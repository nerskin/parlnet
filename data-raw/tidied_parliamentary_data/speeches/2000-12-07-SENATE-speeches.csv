"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on public hospital funding, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In rising to speak to this report, I first take the opportunity to thank those people who were involved with getting the report produced. In particular, I want to thank the secretariat of the Community Affairs References Committee: Elton Humphery, Paul Mackay—seconded from the Department of the Parliamentary Library—Christine McDonald, Peter Short, Leonie Peake and Ingrid Zappe. I am very pleased to note that the names of the committee secretariat are recorded in the report—a principle I would like to see followed more often. When history comes to look at what we said, I think it would be very nice that history could find out who helped us say it. I also want to thank the Library for the secondment of Paul Mackay, who has responsibility in the Library for research in the areas of health and health funding. It is an arrangement that can happen and does infrequently happen. I would like to acknowledge the great assistance that that arrangement, and Paul Mackay himself, has been to our report.
It has been a very timely and very fruitful inquiry. We had some 93 submissions. We received over 6,700 postcards and emails in support of Medicare and the public health system. We held eight days of public hearings and, importantly, we had two roundtables. Both of those were not entirely unprecedented but very close to that. I hope that the Senate committees, in their discussions formally and in the corridors, will check out how the roundtables went, because they were a very constructive and productive way in which our hearings and inquiry came to its final conclusions.
People need to remember that this report arose from the premiers and chief ministers arriving in Canberra in the middle of last year—that is, 1999—seeking from Mr Howard and Mr Costello an inquiry by the Productivity Commission into the funding for public hospitals. All around the country there was an agreement that the hospitals were significantly underfunded. The government refused to initiate that inquiry, so it fell to the Senate. I think one has to say that this has been a very thorough and very non-partisan exercise. It is an inquiry that has produced a remarkable breadth of support for the recommendations or at least the main thrust of the recommendations—in particular, that the public hospitals are significantly underfunded and that the recommendation of the independent arbiter, Mr Castles, of some further $450 million to the public hospitals over the next two years should be supported. 
The committee also found consistently that the community, the people involved in hospitals, the practitioners, the bureaucrats—most everybody—had got to the stage of realising that blame shifting and cost shifting between the Commonwealth and state governments had long since passed its use-by date; it was a sheer waste of time and a waste of money. We cannot tell you how much the cost shifting actually amounts to. But we can say that participants, particularly from the roundtables where we heard from senior bureaucrats from Commonwealth and state level, senior health economists, senior practitioners and deliverers of health from the medical area, the whole range of specialties in hospitals, the nursing profession and allied health professions, and members of the community, were of one voice when they said it is time to stop the cost shifting and the blame shifting and move on. It is time to move on. It is important to acknowledge that the second recommendation is that, if we are asking the Commonwealth to increase its funding, the states should be asked to match the percentage increase as part of the improved funding to our public hospitals. The community very much wants to see adequate funding for public hospitals. It wants the support, security and back-up that the great public hospitals have provided—and still do, even while straining at the edges. It is very important to note, as I have said, that this report received widespread support. Its recommendations address the issues of adequately funding our public hospitals. 
As always happens, I have only just very recently received a copy of the report and very quickly had an opportunity to look at the government's objection to the majority report of the opposition and the Democrats. I find it disappointing that once again the government suggests that this is a partisan report. I strongly object to that: it is not. The government also suggests that a lot of the issues are really about states and funding or they are already under way and the inquiry really has been a considerable waste of time and effort. I would urge the government to read very closely the outcomes and the Hansard of the roundtables: that was not the sense that I had of the attitude at those roundtables. In fact, it was very interesting to be present at the time when people publicly acknowledged it is time for a cultural shift in funding of our public hospitals. It is no longer any good for the states to say, `The Commonwealth is not giving us enough,' and the Commonwealth to say, `The states do not give enough.' That is past, and everybody at the roundtables was looking for solutions to how it might be better done in the future. There is a considerable sympathy and support for the notion of pooled funding or a single fund of contributions from the Commonwealth and the state, to be set out and stated from both sides, Commonwealth and state. This is seen as allowing flexibility and doing away with opportunity for cost shifting and blame shifting. Let us move on: let us find better ways to fund our public hospitals.
The government report in opposition to the opposition's report suggests that a lot of these things are state issues. But one of the main concerns our inquiry had to deal with was: how do you get adequate accounting of Commonwealth dollar expenditure when it is down to the states to provide the adequate data? This is not a matter of: `It's a state issue; we shouldn't be concerned about it.' It is important for the Commonwealth and states to agree to exchange of data and agree to moving on with the issues raised in the inquiry. The government's minority report seems to make the case for not moving forward, and I think that would be a disappointing outcome from an inquiry which, as I say, was non-partisan and recommended significant improvement and ways forward. I acknowledge Senator Lees's and the Democrats' contribution, which appreciates that it is time to move forward and it is time for us to have to look at different ways of doing things. The Democrats have in large part supported what the opposition senators have said but also suggest that, instead of waiting until the next health care agreements or perhaps a change of government, there are ways in which we could experiment with pool funding in a local or regional area. Some of us and some of the witnesses have concerns about that, because it may move away from the national equity and access emphasis of Medicare in the provision of our public hospital and public health services, but I certainly think it is interesting to note Senator Lees's contribution and her support for the principal recommendations of this report.
In summary, what has emerged is a very strong desire for change from all of those people I listed, because of the participants' concern about the ability of our public hospitals to continue to meet the demands made upon them if the current arrangements and the current funding continue indefinitely. We need to have an urgent increase in funding to address the desperate shortage of resources; an end to the divided funding of health programs and the beginning of a new intergovernmental era of agreement between the two levels of government; a move to much more open reporting of funding and performance against national standards; and a new focus on the quality of health and the importance of information technology in both the running of hospitals and the management of patient health care. Both of those are still lagging behind in Australia, and need to be increased.  
Finally, there is a lot of discussion in this report about the impact of private health insurance and the increased uptake of private health insurance. It is important to note that there is no evidence that that does anything to reduce the demand on public hospitals. The large number of people who are taking out private health insurance are young, healthy people who never use public hospitals and will not be a demand on them. This will not therefore relieve demand on the public hospitals. Importantly, many people have front-end deductibles arrangements for private health; under Medicare they are of course entitled to use the public hospital system, and many have chosen to do so. I urge people to have a look at this report. We have called it Healing our hospitals because we appreciate that, while they are managing, they are struggling.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-12-07,"—In making my comments today on the Community Affairs References Committee report, I would like to focus on what in fact could be done. I am particularly disappointed in the opposition's report. After a very lengthy reference to the committee that was based on Labor Party press releases about the terms of reference, it was disappointing to see that the commitment that was given to the committee at the commencement of this inquiry—that it would be completely apolitical and it would actually look for solutions—has resulted in a report that is anything but apolitical and is totally and utterly biased. But, worse than that, after 12 months it has in fact ignored what could be done to improve the system of health in Australia.
Mystifyingly, Senator Crowley has simply dismissed the claims in the government members' minority report that there are many things that are outside the jurisdiction of this committee to assess. For the life of me, I cannot understand why she would do that, given the fact that on page 186, where we list the details that are already in the recommendations vis-à-vis what is already in place, there are six recommendations that the opposition have made that are already a matter of public policy. There are 16 that are clearly a responsibility of the states and eight that are seeking to create an additional bureaucracy. Anyone in their right mind, after 12 months of inquiry, would not want to put down that many areas of discussion that are already public policy, that many that are not the responsibility of the Commonwealth—after all, this is the federal parliament—and then put a request that we create another level of bureaucracy, thus using important taxpayers' dollars that will not ultimately end up in the health system. It is just absolutely and utterly preposterous.
As Senator Crowley just said, there were requests by many of the witnesses that it was time for a cultural shift and that they were looking for solutions to the future. I cannot understand why the opposition did not jolly well put it down. The fact of the matter is that what they have said is that you simply have to throw more money at the hospitals; that is what we have to do. To that I would make a number of comments. First and foremost, if the states had kept pace with their funding and the Commonwealth funding, there would be an extra $460 million, nearly half a billion dollars, going into the hospital system. They have not. That is not a case of finger-pointing both ways; that is simply a case of reality. It they had kept pace, that is what would have happened—and it is disappointing to see states like Tasmania and South Australia ripping money out when the Commonwealth puts money in. That should be deplored. There is one recommendation we would make, and that is that we should make sure that future agreements are signed and sealed on the basis that the Commonwealth increases the level of funding but so do the states, and that the states give a commitment that they will not take money out based on the level of funding increase the Commonwealth has put in.
I would have thought that the opposition, with any prospect of being in government one day—heaven help the country—might have agreed to that, but they have not. I do not know why not. Also, they seem to focus on the fact that it is an ageing population that is creating a problem in our hospitals and the demand on hospitals. It is not just a case of an ageing population; it is a case of dealing with chronic illness. There is not one recommendation in the opposition's umpteen-million pages of report that actually deals with chronic illness and how best a government can assist the states and vice versa. Admittedly, this would require a new level of cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth that has not been seen previously. Nonetheless, it would ensure the shift to making the treatment of chronic illness a priority, because there are trials both in Australia and overseas that have clearly demonstrated that such a shift in focus would result in a 10 per cent decrease in demand on public hospitals. After 12 months, why on earth have the opposition not been able to focus on such simple issues as that? It is important also to make sure that the level of cooperation between the governments is improved, because there has been too much finger-pointing and I think that we have to make sure that in future the states do give unequivocal commitments. 
Senator Crowley has just made the comment that the increase in participation rates of private health insurance has not shown any decrease in the utilisation of public hospitals. Heavens above, these measures have not been in place all that long. Does she want to see a shift immediately? The opposition were in government for 13 years and ran down the participation rates of private health insurance from around 70 per cent to under 30 per cent. This government has sought to increase those levels of participation, which over time would make sure that there are more people being put into the private hospital system, away from the public hospital system, thereby freeing up the public hospitals for those who are in genuine need and who cannot afford private health insurance. But here we go, with the opposition seeing this as an opportunity to kick the private system yet again. Interestingly enough, Ms Macklin, who is now the shadow minister for health in the other place, concluded in 1991, before she was in this place, in an issues paper that she was involved in:
Data analysed in this paper provides support for the view that the private sector is, on balance, more efficient than the public sector.
That was her view then and she has not indicated that there has been a change of view. But, having listened to Senator Crowley today, I am a bit concerned that in fact the 30 per cent rebate that I thought the opposition had signed on to for private health insurance may not now be policy.
—Maybe it might be in roll-back.
—Yes, it might be part of the roll-back, Senator Campbell. That is a great worry because many people have taken out private health insurance, and I think it is interesting that Senator Crowley has now put a question mark over that again. I think that the people of Australia should know that her comments today put that 30 per cent rebate in jeopardy and that clearly the opposition are now considering scrapping that. That is unwise.
—It is irresponsible.
—It is totally irresponsible, Senator Ferris, and it is not a policy that the Australian community want. It is important they know that this is where the Labor Party are heading in such important areas of policy, because they have no solutions to this area. They have no solutions to public hospital funding. All they say is, `Let's pool the money. Let's put all the money from the Commonwealth and states together in one big pot and then let's decide how to do it.' But they just don't focus on the issues. There was another recommendation that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare, community health services and aged care should all be wrapped into an area where the states have some say. How on earth can you come up with that solution? The PBS and Medicare are completely Commonwealth, and why would you want the states involved in that? It is not possible. The Labor Party did not do it. It is not possible, because that is the domain of the Commonwealth. 
When we look at so many of these recommendations—unfortunately, time does not permit a closer scrutiny here today—they are simply and utterly impractical and unworkable. For a majority opposition committee report to come down with so many recommendations that are already a matter of public policy, are within the province of the states or are just creating another layer of bureaucracy is nothing short of a disgrace, after all of this time. It was a real opportunity for a committee to work in a non-partisan fashion to come up with solutions. It is not a case of closing the door and saying there are not better ways to do it. The Minister for Health and Aged Care recognises there are better ways, such as the management of chronic illness, such as making sure the states contribute equally and do not take money out of the system, and many more issues. Why could the opposition not focus on that instead of just trying to be political? ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-12-07,"—This message from the government—
—What are you going to do?
—You wait and find out, Minister. Some people would say that the situation surrounding the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 has become farcical. Certainly the statements and behaviour of the government might lead one to that conclusion. Labor does not regard this matter as one to be laughed about. It is one of the most serious issues that I, for one, have faced in my political career. Its implications are enormous. The potential effects of the government's new SES funding model are so unjust, so unfair and so inequitable that Labor has consistently sought to persuade this government through all possible means to listen seriously to the overwhelming and unanimous public opposition to this issue.
Late on Tuesday night Dr Kemp once again tried in vain to blame the Labor Party for the impasse over the schools funding bill. But, Minister, that just will not stick. No-one believes him. The government is behaving with disgraceful intransigence. It has refused to listen and it will not amend its flawed and unfair legislation, no matter how many times requests are made of it by the Senate to do so, no matter what arguments are put forward and no matter who calls for this to happen. For example, there are the publicly expressed views of the Anglican Bishop of Grafton, the Right Reverend Philip Huggins, who has called on the government to withdraw its inequitable funding proposals for non-government schools. He says the bill is `unnecessarily divisive'. He asks whether Dr Kemp will persist stubbornly with this new policy until commonsense prevails. Another example is Father Nic Frances, the head of the respected Anglican charity the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who has publicly described the policy in similar terms.
In the evidence before the Senate committee of inquiry into the bill, the Reverend Tom Doyle, the deputy chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, the one so often quoted by Dr Kemp as being supportive of this new model, said that the NCEC:
... had argued consistently that a combination of measures of need should be used. These included the current capital resources, the geographical spread, the necessity to provide a wide range of central services and the socioeconomic status of the population served by the schools. 
Father Doyle is not as unequivocally enthusiastic about the new funding measure as Dr Kemp would have us believe. He thinks the model is one dimensional and that it does not adequately measure the resources available to schools. It is not only the lonely voice of the opposition, as the minister would put it, but many voices. Many community organisations, many parent groups, many school principals, many teachers and many school councils have voiced their very grave concerns.
—Anyone with half a brain has.
—Indeed, Senator. We are calling on the government to rethink its position, and even now I do not think it is too late on this last day of the sittings.
On Tuesday night the Speaker of the House of Representatives issued a statement on procedural issues associated with the passage or otherwise of the bill. The Speaker, in his wisdom, believes that pressing a request on behalf of the Senate is not on. He thinks it is not on because it has not happened at this level since 1906. He thinks it cannot be done because the House, he says, has never accepted that it could be done. I really must ask what sort of advice the Speaker is getting. I think it is reasonable to point out that the reason the Senate has not repeatedly made requests since 1906 is that since that time pressed requests have been acceded to. Further, I am advised by the Clerk of the Senate that, on that occasion in 1906, the government acceded to the request pressed on the second occasion. 
The Speaker says that this issue is not dealt with in the standing orders. He seems to forget that the House is within its rights to suspend its own standing orders. He mutters darkly about double dissolutions. He makes a quaint distinction between the pressing of requests and the pressing of amendments. Basically, he does nothing to advance the debate either in the substance or in the process. If I look at the minister's remarks—and there we do see a true constitutional giant—he says that the opposition has precious little respect for the Constitution of this country. This is a particularly interesting concept coming, as my colleague in the House Mr Lee pointed out, from a party that caused the constitutional crisis of 1975 when the Liberal Party refused to allow supply, thus threatening to bring the entire machinery of the Commonwealth government to a grinding halt.
I am intrigued by the view coming from Liberal Party representatives in the House of Representatives about the Senate's right to press requests. My advice is that, during the period of the Labor government, the same principles were not applied. In fact, on five occasions the Liberal Party initiated requests which were pressed in this chamber. For example, on the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Levy Amendment Bill 1985, the Veterans' Entitlements Bill 1985 and, oh dear, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1988, requests were made and those requests were pressed. I am reminded by the Clerk that the issue there was requested amendments and reinstated establishment grants for non-government schools in 1989. Minister, that is a bit awkward, given the claims made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in the House of Representatives. There were also the wool tax bills Nos 1 to 5 in 1991 and the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994—another education bill. With the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994, the Senate pressed requests and the bill was later signed. So I do not think the government is on strong constitutional grounds here.
The hypocrisy of the Liberal Party when it comes to the Constitution knows no bounds. They are the party of 1975. The Labor Party do not behave in that way. The Labor Party would never do that; we have made that clear. On this occasion we are talking about a $22 billion bill for 10,000 schools, for 3.2 million students. When the Liberal Party talked about these constitutional issues in 1975, they were holding the entire country to ransom. In my judgment, it is the government that is seeking to blackmail and to hold to ransom the children of this country. The requests that we have made simply seek to transfer a proportion of the $22 billion from the wealthiest schools in this country to students with disabilities, who, many would argue, are the most in need—that is, a transfer from those who have the most to give to those most in need. This is about priorities. This is a test which this government has failed. 
It strikes me that, if we consider the fulminations of the Speaker and the ravings of the minister, they have essentially missed the point. They have missed the point of the simple proposition about the needs of Australian children. I asked Mr Evans, the Clerk, to give me some advice on these questions, and he pointed out to me:
The Constitution and the Senate standing orders place no limitations on the number of occasions on which the Senate can repeat a request. The House of Representatives has a standing order to the effect that, while the Senate insists on an amendment for a second time, the House will lay the bill aside or request a conference between the houses. It is not clear that this standing order applies to repeated requests by the Senate, but, in any event, the House can suspend its standing orders if it wishes to consider repeated requests, so there is therefore nothing to prevent the Senate repeating and the House reconsidering a request for an amendment on any number of occasions.
The clear and concise words of the Clerk need no paraphrasing, and in theory we can go on doing this forever—at least until the parliament is dissolved. We have said that this bill is obscene. It is blatantly inequitable. It is a disgusting and arrogant display of the politics of privilege and greed. It assumes that the average Australian is prepared to subsidise the lavish education and the luxurious school facilities available in the wealthiest schools, where the amount available per student is three times the amount we see fit to spend on kids in government schools. 
Dr Kemp accuses the Labor Party of whipping up class hatred. Of course, we would expect nothing less from him. This bill in its cold, dispassionate display of blatant featherbedding for the richer schools is what whips up class hatred as cleanly as anything else could possibly do. The government cannot hide behind its spurious obfuscation about the procedures and standing orders. It cannot issue hollow threats about constitutional crises and double dissolutions. Only one thing is needed to resolve the impasse, and that is for the government to accept our requests.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I want to make some final comments on this bill today. I had not intended to do that until I attended the breakfast and ceremony this morning held by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as they finished the work they have been doing for 10 years. They not only presented their report of that 10-year period, Reconciliation Australia's challenge, but also introduced Reconciliation Australia, which is the new foundation that will take over their work.
You might ask yourself, `What do this morning's ceremony and breakfast on reconciliation have to do with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, which gives $22 billion to schools around this country for the next four years?' As I sat there this morning and I heard many people talk about fairness, equity and a fair go for Aboriginal Australians in this country, I realised how hypocritical this government really is in the kinds of bills that it presents to this parliament. I thought of last Sunday when the Treasurer and some of his colleagues attempted, with two feet and a heartbeat, to walk along the streets of Melbourne purporting to support reconciliation. I thought of how courageous it was of them to do that but how very empty their words were.
We hear members of this government talking about a new catchphrase which they have designed: `practical reconciliation', they now tell this country. `We do not need to apologise. We do not need to embrace all of these documents that are being produced in order to drive this agenda forward. We do it in a practical way. We have practical reconciliation. We have embraced that term and cuddled it as if it is the best thing since sliced bread.' But here we are in the parliament today, considering for the last time—because this is the third time it has come back to the Senate—a bill which will give millions of dollars to the wealthiest schools in this country, at the expense of indigenous Australians, particularly the people I represent in the Northern Territory. Under this bill, on average $4,000 a head is spent on kids in public schools around this country.
As I said in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill, in some communities in the Northern Territory there is no secondary school—no bricks and mortar. There are communities of over 2,000 people, with 500 children in the primary school who have no opportunity to do schooling past year 7. Yet millions of dollars will be going to schools like Wesley College, Geelong Grammar and the King's School in Sydney, which do not need this money. Let us be honest about it: they do not need this additional funding—not while we have Aboriginal children in the northern part of Australia who not only do not have a secondary school and do not have computers in their classrooms; they have classes of 25 and 30 kids with one teacher, just as they do in Woden here in Canberra, but these kids do not speak English as a first language. They should be resourced on a one to five ratio. 
No wonder these kids have the poorest literacy and numeracy rate around the country. No wonder these children will struggle all of their lives to attain the same level of education that your children and my children will attain by the time they get to grade 3. Yet the federal government is prepared to put this bill, which ignores that fact, before the parliament again. They say, `We fund indigenous education over and above the normal mainstream through IESIP, through targeted programs.' When you put it side by side with what is going to happen to category 1 schools, it is not enough. Why can that money not be channelled to the neediest kids in this country, to those kids who are disabled or to our indigenous children who will struggle for many years? In their wildest dreams, they will never be able to achieve the level that students at elite, private and wealthy schools will be able to achieve.  
Indigenous children step out of those communities and go to places like Darwin, Alice Springs and capital cities on the eastern seaboard and step into another world, into a chasm, which some members of this federal government fail to understand. I believe they long to have a decent and proper education. They would want a computer at each of their desks. They would want not only a library in their school but a properly resourced library. They would like to have teachers on a one to five ratio, as they try to learn the same concepts which we teach our kids in primary schools but in a second language. They are trying to learn literacy skills which are unknown to their culture in a second language, but we treat them as if English is their first language. We put them in classrooms of 25. We give them first-year-out teachers who have little experience, let alone cultural knowledge and an ability to adapt to remote communities in the bush.
So on a day when this government accepts this document Reconciliation Australia's  challenge, no doubt in question time, as a dorothy dixer from across the chamber is asked of Senator Herron, we will hear the words `practical reconciliation'. That is what this government does. `That's what we do. We don't have to speak these words to Aboriginal people. We do it practically.' Yet this morning we are going to see this bill in this parliament which allocates millions of dollars to kids in the wealthiest schools and ignores indigenous children in northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory. That is not a sign of practical reconciliation; that is the government turning their backs on the future of indigenous children in this country. I cannot believe that the people in DETYA and this minister can put their hand on their heart and say to the people of this country, `This bill is fair. This bill delivers equity in distributing the education dollar,' because it does not. A close scrutiny of where the money goes, even a cursory glance at what is happening in this bill, will prove to every single person in this country that this bill is far from fair. It is not equitable.
We do not have a level playing field in this country from which we can resource people from here on in. This bill will advance the wealthy. It will advance people who least need this money to assist their education. This bill will continue to ignore the disadvantaged circumstances that indigenous children in this country endure on a day-to-day basis when it comes to trying to resource their education. In the 2½ years I have been in the Senate, this is the worst bill I have had to deal with. It is a disgrace. It is not an example of practical reconciliation, and don't anyone believe that as they hear these words coming from this government in the next 24 hours.
You cannot say that we have practical reconciliation with Aboriginal people on the very same day that you are going to endorse a bill that gives millions of dollars to 21 or 29 of the wealthiest schools in this country. I have communities in the Northern Territory—at Kintore, Numbulwar, Ngukurr, Maningrida and Port Keats; you could roll them off, 190 or so of them—that are struggling to maintain teachers, to have well qualified teachers, to have the resources they need and to have the technology they need to be able to teach their kids properly in the 21st century, while this bill is still being pushed by this federal government. It is a disgrace and it is an embarrassment. We will make something of this in the course of the next 12 months—my oath. It will be something that I will push in every Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory to highlight to them the disregard that this government has for their attempts to properly resource their children's education and their children's future.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I am very pleased to hear those contributions from Senator Carr and Senator Crossin. I hope we can look forward to Labor maintaining its line and insisting on those amendments and requests. As has been properly pointed out today, this is not a matter of the Senate blocking the bill; it is a matter of the Senate simply insisting on its amendments. It is up to the government to decide whether the bill is blocked or not. As I have said many times in this debate, they are not ideal amendments but they are at least important in knocking off the worst aspects of this bill which, as we know, delivers huge gains to private schools. I do not want to canvass all of those arguments again but, as I looked back through the Hansard and checked a few of the statistics, reports and so on, there are some things that I wanted to raise with the minister about his remarks throughout the debate. I also think it is worth commenting on the comments of the Speaker in the House of Representatives in the last couple of days concerning requests. I want to put on the record exactly what section 53 of the Constitution says. It provides that the Senate may, at any stage, return a bill to the House of Representatives with requests.
Even if `at any stage' it is interpreted as meaning `at any stage in the Senate's initial consideration of the bill', as has been suggested, as an argument against pressing the request, the Senate could press a request many times by reiterating it at each stage of the consideration of the bill. Even if the Senate was not able to press the same request, it could easily circumvent a restriction, if that was its intention, by slightly modifying the request each time it put it. As the Senate Clerk, Mr Evans, has advised us, there is no suggestion that the framers of our Constitution intended that requests should not be pressed more than once. It is quite clear that, in this place, we are entitled to do that as many times as is necessary. I think it is important to get that on the record. That advice is available to all senators, no doubt, who would like to see it.
I wanted to pick up on something Minister Ellison said in the last debate, and that was that the state governments were in favour of this legislation. We all heard that; some of us were open-mouthed in hearing it. I went back and had a look at some of the correspondence that has been received on this question from the states. One that I want to concentrate on today is that from the Queensland state government. There certainly was not unanimous support for this legislation in any quarter, even from the private school sector. The government cannot claim that there is unanimous support here. The Catholics have opted out. I have had many letters and phone calls from schools that are very hard done by in this legislation and they certainly do not support it in its current form. The Queensland state government said that they did welcome more funding going into non-government schools—we might agree to disagree with that—but that is about where their support stops for this bill. It is my understanding that Queensland drew the Prime Minister's attention to the decline in funding to government schools as a proportion of funds provided to all schools, pointing out that it is a drop from 32.5 per cent in 1997 to 28.8 per cent in 2004. They offered the view that this was of great concern. The minister also said, in this place, that the state ministers had accepted the EBA as a fair enough kind of measure. Again, as I understand it, the Premier of Queensland said:
The EBA is a crude policy instrument that penalises Queensland government schools even though their enrolments are increasing by more than enrolments in non-government schools. For example, between 1996-1999, enrolments in Queensland government schools increased by 15,512 and enrolments in non-government schools increased by 14,752. Despite this, Queensland lost $5.4 million in 1999-2000 and is projected to lose $7.7 million in 2000-2001.
I think that even if the minister did not mislead this place, certainly his suggestion that state governments were in favour of maintaining the EBA is false. I certainly know that other states have complained about it on numerous occasions. The Queensland correspondence also says:
This bill represents a shift in the balance of Commonwealth funding away from government and towards non-government schools. This shift represents a fundamental change in the partnership between the Commonwealth and states which has been a cornerstone of education funding policy since the mid-1960s. 
They also drew attention to the disadvantage for people who rely on government education who are living in rural and remote areas and for parents of children who have special needs.
Another matter the Queensland government raised was the fact that there will be numerous instances under the new SES model in which non-government schools in Queensland will receive more total government funding—that is, Commonwealth and state—per student than neighbouring state schools. I would like a response from the minister to that. I would like to know whether the government has checked out those figures that were produced by Queensland, and validated, I understand, by PricewaterhouseCoopers. If this is the case, as Queensland believes it is, we have a very serious situation indeed on our hands.
A case in point is an independent secondary school in the Brisbane region which will receive total government funding of $5,651 per student in 2004. A neighbouring state high school will receive just $4,996 per student in the same year, and that includes a share of central overhead costs; so it is not simply coming from the global budget of the school. They say that there are many similar examples throughout Queensland. I think this raises the question of how a state secondary school can possibly offer their students all of the resources necessary to deliver a good education on $4,996 a head. Parents know that is not enough money. That is why more and more of them are prepared to pay extra so that their child can be in a school which is better funded. Many schools charge fees of more than twice that amount. Of course, many schools have those fees topped up by fundraising, which can be very substantial, and each school receives Commonwealth and state grants. State schools can, of course, fundraise—and many of them do—but many of them are unable to fundraise to anything like the extent that even some government schools in better-off suburbs can. Many of them certainly do not have anything like the opportunities available to non-government schools, many of which are getting a huge handout from this bill. 
The other issue is that there are limits on fees and levies which can be paid to these schools. In most states the state government sets a limit—and quite rightly. We should not be seeing user-pays come into our public education—I am not advocating that. I am pointing out that the parents in those schools do not have any opportunity, except through fundraising, to raise the amount of money spent on each student in that school. If they see that the school is hopelessly underresourced—as most state schools are—their only option is to take their children out of that school and send them to a private school—and I think this goes to the crux of this whole question and this bill. The result is that the private sector can confer serious advantage to their students at the expense of government schools. 
The Queensland Premier says that the result of the bill will be that parents who do not choose the non-government option or cannot afford to do so will be left with a degraded, poorly funded public education sector. The Queensland state government has pointed out that this measure is about making more money available to be spent on those advantaged students, as there is no requirement for the schools to reduce their fees. The government's claim is that this measure will make choice a reality for more parents, and clearly that is hogwash. As I said in my last contribution to this debate, we have seen Canberra Grammar School, which receives more then $1 million from this measure, advertising for a person to promote the school. We are not going to see any school reduce their fees as a result of this measure. I think Wesley said they might reduce it by $200 per student, but that is a fraction of what they will receive from this bill per student.
As I understand it, Queensland are also not happy with some aspects of the accountability arrangements that are proposed in the bill. They point out that, through MCEETYA, the states have already agreed to a set of national goals for schooling and are finalising a series of performance measures and targets, and they see no reason to provide the Commonwealth minister with the ability to short-cut this process. Queensland also complained about the consultation on this bill. Only two weeks ago they said that it would have been appropriate to discuss the bill at MCEETYA or at COAG. Maybe discussions have taken place in the last two weeks with each of the state ministers—I do not know. Perhaps the minister can advise us on that. But to come into this chamber and suggest that the states are now ticking off this bill is grossly wrong. Dr Kemp often justifies this bill on the basis that: 
... the socioeconomic profile of non-government school parents is today very similar to that of government school parents.
That is a quote from a recent document that was distributed from Dr Kemp's office. Again, that can be quite solidly refuted. 
This year, Barbara Preston looked at the data in relation to the type of school attended and seven parental income brackets. That data illustrated that:
·	the wealthier the family, the more likely it is that the children will attend private school;
·	in the secondary years it is approximately 2½ times more likely that the children of the highest income bracket will attend private schools than those in the lowest;
·	in primary school there is roughly double the possibility;
·	the difference is not confined to the extremes. The positive relationship between income bracket and the type of school attended is clear across all brackets.
I wanted to get that on the record because we have heard so much about choice and how parents are struggling—and indeed they are. I make no claim that they do not struggle. I know a lot of parents who sacrifice a great deal in financial terms in order to send their children to non-government schools, and I do not deny them that right. But this bill is about something else. This bill is about rewarding those schools which draw from communities which are very well placed to pay very high fees. Again, I want to draw attention to the differences between those schools that will benefit so hugely from this bill and government public schools. In some ways, I guess this legislation has been useful to us in drawing attention to those huge differences. 
There is a huge public outcry about this legislation. I hope it is felt by the government at the next election. I hope the fury that I am hearing about is reflected. I hope that Labor takes this opportunity to take advantage of that fury instead of giving in—and I was very heartened to hear what Senator Carr said today. Again I advise that the Democrats will insist on these amendments and the requests because we think they are the least that this place can do.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—It is crunch time as far as this education legislation is concerned. I am concerned that we are about to see the prognostication of opposition leader Kim Beazley on 4 August last come true. He said:
We would not try to block the bill. That would simply produce the situation where nobody got any money. So we certainly won't be trying to do that.
We ought to be standing firm on this matter. I agree with previous speakers that this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we could see in this place, because not only does it distribute 65 per cent of the money to private schools, which have some 30 per cent of the students, but also, when you look at it in the reverse, it distributes only 35 per cent to the public school system, which has the big majority of students in this country. The philosophy and the drive of this government indicate that this change in direction will go a lot further. While the Labor Party might feel that it will go to the next election campaigning on this matter and will pick up votes on it, I think we have to be sanguine enough to say, `We don't know what's going to happen at the next election.' It may well be that the Howard government will be returned and, when and if that happens, things will get worse still. The imbalance between the wealthy and the poor in this country will grow, and with that we will see an accelerated imbalance between the wealthy and the poorer schools in the country.
—That is not true.
—Senator Ferris says that is not true. It is true. You cannot put your head in the sand and deny the statistics that show that the gap between the rich and the poor in this country is growing. You cannot deny what is in front of us on our desks at the moment, which shows that there is a massive spending boost to already wealthy schools at the expense of the public school system in Australia. I as a Green am not going to stand for that. I am not going to demur at this confrontation with the government. I am not going to allow myself to be found voting for this wretched piece of legislation that sets its face against the public school system in Australia. I would remind senators that this legislation would be unconstitutional in the United States, where the government is not allowed to put money into private school coffers at all. What we are seeing here is an historic destruction of the public school system at the expense of the privileged private school system. We are seeing a loss of that dictum that says: `Every child in this country should have an equal right to an equal quality education.' The minute you depart from that you enter the field of discrimination. This legislation is high discrimination against millions of Australian students. Senator Crossin very eloquently pointed to those who are in the most disadvantaged sector of our community, the first Australians themselves. I can tell you that this legislation is going to do nothing to try to close the gap, the disadvantage, for indigenous people and indeed other people who do not have adequate facilities in the 21st century. 
Senator Carr said, `We have sought to persuade this government through all possible means.' But I think that in brackets after that comes, `Sadly we must now capitulate.' Senator Carr said, `We are calling on the government to change its position; even now it is not too late.' But in 10 or 20 minutes or half an hour from now, we will see whether it is too late. That will be demonstrated to us by who is on which side of this chamber standing up for the public education system and making sure that the Senate does use its powers to get a fair deal for public education in this country. The Labor opposition says that the government is seeking to blackmail and hold to ransom the students of this country. Well, who of us on this side or on the crossbenches wants to be party to legislation from a government that blackmails and holds to ransom the students of this country? We are about to find out. I would say to the opposition, `Don't you be a party to that. You have described it exactly but don't you be party to it, because going to the government side in this matter, in being faced down by the House of Representatives, is to do just that.'
The opposition says that the government cannot hide behind threats of a constitutional crisis. We are nowhere near a constitutional crisis on this matter. As Senator Allison pointed out, we are within the constitutional right and established powers of the Senate in this matter. It is important that, where the government is doing the wrong thing by the nation and its education system, the Senate exercise that right and that power. Let me say to all senators that the government needs to be tackled on this matter; it needs to be confronted on the matter. There is no doubt that funding for the school system will continue. That is the responsibility of the government. We are talking about some tens of millions of dollars being redistributed through requests made by the Senate. We are not talking about not funding the school system; we are talking about a minimal redistribution to the public school system, to those most in need.
It is a minimal stand that the Senate is taking. It is not an ambit claim. It is not dictating to government, `You must abandon your philosophy,' repugnant as that philosophy may be. It is simply saying that we have to hone back the cutting of the funding to the Australian public school system. Even at this eleventh hour, I say to the Labor Party: stand on your principle, stand by your own position. Stand up to this government, and the Australian electorate will thank you for it. The Australian electorate does not want the government to get away with this legislation. After all, it affects so many of the children of this nation—the next generation of this nation. It is time for a stand, and this is the place to do it.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Mr Temporary Chairman Calvert, I recognise that you called Senator Harris ahead of me. I therefore will not take long, because I appreciate the honourable senator wants to make his contribution to this debate. I, for one, would certainly welcome his views. I want to take a few moments, however, to address the chamber on the matter that is now before us. I have been stimulated to do so by the remarks of Senator Brown, who has just now resumed his seat. Senator Brown has an unerring ear for the dramatic. I do not mean that as a criticism, because quite clearly this legislation before the chamber is an important and defining piece of legislation for Australia. 
There is absolutely no doubt that education is the most fundamental of all issues for developed and developing countries. Access to educational opportunity for all is what defines a fair country from a country that lacks fairness. It is also true that the Australian Labor Party in government has been a party committed to the principles of equal opportunity, fairness and the right of every younger person in Australia to have access to the best education that can be possibly provided. That is the only way for the true talents of Australians to be properly tapped and for the true creativity of this nation to reach its natural optimum. It is the only way to give ordinary Australians a chance to learn the skills and to obtain the qualifications they need to be a useful person in society and to understand what is happening in the wider world.
It is right to emphasise with some drama the importance of this legislation. It is right to point to the perfidy of this government because of this legislation. In 1996, 43 per cent of funding went to government schools. In 2004, as a consequence of this bill, 34 per cent of funding will go to government schools, which is an actual reduction. Just as education was one of the key issues in the still disputed United States election—with the rivals, Bush and Gore, trying to outspend one another—in Australia the government is reducing the amount of expenditure as a percentage of total outlays.
As countries within our region aspire to lift their economic standards through education in real terms, Australia has a government which in real terms is cutting back. We have a government in Australia that is shifting educational opportunity from all to just the wealthy. It is removing the right to education from ordinary citizens and giving it to those who can afford it, thus seeking to introduce and to perpetuate inequality of opportunity in Australia. So it is right to condemn this government.
I do not accept the definition applied to the Labor Party by the Greens. It is true that this is a dramatic piece of legislation, and it is true the government should be rightly condemned for its perfidy and for its attempt to turn back the clock to the 19th century by rewarding wealth and privilege over the right of all, but this legislation will be an election issue. The Labor Party will be fighting an election on this legislation.
—We welcome it.
—You welcome it. You are welcome to welcome it, because we will join you on the electoral battlefield over this legislation, as we have done and will continue to do in this chamber. Labor will put to the Australian people the stark choices they are faced with: the Liberal option of education for the well-heeled and better off in society, or the Labor option of access to education for all equally and according to merit and attainment. People will be able to make a choice. We will talk about the nation building elements of education as well and the importance of a highly educated society in the 21st century. We will talk about all of those things and point to the government's abysmal record of reduction in real terms in Commonwealth outlays on education expenditure. So it will be an election issue.
Let me just turn the question back on the Greens and the Democrats. If this is going to be one of the defining issues at the next election, will the minor parties join the Labor Party in defeating the Liberal-National coalition, or will they not? That is a key question here. It is all right to make a proselytising speech in this chamber, but when you are called out and have to front up for your convictions, as you do in an election, where you put your preferences and which of the two major parties you prefer for government is what you mean by what you say. So the challenge goes back the other way. If your convictions are real, do not judge people by their speeches—judge them by their actions. And the Australian people will have a decision in this is when they vote. What you do with your preferences is what you do for education.  
—Because you say—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman; I do not want to be disorderly and recognise disorderly interjections—
—Heaven forbid!
—Heaven forbid, exactly. I am a very orderly senator, as you would know, Senator Lightfoot. 
 (Senator Calvert)—I think it must be getting close to Christmas!
—I am disarmed by such scathing criticism. My God! The fundamental point comes down to this: whatever we do here today and whatever happens to this bill, there is still the dividing line between the two major parties. That dividing line is education and who will do the right thing by Australia and who will protect the privilege of the wealthy in Australia. We are on the side of doing the right thing; they are on the side of protecting the privileged—that is the choice. When it comes to polling day and the preferences go to the other side, all I will have to say is that you did not mean a word of the speeches you made in this chamber. If the preferences come to our side, you are entitled to the respect and dignity of a party standing up for what is right in the defence of the entitlement of Australians to equal access to education—and that is the issue.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—Rising to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, I would like to briefly refer to the message that has come back from the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives returns the bill and transmits to the Senate the following resolution which was agreed to by the House of Representatives on this day. I would like to focus on item (d) because it goes to the essence of the debate we are having today. In this item the House of Representatives:
(d) calls on the Senate to agree to the Bill as transmitted to it by the House of Representatives without requests, amendments or further delay.
So we have the government, through the House of Representatives, calling on the Senate to actually disregard all of the input of the senators whose responsibility it is to represent their states. I emphasise the latter. It is the prerogative of the House of Representatives to put forward legislation but it is the responsibility of the senators in this place to view that legislation based on their representation of their state. The essence of the bill is that it will appropriate additional funding to schools. I remind the Senate that approximately 70 per cent of the students in Australia attend government schools. I, like other senators, have received overwhelming correspondence in regard to this issue. I would like to quote a letter from the Monto State School Parents and Citizens Association in Queensland: 
I am writing on behalf of the Monto State School Parents & Citizens Association.  Monto is a rural community approximately two hours drive west of Bundaberg in Queensland. There are presently 215 students enrolled at the school from 129 families.  Concern has been expressed at the Bill presently before the Senate relating to the funding for schools, in particular the amount apportioned to Private Schools.
Last year we were the victims of Government cut backs—
to clarify, they are referring to the Queensland Labor government—
when our Groundsman's hours were slashed in half to 22 hours per week. We made representations to The Queensland Education Department and various politicians without success. The cut in hours came about due to a ridiculous mathematical formula revolving around the number of students at the school. The student number has increased this year but the Groundsman did not get his hours back. The school grounds remain the same size and require the same amount of maintenance but there is only so much one man can do with 22 hours.
Now we see this Bill, which will give Private Schools a great deal more funds than Government funded schools.  Why? There is a great deal of anger in the Monto community over this Bill. On the evening news on Sunday 19 November the matter of funds for Kings College was broadcast. To see a Private School being given $1,000,000.00 to upgrade their oval made no sense, considering we are not able to have the funds to have a full time groundsman. One million dollars would keep him employed for quite a while. 
Further in the correspondence:  
Contained in the correspondence I received from the Queensland Council of Parents & Citizens Association Inc is the following passage which relates to the legislation changes, ""The net result of the new funding model is that 61 category 1 schools, the wealthiest category, out of 2,620 non-government schools will receive an extra $57 million per year.
This is an average gain of $900,000 for those 61 category 1 schools. The letter goes on to say:
This is an average gain of $900,000.  In fact, 70% of non-government schools across Australia will receive no extra funding at all. 54 of the 61 category 1 schools are in Sydney or Melbourne."" The meaning of this is quite clear. There is no equity in the new legislation and it reeks of favouritism.
That is quoting from one of the many hundreds of pieces of correspondence that I have received in relation to this bill. Overwhelmingly, the correspondence that I have received does not call for amendments to the bill; it calls for the bill to be opposed. I believe it is incumbent on the Queensland senators to listen to that overwhelming message that has been coming from the government schools. I have received two pieces of correspondence in support of the bill—two in support and hundreds against. In light of that response from the people of Queensland, I will be opposing the message from the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I want to respond to Senator Cook. Senator Cook said that preferences will be important for the Democrats and the Greens at the next election and that Labor will be going to the election on this. Let me say to Senator Cook and the Labor Party: you have to judge people on what they do, not on what they say. When you go to an election you have to judge on performance, not on promise. I have said to my party in Tasmania: how can we give preferences to a Labor Party which wants to drive the chainsaws into the tall forests faster than a coalition? The nationwide message that comes out of today, ifLabor is seen to be voting with the Liberals on the other side of this chamber, is: what is the difference between the two? Is this a `goversition' or an `opposment'? Isn't this the `Laberals' again? Isn't this the Australian public being denied a real choice by the two big parties—Tweedledum and Tweedledee? 
I know that the Labor Party in past government has a different record from the coalition. I suspect that the Labor Party would never have come up with this piece of legislation that the Howard government has brought before this Senate. But I reiterate: the crunch time is here and the opposition should stand firm on this matter. I have no doubt it will be resolved before the end of the year. I point out that the requests ask less than the amendments coming next. They are very modest requests for some remediation of the most repugnant part of this legislation to divert some money into the most needy sectors of the public school system. The opposition should stand on those requests, with other parties in this place, or the electorate will see that and we will have to take that into account as we go to the next election.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Senator Brown ought to know that his choices and his party's choices at the next election are quite limited. He ought to know that. He ought to understand what the options are. The fact remains that presumably he will be asking his supporters to make decisions about who they think would produce the best government in this country. On the question of education, I do not believe, Senator Brown, you could possibly argue anything that would suggest that the Liberal Party has the interests of Australian children in mind.
—We'll see how you vote. 
—Senator Brown, you will see how we vote in a few minutes. We will see how you vote at the next election, like us all. Minister, I think our position has been spelt out perfectly clearly: nothing matters more than the education of our children. It is at school that children develop, discover and become adults. It is at school that children learn about the world and theirplace in it. They learn in many other places as well but school is central to that learning process. They learn with their families and with their friends. They learn through the media. They learn through a whole range of avenues. But school is the central socialising process. Schooling is central to children's lives. I would suggest that the policies that underpin schooling shape that experience. That is why this bill is so important. How we educate our children in school both reflects and reproduces the sort of society that we are. There are a number of former teachers in this chamber. I do not think I would take long to persuade them that schooling has the potential to transform society and certainly to profoundly change the life chances for individuals.  
Australia's children are a collective responsibility for us all in our roles as legislators, in terms of our funding to teachers, and of course as parents and citizens and taxpayers. This Senate has to understand that our country's future and the legacy that we leave behind will be determined by the actions that we take on bills like this and on the policies that government pursues in regard to schooling. Labor's commitment has been clearly spelled out—our commitment to  universal, comprehensive public education is central to our platform and informs all about our policy development. That priority is expressed in the phrase `the knowledge nation'. The knowledge nation idea encapsulates the concept of collectivity, universality, excellence of innovation and quality in education. In school education, which is the site of the acculturation and intellectual development of children as they grow towards adulthood, we must convey to children that we value and respect all equally. That does not mean that we must treat every child the same as every other child. Some children, due to physical or intellectual disability, need additional assistance. Children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, who do not enjoy the social privileges, are entitled to additional assistance. Some children will need to be encouraged to pursue education much more than others, because at the moment the cultural and social pressures are on them not to do so: I speak of our Aboriginal children. But not just those; working class children in the west of Melbourne, for instance, require additional assistance. This government turns all that on its head. It says: the people that need additional assistance are the wealthiest, the most privileged, the most affluent. In the name of social justice it hands out millions and millions of dollars to the already advantaged. Our specific responsibility as legislators in the Commonwealth is to ensure that all Australian children, wherever they live, whatever their background, have access to schooling that meets adequate community standards.
That is essentially what the Whitlam government took upon itself when it assumed responsibility for the funding of schools on the basis of need. Thirty years on from the Karmel settlement, as it is known as, it is something that remains for us to all be proud of. It recognised that, whatever kind of school a child attended, we owed them an opportunity for a decent education; that the Commonwealth should recognise that, while the primary responsibility of governments ought to be a strong and vigorous public system, the choices of those who wanted, for example, a Catholic schooling or a Jewish education should also be supported; and that needy schools should be subsidised so that school learning was not at a lower level for those children. Labor's Disadvantaged Schools Program, one of our policies, addressed that problem quite directly. That program was abolished by this government. The aim of this government's policy has been to actually expand the gap, to widen the chasm, between the rich and poor in terms of educational opportunities. On top of that we have seen, through the actions of this government, the resurrection of the ghost of the state aid debate. This government ought to be condemned.
The bill before the parliament allocates massive windfall gains in Commonwealth moneys to the richest private schools while leaving the many needier non-government schools to basically go without. The bill basically provides nothing in real terms, apart from indexation, for government schools. This is why I say the bill is unfair. It is divisive. The policies are so blatantly unjust that it is obscene. This is why the vast majority of Australians are so angry about what this government has done in schools. This is why this is burning such a hole in the government. I have absolutely no doubt that the empirical advice coming to you, Minister, in terms of your survey results will back up that claim. What this government has done is congratulate itself for stirring up sectarianism, religious bigotry and racial intolerance, all of which have accompanied their schooling policy. It has produced the highest level of prejudice and divisiveness that we have seen in 30 years. That is quite an achievement, Minister. The anger in the electorate, I am absolutely convinced, will be shown at the ballot box. The states grants bill is an example in legislative form of just how flawed the government thinking is in terms of its educational policy. The formula lacks transparency; it lacks clarity; it lacks equity. It is a formula which pretends to be fair but is in fact unjust, inequitable and divisive. The funding formula makes facile and tragically wrong assumptions about the nature of private education in this country. It assumes that the elite, exclusive, wealthy schools that cater for a tiny privileged echelon in the community whose parents can afford the $14,000 a year per child fees are essentially no different from the lowest-fee, most needy, most modest schools in our country. 
As for this formula developed by Professor Farish of the University of Melbourne, Professor Teese made the point that it advantaged what he called `predator' schools. It seems that the professor that drew the scheme up was an epidemiologist. He was not an educationalist; he was from the medical faculty of Melbourne University. Frankly, it is not surprising that the government should find itself in so much trouble over this measure. I do not believe that his expertise and his experience was in the field of education in terms of drawing up these measures. It is not a transparent system.
The decision to exclude from the model the applications to the Catholic education system and to ensure that its schools are in fact no worse off makes the point of just how ridiculous the system is: it only applies to such a tiny minority of non-government schools. Frankly, the government has a situation where it has now proposed to us that the amendments that we are proposing cannot be accepted. The government has essentially remained intransigent, and it does itself no credit in that process. It has rejected on numerous occasions the request by the Senate. It has frankly refused to discuss the issues and it has sought to avoid its responsibilities, and in doing so has essentially demonstrated its priorities.
The government says in return that, if the bill is not passed, essentially it is prepared to blackmail the 3.2 million Australians that are dependent upon this funding. Of course, that is not to mention the parents of the 3.2 million Australian students that depend on this money. It says it will block money to Australia's 10,000 schools. It says that the 7,000 government schools, the 1,700 Catholic schools and the other 900 non-government schools will have to do without. It is prepared to hold hostage 3.2 million Australians because the Labor Party has essentially exposed the farce of its funding formula.
This bill is unfair. It is outrageous. It is repugnant. But the situation is that it is the last day of the parliamentary sitting and the options before the chamber are quite stark. We are not a party that will deny funding to those 3.2 million Australians. We will pursue this issue vigorously. We have made it clear what our position will be in government. We have made it clear what our position will be in the run-up to the next election. We have made it perfectly clear that we will ensure that this bill will be amended when we are in government. The fact of the government's blackmail and of it holding hostage those 3.2 million Australians remains. We cannot allow those children to go without and therefore we are obliged to allow the bill to pass.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-12-07,"—At long last we have the final position from the opposition as to what it is going to do. One thing you can say about the Greens and the Democrats is that they have been very clear on their position. Whilst I do not agree with it, it has been a clear position. But, in relation to the opposition, we had trenchant criticism from Senator Carr despite the fact that the shadow minister for education and the Leader of the Opposition had both said that the opposition would support this bill. Despite that, we have a situation where the government is moving that this request not be pressed, where we would have faced an unprecedented situation if that motion were to fail because the Senate has never advanced that far in pressing a request a third time. So the situation has reached a point where a precedent could have been established where we would have traversed ground not previously covered. 
I will just point to some issues which have been raised by senators in speaking against this bill and firstly deal with comments made by Senator Carr. Senator Carr mentioned that in some way there was some qualification from Father Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Commission. On 23 August this year Father Doyle issued a media release in which he stated that:
The Senate should pass the State Grants Bill 2000 intact ...
He went on to say:
The Bill has the support of the—
National Catholic Education Commission—
and the State and Territory Catholic Education Commissions as it recognises that the allocation of funds is based upon need.
There was also a statement on 17 October this year by Peter Tannock, the Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, that said:
The NCEC recommends that the Commonwealth Parliament pass the legislation as soon as possible. It is important to remove the uncertainty about the availability of funding for January, 2001.
That is an essential point, because what the opposition and others have done here is to bring down to the wire the question of funding in relation to a bill which we are all agreed is very important and funding in relation to a question on which we are all agreed is very important, and that is: the provision of a good education to all Australians no matter where they are, no matter what their background and no matter what school they attend. In this bill we have billions of dollars of government funding for both government and non-government schools, funding which can be paid as soon as 1 January 2001, which is just over three weeks away. That is the urgency of the passage of this bill and that is the need for certainty that Dr Tannock mentioned in his release, and to have blocked this bill further, to have delayed it further, would have jeopardised the passage of this bill which related to that enormous amount of funding for education in this country.
Senator Allison raised a point in relation to education funding in Queensland and put a question to me as to whether the figures had been verified and that in round terms there was funding of $5,000 per student at a government school when the average was $6,000. The government has verified those figures. Indeed, the Prime Minister wrote to Premier Beattie on 3 December this year in relation to funding, and I quote the Prime Minister's letter:
Based on your own advice, it is clear that the total State funding provided to the government school in question is significantly less than the national and State averages. This raises questions about your Government's commitment to government schools, particularly in the context of the new and growing revenue available to States through A New Tax System. I understand that analysis by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs suggests that in 2000-01 the Commonwealth increased its funding to government schools in Queensland by 4.2 per cent compared to an increase in State funding of 0.8 per cent.
What the Prime Minister is putting very clearly there to Premier Beattie is that the Commonwealth government had increased funding to government schools by 4.2 per cent, as opposed to the state government, which only increased it by 0.8 per cent. What is more, the Prime Minister pointed to the fact that under the new tax system the states will have the revenue from the GST—revenue they never had before.
Senator Brown mentioned that, if this bill were in the United States of America, it would be unconstitutional because government moneys cannot go to private schooling in that country. With the greatest of respect to the United States of America, I say that they have their Constitution and we have ours. They have in their Constitution the right to bear arms, and I am sure Senator Brown, coming from Tasmania, would be the first to say that that is not a provision we would welcome in our own Constitution, particularly when one considers the state that Senator Brown comes from. So I think that analogy is not a good one to draw. 
Senator Crossin's criticism of funding for indigenous education and the provision we made for it insofar as this bill is concerned does not recognise the funding that we have provided for in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance)Bill 2000. In that bill we provided, for the quadrennium 2001-04, an appropriation of some $591 million in grants to indigenous education providers in the states and territories. In that bill alone we provided $591 million specifically for indigenous education. That is in addition to what this bill provides in various forms for indigenous education via the funding. Of course, this bill contains total funding of $22 billion. I want to place on record that the government are totally committed to indigenous education. We recognise that there is a great challenge in relation to indigenous education, one which has not been fully met and one which will take a great deal of effort to meet. We are committed to meeting that challenge, and we recognise that across the chamber there is a commitment to indigenous education. But what we think is entirely inappropriate is to turn it into a political football. Let us work together to improve the outcomes in relation to indigenous education in this country.
There has been comment made about the question of provision of government funding to non-government schools. In a letter to the Australian on 6 November this year, Audrey Jackson, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia, wrote:
It is time to stop taking the narrow view, with a focus on the larger, high fee, longer-established schools, and to consider the benefits across the sector. In the SES, the government has developed a method of funding that truly recognises the circumstances of schools in rural and remote Australia.
What Ms Jackson was referring to there were independent schools in such places as Coolgardie, Carnarvon, Gibson and Mukinbudin, and also those independent schools in the Pilbara, the Kimberley and the Great Sandy Desert. What Ms Jackson went on to say was that these schools will benefit from the implementation of the socioeconomic status model of funding since the maximum funding level has increased to 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost. What she is saying is that these independent schools, dealing with some of the most disadvantaged people in this country—geographically, socially and otherwise—were going to receive more funding as a result of our SES funding model. I think that is a salutary point that is made. I know those areas because they are in my state, and that is why I refer to them. But, of course, this has application across the nation and not just in Western Australia.
We have now reached the time when we have to realise the seriousness of any delay in the passage of this bill. If the government's motion is defeated, it will jeopardise the passing of the bill. I welcome the comments which I hear from Senator Carr in his closing remarks that the opposition will be supporting the bill. In that regard, we take it that the opposition will be supporting the government's motion that this request not be pressed. If, however, the opposition is minded that it should oppose the government's motion, I foreshadow that we will divide on the question.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I apologise for again seeking to make a contribution after the minister has summed up, but I feel obliged to do that because Senator Carr has just dropped a fairly large bombshell on this place and it cannot go unremarked. He says that the ALP are obliged to allow the bill to pass. I think we probably all know in this place that the ALP have known that all along, and in fact they indicated it from the very early stages of this debate. So what we have seen here is a fairly farcical exercise in time wasting. Those of us at this end of the chamber have hoped against hope that the ALP would change their mind, but it has been fairly clear right from the beginning that Mr Lee, the shadow spokesperson for schools, was always going to give in on this bill. I will be asking at the next election all of those people associated with the government and the non-government sector to remember that, because this has been a real waste of time and a great disappointment. 
We do not know that we will have an ALP government at the next election, and I think the fact that the ALP have not been prepared to insist on their amendments or on this request is an indication that they are weak in this area of public education and supporting the public sector. I do not think people are going to be persuaded that, just because they hung out for a couple weeks on their amendments, the ALP are likely to do better on public education than even the coalition. I do not think they can bask in the glory of this last couple of weeks of wasted time. It was never going to draw anything out of the government in any case. If you want to be serious in this place about getting some concessions, getting amendments put and getting them accepted, you do not flag at the outset that you are not actually going to insist—but Labor did that. The government simply had to wait it out, and it has been clear that that is what has happened.
There was, as I said, no obligation for this bill to pass or at least no obligation for the Senate to accede to the request of the House of Representatives. This should very much have been sheeted home to the government. It is the government bill, it is a very unpopular bill and it is a bill which is wrong in so many respects. It should have been amended by this place. Of course, I would have preferred the Democrats amendments, but we got stuck with the ALP's second-best amendments and now we hear that even they are not going to be insisted upon. So it is a great disappointment. I can promise the ALP that we will be not only drawing attention to the coalition's record on public education and on what this bill does but also drawing attention to the fact that the ALP were unable and unwilling to do anything about it.
As I said earlier, there is no guarantee we will have a Labor government next time around. There is no guarantee that a Labor government will roll it back. We have had no real commitments from Labor on what they will do for public education. We have had no real commitments on this bill. What about the EBA? What about the fact that Labor for so long has said, `We will take the opportunity to get rid of the enrolment benchmark adjustment'? Apparently they are not even going to insist on that. I feel very despondent and I do not know what the vast majority of parents are going to say about this act. They will not know who to turn to in terms of who ought to be in government next because I do not think Labor have adequately demonstrated that their commitment to public education is solid. We had many years of neglect while Labor were in government, when the amount of money spent on public education declined—and on education in general, I might say. Public education suffered under Labor, just as it is suffering under the coalition. It may not be as bad under Labor; I do not know because we have not been given any commitments along those lines.
This will be a major election issue. Labor are being criticised, as far as I can see, by most parents in this country. Most thinking, decent Australians will criticise both major parties over this decision. It is a very sad day for Australian education and I very much regret the statement that Senator Carr made just a few minutes ago in this place; and that is that public education in this country has no-one to turn to, apart from those of us who are at the back of the chamber. I sincerely hope the Democrats will greatly gain out of this in terms of electoral support, but my key concern is what is going to happen to public education in the long term. That raises real questions that have not been answered in this place. Again, I say that it is a great disappointment.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-12-07,"—I present the final report of the Select Committee on Information Technologies, together with the minutes of proceedings for the 38th and 39th Parliaments.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, I table this morning the final report of this Committee. This report reviews the major findings of the four reports tabled in the 39th Parliament
The Committee, re-established by the Senate on 25th March lost year, has played an important role in evaluating self-regulatory codes in the information industries; in monitoring the social and economic impact of information technologies; and in examining the Government's regulatory regime for dealing with offensive material on the Internet through its Online Services Bill.
The majority of the Committee supported the passage of the Bill without amendment. As governments become more experienced and technology-savvy and as consumers, particularly parents, become more aware and empowered in their dealings with the Internet, I am confident that we will see this important legislation become increasingly effective in protecting children from offensive material on the Internet.
Our next and most publicly debated report was tabled in March of this year and explored the contentious issue of Internet gambling. The report, NetBets, found that the existing interactive gambling models fell well short of the most basic measures that needed to be adopted to ensure safer gambling conditions for consumers.
For example, the Committee found there were inadequate warnings about the dangers of problem gambling; players were not informed about the odds of winning or losing; the player exclusion measures were grossly inadequate; and there was no permanent display of wins and losses.
Consequently, the Netbets report recommended a number of harm minimisation policies, which would offer some protection against an increase in problem gambling.
However, the Internet gambling industry faces a serious public image problem. In fact while much of the community concern with gambling is related to poker machines, Internet gambling has also been perceived in the some negative way.
Unfortunately the industry's lock of progress in dealing with this negative public perception and its reluctance to adopt the Committee's recommended voluntary pause on the introduction of new gambling sites, this Government yesterday placed a ban on new Internet gambling sites until May next year.
Our report into the way complaints against the media are dealt with was the focus of our next report, tabled in April of this year.
We heard many stories of gross invasions of privacy by the media and more alarming we found that the process of making a complaint against a newspaper or radio program was often a frustratingly slow and complicated process.
In an effort to more efficiently streamline the process of making a complaint against the media and ensuring that complaints were taken seriously, the Committee recommended the creation of a Media Complaints Commission (MCC).

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-12-07,"—I present the final report of the Select Committee on Information Technologies, together with the minutes of proceedings for the 38th and 39th Parliaments.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, I table this morning the final report of this Committee. This report reviews the major findings of the four reports tabled in the 39th Parliament
The Committee, re-established by the Senate on 25th March lost year, has played an important role in evaluating self-regulatory codes in the information industries; in monitoring the social and economic impact of information technologies; and in examining the Government's regulatory regime for dealing with offensive material on the Internet through its Online Services Bill.
The majority of the Committee supported the passage of the Bill without amendment. As governments become more experienced and technology-savvy and as consumers, particularly parents, become more aware and empowered in their dealings with the Internet, I am confident that we will see this important legislation become increasingly effective in protecting children from offensive material on the Internet.
Our next and most publicly debated report was tabled in March of this year and explored the contentious issue of Internet gambling. The report, NetBets, found that the existing interactive gambling models fell well short of the most basic measures that needed to be adopted to ensure safer gambling conditions for consumers.
For example, the Committee found there were inadequate warnings about the dangers of problem gambling; players were not informed about the odds of winning or losing; the player exclusion measures were grossly inadequate; and there was no permanent display of wins and losses.
Consequently, the Netbets report recommended a number of harm minimisation policies, which would offer some protection against an increase in problem gambling.
However, the Internet gambling industry faces a serious public image problem. In fact while much of the community concern with gambling is related to poker machines, Internet gambling has also been perceived in the some negative way.
Unfortunately the industry's lock of progress in dealing with this negative public perception and its reluctance to adopt the Committee's recommended voluntary pause on the introduction of new gambling sites, this Government yesterday placed a ban on new Internet gambling sites until May next year.
Our report into the way complaints against the media are dealt with was the focus of our next report, tabled in April of this year.
We heard many stories of gross invasions of privacy by the media and more alarming we found that the process of making a complaint against a newspaper or radio program was often a frustratingly slow and complicated process.
In an effort to more efficiently streamline the process of making a complaint against the media and ensuring that complaints were taken seriously, the Committee recommended the creation of a Media Complaints Commission (MCC).
This independent statutory body would be formed to help individuals in making their complaints and would act as a `one stop shop' for all complaints against the media. The MCC would also function as a final arbiter for complaints.
The Committee felt that it was important that the MCC be there to empower individuals when making a complaint and to act as an independent link between `community and proprietor.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-12-07,"—I move the following amendment to the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000:
(1)	Clause 3, page 2 (line 17), at the end of the definition of road, add:
	; (g)	a covered car park adjacent to a railway station or bus interchange.
This amendment would have the effect of altering slightly, or providing an addition to, the definitions of those things which might be considered a road in relation to those sorts of things that local councils could provide funding to once this Commonwealth funding has been made available to them. As it stands in the bill, the definition of a road would include any of the following associated with a road: first, a traffic sign; second, traffic control equipment; third, street lighting equipment; fourth, a vehicular ferry; fifth, a bridge or tunnel, including a bridge or tunnel for the use of pedestrians; and finally, a path for the use of persons riding bicycles.
As I said in my speech on the second reading, it is encouraging that this road funding is being made available to those other sorts of things and not simply and specifically for roads. However, we propose that the definition be expanded slightly to include one further thing; that is, that the funding ought to be made available through local government to a covered car park adjacent to a railway station or bus interchange.
It is clear from the evidence that there are many people using public transport, be it train or bus. That is a good thing socially and environmentally. But the evidence also illustrates that there are many people who might be encouraged to make better use of trains and buses but who choose not to do so because of the difficulties they may have experienced in relation to leaving their family car, or their key method of transport, at the bus or train station. It is often the case that these car parking areas at interchange stations are unshaded, making it prohibitive to leave your car there all day. That is very much the case in warmer climates and in inclement weather. In many cases, these car parks are unlit, providing insecurity for both the car and the passenger. As a consequence, there is evidence to suggest that there are many people who would make better use of public transport if there were better intermodal operation—that is, if better opportunities were provided to people to access these places.
I note from an article by Matthew Rogers in the Sunday Telegraph of 26 November that the increase in fuel prices which we currently experience has seen a dramatic boost in demand, particular for rail travel. Mr Rogers says in his article that commuters from Sydney's western suburbs are behind an unprecedented boom in demand for rail travel. Stations in the city's west and inner west are reporting passenger increases of up to 60 per cent on last year's numbers. Figures obtained from the Sunday Telegraph show that some 12,000 more people are catching trains each day than at the same time last year. Most of that growth is coming from the suburbs of Liverpool—up some 59.7 per cent on a year ago; Strathfield up 38.1 per cent; Hurstville up 26.4 per cent; Bankstown on eight per cent; and Parramatta on almost eight per cent. The daily increase in train patronage is the equivalent of a capacity crowd at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. It is quite extraordinary, illustrating two things: when encouraged to do so, people can and will use public transport and, when you do have that change in transport behaviour, there needs to be a governmental response to that in terms of best facilitating that and making the best options available to people. 
In moving this amendment, what we are seeking to do, quite clearly, is to ensure that local governments, if they have the option and they choose to, are able to use some of this funding to upgrade or introduce quality car parking stations which are covered and are security protected with lighting for both the vehicles and the passengers, as a carrot, as it were—rather than a stick—to try to draw more people to those stations and to make better use of them. I understand that Labor have indicated that they will not be supporting this amendment, and I express genuine disappointment at that, particularly when you look at this article in the Sunday Telegraph and you see that the suburbs and areas mentioned in that particular article are Labor constituencies, Labor seats. I would have thought that, with these kinds of mortgage belt areas, where people are living in the outer suburbs and are, of necessity, using the train to access workplaces in the city, this would be something that the Labor Party ought to support. I do not see this change as being particularly astonishing or remarkable; I see it as being very sensible. It is good public policy. I would have thought that Labor would have been behind that. Once again I sincerely plea with Labor to give serious consideration to this amendment. I believe it is worthy of consideration. If this amendment is passed, it will make no fundamental change to the bill or to the act. It makes terrific sense on social and environmental grounds. I commend the amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—While I appreciate the reasons behind Senator Greig moving this amendment, the government will not be supporting the amendment, because it really does extend the definition of a road beyond what one would normally anticipate would be a road. The sealing of car parks, particularly around railway stations, is something that the state governments are principally responsible for. In our view, it is something the state governments should do. The underlying principle of the whole roads to recovery grant was to ensure that this was additional money and that state governments, in particular, would not take the opportunity to cost shift from the things for which they are responsible and the things they should be funding and then put that responsibility on councils.
In addition, for consistency, the definition we have adopted, with one minor exception, is the definition of a road under the Australian Land Transport Development Act, which deals with national highways. For legislative consistency, we have adopted the same definition with, as I say, a minor exception which deletes boat ramps from the definition. I am not quite sure—and my advisers have said that they are not quite sure—why boat ramps are included in definitions of the national highway, but we have deleted it from this one. For legislative consistency, we hope to maintain the definition that is in the act when the federal parliament is dealing with similar issues.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Senator Greig is correct: the Labor Party is not in a position to support this amendment. I am advised by Mr Martin Ferguson that he and his office are concerned about the time frames in relation to the circulation of the amendment. I understand that it was advised to their office only after lunch yesterday. Their concern is that in fact the bill has been in circulation since Wednesday last week, and their view is that it is a somewhat ad hoc way to approach the issue of transport. As the government has outlined, this bill is essentially about roads, and the Labor Party is happy with the definition as it exists in relation to roads. While we are not necessarily averse to it in another form, we believe that in relation to this legislation it is somewhat ill fitted.
I have been asked to point out to the Democrats that, if the issue of transparency is of concern, the Labor Party would question why no support was provided for the speed rail probity inquiry, which would have provided some transparency in relation to that process. I am also advised by Mr Ferguson that Labor would appreciate more consultation with the Democrats in relation to transport matters and, in particular, to the timing, which would have allowed us to consider this in a more relaxed environment. However, I am cognisant of the fact that we are dealing with this bill in an expeditious fashion and that we have not got the same amount of time that we normally would have. Labor is concerned that this is a bit of an ad hoc initiative and that it does not fit with the general thrust of the legislation in terms of the definitions. On behalf of Mr Ferguson, I would also like to convey that, as far as Labor and he are concerned, a more cooperative relationship in relation to transport may be an objective that could be pursued between the two parties in relation to timeliness, contact and context.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I rise to briefly comment on the Democrats' amendment and to indicate that One Nation will not be supporting the amendment. I would also like to take this opportunity to make a couple of comments, Firstly, I wish to commend the government for its funding package for roads, which is going directly to the councils, and to speak briefly on some issues relating to areas in North Queensland. The Cook Shire, which is a substantial shire in the north of Queensland that takes up predominantly the entire Cape York Peninsula, does have a particular problem in relation to roads. It is heartening to see in the government's proposal for Queensland that the existing allocations for identified road grants will rise from 18.7 per cent to 20.8 per cent—a substantial increase. Returning to the issue of the Cook Shire, which finds itself in an extremely high rainfall area and where the roads suffer substantial erosion, I take this opportunity to call on the federal government to look at its predicament in relation to roads. All of the roads in the Cook Shire are predominantly dirt or gravel formed roads and they suffer considerably during the wet.
The other area I would like to briefly speak about is the tableland, consisting of the Mareeba Shire, the Atherton Shire, the Herberton Shire and the Eacham Shire. The roads within those shires are predominantly bitumen. There has been substantial development in the last couple of years on the tableland, particularly in the sugar industry. This expansion is extremely welcome following the downturn in other agricultural activities up there, particularly in the tobacco industry. This expansion, from approximately a million tonnes annually to two million tonnes, has also brought a heavy impact on the road infrastructure. So, again, I commend the government in the passage of this bill in that the funding will go directly to those shires. I hope it will help to alleviate in some way the extra pressure on the local governments.
Having said that, I would like to place on record the concern of Pauline Hanson's One Nation about the cost of fuel, and that has been raised before in this debate. What is the use of upgrading a road if you cannot afford the cost of the fuel to travel on it? That would be my only criticism in relation to this bill: the government has failed to listen to the cries for help from the Australian people about the cost of fuel. I see this bill as a step in the right direction. It will help the local governments in their local areas. I ask the government to also take into consideration the particular impacts in the Cook Shire in relation to their heavy rainfall and also the impact of the increased traffic on roads in the local shires of the Atherton Tableland, which is related to the expansion in the sugar industry. Finally, I believe that the amendment put forward by the Democrats could raise considerable long-term problems in relation to the allocation of this funding.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-12-07,"—I will take a brief opportunity to respond to my critics. The minister, perhaps not surprisingly, raised the issue of the state and Commonwealth nexus. Last Sunday, at Government House in Sydney, I had the privilege to listen to the last in the current series of the Boyer Lectures, where the Chief Justice of the High Court, Mr Murray Gleeson, spoke on the role of the law in the Constitution. He mused over the fact that, at a function he attended recently, it was brought to his attention that the UN had declared next year the International Year of the Elephant. In response to this, it was suggested that each nation would produce a book to celebrate this: the US would produce a book called `Elephants: how to manage them and profit from them'; the Germans would produce a book called `Elephants: their training and discipline'; and the Australians would produce a book called `Elephants: a state or federal problem'. The more time I spend in this place, the more nationalist I become. 
The nexus we continue to experience between state and Commonwealth jurisdiction is frustrating. However, I do not think the minister was saying that my proposal could not be done but rather that it ought not be done. There is a fundamental difference. Senator Mackay mentioned the Speedrail inquiry. In all sincerity, I did not understand the nexus; however, she went on in a more general sense to talk about cooperation between Labor and the Democrats. I have no difficulty in encouraging that, as I would with the government—I am nothing if not reasonable. However, I state clearly for the record that the reason I had not contacted Labor directly with my amendment is that I thought it was very simple and spoke for itself. I did not think it needed explanation. I was not proposing fundamental or comprehensive changes to the bill. My recollection is that my amendment was circulated before your second reading contribution and, with respect, I had no consultation from your office on the second reading amendment.
Senator Harris referred to the potential long-term problems with my amendment. With respect, Senator Harris, I do not concede that. I see no comprehensive or ongoing difficulty with the amendment. I wonder, if this amendment were to pass, whether many councils would take advantage of it. Certainly the opportunity is there for them, but my experience in liaising with delegates at the ALGA conference, which concluded in Canberra in recent days, was that there is a great sense of excitement and tremendous enthusiasm. The minister was quite right when he said in his second reading speech that both governments are extremely keen for this money, and I can understand that, having come from a local government background. I note with interest that my old bailiwick, in the town of Vincent, will receive $160,000 over four years, which is about enough money to seal two rights of ways of about 100 metres in length. So it is not overwhelming in the inner city areas.
In summing up, I concede that I am not going to win this one, but I do think it was a genuine attempt on my part to bring some focus back to public transport in what has been a very vehicle based, fossil fuel based debate. I think all too often we lose sight of what we really need to do: to get people out of cars, to get pollution out of the air and to have strong, sensible, national and state based transport polices that focus far more strongly on public transport.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I want to take the opportunity to put one thing on the record, and I would appreciate some indication from Senator Greig. It was my understanding—and if this has not occurred, I will chase it up—that Martin Ferguson's office had provided you with our proposed second reading amendment. It was my understanding that it was provided to your office.
—Okay. If it was not, I will chase it up and find out what happened to it. That was certainly my understanding, and it is something that we would normally do. Just to provide some context for the allusion to the Speedrail issue, our contention is that transport does need to be dealt with in a holistic sense in terms of its intermodal capacity and all forms of transport. In relation to this amendment in particular, we believe we are dealing with a roads bill. This does not mean to say that there may not be some mechanism which we can discuss with the Democrats and potentially the government to cover the types of issues that you have raised here. 
Senator Greig, I found your joke very amusing, and I do not share the minister's view that it is therefore a state issue. One could draw on anything being a state issue—for example, internal transport and airports. If they are a state issue in New South Wales I think that is probably news to the New South Wales government with the various media speculation that is occurring at the moment. I just wanted to put that on the record. If you did not get a copy of that, I will chase that up for you. Just to reiterate: we will not be supporting this amendment in the context of this particular bill.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-12-07,"—If no-one on the other side is going to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, I want to make a couple of comments. This bill clarifies the government's existing powers to safeguard the public interest in electronic addressing services including domain name management. The bill is a key element in the framework for the introduction of competition to the .au domain space. The bill ensures that the government has the necessary powers to safeguard the public interest in electronic advertising services, such as Internet domain names. This will underpin the government's policy of responsible self-regulatory management for the .au Internet domain. It is important that the government ensures that a safety net is in place in case problems arise in the future. The government's position on the introduction of competition to domain name registration has the support of the Internet industry, auDA and other major players in the domain name space. These amendments recognise the importance of electronic addressing services such as domain names to end users by ensuring that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has powers to direct a manager of electronic addressing in relation to consumer protection matters as well as competition matters. The amendments will also ensure that the government has a number of options as to how it can become involved in electronic addressing management to ensure a sensible safety net underpins self-regulation of this important Internet infrastructure. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I say at the outset that there has been some movement on the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999 legislation. There has been some movement by the government, and we are pleased to see that. We are pleased to see that the government has seen some sense and done a backflip in response to the opposition's concerns about the proposed moral rights legislation as it was first drafted. The government has recognised at last that what it was proposing to do was, in essence, the wrong thing. It was proposing to take an agreement that was made specifically for the film and TV industry and apply it across the entire arts industry. For some time we have made it very clear that this situation was unacceptable. We have been prepared to specifically amend the bill to implement a comprehensive moral rights regime to reflect the film and television agreement and concerns within the wider arts industry. As I say, the government, aware that both Labor and the Democrats were prepared to support amending this legislation, has at last seen some reason and has substantially adopted Labor's amendments. These amendments will now be introduced by the government. We are prepared to support them because they are significant improvements on the government's initial bill. As the government is aware, there is still some concern in the arts industry in relation to the application of certain parts of this legislation. Therefore, we will be watching its application closely, and we will be prepared to make further amendments to the bill if required. 
One aspect of moral rights that is not specifically addressed in this legislation is moral rights for indigenous Australians. For indigenous Australians, art is an expression of all aspects of life and identity, and art is a major way of passing on culture to future indigenous generations. Many indigenous artworks depict culturally important content such as creation stories and ceremonies. Certain images, techniques and styles have developed over time, originating from and identifying particular indigenous groups. Indigenous law and custom may control the use of these. Therefore, accuracy of reproduction is of great importance as inaccurate reproduction of an artwork can cause deep offence to those familiar with the Dreaming. I believe that the introduction of moral rights of authorship and integrity will be significant for indigenous artists. There are of course issues in relation to extending moral rights protection to indigenous clans over works that contain traditional ritual knowledge. This has not been addressed in the current legislation. We give a commitment to consult extensively with indigenous artists and communities and other parties as to the most appropriate way of extending specific moral rights to indigenous artists. 
Having said all that, this legislation has taken a long road to get to this stage. It must be remembered that the Labor Party first promised an examination of moral rights for artists by the Keating Labor government at the 1993 federal election. In June 1994, the ministers for arts, justice and communications jointly released a discussion paper entitled Proposed moral rights legislation for copyright creators. From these discussions, draft moral rights amendments were prepared and circulated just before the election in February 1996. Unfortunately, as we all know, there was a change of government. That led to the current government taking what we believe to be a less than satisfactory approach to moral rights since 1996. The Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 was introduced in June 1997 and was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee reported in October 1997. Because of, essentially, the government's inability to resolve industry differences, the government withdrew the moral rights provisions of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. Senator Alston, then Minister for the Arts, gave a commitment in June 1998 that he would reintroduce moral rights amendments by the end of 1998 after further consultation. The government finally got around to introducing this bill, the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999, in December 1999. When we finally got the legislation, it was sadly lacking in substance and demanded significant amendment. As I said earlier, we have drawn a number of concerns to the government's attention. At last they have listened to most of them, and that is why at this stage we are supporting the amendments that are being proposed by the government today. 
The introduction of moral rights for Australian artists is a significant achievement. Moral rights seek to complement existing economic rights but, unlike economic rights, moral rights seek to deal with the creator's honour and reputation through the way their work is used. We believe this bill, as well as having a philosophical commitment to moral rights, should address Australia's obligations under the 1971 Paris Revision of the 1928 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Labor support moral rights because they provide recognition that a work is part of an author's character and personality and therefore any unauthorised change to the work could reflect badly on the author. The right of individuals to protect the integrity of their work and the right to have their work attributed to them are at the core of moral rights. The right to be able to protect a work from derogatory treatment has also been addressed. `Moral rights' is defined to mean the following three rights: the right of attribution of authorship, the right not to have authorship falsely attributed and the right of integrity of authorship. I am pleased that the government has done this backflip at the last moment. It is now moving substantial amendments to its original bill. It is now taking what we believe to be a more bipartisan and inclusive approach to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights legislation for all Australian artists by moving the amendments the opposition will be supporting today.
In conclusion, on behalf of the opposition I would like to thank the government for its cooperation in adopting the majority of Labor's concerns in relation to the inadequacy of the initial bill. I also place on record the work of the previous shadow minister for the arts, Duncan Kerr, and the shadow Attorney-General, Robert McClelland. The opposition would also like to acknowledge the work—and I must stress this—of the Arts Law Centre of Australia, especially Delia Browne, who is a respected moral rights expert. The centre's ongoing work to achieve moral rights for Australian artists has beenbrought to fruition in the amendments that we are accepting today. Labor will be supporting the circulated government amendments. We welcome the introduction of moral rights for Australians and this legislation, to the extent that it does that. 
Can I also indicate that there will be some amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. We are disappointed that we are not in a position to have given them greater consideration. They were presented to us at about 11 a.m. this morning, less than two hours ago. There has been absolutely no consultation with the opposition on these amendments. We are not aware, for instance, of the extent, if any, of any consultation that the Democrats have undertaken with indigenous artists in forming these amendments. We understand the spirit and direction they want to take, but I think this legislation demands more than a less-than-two-hour consideration of amendments such as the ones that are to be moved by the Democrats. The issues of moral rights for indigenous artists are serious issues. We think it would be appropriate for the government to instigate an inquiry into moral rights for indigenous artists, and such an inquiry would be supported by the opposition. We cannot support Senator Ridgeway's amendments if he decides to go ahead with them today. We cannot support them at this stage but, as I signalled earlier, this area does require attention and will be given attention by Labor in government. As I say, there probably is a very good case for an inquiry into this area in the interim.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-12-07,"—The Australian Democrats see today as a very important day for the Australian arts community. I believe that Australia is a step closer to fulfilling our obligations under the Berne convention. I would also like to be able to say that I am pleased about Australia meeting a debt to our indigenous arts community by recognising their very particular moral rights at both the individual and collective level. I will talk more on that, in the committee stage. I would like the chamber to note that I am attempting to shorten my speech during the second reading debate in order to talk more specifically about indigenous moral rights. Perhaps it may well come about, as part of the government's undertaking today, that they will address a number of issues that I raise. Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats congratulate the government on its amendments and are pleased to be able to support the package of amendments tabled today to introduce moral rights into the Australian Copyright Act. 
Special congratulations are also due to the Arts Law Centre of Australia and most especially its Director, Ms Delia Browne. She has worked tirelessly bringing this legislation to fruition. Without her dedication and passion on this issue over the last decade, the arts practitioners of Australia would surely be seeing a very different set of amendments being considered in this chamber. Credit also needs to go to Tamara Winikoff of the National Association of the Visual Arts, Jose Borghino of the Australian Society of Authors, Sue McCreadie and Ian David of the Australian Writers Guild, and Richard Harris of the Australian Screen Directors Association. Every one of them has worked hard to negotiate these amendments and reach consensus amongst themselves, the artists they represent and the government. In reaching that consensus, much ground has been conceded by the arts sector, the film and television sector and the government.
The Australian Democrats are particularly mindful of the concerns still held by the arts sector as to how the bill in its form today will work in practice. In recognition of the other strengths of the bill and the overall benefits that legislative moral rights protection could bring, the ASA and the Arts Law Centre have put those concerns to one side, and recommended the enactment of the bill, which we are happy to support. However, I would like to put those concerns on the public record. They relate to the sections of the bill that deal specifically with the agreement that was negotiated by the film and television sector with the government and, in turn, how that agreement will impact on the rest of the arts sectors. Those sections are 195AM, 195AN subsection (4), 195AW, 195AZM, 195AZN and 195AZO.
It is the Democrats' understanding that the agreement reached between the film and television sector was only ever meant to apply to that particular sector and it was on that basis that other art sectors felt it appropriate not to be directly involved in those negotiations. It is also my understanding that the government has developed amendments which will establish two consent procedures that will operate side by side for the film and television sector and also for the rest of the arts sector. This is borne out by sections 195AW and 195AWA. Whilst it is clearly not an ideal situation and will create some anomalies, all parties to that agreement have entered into this outcome in good faith, and the Democrats commend them for that.
The effect of these consent provisions will be that already published novels, plays and musical works which at some point in the future become incorporated into a film or television adaptation will be subject to the consent provisions that apply to the film and television sector. In effect, it means that the duration of the moral right of integrity of authorship in relation to a novel which is adapted for film will die with the author and not continue for the life of copyright protection, that is, another 50 years. That is something that will create a situation where the right of integrity of authorship will vary from one novel to another, depending on whether they have been adapted for film and TV or not.
The Australian Democrats will therefore be watching very closely to see how those provisions operate in practice and to what extent other measures to protect the rights of authors are able to operate to good effect. In particular, the Arts Law Centre and the ASA are placing great faith in section 195AWB, which provides that consents are invalidated by duress or false or misleading statements. However, the reality that consents with waivers recently became common practice in contracts for sectors of the arts industry only heightens the need for all parties to the negotiations surrounding this bill to make sure that the good faith with which those agreements have been entered into is not allowed to dissipate.
The Australian Democrats also want to give credit to the government for the significant advance in its position on the operation of moral rights in relation to public art. We welcome these new amendments in 195AT. We believe they will assist greatly in fostering the development of a public art code of conduct. The Democrats therefore welcome these amendments. We endorse them with the reservations I have mentioned. We hope that the good faith of the parties will continue into the future so that all authors and our arts industry as a whole will benefit from this consensus outcome. 
I note the comments from my colleague in the opposition in terms of the indigenous moral rights provision that I have put forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It needs to be said for the record that, whilst there have been attempts to deal with these issues over a long period, I do not think it is fair to say that consideration of this issue has been left to the last two hours. Clearly, this is an issue that has been raised time and time again by indigenous people. It is an issue that I raised with the shadow spokesperson for arts some four weeks ago. At that time I did not have to hand a copy of an amendment. That has now been provided. It simply needs to be stated for the record that consultation did occur. Whilst the ALP is not prepared to support that, I would hope that it is prepared to support a further inquiry and specific actions by the government to ensure that indigenous moral rights are dealt with adequately.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-12-07,"—In the interests of facilitating the passage of this and other bills in this hour, I will speak more briefly than I would otherwise have. As Senator Ridgeway has indicated, the issue of copyright is a significant and important one and, in a way, it is a shame that we cannot have a more fulsome debate on the broader issues. I do want also to flag some other matters to put it in the broader context of the need for ongoing reform in the area of copyright. 
This particular legislation goes part way to doing that. It has taken a fair while to appear, and I think we need to continue to make the point that there are other areas where we need action, particularly if we are to honourall the obligations we have made in international law in relation to human rights, culture and other areas. These include things such as directors' copyright, resale royalty rights—which is particularly important for indigenous artists whose works are now being sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars when they were bought for maybe a couple of hundred dollars a matter of years ago—comprehensive legislation protection for indigenous copyright, both individual and collective, and also the issue of performance copyright, which is an economic right rather than a moral right and therefore, in that sense, not necessarily appropriate for this legislation. But the broader issue of copyright reform and the need for further action in relation to that needs to be acknowledged. 
At the moment the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill provides that authors of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work shall be granted moral rights protection in their work in which the copyright subsists, but performers in sound recordings are not included in that. Certainly my view is that we need to include accreditation to and preservation of integrity in performers' audio and audiovisual work. This was something that was mentioned in the present government's pre-election arts policy `For art's sake—a fair go', which indicated it would devise workable performance copyright legislation. I trust the government is still working to deliver on that commitment. 
It is important that performers be given a legal right to receive equitable remuneration for the reproduction, public performance, broadcasting and communication to the public of their recorded performances. The World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, adopted the World Performances and Phonograms Treatyin Geneva in 1996, which protects all of those performers' rights in sound recordings. The treaty has provided important economic incentives for performers, yet under the current copyright law in Australia there is no protection for performers. The only right performers currently have is where a sound recording of a performance is used in a film and the recording was not initially authorised for that purpose. 
Under the copyright law there are two copyrights relevant to the music industry, neither of which give rights to performers on sound recordings. One of those is a musical work in a work comprising both music and lyrics, and the owner of the copyright there in the musical work is in the songwriter. The second copyright is the sound recording which is a work comprised of a series of recorded sounds and the sound is on a disc or a record. The owner of copyright in a sound recording is the person who paid for it, which is usually the record companies. The largest owners of these copyrights, of course, are the major record companies.  
As a result of the copyright, the owners have the right, among other rights, to play the work publicly, to broadcast or to copy the work, most usually through the selling of CDs and so on. When either copyrights are played publicly or broadcast, the venues such as entertainment centres, pubs, hairdressers, restaurants, radio stations, cinemas and so on have to pay for the right to do that. They pay two licence fees. The fee for the musical work goes to APRA, which distributes that income to songwriters, and the fee for the sound recording goes to the PPCA, which distributes that income to the owners of the sound recordings and artists entitled to an artist royalty. 
Any payments performers currently receive under their contracts with record companies and/or from the PPCA are based on their contribution to the recording costs of sound recordings, not linked to their performance per se. Although the record company pays the initial recording costs, the record company recoups those costs from the performers. That is the artist's royalties. So, in effect, performers are paying for the costs of recording. That is not so for composers. As a result of the copyright entitlements in the act on the musical work, composers are paid a royalty, known as a mechanical royalty, on every record from the first record sold. 
Recognising performers' copyright would give performers with recordings the same rights and economic stream as other copyright owners; it would not be an equivalent income stream but the same rights to some economic stream. In contrast to the existing rights under the act, performers would have rights in relation to a range of uses of authorised recordings for performances and moral rights. It is my view that performers are entitled to equitable remuneration in recognition of the value of their performances. I am sure all of us could list—and I would if I was not rushed for time—any number of well-known songs where the performer, whether it is a singer or other musicians, clearly contributed to the success of that recording yet they have no copyright under law; only the writer of the song does. 
Because performers have no legal rights for negotiating directly with end users of recordings on which they have performed, they have no opportunity to establish income streams which are independent of the maker of the first recording of a live performance. So if performers are granted legal rights to their performances, they will be entitled to receive payment for the use of their recorded performances. Performers would receive remuneration for the reproduction, broadcasting and public performance of their recordings, as do the composers and the owners of sound recordings currently. 
Because performers have no rights, they have extremely limited income streams, and I think that this point needs to be made. If we are looking at trying to encourage or generate economic incentives for the arts industry and the music industry, some guarantee of income stream—some right to that through the work of the performer—is absolutely crucial. The average income for an Australian musician—a non-composing one—is well below average weekly earnings. I think addressing something such as performance copyright would go some way to improving the opportunities for people who wish to pursue activity in the arts industry and the music industry. 
I do urge the government, in their ongoing efforts to improve, reform and update copyright law, ideally to address all of those issues I outlined at the start of my contribution, but particularly performance copyright. As a former musician of absolutely no note whatsoever, I could be seen to have an interest in that. Certainly, from my previous experience and involvement in the music industry, I am well aware of the sacrifices people make, the very limited opportunity to earn a decent living and the fact that performers of whatever type—whatever instrument or voice—make an integral contribution to the value of a sound recording. Their contribution and the rights attached to that recording should be enshrined in law, as it currently is for the composers of those works.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-12-07,"—It has been a long haul in the issue of moral rights. I was shadow minister for the arts—I cannot actually remember when; it may have been the mid-nineties—and this was an issue then when Labor was in government. It is a tough issue; it is not easy, and I am delighted that it has been the coalition government that has finally brought legislation into this chamber to deal with the issue of moral rights. 
I think I read about six folders of material on moral rights, and I realised what a complex question it is. There are arguments and views on all sides. I visited the Arts Law Centre and I know that they have had a particular role to play in this issue over many, many years. Labor had 13 years and they got to exposure draft bill stage, I think, and here we are with a bill and with some action. That is what the public are coming to expect from the coalition government: rather than rhetoric, it is actually a government which does something. 
Delia Browne from the Arts Law Centre has brought her knowledge and experience to this debate and has contributed enormously, as has been said by the Democrats and the Labor Party. She also brought to bear her skills in consulting and has brought consensus among the various interests within the arts community. Anybody who has read anything on this area realises that there are various views even within the arts community about the issue of moral rights. So our congratulations ought to go to Delia Browne for the contribution that she has made to this debate and to this bill. 
The bill is another important landmark in the government's ongoing program of copyright reform. It establishes for the first time a comprehensive regime for the protection of the moral rights of Australian authors, artists and film makers. It implements the coalition's commitment at the 1996 election, reiterated at the 1998 election, to develop legislation to ensure greater respect for the integrity of creative endeavour. 
There has been increasing criticism that Australia's implementation of its obligations under the Berne convention is fragmentary and incomplete. This bill will address those criticisms. This bill is not just about fulfilling international obligations. More importantly, it is about acknowledging the great importance of respect for the integrity of creative behaviour. At its most basic, the bill is a recognition of the importance to Australian culture of literary, artistic, music and dramatic works and of those who create them. The government recognises the concerns of users of copyright, such as broadcasters, advertising agencies, film makers and newspaper publishers, that moral rights will unduly hamper their existing practices. However, if a user of a work respects the rights of the creator, the user will not need the author's permission in making use of that work. Thus, if a user acknowledges, where reasonable, the authorship of the work and, where reasonable, avoids treatment that is prejudicial to the reputation of the author, there can be no objection by the author or the creator. 
The government's intention is that as a result of these amendments the broader film industry consent provision currently in the bill will only apply to the extent that a work is actually included in a film. If a work is never included, the restricted consent provision we are introducing today will operate to limit the range of acts and omissions to which the consent may be sought. The existing consent provisions reflect the outcome of close to two years of negotiations with the film industry, represented by the Film and Television Group, a body with representatives from all sectors of the film industry and established by the industry to develop a unified industry position on moral rights. 
The bill is another initiative from a government committed to reshaping copyright for the 21st century and beyond. We have addressed the main issues of controversy and have worked hard to accommodate as far as possible the views conveyed to us.  
I wish to respond to a couple of comments. Senator Ridgeway received a letter from Senator Alston dated yesterday, and I wish to read into Hansard the relevant part of that letter: 
However, I will ask my Department to give serious consideration to the principles underlying your proposals in the context of its development of legislative amendments and other measures to address the issues you raise. I have asked my Department to bring forward a final proposal for the consideration of myself and my fellow Ministers early in the new year. I undertake to ensure that you—
that is, Senator Ridgeway—
are consulted in my Department's deliberations, including on draft proposals and legislative amendments. I will also ensure that my Department consults with representatives of appropriate peak Indigenous bodies. 
I wanted to put on the record that commitment that the minister has made to Senator Ridgeway. 
With regard to the comments Senator Bartlett made about actors being granted moral rights in relation to films, the bill deals with moral rights in works and films as required by the Berne convention, of which Australia has been a member for many years. Performers' moral rights are dealt with in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty concluded in 1996 and not yet in force internationally. The government has consulted affected interests on the possibility of legislating for the obligations under that WIPO treaty, including performers' moral rights. Further consideration will be given to this issue following a diplomatic conference taking place in Geneva as we speak to adopt a protocol to the WIPO treaty to cover performers' rights in films, TV programs and other audiovisual productions. I hope that addresses some of the concerns that Senator Bartlett had. 
In closing this debate, I want to again say that it is easy to run away from the tough tasks. It is easy to put it off and keep having consultations. It takes a government that is committed to appropriate reform to bring in these sorts of reforms to address, to the best of our ability, the issues that have concerned both sides of the industry—the artists and those who use the works of artists—and to accommodate the very differing views. The bill, with the changes that are being moved, forms a balanced package of rights that will represent a great advance in the recognition of, and respect for, the creativity of authors, artists and film makers. It is a workable scheme. It deserves the strong support of this parliament. I commend the bill to the Senate. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I am conscious that we have made very little progress this lunchtime on the passage of the bill, so I was going to suggest to the parliamentary secretary, Senator Patterson, that, given the timing, I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech rather than delay the Senate for 20 minutes by reading it. I am happy to allow her to have a look at it, but there is nothing in it that is offensive or controversial.  
—Firstly, I have a problem with the incorporation of a speech, especially when I have not seen it. Even when I have seen it, I think it is a habit we should not get into. I personally have that view, and I am on duty in the chamber at the moment. If you could abbreviate your speech, that would be wonderful, but I would ask you to actually make your comments.
—I will just make my speech then, and Senator Patterson can deal with the complaints at 3 o'clock in the morning when our colleagues show their concern.
This bill makes it harder for people ineligible for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, such as tourists, overseas visitors and people with non-resident status, to obtain subsidised drugs. The bill also attempts to reduce the incidence of doctor shopping—the practice of a person getting multiple prescriptions from different doctors. The opposition support these two goals. We agree with tightening up the eligibility arrangements. However, this should not be at the expense of the privacy of an individual's health information. 
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a $3.8 billion program. It is a significant government program that provides the community with reliable and affordable access to necessary and cost-effective medicine. Under the scheme, the Commonwealth pays about 82 per cent of the cost of PBS listed drugs. Pensioners are required to pay only $3.30 for each script, which makes sure that they have access to the medicines they need at an affordable price. Considering the substantial benefits payable through the PBS, its entitlement arrangements should be properly administered to make sure only eligible people receive the benefits. The government must also be vigilant in making sure that the process of listing a new drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is properly administered and that access to low cost pharmaceuticals continues. 
The opposition has serious concerns that the government's implementation of the final report of the review of PBS listing arrangements will weaken the PBS listing process, particularly in the short term. Decisions to place new drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are made on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. No new drug can be made available on the PBS unless the committee has recommended it. 
This committee undertakes rigorous assessments of the cost effectiveness of new drugs before it advises the government on whether the health benefits and costs of a new drug warrant its inclusion on the PBS. In the period 1994 to 1997, the PBAC reviewed 326 major applications. Of these, 182 applications were for new listings on the PBS and 51 were for applications for major changes in indications, conditions of use or prices applying to drugs that were already listed. The remainder were resubmissions or a review of the basis of its pricing negotiations requested by the manufacturers. 
The work of this committee is highly involved and, therefore, it is critical that it comprises people with the necessary experience in interpreting pharmaco-economic analysis and balancing those considerations with other factors, such as clinical need, equity of access, rule of rescue and the total costs to the health care system. The committee's work is not straightforward. Interpreting the data and getting the balance right rests on the committee members possessing the right mix of skills and experience. It is estimated that it takes approximately 18 months for new members to develop that necessary experience. 
Considering the volume of submissions and the complexity of the decisions before the committee, it is very concerning that the government is intending to overhaul the membership of the committee and replace up to six of its members, including its chair, Professor Don Birkett, on 31 December. This, we believe, will create a vacuum on the committee, especially considering no transition arrangements are in place for the new chair. The opposition do not oppose reform in the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee or placing limits on members' terms. However, transition arrangements must be put in place first so the committee's expertise is not lost. Senator Tambling's own report states:  
The introduction of an overall limit that applies to the number of years any one member could serve would ensure that membership was regularly turned over in future. A possible disadvantage of this system is that some highly valuable members could be retired prematurely. Their departure could create a gap in experience and expertise that may be affected during a transitional period until suitable replacements could be found and gain the necessary experience. 
Senator Tambling's final report goes on to state: 
The role of the Chair is particularly important to the PBAC. This is primarily due to the need to show consistency of decision-making over long periods of time. This is accentuated by the inherent comparative nature of the work of the committee. There are significant advantages in these circumstances in having a PBAC Chairman with full working knowledge of the practices of the Committee and as a repository of corporate knowledge as to how the PBAC has tackled similar decisions in the recent past. 
Clearly, Senator Tambling is ignoring the findings of his own report. 
The Australian system of listing drugs for subsidy is recognised as a world leader and, consequently, proposals to alter the committee must be properly considered and not rushed through the parliament. As the former head of the department of health and now Professor of Health Policy at La Trobe University, Professor Stephen Duckett, pointed out on ABC Radio last Friday: 
Australia is a very small country, and the number of people with expertise in pharmaco-economics is very, very limited. So arguments about new blood and so on really just don't make any sense. What they're trying to do is get rid of the people who know what it's all about and who are being very rigorous in the application of the value-for-money principles. 
It is irresponsible for the government to move these amendments to the PBAC without first putting in place those proper transition arrangements. That is why the opposition will move a second reading amendment to adjourn debate on the bill and refer the amendments to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration and report by 28 February 2001. 
These changes to the PBAC need to be properly considered and transition arrangements need to be put in place. The opposition sees no need to rush the government's PBAC amendments through the parliament. Interim arrangements are already in place for the six committee members whose terms expire on 31 December. What the government does need to do is to put in place transition arrangements. These transition arrangements are required for the changes recommended to both the composition of the committee and members' terms. The government would, therefore, be better off, we think, withdrawing its PBAC amendments until those transition arrangements are put in place. 
I will now turn to discussing the primary aim of this bill, and that is to make sure that only eligible people have access to the PBS. The PBS scheme does not currently require a person to prove their eligibility. Concessional patients must produce a health care card, but for the general benefit no proof of eligibility is currently required. It has therefore been difficult for pharmacists to determine the entitlement status of a customer or to recognise doctor shoppers. The desirability of tightening the legislative requirements to enable dispensers to check a customer's eligibility is therefore recognised, provided that this is done in a cost-effective way. 
This bill will require doctors and other prescribers to put the patient's Medicare number on each prescription. This will allow pharmacists to check who is eligible for the PBS and assist the HIC and pharmacists to identify doctor shoppers. When fully implemented, the government will not pay pharmacists unless they have checked the person's Medicare number and expiry date before dispensing the medicines. In addition, if the number is incorrect when compared to the HIC data, pharmacists will be responsible for tracking down the customer in order to correct their Medicare number or obtain the balance of the payment for the pharmaceuticals. The bill permits pharmacists and doctors to retain the Medicare numbers for future use for the same patients but requires them to maintain the privacy of this information. The bill creates various offences for disclosing or misusing Medicare numbers.  
There are a number of groups of people who may not have Medicare cards but who are eligible for pharmaceutical benefits, including people with disabilities in the care of a guardian, people who are itinerant, some Aboriginal people, visitors from overseas countries with which Australia has a bilateral agreement, and a person in an emergency situation or someone who has temporarily lost their card. To make sure that in the implementation of this bill access to subsidised PBS drugs is not denied to these eligible people, the scheme will be required to include a number of exemptions. These exemptions, we think, should be made clear to the parliament before the bill is passed. 
While the opposition supports the aims of this bill, the effectiveness of the measures, I think, is questionable. Under the new scheme, it will not be necessary to have your Medicare card to have a prescription filled. It will only be necessary to quote your family's Medicare number and the expiry date of the card. Agents can still collect a prescription if they also know the Medicare card number or at least can quote the same number as appears on the prescription. This measure will not be effective against doctor shopping if there is no data matching. Doctor shopping involves consumers obtaining large quantities of subsidised drugs for recreational drug use, sale for profit, or sending to friends overseas, by presenting prescriptions from different doctors to different pharmacists for the same drug. This bill may not, therefore, make much impact in either controlling use of the PBS by ineligible people or abuse of the PBS by the doctor shoppers. It is, therefore, doubtful that the bill will save the Commonwealth the large amounts of money claimed. This saving might also be offset by the increased costs incurred by implementing these requirements. 
The opposition's privacy concerns relate to whether the mechanism used in this bill, the public exchange of Medicare numbers, is foreshadowing the government's overall approach to medical records and the development of a unique patient identifier by the Health Insurance Commission. So long as health privacy legislation does not exist, it is premature to be introducing a unique patient identifier, and there is every sign that the Medicare number on people's cards has been effectively used in this way under this bill. There are ways to overcome this problem and make sure that each person can have a unique patient identifier that is confidential and does not appear on the card itself. But this requires a lot more thought than the government has given to this issue so far. 
The second privacy concern is how the government will use this information once it has been collected. The bill is unclear about this issue. There are currently specific Privacy Commissioner guidelines about the use of pharmaceutical data and matching with medical benefits data. During briefings, departmental officials have indicated that the data collected based on Medicare numbers will not be matched against existing MBS and PBS data, but there is nothing in the legislation to stop it. There would be problems with this approach, because there are ambiguities about the numbers on cards, and one cannot be sure who the medicine has been purchased for. This point needs to be clarified, and I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary, in reply, could indicate to the Senate how the rules will operate for collecting data based on Medicare numbers and matching this against other HIC data as allowed for by this legislation. 
These measures are being introduced separately from the legislation planned to implement the Better Medication Management Scheme. The BMMS promises to develop an electronic system for patient medication records that can be accessed by doctors, pharmacists and patients. The government has still not properly explained why it is introducing these two e-health schemes separately. The government is, we believe, creating one unique patient identifier to check a patient's eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and has flagged separate legislation to create another identifier to allow doctors, pharmacists and patients to access medication records as part of the Better Medication Management Scheme. Australians are going to have multiple unique patient identifier numbers, and none of them will be covered by a national health privacy regime.  
Personal health information should not go on line until the rules as to how the information is to be used are properly explained. The transition to electronic health records must be managed sensitively and be accompanied by strong privacy laws. The confusion surrounding unique patient identifiers needs to be cleared up. Government plans for electronic health records and unique patient identifiers need to be very clearly spelt out. As I said at the start, the opposition supports the two primary aims of this bill: to ensure that the subsidised use of pharmaceuticals is available only to those who are eligible and to significantly limit the doctor shopping that is occurring. Whether these measures will have the desired effect, however, is questionable.
Finally, I wish to move a second reading amendment which will address concerns about the need for transitional arrangements and concerns about how the government is proposing to implement changes to pharmaceutical benefits. I understand that that matter will be considered when we resume debate on the bill later today. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		""and that:
	(a)	the amendments to the bill, circulated by the Government on sheet FC259 (REVISED), be referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 February 2001; and
	(b)	further consideration of the bill be postponed till the next sitting day following the presentation of the report mentioned in paragraph (a)"".

Secondly, if the Senate is to accept the explanation that Senator Hill has given, I would ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to indicate that that material would be provided out of session, because it certainly is not reasonable in the circumstances for the Senate to have to wait until sittings commence in the year 2001.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-12-07,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the third evaluation of the National Crime Authority, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RECOM-MENDATIONS FROM THE 3RD EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY BY THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY
The Report from the 3rd Evaluation of the National Crime Authority by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was tabled on 6 April 1998.  The Report makes 30 recommendations relating to the role, function and composition of the National Crime Authority; the reference system; powers and penalties; accountability and parliamentary supervision; and complaints.
The Government wishes to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee for conducting the evaluation of the National Crime Authority.  Both the Government and the Parliamentary Joint Committee are confident in the ongoing capability of the National Crime Authority to continue its role in the fight against organised crime.   
While acknowledging the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee and agreeing with many of its recommendations, the Government is of the belief that some of the issues raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee can be achieved by means other than those proposed.  However, the Government will pursue a number of amendments to National Crime Authority Act 1984 where this is necessary to implement the agreed recommendations.  This will result in a more effective and efficient National Crime Authority. 
The recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, together with the Government's response to each recommendation, are set out below:
Recommendation 1: That the National Crime Authority commence regular reporting on a comprehensive range of performance measures so that the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the community will be better able to assess its performance. (para. 1.129)
The Government is progressing arrangements for improved accountability for Commonwealth departments and agencies generally. It has introduced an accrual budgeting framework and requires government departments and agencies to report on performance indicators and output/outcome measures. All departments and agencies, including the National Crime Authority, have developed performance indicators and output/outcome measures in preparation for this year's budget. 
Recommendation 2: That the National Crime Authority's base funding be urgently increased to ensure its ability to work with maximum effectiveness across the full range of organised crime activity.  (para. 1.182)
The Government is committed to an effective national approach to dealing with organised crime and will continue to support Commonwealth law enforcement agencies appropriately. National Crime Authority funding is a matter for the Government to consider in the budget context. This Government has adopted a supportive approach to the performance of the National Crime Authority. Funds appropriated for the National Crime Authority have included substantial amounts to cover specific projects. Budgets for agencies such as the National Crime Authority generally now comprise one off elements for specific work covering a number of years as well as recurrent funding. 
Recommendation 3: That a clear statement of the role of the National Crime Authority be included in the statute as an objects clause.  (para. 2.119)
The Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the National Crime Authority's role can be further clarified, but this can be done adequately without introduction of an objects clause into the National Crime Authority Act as suggested. The National Crime Authority's role can be expressed in the National Crime Authority Act with clarity and certainty by amendment to existing provisions in the context of the matters raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee in their report.
Recommendation 4: That the area of inquiry of the National Crime Authority reflect that its role is to counter criminal activity which is systematic and complex and which may, but not necessarily, be trans-or multi-jurisdictional.  Where the area of inquiry involves intra-state investigations, such inquiry should only proceed by mutual agreement with the relevant State or Territory and on a fully funded basis. (para. 2.124)
While the National Crime Authority's role is to counter criminal activity that is systematic and may be multi-jurisdictional, there should be delineation between State or Territory police investigations and investigations carried out by the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority was established as a national agency and where it undertakes investigations within one State or Territory, it does so because that investigation has national significance. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth fund such investigations. It should also be noted that the States and Territories make a significant contribution through the secondment of staff. 
Recommendation 5: That the statute be amended to provide that the Inter-Governmental Committee may refer matters for special investigation by the Authority which are framed in broad terms as to the characteristics of the criminality to be investigated.  (para. 3.107)
The framing of references in broader terms is consistent with the decision of the Federal Court that references may be valid without specifying the offenders, the particular conduct, transactions or the time frame. As the High Court refused leave to appeal from that decision, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to make substantial changes to the provisions of the Act dealing with references. 
The reference model is not intended to be used as a basis for a general investigative power. It is the framework under which the National Crime Authority can use the special powers that are not available to police forces with general investigative powers. Each reference, therefore, requires some factual basis to justify the use of the National Crime Authority's special powers to enable the Inter-Govern-mental Committee to make a decision regarding the use of those powers. There is, however, a problem with current time constraints and it is proposed that the National Crime Authority Act be amended to allow the National Crime Authority to investigate related activity occurring after the date of the reference.
Recommendation 6: That, as a check and accountability measure within the system of broadly framed references, the National Crime Authority must first form the opinion that there is a reason to believe that ordinary investigative methods are unlikely to work before it can invoke its special powers.  This incorporation of the `reason to believe' test into the references scheme is subject to the adequacy of the balances for enhanced scrutiny contained in this report.  (para. 3.107)
A ""reason to believe"" test is not required, because under the National Crime Authority Act as it stands, the Inter-Governmental Committee must consider, before approving a reference, whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matter are likely to be effective. Such a test would only be necessary if references were not to be the means of instigating a special investigation. Given the response to recommendation 5, the incorporation of a ""reason to believe"" test, is unnecessary and could leave the Authority open to costly legal claims of dubious merit.
Recommendation 7: That the National Crime Authority itself, not a Director of Public Prosecutions, should make the decision about whether to indemnify a witness who claims self-incrimination.  To protect against improper use of this power, each such decision must be referred immediately for examination by the Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. (para. 4.72)
The Government does not agree with the specific recommendation that the National Crime Authority itself not the Director of Public Prosecution should make indemnification decisions. It is not appropriate that a discretionary power to undertake not to prosecute be given to a law enforcement agency. However, the Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the current arrangements allow witnesses to frustrate the investigation process by refusing to cooperate, including asserting that self incrimination means they cannot answer questions. 
The Government believes that there is an alternative solution to the problem identified by the Parliamentary Joint Committee. Amendments will be sought to the sections of the National Crime Authority Act, which provide for undertakings as to use of incriminating evidence. The proposed amendments will provide automatic immunity from use of self incriminating evidence against the witness. The effect would be that, where a person claimed the privilege, they would still be required to give the evidence but it could not be used in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. However, any evidence identified as a result of that answer (derivative use) would be permitted. The provisions will be consistent with those in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.
Recommendation 8: That no privilege against self-incrimination should attach to summonsed documents.  (para. 4.72)
The Government supports this recommendation and will seek to clarify this provision because the law has changed fundamentally since the introduction of the Act.  The privilege against self-incrimination applies to statements made by the person claiming privilege.  It also applies to documents that the person is required to produce, but only so far as the documents equate with testimonial evidence.  Consistent with the common law, the privilege against self-incrimination would not apply to the fact of the existence of the documents (but immunity would apply to their contents). 
Recommendation 9: That the application of client legal privilege be clarified.  (para. 4.92)
The Government agrees with this recommendation.  Subsection 30(3) of the National Crime Authority Act, which preserves legal professional privilege in relation to questions or requests for documents made to a legal practitioner at a hearing, requires clarification in accordance with the law on legal professional privilege.  It is unnecessary to establish expressly all the circumstances in which legal professional privilege applies.  The provisions need only state that the provisions of the Act do not affect the law relating to legal professional privilege.
It is also proposed to seek repeal of paragraph 29B(2)(e)(i) of the National Crime Authority Act, which provides an exception to the prohibition on disclosure under section 29B for a legal practitioner.  This exception is in addition to a legal professional privilege exception and an exception for the purpose of obtaining legal representation.  Its scope is uncertain and it is anomalous to provide such an exception only to legal practitioners.  A duty arising from a professional relationship such as a contractual or fiduciary obligation of good faith may arise in any professional relationship but no exemption is provided in relation to other professions.
Recommendation 10: That the National Crime Authority should be empowered to issue search warrants in narrowly defined circumstances.  Any decision made by the Authority in relation to an application for a search warrant should be notified to the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority as soon as practicable. (para. 4.106)
The view of the Government is that to allow the National Crime Authority to issue its own search warrants is not appropriate or necessary. It does however, support consideration of a broader approach to the issuing of search warrants (such as the issuing of warrants by magistrates). Any extension of the power of the National Crime Authority in relation to search warrants that extends beyond the powers of police under the Crimes Act 1914 is not supported. 
The Government will also seek to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984 so that search warrants (and arrest warrants under section 31) include an express stipulation of `reasonable force'. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed concern about the absence of this stipulation in arrest warrants.
Recommendation 11: That the penalties for the offence of money laundering be increased.  (para. 4.119)
The Government understands the concern of the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the Courts are issuing some manifestly inadequate penalties for the offence of money laundering but it believes that the determination of appropriate penalty is a matter for the Courts. The Commonwealth money laundering offence in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a penalty of $200,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 20 years or both, for a person who engages in money laundering of greater amounts than $200,000. The Government believes such penalties are sufficient. 
Recommendation 12: That the penalties for non-compliance with the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be increased.  (para. 4.123)
It is proposed to seek amendments to the Act so that: failure to attend when required to do so; failure to attend from day to day; refusing or failing to take an oath or affirmation; refusing to answer a question; refusing or failing to produce a document or thing; and contempt will have the same penalty as lying under oath.  The Act currently provides a fine of up to $22,000 or 5 years imprisonment for making false or misleading statements or, if heard summarily, $2,200 or imprisonment for one year.  Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Act delays the hearing process but, in the absence of greater penalties, there is no incentive to comply.  
In addition to increasing the penalties for the offences listed, the Government also proposes seeking amendments to the Act to give the National Crime Authority a contempt regime.  This regime, which would be broadly based on the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, would enable the National Crime Authority to apply to a Court to have the Court deal with the contempt as if it were contempt of Court.  This amendment will further support the effective and efficient operations of the National Crime Authority.
Recommendation 13: That, pending the passage of the Commonwealth Criminal Code and as a matter of general guidance of what is considered acceptable, the meaning of `reasonable excuse' under sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 should be defined in the Act.  (para. 4.125)
The Government will seek to amend the Act so that Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, which deals with criminal responsibility and contains comprehensive general defences, applies to offences under the Act.  The Government will also seek to remove the `reasonable excuse' defence from the offences in the Act, as the Code will require the proof of any mental element for offences as well as providing appropriate defences.
Recommendation 14: That, given the substantial amendment of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 required to implement the Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations in this report, the Government should rewrite the Act to ensure that Parliament's intentions are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.  (para. 4.143)
The Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations do not affect the greater part of the National Crime Authority Act. However, in accordance with the Government's policy on statute repair, the Act will be examined during the drafting process of the proposed amendments to ensure that its contents are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. 
Recommendation 15: That, without restricting the manner in which the Authority may regulate the conduct of proceedings at a hearing under section 25 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, where the presiding member has permitted a person to attend a hearing who is not a member of the National Crime Authority's staff, witnesses should be so advised and be able to comment.  (para. 4.154)
The Government will seek to have this provision amended as recommended, but not so as to give the witness grounds to refuse the presence of the individual.  
Recommendation 16: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should not also be chair of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board.  (para. 5.46)
The Government intends to initiate a re-examination of this arrangement in the context of the broader issue of Commonwealth law enforcement coordination. 
Recommendation 17: That the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence be recognised in the statute as an advisory body to the National Crime Authority.  (para. 5.52)
Government is considering, in consultation with the States and Territories, the role and functions of the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence (SCOCCI). It is not appropriate that a body such as SCOCCI, which advises a ministerial committee, be recognised in the National Crime Authority Act.
Recommendation 18: That sections 51 and 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be amended to clarify that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has access to all information held by the Authority which is not of a sensitive nature.  (Para. 5.103)
The Government does not agree with this recommendation. It feels that if an appropriate complaints mechanism is created, there is arguably less reason to give the Parliamentary Joint Committee wider access to information. However, the Government does agree that the Parliamentary Joint Committee could be provided with a greater degree of information provided operational sensitivities are protected. Amendments will therefore be proposed to allow the Parliamentary Joint Committee access to information on completed operations and to Ombudsman reports referred to it by the Minister.
Recommendation 19: That an Office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority be created, subject to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, to investigate any aspect of the Authority's operations as may be required.  (para. 5.103)
The Government does not agree with the concept of creating an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority to be subjected to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The National Crime Authority is already under the direction and oversight of the Minister and the Inter Governmental Committee. The notion that a Parliamentary Joint Committee supervises a statutory office would be inappropriate in our system of government. No other Parliamentary Committee has such a role.
Furthermore, the Ombudsman has the role of auditing the interception activities of the AFP and the National Crime Authority under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.  The audit and complaints investigation functions would complement each other, as they do with the AFP. 
The Ombudsman would not be subject to the direction or oversight of the PJC in relation to the investigation of specific complaints, but the PJC would have access to such Ombudsman reports as referred to it by the Minister. 
Recommendation 20: That the Minister be required to table the annual report of the National Crime Authority within 15 sitting days of its receipt.  (para. 5.108)
Currently the Minister must table the annual report within 15 sitting days of its receipt. The inter-governmental nature of the National Crime Authority requires that the report be circulated to members of the Inter-governmental Committee for comment before it is provided to the Minister. This process naturally takes some time but it is essential given the nature of the National Crime Authority.
Recommendation 21: That the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be designated as the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority and be given responsibility for overseeing the operations of the National Crime Authority in respect of complaints made against the actions of all its officers, including seconded police.  (para. 6.57)
The Government does not agree with the concept of an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. However, the Government does agree that what has existed to date is an unsatisfactory system, with complaints to Ministers, the Parliamentary Joint Committee and police complaint bodies, none of which deals with the totality of the issue. The Government supports the establishment of specific procedures for the investigation of complaints against the National Crime Authority but considers that the Ombudsman should undertake this function. 
That office already has jurisdiction in relation to the Australian Federal Police seconded to the Authority. It is also consistent with the systems of complaints against police in the States and Territories and will facilitate consistent processes for dealing with officers the subject of complaints. Some concern has been expressed that the statutory role of the police commissioners responsible for officers seconded to the Authority may not be adequately recognised. It is proposed that in respect of those officers, the Ombudsman be given jurisdiction to examine complaints against the National Crime Authority, with home jurisdictions to determine appropriate disciplinary action.
Recommendation 22: That the proposed Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority present details on the outcome of the examination of complaints in relation to the National Crime Authority in an annual report to Parliament. (para. 6.57)
As outlined in Recommendation 21, the Government intends setting up a complaint mechanism utilising the office of the Ombudsman. The ordinary requirements in relation to reporting by the Ombudsman should apply.
Recommendation 23: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority be a judge.  (para. 7.26)
The Government notes that under the National Crime Authority Act, a judge may be appointed as Chairperson. None of the powers of Members or the Chair are judicial. The National Crime Authority is an investigatory body, not an adjudicatory body. The Parliamentary Joint Committee recommendation arises from its view that the powers of the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should be expanded, but the Government does not agree that there should be a significant increase in those powers. A requirement that a judge chair the National Crime Authority would significantly reduce the number of possible candidates with other qualifications necessary to the position including demonstrated management skills. No change should be made to the current qualifications for the Chairperson.
Recommendation 24: That the provisions of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in relation to the qualifications of Authority Members be retained. (para. 7.26)
The Government agrees with the recommendation. This provides more flexibility for the appointment of persons with necessary skills.
Recommendation 25: That the term of membership of the National Crime Authority be four years, with the option for renewal for a maximum of another four years, subject to satisfactory performance.  (para. 7.47)
The Government proposes to seek amendments to extend the potential maximum term(s) to a total period of 6 years.  This will provide some greater flexibility balanced against the safeguard of terms being capped.  
Recommendation 26: That subject to demonstrating appropriate aptitudes and qualities, a Member should be capable of appointment as Chairperson of the National Crime Authority for four years, subject to the aggregate term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.47)
Under the National Crime Authority Act, there is currently no barrier to a member being appointed as Chairperson, provided that the member is qualified. The Government agrees that it should be possible for a member to be appointed as Chairperson. The aggregate term should be for no more than six years (see recommendation 25). Legislative amendments to achieve this will be proposed.  
Recommendation 27: That the Government present a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal for a review of the remuneration of the Chairperson and Members of the National Crime Authority in recognition of the substantial changes in their responsibilities arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report. (para.  7.47)
The Government does not believe the changes it proposes are sufficient to warrant a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal at this time. 
Recommendation 28: That the statute be amended to provide for the appointment of a number of part-time members, who would each serve a term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.50)
The Government agrees with the need to increase the number of persons who are able to exercise powers under the Act.  However, the Government does not agree that there is a need for part-time members who would differ from the full-time members only in relation to the nature of their appointment.   To enable the National Crime Authority to operate effectively and efficiently, there should be a number of persons who are specifically empowered to conduct hearings on behalf of the National Crime Authority.  It is, therefore, proposed to seek amendments to the Act to allow for the appointment of an unlimited number of hearing officers whose only function would be to conduct hearings for the National Crime Authority.  Such hearing officers would have all the powers, privileges and immunities of the full-time members of the National Crime Authority when they conduct a hearing, but no other function or role.  Hearing officers would increase the investigative capacity of the National Crime Authority and open appointments to qualified persons who could not otherwise accept a full-time appointment. 
The Governor-General on the recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Committee would appoint the hearing officers for a maximum period of six years.  A number of minor administrative amendments governing leave and conflict of interest will be required.
Recommendation 29: That attention should be paid to the geographical distribution of National Crime Authority members, with particular reference to Western Australia.  (para. 7.51)
It is current practice in considering appointments to take account of geographical distribution. The appointment of part-time members should allow for their strategic allocation to ensure that the National Crime Authority maintains an effective national presence.  
Recommendation 30: That the National Crime Authority should employ a small core of staff investigators to complement the existing system of seconded police officers, the emphasis and priorities of this core being a matter for discussion with SCOCCI having regard to the Authority's needs for investigative personnel and the availability of seconded officers.  (para. 7.91)
This is a management issue to be considered in the context of managing and allocating resources to effectively achieve the National Crime Authority's outcomes. There are complex issues involved in this recommendation, especially those regarding the possibility for corruption, which the Parliamentary Joint Committee in its report acknowledges.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Crime Authority Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-12-07,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the third evaluation of the National Crime Authority, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RECOM-MENDATIONS FROM THE 3RD EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY BY THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY
The Report from the 3rd Evaluation of the National Crime Authority by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was tabled on 6 April 1998.  The Report makes 30 recommendations relating to the role, function and composition of the National Crime Authority; the reference system; powers and penalties; accountability and parliamentary supervision; and complaints.
The Government wishes to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee for conducting the evaluation of the National Crime Authority.  Both the Government and the Parliamentary Joint Committee are confident in the ongoing capability of the National Crime Authority to continue its role in the fight against organised crime.   
While acknowledging the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee and agreeing with many of its recommendations, the Government is of the belief that some of the issues raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee can be achieved by means other than those proposed.  However, the Government will pursue a number of amendments to National Crime Authority Act 1984 where this is necessary to implement the agreed recommendations.  This will result in a more effective and efficient National Crime Authority. 
The recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, together with the Government's response to each recommendation, are set out below:
Recommendation 1: That the National Crime Authority commence regular reporting on a comprehensive range of performance measures so that the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the community will be better able to assess its performance. (para. 1.129)
The Government is progressing arrangements for improved accountability for Commonwealth departments and agencies generally. It has introduced an accrual budgeting framework and requires government departments and agencies to report on performance indicators and output/outcome measures. All departments and agencies, including the National Crime Authority, have developed performance indicators and output/outcome measures in preparation for this year's budget. 
Recommendation 2: That the National Crime Authority's base funding be urgently increased to ensure its ability to work with maximum effectiveness across the full range of organised crime activity.  (para. 1.182)
The Government is committed to an effective national approach to dealing with organised crime and will continue to support Commonwealth law enforcement agencies appropriately. National Crime Authority funding is a matter for the Government to consider in the budget context. This Government has adopted a supportive approach to the performance of the National Crime Authority. Funds appropriated for the National Crime Authority have included substantial amounts to cover specific projects. Budgets for agencies such as the National Crime Authority generally now comprise one off elements for specific work covering a number of years as well as recurrent funding. 
Recommendation 3: That a clear statement of the role of the National Crime Authority be included in the statute as an objects clause.  (para. 2.119)
The Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the National Crime Authority's role can be further clarified, but this can be done adequately without introduction of an objects clause into the National Crime Authority Act as suggested. The National Crime Authority's role can be expressed in the National Crime Authority Act with clarity and certainty by amendment to existing provisions in the context of the matters raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee in their report.
Recommendation 4: That the area of inquiry of the National Crime Authority reflect that its role is to counter criminal activity which is systematic and complex and which may, but not necessarily, be trans-or multi-jurisdictional.  Where the area of inquiry involves intra-state investigations, such inquiry should only proceed by mutual agreement with the relevant State or Territory and on a fully funded basis. (para. 2.124)
While the National Crime Authority's role is to counter criminal activity that is systematic and may be multi-jurisdictional, there should be delineation between State or Territory police investigations and investigations carried out by the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority was established as a national agency and where it undertakes investigations within one State or Territory, it does so because that investigation has national significance. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth fund such investigations. It should also be noted that the States and Territories make a significant contribution through the secondment of staff. 
Recommendation 5: That the statute be amended to provide that the Inter-Governmental Committee may refer matters for special investigation by the Authority which are framed in broad terms as to the characteristics of the criminality to be investigated.  (para. 3.107)
The framing of references in broader terms is consistent with the decision of the Federal Court that references may be valid without specifying the offenders, the particular conduct, transactions or the time frame. As the High Court refused leave to appeal from that decision, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to make substantial changes to the provisions of the Act dealing with references. 
The reference model is not intended to be used as a basis for a general investigative power. It is the framework under which the National Crime Authority can use the special powers that are not available to police forces with general investigative powers. Each reference, therefore, requires some factual basis to justify the use of the National Crime Authority's special powers to enable the Inter-Govern-mental Committee to make a decision regarding the use of those powers. There is, however, a problem with current time constraints and it is proposed that the National Crime Authority Act be amended to allow the National Crime Authority to investigate related activity occurring after the date of the reference.
Recommendation 6: That, as a check and accountability measure within the system of broadly framed references, the National Crime Authority must first form the opinion that there is a reason to believe that ordinary investigative methods are unlikely to work before it can invoke its special powers.  This incorporation of the `reason to believe' test into the references scheme is subject to the adequacy of the balances for enhanced scrutiny contained in this report.  (para. 3.107)
A ""reason to believe"" test is not required, because under the National Crime Authority Act as it stands, the Inter-Governmental Committee must consider, before approving a reference, whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matter are likely to be effective. Such a test would only be necessary if references were not to be the means of instigating a special investigation. Given the response to recommendation 5, the incorporation of a ""reason to believe"" test, is unnecessary and could leave the Authority open to costly legal claims of dubious merit.
Recommendation 7: That the National Crime Authority itself, not a Director of Public Prosecutions, should make the decision about whether to indemnify a witness who claims self-incrimination.  To protect against improper use of this power, each such decision must be referred immediately for examination by the Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. (para. 4.72)
The Government does not agree with the specific recommendation that the National Crime Authority itself not the Director of Public Prosecution should make indemnification decisions. It is not appropriate that a discretionary power to undertake not to prosecute be given to a law enforcement agency. However, the Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the current arrangements allow witnesses to frustrate the investigation process by refusing to cooperate, including asserting that self incrimination means they cannot answer questions. 
The Government believes that there is an alternative solution to the problem identified by the Parliamentary Joint Committee. Amendments will be sought to the sections of the National Crime Authority Act, which provide for undertakings as to use of incriminating evidence. The proposed amendments will provide automatic immunity from use of self incriminating evidence against the witness. The effect would be that, where a person claimed the privilege, they would still be required to give the evidence but it could not be used in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. However, any evidence identified as a result of that answer (derivative use) would be permitted. The provisions will be consistent with those in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.
Recommendation 8: That no privilege against self-incrimination should attach to summonsed documents.  (para. 4.72)
The Government supports this recommendation and will seek to clarify this provision because the law has changed fundamentally since the introduction of the Act.  The privilege against self-incrimination applies to statements made by the person claiming privilege.  It also applies to documents that the person is required to produce, but only so far as the documents equate with testimonial evidence.  Consistent with the common law, the privilege against self-incrimination would not apply to the fact of the existence of the documents (but immunity would apply to their contents). 
Recommendation 9: That the application of client legal privilege be clarified.  (para. 4.92)
The Government agrees with this recommendation.  Subsection 30(3) of the National Crime Authority Act, which preserves legal professional privilege in relation to questions or requests for documents made to a legal practitioner at a hearing, requires clarification in accordance with the law on legal professional privilege.  It is unnecessary to establish expressly all the circumstances in which legal professional privilege applies.  The provisions need only state that the provisions of the Act do not affect the law relating to legal professional privilege.
It is also proposed to seek repeal of paragraph 29B(2)(e)(i) of the National Crime Authority Act, which provides an exception to the prohibition on disclosure under section 29B for a legal practitioner.  This exception is in addition to a legal professional privilege exception and an exception for the purpose of obtaining legal representation.  Its scope is uncertain and it is anomalous to provide such an exception only to legal practitioners.  A duty arising from a professional relationship such as a contractual or fiduciary obligation of good faith may arise in any professional relationship but no exemption is provided in relation to other professions.
Recommendation 10: That the National Crime Authority should be empowered to issue search warrants in narrowly defined circumstances.  Any decision made by the Authority in relation to an application for a search warrant should be notified to the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority as soon as practicable. (para. 4.106)
The view of the Government is that to allow the National Crime Authority to issue its own search warrants is not appropriate or necessary. It does however, support consideration of a broader approach to the issuing of search warrants (such as the issuing of warrants by magistrates). Any extension of the power of the National Crime Authority in relation to search warrants that extends beyond the powers of police under the Crimes Act 1914 is not supported. 
The Government will also seek to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984 so that search warrants (and arrest warrants under section 31) include an express stipulation of `reasonable force'. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed concern about the absence of this stipulation in arrest warrants.
Recommendation 11: That the penalties for the offence of money laundering be increased.  (para. 4.119)
The Government understands the concern of the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the Courts are issuing some manifestly inadequate penalties for the offence of money laundering but it believes that the determination of appropriate penalty is a matter for the Courts. The Commonwealth money laundering offence in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a penalty of $200,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 20 years or both, for a person who engages in money laundering of greater amounts than $200,000. The Government believes such penalties are sufficient. 
Recommendation 12: That the penalties for non-compliance with the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be increased.  (para. 4.123)
It is proposed to seek amendments to the Act so that: failure to attend when required to do so; failure to attend from day to day; refusing or failing to take an oath or affirmation; refusing to answer a question; refusing or failing to produce a document or thing; and contempt will have the same penalty as lying under oath.  The Act currently provides a fine of up to $22,000 or 5 years imprisonment for making false or misleading statements or, if heard summarily, $2,200 or imprisonment for one year.  Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Act delays the hearing process but, in the absence of greater penalties, there is no incentive to comply.  
In addition to increasing the penalties for the offences listed, the Government also proposes seeking amendments to the Act to give the National Crime Authority a contempt regime.  This regime, which would be broadly based on the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, would enable the National Crime Authority to apply to a Court to have the Court deal with the contempt as if it were contempt of Court.  This amendment will further support the effective and efficient operations of the National Crime Authority.
Recommendation 13: That, pending the passage of the Commonwealth Criminal Code and as a matter of general guidance of what is considered acceptable, the meaning of `reasonable excuse' under sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 should be defined in the Act.  (para. 4.125)
The Government will seek to amend the Act so that Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, which deals with criminal responsibility and contains comprehensive general defences, applies to offences under the Act.  The Government will also seek to remove the `reasonable excuse' defence from the offences in the Act, as the Code will require the proof of any mental element for offences as well as providing appropriate defences.
Recommendation 14: That, given the substantial amendment of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 required to implement the Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations in this report, the Government should rewrite the Act to ensure that Parliament's intentions are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.  (para. 4.143)
The Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations do not affect the greater part of the National Crime Authority Act. However, in accordance with the Government's policy on statute repair, the Act will be examined during the drafting process of the proposed amendments to ensure that its contents are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. 
Recommendation 15: That, without restricting the manner in which the Authority may regulate the conduct of proceedings at a hearing under section 25 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, where the presiding member has permitted a person to attend a hearing who is not a member of the National Crime Authority's staff, witnesses should be so advised and be able to comment.  (para. 4.154)
The Government will seek to have this provision amended as recommended, but not so as to give the witness grounds to refuse the presence of the individual.  
Recommendation 16: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should not also be chair of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board.  (para. 5.46)
The Government intends to initiate a re-examination of this arrangement in the context of the broader issue of Commonwealth law enforcement coordination. 
Recommendation 17: That the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence be recognised in the statute as an advisory body to the National Crime Authority.  (para. 5.52)
Government is considering, in consultation with the States and Territories, the role and functions of the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence (SCOCCI). It is not appropriate that a body such as SCOCCI, which advises a ministerial committee, be recognised in the National Crime Authority Act.
Recommendation 18: That sections 51 and 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be amended to clarify that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has access to all information held by the Authority which is not of a sensitive nature.  (Para. 5.103)
The Government does not agree with this recommendation. It feels that if an appropriate complaints mechanism is created, there is arguably less reason to give the Parliamentary Joint Committee wider access to information. However, the Government does agree that the Parliamentary Joint Committee could be provided with a greater degree of information provided operational sensitivities are protected. Amendments will therefore be proposed to allow the Parliamentary Joint Committee access to information on completed operations and to Ombudsman reports referred to it by the Minister.
Recommendation 19: That an Office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority be created, subject to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, to investigate any aspect of the Authority's operations as may be required.  (para. 5.103)
The Government does not agree with the concept of creating an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority to be subjected to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The National Crime Authority is already under the direction and oversight of the Minister and the Inter Governmental Committee. The notion that a Parliamentary Joint Committee supervises a statutory office would be inappropriate in our system of government. No other Parliamentary Committee has such a role.
Furthermore, the Ombudsman has the role of auditing the interception activities of the AFP and the National Crime Authority under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.  The audit and complaints investigation functions would complement each other, as they do with the AFP. 
The Ombudsman would not be subject to the direction or oversight of the PJC in relation to the investigation of specific complaints, but the PJC would have access to such Ombudsman reports as referred to it by the Minister. 
Recommendation 20: That the Minister be required to table the annual report of the National Crime Authority within 15 sitting days of its receipt.  (para. 5.108)
Currently the Minister must table the annual report within 15 sitting days of its receipt. The inter-governmental nature of the National Crime Authority requires that the report be circulated to members of the Inter-governmental Committee for comment before it is provided to the Minister. This process naturally takes some time but it is essential given the nature of the National Crime Authority.
Recommendation 21: That the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be designated as the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority and be given responsibility for overseeing the operations of the National Crime Authority in respect of complaints made against the actions of all its officers, including seconded police.  (para. 6.57)
The Government does not agree with the concept of an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. However, the Government does agree that what has existed to date is an unsatisfactory system, with complaints to Ministers, the Parliamentary Joint Committee and police complaint bodies, none of which deals with the totality of the issue. The Government supports the establishment of specific procedures for the investigation of complaints against the National Crime Authority but considers that the Ombudsman should undertake this function. 
That office already has jurisdiction in relation to the Australian Federal Police seconded to the Authority. It is also consistent with the systems of complaints against police in the States and Territories and will facilitate consistent processes for dealing with officers the subject of complaints. Some concern has been expressed that the statutory role of the police commissioners responsible for officers seconded to the Authority may not be adequately recognised. It is proposed that in respect of those officers, the Ombudsman be given jurisdiction to examine complaints against the National Crime Authority, with home jurisdictions to determine appropriate disciplinary action.
Recommendation 22: That the proposed Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority present details on the outcome of the examination of complaints in relation to the National Crime Authority in an annual report to Parliament. (para. 6.57)
As outlined in Recommendation 21, the Government intends setting up a complaint mechanism utilising the office of the Ombudsman. The ordinary requirements in relation to reporting by the Ombudsman should apply.
Recommendation 23: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority be a judge.  (para. 7.26)
The Government notes that under the National Crime Authority Act, a judge may be appointed as Chairperson. None of the powers of Members or the Chair are judicial. The National Crime Authority is an investigatory body, not an adjudicatory body. The Parliamentary Joint Committee recommendation arises from its view that the powers of the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should be expanded, but the Government does not agree that there should be a significant increase in those powers. A requirement that a judge chair the National Crime Authority would significantly reduce the number of possible candidates with other qualifications necessary to the position including demonstrated management skills. No change should be made to the current qualifications for the Chairperson.
Recommendation 24: That the provisions of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in relation to the qualifications of Authority Members be retained. (para. 7.26)
The Government agrees with the recommendation. This provides more flexibility for the appointment of persons with necessary skills.
Recommendation 25: That the term of membership of the National Crime Authority be four years, with the option for renewal for a maximum of another four years, subject to satisfactory performance.  (para. 7.47)
The Government proposes to seek amendments to extend the potential maximum term(s) to a total period of 6 years.  This will provide some greater flexibility balanced against the safeguard of terms being capped.  
Recommendation 26: That subject to demonstrating appropriate aptitudes and qualities, a Member should be capable of appointment as Chairperson of the National Crime Authority for four years, subject to the aggregate term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.47)
Under the National Crime Authority Act, there is currently no barrier to a member being appointed as Chairperson, provided that the member is qualified. The Government agrees that it should be possible for a member to be appointed as Chairperson. The aggregate term should be for no more than six years (see recommendation 25). Legislative amendments to achieve this will be proposed.  
Recommendation 27: That the Government present a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal for a review of the remuneration of the Chairperson and Members of the National Crime Authority in recognition of the substantial changes in their responsibilities arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report. (para.  7.47)
The Government does not believe the changes it proposes are sufficient to warrant a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal at this time. 
Recommendation 28: That the statute be amended to provide for the appointment of a number of part-time members, who would each serve a term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.50)
The Government agrees with the need to increase the number of persons who are able to exercise powers under the Act.  However, the Government does not agree that there is a need for part-time members who would differ from the full-time members only in relation to the nature of their appointment.   To enable the National Crime Authority to operate effectively and efficiently, there should be a number of persons who are specifically empowered to conduct hearings on behalf of the National Crime Authority.  It is, therefore, proposed to seek amendments to the Act to allow for the appointment of an unlimited number of hearing officers whose only function would be to conduct hearings for the National Crime Authority.  Such hearing officers would have all the powers, privileges and immunities of the full-time members of the National Crime Authority when they conduct a hearing, but no other function or role.  Hearing officers would increase the investigative capacity of the National Crime Authority and open appointments to qualified persons who could not otherwise accept a full-time appointment. 
The Governor-General on the recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Committee would appoint the hearing officers for a maximum period of six years.  A number of minor administrative amendments governing leave and conflict of interest will be required.
Recommendation 29: That attention should be paid to the geographical distribution of National Crime Authority members, with particular reference to Western Australia.  (para. 7.51)
It is current practice in considering appointments to take account of geographical distribution. The appointment of part-time members should allow for their strategic allocation to ensure that the National Crime Authority maintains an effective national presence.  
Recommendation 30: That the National Crime Authority should employ a small core of staff investigators to complement the existing system of seconded police officers, the emphasis and priorities of this core being a matter for discussion with SCOCCI having regard to the Authority's needs for investigative personnel and the availability of seconded officers.  (para. 7.91)
This is a management issue to be considered in the context of managing and allocating resources to effectively achieve the National Crime Authority's outcomes. There are complex issues involved in this recommendation, especially those regarding the possibility for corruption, which the Parliamentary Joint Committee in its report acknowledges.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,27,2

EAST TIMOR INQUIRY
I present the final report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on East Timor.
On 30 September 1999, the Committee had presented an interim report to the Senate following the massive violence and destruction that took place in East Timor in early September 1999 and the subsequent deployment of the Australian-led Interfet force under a United Nations mandate.
Although the pro-integrationist militias are still creating some security problems for the United Nations transitional authority (UNTAET) in East Timor, and there is still no final resolution to the refugee problem in West Timor, considerable progress has been made towards rebuilding East Timorese society and government.  It has been, of course, a slow process and there is still much to do.
There is much more to building a new state than just replacing the buildings and infrastructure destroyed during the militia rampage after the popular consultation on 30 August 1999.  
Four hundred years of Portuguese colonialism and 25 years of repressive Indonesian military rule left East Timor with a largely uneducated population, an impoverished economy, considerable health problems and with no experience of a system of government based on the rule of law.
East Timor is going to need foreign help in many areas, both financial and expertise, for a long time until the East Timorese can be trained to take over all the functions of running a modern state.   
The Committee believes that it is in Australia's interest for East Timor to become a viable nation; one that does not remain a mendicant state and one that can play a constructive role in regional affairs. 
Timor Gap Treaty
An important source of income for East Timor will be the royalties arising from the commercial production of oil and gas in the Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation A.  The Timor Gap Treaty, which was negotiated between Australia and Indonesia, provides for a 50:50 split between Australia and East Timor (which replaces Indonesia) in Zone A. The East Timorese are seeking a greater share of the royalties under the Treaty.  Australia and UNTAET, which is acting for East Timor under its United Nations mandate, are currently re-negotiating royalties under the Treaty.
The Committee believes that Australia should act generously towards East Timor to provide it with the means by which it can develop a society and economy in keeping with the region. The revenues from oil and gas royalties would inevitably become the cornerstone of its future economic and social development.
The Committee has recommended that, in its negotiations with UNTAET on the future of the Timor Gap Treaty, the Australian Government should take into account current international law in relation to seabed boundaries, the history of our relations with the East Timorese people, the need to develop good bilateral relations with East Timor and the need for East Timor to have sources of income that might reduce dependency on foreign aid.
Human Rights Abuses in East Timor
The East Timorese people have suffered gross human rights abuse at the hands of the Indonesian military and militias throughout the period of Indonesian rule.  The massive violence and destruction of property that occurred after the 30 August 1999 ballot drew international support for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the perpetrators of the violence.  Indonesia objected to international interference into what it regarded as its sovereign responsibility and has been carrying out investigations of it own.
The Committee believes that justice should prevail, whether it is carried out by Indonesia, East Timor or by an international tribunal. Given the difficulties of getting hold of Indonesian suspects residing in Indonesia, it is preferable to let justice take its course through the Indonesian justice system. If, on completion of that process, the international community remained dissatisfied with the outcome, it should press for the establishment of an international tribunal to instigate its own proceedings against alleged perpetrators of the violence.
Australian policy towards East Timor
As required by its terms of reference, the Committee examined Australian policy towards East Timor, mainly from about 1974 onwards. However, as made clear at the beginning of the inquiry, the Committee did not examine the matter of the deaths of five Australian and British journalists at Balibo in October 1975.
It is easy to understand why many people thought that incorporation into Indonesia was the best solution for Portuguese Timor in 1975. The Portuguese had not prepared the Timorese for independence, the economy very small and most Timorese outside Dili and the larger towns were subsistence farmers. Timor would have been very dependent on foreign aid for a long time. Moreover, Apodeti members preferred some association with Indonesia while the two main parties, Fretilin and UDT fought a bloody civil war. The left-leaning Fretilin was of great security concern to Indonesia, which was very anti-communist, in case Fretilin attracted external communist involvement and support. Internationally, there was support of incorporation of Portuguese Timor into Indonesia. 
It is always difficult, even in hindsight, to establish whether a different policy approach would have achieved a significantly different outcome. It is clear that Ministers and public servants generally agreed that Portuguese Timor should have been incorporated into Indonesia.
Mr Whitlam appeared, particularly in 1974, to take the view that the outcome was more important than the process. His comment to officers that `I am in favour of incorporation but obeisance is to be made to self-determination' supports that view. This approach was watered down to some extent in early 1975. Others, such as Senator Don Willesee, consistently gave greater emphasis to the process of self-determination than the outcome.
Through the whole period from April 1974 to the fall of the Whitlam government in November 1975, not once was the future of Portuguese Timor referred to Cabinet for consideration. 
At the time of the Yogyakarta meeting in September 1974, it appears that President Soeharto was still diffident about incorporating Portuguese Timor in Indonesia. 
A strong Australian position in favour of self-determination might have bolstered the non-interventionist element in the Soeharto administration as opposed to military elements that supported Indonesian action to effect incorporation.  
Even if that happened, there was no guarantee that the non-interventionist position could have withstood the events of 1975 in Portuguese Timor, that is, Fretilin and UDT calling for independence and the civil war between the two, as well as allegations of communist sympathies on the part of Fretilin. 
When, on 17 August 1975, the Australian Ambassador to Jakarta, Mr Woolcott, sent his oft-quoted cable to Canberra arguing in favour of pragmatism rather than principle, it was probably too late for Australia to have changed the course of events. 
East Timor has been a thorn in the side of Australia's relationship with Indonesia since incorporation. 
Ever since the mid-1970s, there has been a thread running through East Timor policies of Australian Governments of all political persuasions: that greater emphasis should be placed on relations with Indonesia at the expense of East Timor. 
Until the latter part of 1999, all governments have publicly played down reports of human rights abuses in the territory. They were prepared to accept Indonesian Government assurances and explanations at face value, and support them, even in the face of contradictory evidence. 
The East Timorese people, having been colonised by the Portuguese, had a different heritage to the rest of the Indonesian people. Having had a taste of freedom in 1975, they were not prepared to accept Indonesian rule and, hence, their prolonged resistance. The brutal military regime that controlled East Timor over the next 25 years only served to reinforce their desire to throw off the Indonesian yoke. 
Once almost 80 per cent of East Timorese cast their votes for independence, despite severe intimidation by pro-Indonesian militias, aided and abetted by the Indonesian military, the TNI, that act of self-determination rendered continued Indonesian control of East Timor unsustainable. 
The subsequent horrendous violence and destruction wreaked on East Timor by the militias and the TNI made international military intervention an inevitable and pressing requirement. 
The denial of self-determination to the East Timorese people in 1975 has now been rectified, albeit at a huge cost for both the East Timorese people and Indonesia. 
Ironically, when, ultimately, Australia was forced by circumstances to change its policy towards East Timor, it was blamed by Indonesia for its loss of East Timor, resulting in a downgrading of the bilateral relationship, which Australia's earlier disingenuous policy towards the territory had been aimed at propping up.
Defence Co-operation with Indonesia
On 10 September 1999, the Government announced a review of the defence relationship with Indonesia because of the events in Indonesia, as a result of which there was a significant scaling back across a wide range of activity.  However, some staff college level exchanges and educational activities continued.
As it was the Indonesian military that sponsored the violence that occurred in September 1999, and had earlier been responsible for the many human rights abuses perpetrated over 25 years of Indonesian rule of East Timor, the question of defence co-operation became a sensitive issue in the inquiry.
The Committee believes that Australia has the capacity to assist the TNI become a professional force but until there is a clear indication that the TNI is prepared to move in that direction, Australia should not countenance renewing the defence co-operation program. 
The Committee believes that before any additional defence co-operation measures are undertaken there must be a resolution of the refugee problem in West Timor and the neutralisation of the East Timorese militias, including prevention of their incursions into East Timor. 
There must also be clear evidence that the TNI is dismantling the territorial command structure throughout Indonesia and that it is becoming a professional defence force rather than mainly an internal security force. 
It has been the territorial command structure that has given the TNI the power to meddle in domestic matters both nationally and right down to village levels, and given rise to gross human rights abuses perpetrated in East Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. 
As Indonesia now has a democratic system, albeit in a fragile state, it would be anathema for Australia to support the TNI or any other element in Indonesia not working to strengthen democracy. 
Relations with Indonesia
Undoubtedly, Australia's role in East Timor's independence has had a deleterious effect on relations between Australia and Indonesia. Some Indonesians still blame Australia for the loss of East Timor. Relations with Indonesia have remained strained.   
As close neighbours, the Committee believes, and re-affirms, that it is in the long-term interests of both Australia and Indonesia to develop a strong and enduring relationship. However, there is little point in being precipitate in trying to form a new relationship until there is a readiness on both sides to embrace one. Given Indonesia's loss of East Timor and the enormity of the political changes that have occurred since the downfall of President Soeharto, it is not surprising that there are many uncertainties in Indonesia at the moment. These domestic tensions have not been conducive to rebuilding relations with Australia. However, in time, the mutuality of interests should bring about a rapprochement in relations.
As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade pointed out during the inquiry, not all levels of the relationship have suffered the significant downturn experienced at the political level. The Department should continue to shore up support at these working levels as a basis for improving political relations in due course. It should also try to maintain trade and people-to-people contacts between the two countries.
The Australian Government and Parliament need to keep in touch with public opinion across the spectrum of Indonesian society. In the Committee's Interim Report of 30 September 1999, the Committee recommended a visit to Indonesia by an Australian parliamentary delegation to discuss issues of importance to both sides with Indonesian parliamentarians. Such a visit has not yet taken place. The Committee reiterates its call for such a visit and recommends that overtures be made to the Indonesian Parliament to seek their agreement to it.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I joined the committee late in relation to this inquiry into East Timor. I want to refer particularly to chapter 6 of the report, which essentially deals with the period of the Whitlam government and the Whitlam government's dealings on East Timor with Indonesia and our other allies. In some circles in Australia, former Prime Minister Whitlam has been often accused unfairly of being a willing and compliant collaborator with the Indonesian government when East Timor was invaded in December 1975. As you and I know, Madam Deputy President, Mr Whitlam has denied strenuously in print and in person before the committee that he gave a green light for the Indonesians to proceed. Mr Whitlam maintained, and provided evidence of the fact, that he had publicly and privately communicated to the Indonesian government that he was, as his government was, in favour of self-determination for the people of then Portuguese Timor.
I might say, for the purposes of historical perspective, that it was a very worrying time throughout the world, particularly for people of a social democratic point of view. During the period Mr Whitlam was in power, we saw in a number of areas in the world an increase in the victories of people from the extreme left. It was with a great deal of concern that people observed the goings on in other parts of the world. In Portugal itself, which had been for some decades under a fascist dictatorship, a combination of socialists and communists came to power via certain young army officers. At that same time as the Spinola government was deposed, the situation was inevitably starting to deteriorate in East Timor. I might add that Mr Whitlam made a speech to the United Nations in September 1974 in which he declared his desire to see the end of Portuguese colonialism. It was not long after that that the new Portuguese foreign minister met with Mr Suharto in Jakarta and expressed—and this is a socialist foreign minister—to the Indonesians at that meeting that in fact East Timor should be incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia. It was at the same time that the North Vietnamese politburo decided to breach its peace accord and invade South Vietnam.
Whilst this situation was occurring in our region, our government, Mr Whitlam in particular, was trying to ensure that the ALP's policy of self-determination was directly, publicly and privately, communicated to the Indonesian government. As we know from history, in January 1975 the independence parties of UDT and Fretilin formed a coalition, which deteriorated later in the year. It broke down and a full-scale civil war began in August of that year. The Fretilin movement was aided by the fact that, when the Portuguese authorities left Dili and went to a ship offshore, they left behind thousands of guns and other bits of ammunition so that the movement would be able to have some advantage over the other parties in at least the prosecution of this civil war. 
I recall at the time being concerned, as were many Australians, that, with the developments that were occurring in the world, we might have been witnessing on our own shores another Cuba. It was with that concern that former Prime Minister Whitlam conducted our foreign policy, seeking to make sure that our allies were up to date on the expression of our views. I was not then and am not now a fan of Fretilin. I am very suspicious of them, and I will continue to be suspicious of them until such time as I think their motives can be, at least historically, flushed out.
I do not want to say too much more on the report. It was a comprehensive report that the officers of the committee put themselves tirelessly to the task of preparing. All I will say in conclusion is that there was at the time a great deal of chaos and instability, not only in our region but also in Lisbon, which led to the December 1975 invasion by Indonesia. There was a lot of political instability in our own country, as we recall. I believe—and Mr Whitlam still testifies to this—that Mr Whitlam conducted himself with great honour and great diligence as our Prime Minister, and I believe that he is wrongly vilified by certain sections of the community for what they see as his attitude to that terrible period for Australian foreign policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

As it was the Indonesian military that sponsored the violence that occurred in September 1999, and had earlier been responsible for the many human rights abuses perpetrated over 25 years of Indonesian rule of East Timor, the question of defence co-operation became a sensitive issue in the inquiry.
The Committee believes that Australia has the capacity to assist the TNI become a professional force but until there is a clear indication that the TNI is prepared to move in that direction, Australia should not countenance renewing the defence co-operation program. 
The Committee believes that before any additional defence co-operation measures are undertaken there must be a resolution of the refugee problem in West Timor and the neutralisation of the East Timorese militias, including prevention of their incursions into East Timor. 
There must also be clear evidence that the TNI is dismantling the territorial command structure throughout Indonesia and that it is becoming a professional defence force rather than mainly an internal security force. 
It has been the territorial command structure that has given the TNI the power to meddle in domestic matters both nationally and right down to village levels, and given rise to gross human rights abuses perpetrated in East Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. 
As Indonesia now has a democratic system, albeit in a fragile state, it would be anathema for Australia to support the TNI or any other element in Indonesia not working to strengthen democracy. 
Relations with Indonesia
Undoubtedly, Australia's role in East Timor's independence has had a deleterious effect on relations between Australia and Indonesia. Some Indonesians still blame Australia for the loss of East Timor. Relations with Indonesia have remained strained.   
As close neighbours, the Committee believes, and re-affirms, that it is in the long-term interests of both Australia and Indonesia to develop a strong and enduring relationship. However, there is little point in being precipitate in trying to form a new relationship until there is a readiness on both sides to embrace one. Given Indonesia's loss of East Timor and the enormity of the political changes that have occurred since the downfall of President Soeharto, it is not surprising that there are many uncertainties in Indonesia at the moment. These domestic tensions have not been conducive to rebuilding relations with Australia. However, in time, the mutuality of interests should bring about a rapprochement in relations.
As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade pointed out during the inquiry, not all levels of the relationship have suffered the significant downturn experienced at the political level. The Department should continue to shore up support at these working levels as a basis for improving political relations in due course. It should also try to maintain trade and people-to-people contacts between the two countries.
The Australian Government and Parliament need to keep in touch with public opinion across the spectrum of Indonesian society. In the Committee's Interim Report of 30 September 1999, the Committee recommended a visit to Indonesia by an Australian parliamentary delegation to discuss issues of importance to both sides with Indonesian parliamentarians. Such a visit has not yet taken place. The Committee reiterates its call for such a visit and recommends that overtures be made to the Indonesian Parliament to seek their agreement to it.
I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,35,2
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I joined the committee late in relation to this inquiry into East Timor. I want to refer particularly to chapter 6 of the report, which essentially deals with the period of the Whitlam government and the Whitlam government's dealings on East Timor with Indonesia and our other allies. In some circles in Australia, former Prime Minister Whitlam has been often accused unfairly of being a willing and compliant collaborator with the Indonesian government when East Timor was invaded in December 1975. As you and I know, Madam Deputy President, Mr Whitlam has denied strenuously in print and in person before the committee that he gave a green light for the Indonesians to proceed. Mr Whitlam maintained, and provided evidence of the fact, that he had publicly and privately communicated to the Indonesian government that he was, as his government was, in favour of self-determination for the people of then Portuguese Timor.
I might say, for the purposes of historical perspective, that it was a very worrying time throughout the world, particularly for people of a social democratic point of view. During the period Mr Whitlam was in power, we saw in a number of areas in the world an increase in the victories of people from the extreme left. It was with a great deal of concern that people observed the goings on in other parts of the world. In Portugal itself, which had been for some decades under a fascist dictatorship, a combination of socialists and communists came to power via certain young army officers. At that same time as the Spinola government was deposed, the situation was inevitably starting to deteriorate in East Timor. I might add that Mr Whitlam made a speech to the United Nations in September 1974 in which he declared his desire to see the end of Portuguese colonialism. It was not long after that that the new Portuguese foreign minister met with Mr Suharto in Jakarta and expressed—and this is a socialist foreign minister—to the Indonesians at that meeting that in fact East Timor should be incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia. It was at the same time that the North Vietnamese politburo decided to breach its peace accord and invade South Vietnam.
Whilst this situation was occurring in our region, our government, Mr Whitlam in particular, was trying to ensure that the ALP's policy of self-determination was directly, publicly and privately, communicated to the Indonesian government. As we know from history, in January 1975 the independence parties of UDT and Fretilin formed a coalition, which deteriorated later in the year. It broke down and a full-scale civil war began in August of that year. The Fretilin movement was aided by the fact that, when the Portuguese authorities left Dili and went to a ship offshore, they left behind thousands of guns and other bits of ammunition so that the movement would be able to have some advantage over the other parties in at least the prosecution of this civil war. 
I recall at the time being concerned, as were many Australians, that, with the developments that were occurring in the world, we might have been witnessing on our own shores another Cuba. It was with that concern that former Prime Minister Whitlam conducted our foreign policy, seeking to make sure that our allies were up to date on the expression of our views. I was not then and am not now a fan of Fretilin. I am very suspicious of them, and I will continue to be suspicious of them until such time as I think their motives can be, at least historically, flushed out.
I do not want to say too much more on the report. It was a comprehensive report that the officers of the committee put themselves tirelessly to the task of preparing. All I will say in conclusion is that there was at the time a great deal of chaos and instability, not only in our region but also in Lisbon, which led to the December 1975 invasion by Indonesia. There was a lot of political instability in our own country, as we recall. I believe—and Mr Whitlam still testifies to this—that Mr Whitlam conducted himself with great honour and great diligence as our Prime Minister, and I believe that he is wrongly vilified by certain sections of the community for what they see as his attitude to that terrible period for Australian foreign policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-12-07,"—by leave—I table and present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Brazil and Argentina, which took place from 15 to 29 October 2000. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The document read as follows—
The Delegation's visit to Brazil and Argentina could best be summed up as one of opportunity: The potential for trade, investment and tourism with these countries is enormous.
Overview comments
The visit followed a report by the Trade Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on building Australia's trade and investment relationship with South America tabled in September. The Sub-Committee had also visited Brazil and Argentina as part of visit to South America earlier in the year. Their report provided a focus for the Delegation who was able to progress issues by reinforcing findings and emphasising recommendations during its meetings.
The Delegation found that an important issue in the relationship between Australia and Brazil and Argentina is simply a need for greater awareness of the respective regions and their potential.
Brazil and Argentina have not previously been an area of great focus - Both our regions have looked more to Europe and North America, and in Australia's case recently to Asia. We must now also look across the Pacific.
Australia's profile benefited greatly by the success of the Olympic Games. Complimentary comments relating to the Olympics were constantly made to the Delegation in both countries. The Delegation believes that the value of the Olympics in raising awareness of Australia can not be under-estimated and provides a window of opportunity that must not be missed for realising trade and investment potential and maximising tourism potential.
The Delegation was able to gain an insight into the economic and political situation in both countries. Economic recovery is occurring after the recession of the late 1990's, with Brazil particularly surging ahead. Significant economic restructuring has been occurring during the 1990s and governments in both countries have introduced strong fiscal measures.
Politically, constitutional democracy is now well entrenched in both countries. Argentina voted for a change of government in 1999 and while it currently is undergoing some political disputation, events are easily being controlled within the democratic system. In early October, Brazil held nationwide local government elections with a massive turnout of voters.
Meetings with key governmental figures
The Delegation had the honour of meeting with Vice-President Maciel in Brazil and Acting President Losada in Argentina, with Ministers and many Senators and Deputies from each Congress. The enthusiasm with which the Delegation was received and the constructive dialogue at these meetings has contributed significantly in developing and strengthening the links between our respective Parliaments and the bilateral relationship with each country.
Many issues were discussed at the various meetings with these key governmental figures and these are outlined in detail in the Delegation's report. They included benefits of exchanges - particularly in parliamentary, educational, scientific and business areas; trade and investment; foreign relations and multilateral issues; agriculture and mining.
In Argentina, the Delegation also had the opportunity of raising a number of finance and taxation issues with Ministers and Committees of Congress that were causing concern for a number of Australian companies. The companies had discussed these concerns with the Delegation at earlier meetings.
Trade and Investment opportunity
Trade and investment opportunities in Brazil and Argentina abound. At virtually every meeting and inspection the Delegation was able to discuss an area of opportunity and the mutual benefits that could accrue. Areas of immediate potential arising from the Delegation's meetings and discussions include:
·	mining exploration and development,
·	oil and gas especially from significant recent privatisation,
·	agribusiness in many fields is receptive to new and innovative technologies,
·	information technology and telecommunications,
·	education services especially in tertiary, postgraduate and distance education, and 
aquaculture and viticulture.
These, together with other areas of opportunity, are also discussed in detail in the report.
Tourism offers huge potential, especially with Qantas commencing direct return flights to Buenos Aires in 1998. Tourism is very much a two-way thing with numbers coming from Brazil increasing significantly in recent years. The Delegation attended a joint Australian and New Zealand tourism promotion that showcased the potential on this side of the Pacific.
Particular highlights of the visit
The Delegation's program for the visit was both interesting and diverse, allowing it to gain a broad insight into a wide range of activities, including:
·	Seeing and understanding the electronic voting system operative in Brazil. The system had been successfully used for Brazil's recent nationwide local government elections.
Visiting an ethanol plant and synchrotron light technology laboratory in
Sao Paulo State,
Seeing the successful introduction of Australian polymer technology being used for Brazilian banknotes,
Meeting and discussing with representatives from Australian companies about their experiences in successfully establishing and investing in Brazil and Argentina. Companies the Delegation met with included BHP, MIM/North, P&O, Village Cinemas, Qantas.
Observing a cattle auction at the Liniers cattle market and gaining an understanding of the size and scope of the beef industry in Argentina,
Learning of the breadth of agricultural research undertaken in Brazil and Argentina and of the many close links and collaborations with Australian researchers.
The Delegation visited INVAP at Bariloche. INVAP is the company that was awarded the contract for the design and construction of the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. It is also involved in a range of business activities in other fields including, the development and construction of scientific satellites, the design and production of high-technology medical equipment, and industrial and other projects including high speed data transmission by satellite.
The Delegation was pleased to be able to inspect the facilities of INVAP's space laboratory and observed work being undertaken on construction of their next satellite due for launching later this year and its payload of a multispectral camera. We also visited the RA-6 research reactor.
Acknowledgments
Many people contribute to make a Delegation's visit a success. The report lists and thanks a range of people who contributed to the overwhelming success of our visit to Brazil and Argentina. However, a number of people are worthy of particular acknowledgment.
Ambassadors Garry Conroy in Brasil and Sharyn Minahan in Argentina, and Trade Commissioner Gerard Seeber in Sao Paulo assisted the Delegation with comprehensive briefings and invaluable support and assistance. In addition, the staff of the Embassies in Brasilia and Buenos Aires, and at the Austrade office in Sao Paulo, also provided great assistance especially Edward Sellars, Sarah Roberts and Radek Divis. 
The professionalism and commitment of the Ambassadors and their staff was particularly evident to the Delegation. Australia can be very proud that it has representatives of this calibre who will be involved in realising the opportunities and potential that exists between Australia and Brazil and Argentina.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The government asserts that the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000 before us now was a major recommendation arising from the Regional Australia Summit. I would like to give the committee some idea of the terms of reference of the research that we have been referring to recently as it underpins the Regional Australia Summit and therefore resulted in the Roads to Recovery legislation that is before us. I will read into the Hansard the terms of reference of Quantum Market Research:
Undertake research and market testing of branding elements to be used for the Regional Australia Summit response package in regional Australia. The consultant was also required to concept test proposed text, graphics, logos and taglines and provide an indication of the effectiveness of these elements in achieving communication objectives. This research fed into the overall regional Australia campaign and helped define the communication approach, particularly promotional tools, mechanisms and target audiences.
We heard about that today. It continues:
It also enabled the Department to improve its understanding of regional perception and attitudes and to communicate the government's programs and services appropriately. Staff with relevant expertise were not available in the Department.
And thus Quantum Market Research were given the tender. The minister came in earlier and cited a letter he had received from Quantum saying that they had not undertaken any research in relation to the research on page 13 of the report, which goes into very detailed information, or on page 6, which talks specifically about Queensland. In the introduction on page 1, Quantum have said that the findings are drawn from a number of sources—inter alia, Australia Scan. If you turn to the table which was referred to in question time today, it is headed `Federal election voting intentions: Australia Scan'. If you go to the appendix to this suppressed report, it makes it quite clear that Quantum used Australia Scan to conduct the research that we have referred to:
Australia Scan is a research service which Quantum Research has used to keep their finger on the pulse of what is going on in the hearts and minds of Australians.
Clearly, in relation to the minister's previous contribution, I hope that he does have the intestinal fortitude, in his contribution to this bill, to correct the record in terms of what seemed to be an inadvertent—maybe he had not read the appendices or the full report; certainly Minister Anderson does not seem to have been given a copy—misleading of the Senate. I hope he is now in a position to change that.
Going directly to the bill, I want to ask the minister a number of questions and also put a number of issues on the record in relation to a somewhat misleading second reading contribution from the minister. First of all, I go to the issue of interstate distribution, which is totally critical to exactly where the potential for pork-barrelling is in this bill. There is a clear difference between how the government has used the funds and how they were previously distributed under the Labor formula of 1991—I think the minister said 1994, but it was in fact 1991. In terms of the interstate distribution, the funding is provided over the period 2000-01 to 2004-05 and was determined in a two-stage process. The minister has discretion over the timing of payments to local government authorities over the four years. 
The first stage was the interstate allocation of the $1.2 billion. The government has applied a new formula to these allocations. Despite repeated attempts to seek answers from Minister Macdonald, the only information available on the new formula is the assertion that it is based on road length and population and has been adjusted using unspecified factors—an issue which I traversed extensively in my contribution in the second reading debate. The existing allocation formula—that is, the 1991 formula—used for the identified roads components of financial assistance grants to local government has applied since that period; that is, the financial year 1990-91. The new Roads to Recovery Program allocation formula will apply only for the purpose of this bill.
I have a table which shows the impact of the Roads to Recovery Program formula relative to the existing Labor 1991 identified roads component of FAGs. For example, under the old 1991 Labor formula, the Northern Territory would have achieved 3.2 per cent. Under this new formula—and `new' is not my word; it is the word of Minister Macdonald—the Northern Territory has 1.6 per cent of the available money. In the minister's home state, we have another major disparity. Under the old Labor Party formula of 1991, Queensland would have got 18.7 per cent of the total funding available. Under this formula, they have 20.9 per cent. So here we have clear differences in relation to the two formulas.
In answer to my direct question `Is it a new formula?', Minister Macdonald, somewhat uncharacteristically in relation to estimates, gave us the answer yes. I would appreciate more answers like that from Senator Ian Macdonald. I repeat that the question was: is it a new formula? Minister Macdonald said yes. As I said before, you cannot get any more emphatic than that. I also asked him about how this new formula worked—and this is the real extent of the government's fiddling with the formula. He said that the interstate distribution of funds was based on a formula involving 50 per cent road length and 50 per cent population. So far so good; but he then admitted that the formula was—and I quote from the estimates—`adjusted to get a fair and equitable result'. When further questioned on the basis for these adjustments, the minister would say only that they were undertaken by the government and were solely a govern-ment decision.
As late as yesterday, we had the Prime Minister asserting in a radio interview on 6PR that the formula was Labor's formula, but this is just not correct, as provided by Minister Anderson and admitted by Minister Macdonald. Today, we have a Bills Digest circulated from the Parliamentary Library confirming what is already obvious. Perhaps the minister will sit up and pay attention as the Bills Digest makes a comment on the minister's method of adjustment to this new formula. It states:
When questioned about the adjustment, the Senator—
that is, Senator Ian Macdonald—
replied it was based on `the judgements people make'.
You can almost see the raised eyebrows in the Parliamentary Library at that pearl of wisdom. The digest confirms the variations to the historic state allocation percentages that I have outlined previously. The digest also makes a number of other observations:
Clause 7 requires the Minister to make conditions relating to the payment of funds under the Bill. It is not clear whether the text of these conditions must be published in the Gazette. ... Presumably they are to be published ... but as a matter of drafting this could be spelt out clearly, as for example is the requirement for publishing a funding list under clause 5. 
This is an excellent example, identified by the Parliamentary Library, of our assertion that this is a rushed and sloppy preparation in relation to this bill. The digest's concluding question is:
Does the Bill allow the Commonwealth to influence the choice of roadworks to be funded?
It notes that the opposition already has evidence of members on the other side ringing local councils, attempting to lobby them and so on, and it notes that: 
... although it is not required by the Bill, the Commonwealth has said that:
Local government bodies must ... provide the Minister with a proposal for the expenditure of their grant.
That is from the second reading speech of the minister. The Bills Digest concludes:
... it is clear that there is no limitation on his or her—
that is, the minister's—
discretion as to timing and amount of individual instalments, provided that all funds are paid by 1 July 2005.
It goes on to say:
There is no impediment to the Minister taking a position, for example ... he or she will not release any funds until 2005.
Exactly. The drafting of this bill does not secure adherence to the spirit of its intention. Further, again from the Bills Digest:
The fact that under clause 7 the Minister is similarly unrestricted in his or her power to make funding conditions, could also in theory give the Minister some influence but since these would presumably apply to all local governments, they would be of general application and not capable of targeting particular projects or proposals.
So what we have is a general catch-all phrase by which the minister can exercise considerable discretion. The Bills Digest alsomakes the point that this is a move away from financial assistance grants—that is, untied agreements—to specific purpose payments—that is, tied payments. I would like some response from the minister before I go on to the next issue that I would like to raise, so at this point I will conclude my remarks and seek some response from the minister in relation to those issues and some clarification in relation to the provisions that have been raised.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—I will ignore all of the vicious personal attacks that Senator Mackay has again made on me in the guise of asking questions. I will not respond by `playing the man'. I will respond to those issues that relate to the bill and I will ignore, yet again, the personal attacks that, unfortunately, Senator Mackay is unable to avoid when she is involved in a debate with me. I will also not refer to the issue raised by the Labor Party in question time and again spoken of by Senator Mackay; it has been irrefutably put to bed by me in the advice I read out to this chamber and the Prime Minister has just raised it in the other chamber. It shows that Senator Faulkner, Senator Mackay and Senator Ray deliberately misled the Senate, both in question time and subsequently.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. That is, in fact, unparliamentary. I ask the minister to withdraw.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator, I am advised that you cannot say `deliberately misled'.
—I withdraw that. Whatever the English expression is for getting up and making an assertion which is then clearly shown to be wrong and incorrect—clearly shown, I am still embarrassed that experienced senators like Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner would embark on, and engage in, that sort of conduct. But I am not going to refer to that, in spite of the provocation that has been shown to me.
Senator Mackay asked me some questions about the funding formula and she then read all of the answers I gave at Senate estimates. Senator, this is the last day of sitting for this millennium. We have a lot of work to do. You may want to stand here repeating the questions that you have asked in estimates, but I am not going to stand here and keep repeating the answers I gave in estimates. Not only did I give those answers, but you have read them all out now. You have actually answered the questions you have asked in the way I answered them in the estimates committee, and I cannot add any more to them. I can only say that you have answered your own questions by quoting my answers in the estimates committee. If I said anything more here, I would simply be repeating what I said in the estimates committee. ",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The point of that previous contribution was to highlight that, in fact, the minister has admitted that it is a new formula, which would appear to be directly in conflict with statements by both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Anderson.
Let me move on to another issue, which was not answered at the estimates process, and that is the issue of the intrastate division amongst local government authorities. The formula used for this allocation is based on the current state grants commission formula used for the distribution of the identified road component of FAGs. The state grants commissions did not do the allocation. The government simply applied the retrospective formula. The government relied on the relativities determined from the most recent state grants commission process. 
During the estimates, I attempted to clarify the issue of the metro and rural divide that was highlighted in Minister Anderson's own press release, which was the result of simply applying the existing state grants commission formulas. Didn't Minister Macdonald make a song and dance about that question! Here is a sample of some of the things he said at estimates in relation to what I thought was a fairly basic question. With regard to the section in Minister Anderson's press release which talked about the disparity of the greater metro versus the rural and regional divide in terms of funding, he said this:
That is not mentioned in the act.
He went on to say:
It is certainly not relevant to the act and certainly not relevant to estimates.
When he was asked why, then, Minister Anderson put it in his press release of 27 November, he said:
I have no idea what is in his mind.
We now have evidence, of course, that this is not an unusual occurrence. In response to questions about statements in Minister Anderson's press release, he said:
I am not going to answer.
The committee was then forced to have a private meeting to decide the relevance of questions in Minister Anderson's press release, and the chair was forced to change his ruling, saying:
The fact is that if there is a press release relating to government expenditure, that can be examined in these estimates.
So a fairly simple question was refused by Minister Macdonald. I think we might have to refer him to the Procedure Committee, yet again. The following exchange then took place. I said:
I do not believe I have an answer to that.
Minister Macdonald: 
You believe what you like.
Me:
Will you perhaps ask Minister Anderson?
Minister Macdonald:
No.
Me:
You will not ask Minister Anderson?
This is in relation to the minister's own press release, by the way. Minister Macdonald:
No.
Me: 
Will you take the question on notice?
Which would have given him a chance to have a chat to Minister Anderson in relation to it, but Minister Macdonald said no. I went on to say:
I will just clarify my point of order. The minister has refused to ask Minister Anderson and has also refused to take the question on notice. I think that is a contravention of the standing orders.
The acting chair at that stage was poor old Senator McGauran. He said:
Your question is not out of order. I can only urge the minister to refer the question to John Anderson ... 
And he did not. Given that fairly puerile response from the minister in relation to a question that was specific to a statement in Minister Anderson's press release, I wonder if the minister can now apprise the chamber of what underpinned the issue in terms of the quantum between metro councils and rural and regional councils.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—Again, Senator Mackay, if anyone is interested in what happened at the estimates committee, I am sure they will read the estimates committee Hansard. They do not really need you to read it again into the Hansard here. The only question relative to the bill that I heard in the last six minutes of Senator Mackay's speech was about the intrastate formula.
—Metro versus rural and regional.
—The `metro and regional' is not mentioned in the bill.
—It is in the minister's press release.
—The minister's press release is not in the bill, either. You asked about the intrastate formula. You said that I did not answer your question on that in the estimates committee. If I did not, I do not know why you did not ask me. It is very clear what the intrastate formula is. It is the states grants commission's formula for distributing the untied road identified grants of the financial assistance grants act. That act was introduced by the previous Labor government, supported by the then opposition, and has been actioned by each state government—most of which, regrettably, are Labor state governments. They appoint states grants commissions which then determine a fair and equitable formula for the distribution of moneys to each and every council within a state. That formula, which has been used for almost 10 years now, is the formula used for distribution of moneys intrastate under this bill.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I notice, yet again, that the minister refuses to answer questions relating to the Deputy Prime Minister's press release on this bill. I do not think he will answer, so we will leave it at that and go to another issue. The bill requires the minister to gazette conditions that apply to the payment of the grants. These conditions are of three types. I will just run through this so the minister can be up to speed in relation to it. Section 7(2) sets out the conditions that must be included. It requires the money to be used for roads and be properly accounted for, that councils maintain their levels of other road expenditure and that signs be displayed in relation to projects funded under the act. Section 7(3) sets out conditions that may be included: conditions requiring councils to repay amounts to the Commonwealth in the event of a breach of the conditions and conditions requiring the council to comply with the guidelines issued under the act. Section 7(4) provides that sections 7(2) and (3) do not limit matters that may be dealt with in the conditions. Section 7(5) gives the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the Gazette. This section appears contrary to the description in the explanatory memorandum that states:
In varying any conditions, the Minister will have to ensure that the compulsory conditions in subclause(2) are maintained. 
Minister, clarification of this section is required. In its current form, it gives the minister unfettered power to change all conditions for the allocation of funds. We believe—and I would like your comments in relation to this and, obviously, the Parliamentary Library would as well—that this bill provides for, in effect, the introduction of tied grants of specific purpose payments. We believe this is a retrograde step and will provide capacity for Minister Anderson to potentially interfere with local road funding priorities.
But I come back to the section in the bill that I would like a response to; that is, section 7(5), which is at variance with the other sections—sections 7(2), 7(3) and 7(4). What precisely is meant by this section? Our contention is that it gives the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the Gazette. In fact, it is very clear in the legislation that that is what is meant by that section. Minister, I would appreciate it if you could provide a response to that matter. ",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—Senator, I did not understand the part of your question that dealt with specific purpose payments or tied grants. If you want to pursue that, please ask your question again when I finish answering this. The minister may, by notice in the Gazette, revoke or vary any of the conditions. That is in subsection (5) of section 7. That, of course, means what it says: that the minister is able to revoke or vary any of the conditions that are referred to. I would assume the legal interpretation—and I will get some advice on this; my legal knowledge is now 10 years rusty—would be that there must remain conditions that require the money to be used for roads expenditure. But I assume the precise wording of those conditions can be revoked or varied by the minister and would then have to be replaced by other conditions that require that the money be used for roads expenditure and, similarly, conditions that require that the expenditure be properly accounted for. I assume that subsection (5) means that, initially, the minister may say, `You have to account by getting in the state auditor-general to account for it.' He may then at a later stage say, `That hasn't been practical, so I'll vary that by deleting reference to the state auditor-general and require, for example, the Commonwealth Auditor-General to account for the expenditure.' That is how I would interpret subsection (5).",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Thank you for that, Minister. I would repeat that my final question was in relation to the fact that section 75 seems to give the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the Gazette, and I look forward to clarification on that. I think you have essentially confirmed that, however. I will move on to some other questions on which we would like a response and which are based on representations made to us by a number of councils. I know that Senator Hutchins and Senator O'Brien made similar comments in relation to representations they have received, and I have certainly received the same representations. Minister, will local government be able to draw on funds for the preparation of strategic plans for their local government roads projects? It has been put to me by a number of councils that the reporting mechanisms will represent a significant imposition, particularly in relation to small councils. It is worth noting—and I notice that Senator Hutchins raised this yesterday—that the government seems quite content for funds to be spent on signage that highlights the government's involvement, but councils have put to us that they are concerned about the real administrative costs in relation to it.
While you are thinking about that, Minister, will you also answer the question of whether local government will be able to draw on RTR funds for the additional financial imposition of funding applications and annual reporting? It has been put to us that this is also a significant impost on small regional councils. Minister, how much flexibility is local government going to have to request a staggered payment or lump sum payment of funds? For example, if a particular council wants to undertake a planning study of local roads needs in their area over a 12-month period, will they be able to roll over year one funding into subsequent years? I will leave it at that and come back to other questions later.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—We respect and understand local governments. The whole purpose of this bill and this initiative from the Howard government is to get money to councils for use in upgrading and maintaining local roads. We have made a massive commitment of $1.2 billion, and we want to see it happen. We think local governments are the best people to get this work done efficiently and expeditiously, and everything we do follows that intention. Why would we do otherwise? We have committed the money and we have distributed it in the most fair and open way possible, one that has been universally applauded by local government—and I stress `universally applauded'—because local government understand the formulas, they understand how fair they are, they know they have been working on those for years and they are amused that some people involved in this debate yesterday simply did not seem to understand how things currently work. But that is fair enough; I will leave that. 
The only real condition we have on this whole thing is that the funds must be spent on roads. Under the current act, I will call it the Labor act, the 1994 act, the moneys the Commonwealth gives to local authorities are identified as roads grants. They are calculated on a formula that the state grants commission relates to roads. But, having received the money, the councils can then spend it on anything. They can spend it on a publicity unit or a social worker or whatever, and that is the way that act is set out; we are not trying to change that. But with the Roads to Recovery Program, we are insisting that the funds be spent on roads. To do that, we are asking councils very reasonably to explain to us what they are going to do. These conditions have not been put together yet, but I think we will be saying to councils, `We want to know what you were going to do before this money came along, and we want to know what new or different things you are going to do or what things you are going to bring forward,' just so that we can be assured that they are not cost shifting and transferring some money that they were going to spend on local roads to another program and then using this money to do what they intended to do anyhow. So the conditions will relate to that.
Senator Mackay asked about the timing of the payments. The act provides that the amount be payable in one or more instalments and that the amounts and timing of the instalments are to be determined by the minister. We have indicated publicly that we want to get out the first instalment in February if it is at all possible. We have indicated that it will probably be a quarter of an annual payment that will go out in February. We have also indicated—and I think the bill says—that, where there are only small amounts involved, we can pay the total amount in full, up-front. But we want to help local government, and we will work with local government, to get that money out in the very best way possible. We will continue the excellent working relationship we have with both the Australian local government executive, its president and vice presidents, and the state local government associations with whom we work very cooperatively and well. We will be working with them to make sure we get this money out in the best possible way.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Thank you for that, Minister. You have answered some of the questions but not all of them. However, we have a considerably heavy legislative program so I hope that you will be able to provide us with the answers to the specific question when you have had the opportunity to peruse the Hansard. The bill contains a condition outlining the needs for signage acknowledging the government's financial support. What criteria and guidelines have been issued for the signs required to be displayed at works funded from the new program? Will funding be withdrawn if these signs are not displayed? How much will each sign cost and how much has been allocated in the program to cover signage?
I had a very interesting meeting with a Victorian council, the Macedon Ranges Council. On Tuesday, 5 December, I met with the mayor, Councillor Noel Harvey, and the CEO, Lydia Wilson, to discuss roads, petrol and other related issues. They provided a number of interesting points in relation to the situation facing Macedon council. These points inter alia have been raised with us by a number of councils, but it does provide a good snapshot of some of the difficulties. The information that they provided us was that Macedon council has seen the cost of sealing and asphalt tenders rise by around 40 per cent. Of this 40 per cent, companies are attributing a 30 per cent rise to increased fuel costs based on the petroleum levels in the bitumen products used. The council advised me that the average bitumen reseal rate has increased from $1.75 per square metre to $2.35 per square metre. Due to the increased sealing costs, Macedon will be forced to reduce the percentage of resealed roads from five per cent to 3.7 per cent. This is in the context of the council's targeted reseal percentage of 18 per cent. Their contention is that there will be a budget shortfall of approximately $130,000 in 2000-01 for Macedon shire council. As a result, council's annual RTR allocation of approximately $1 million will be reduced by about $130,000 due to the increased petrol costs and the consequential increase in the cost of bitumen, leaving a revised yearly total of $870,000 before even considering new projects. 
The question that they were keen to pursue is whether the government would allow the council to wait until such time as petrol prices reduce, thus allowing them time to get a better deal, particularly on bitumen. They also said that the cost of running the council's car fleet has risen by $30,000, obviously excluding costs associated with heavy plant.
Finally, the council raised some quite legitimate concerns about competition in any tendering process for roads, based on the limited number of contractors with the ability to provide the service. A senator made the point yesterday about rural and regional Australia. This council in particular has two contractors they can use. This is a major roll-out of infrastructure, and they are concerned to ensure that fairness is entrenched in the contracting process because, with such an amount of money being available, there is a possibility that costs will go up over a short period. This certainly happened pre-GST with the building industry, where we saw a consequential fall.
We suggest—and I will be interested in your response, Minister—that this is an issue that the government could refer to the ACCC for some kind of watching brief. Obviously across all states a small number of contractors, particularly in rural Australia, will stand to benefit from the injection of funds through the RTR program. The opposition believe it is something for which the ACCC could be given a watching brief. This is obviously within the bailiwick of the Treasurer, so I ask the minister whether he would be prepared to take this up with Mr Costello and give the ACCC some kind of watching brief in relation to the issue of contractors.",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—I suggest to Senator Mackay that if she wants answers to specific questions, which obviously she does, she should ask them one at a time. It would be a quicker way than having about 10 questions each time and trying to remember them. But I will have a go.
Senator Mackay asked whether councils can delay their works to take advantage of the situation when petrol prices fall. I must say in passing that I am pleased to note that Senator Mackay recognises that petrol prices will fall, because at some stage the world crude oil price will fall—I do not know when that will be, and perhaps it is a brave thing to say—and the exchange rate will vary. Senator Mackay knows as well as I do that the price of fuel is directly related to those, and that is what it is all about. I agree with Senator Mackay; I think they will fall. On the issue of whether councils can delay, this is really a program that councils will run. All we want them to do is to spend money on much needed road works. Their programs are already in place, and they have this additional money. They have plenty of work to do. We know that, and they know that. Within reason, it is a matter for them if they choose to delay it a bit and hope to pick the world crude oil price. It is really up to them as to how they get the best value for their money. I think you will find that there is such a desperate need for road works around Australia that they will take their chances and do it as quickly as they can. But the choice, within reason, is theirs.
I think you made the point that, because world crude oil prices are high and the exchange rate bad, their current budgets for road funds are some way over the budgeted amount and they will have a shortfall in their current budget expenditure. If you were asking whether they can use this money to fill in their budget, the answer is quite clearly no. This is for new road works, so it is quite clearly no. If this program were not here, they would have to manage it some other way. Two weeks ago, this program was not here. This is new money for new works—additional works that we know all councils desperately want. 
You raised the question about signposts. The conditions on signposting will be interpreted very flexibly as it is likely in many cases the works will be distributed over a number of geographical areas. The councils will be asked to give assurances, and the CEO will be required to certify that this condition has been complied with. The cost of the signs will be funded by the councils, which can use the Roads to Recovery program funds for this purpose if they wish to do it that way. It is normal practice for all authorities, including local governments, to signpost capital works in this way. Senator Mackay will be aware that all of the works done by state governments—certainly in works that are done under the Roads of National Importance program, the Black Spots program, the national highways program and the state arterial roads programs that all of the state governments run—are signposted. This will be no different from those. In fact, my experience as I move around the country—and I know from my own council's experience—is that they are all signposted in any case. These will be signposted in the same way. ",SENATE,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Thank you, Minister. We will—as I hope you will—pass these responses on to local government. I would have appreciated the opportunity to ask these questions seriatim but time, unfortunately, given the government's heavy legislative program, does not permit that. I offer you the opportunity to provide me answers to questions that have not been answered in this committee stage directly so that we can satisfy the representations that we have had from councils. As I said, in the available time it is difficult to do that. I appreciate that we are under the hammer in this. I would seek your reaction to the proposition that—once you have perused the Hansard—you provide, not simply to me, obviously, but to all senators and committee members, answers to questions that, due to time constraints, you have been unable to provide answers to.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-12-07,"—As the bill says, these conditions will be promulgated by the minister and published in the Gazette. They will very clearly explain exactly what is required of every council and will be made available to every council in Australia and to you. The department will be working on these conditions. Do not hold me to this, but the expectation is that it will be mid- to late January before the conditions are gazetted and made available to all councils. At that time can I offer you, and anyone you choose to bring, a briefing from the department on exactly what the conditions are so that any questions you may have could be answered by departmental people. I think that is probably the best thing I can do and perhaps, in the end, the most useful thing for you in appreciating the conditions and how they will proceed.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I was going to speak on the National Health Amendment (Improved Monitoring of Entitlements to Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2000 but, in the interests of the Senate and to expedite the passage of legislation, I seek leave to incorporate my speech. 
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
The National Health Amendment legislation would establish a new system to oversee the eligibility for people to obtain pharmaceuticals under the Medicare system. It works, in essence, by establishing an arrangement where doctors and other prescribers must write the patient's Medicare number on each prescription.  
The Government has also attached to this bill a range of amendments seeking to change the composition and terms of office of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (the PBAC).  I'll discuss those measures later because I'd like to spend most of my time considering the principal part of this legislation.
The main measures of this bill are designed to tighten eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Scheme costs the Government $3 billion a year and is one of its most successful programs. Through its operation, the Government pays about 82 per cent of the cost of listed drugs. 
More than 500 different medicines are covered by the scheme. About 129 million prescriptions are issued through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme each year.
Both claims and payments under the scheme are administered by the Health Insurance Commission, which is also the body responsible for administering claims and payments of Medicare benefits.
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the scheme to our health system. The Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme is one of the most crucial elements of our health system. We must be extremely careful about any changes we make to the current system, even if those changes are only at the very edges.
Considering the cost, size and importance of the scheme it is essential that we ensure only eligible people receive benefits. Eligibility is confined to residents of Australia and to visitors from the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Malta, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, where we have reciprocal health agreements.
The measures in this bill would make it more difficult for ineligible people such as overseas visitors and people who have non-resident status to obtain drugs at a subsidised rate.
When fully implemented, the Government will not pay pharmacists unless they have checked the person's Medicare number and expiry date before dispensing a prescription. Furthermore, if the number is not correct when compared to Health Insurance Commission data, pharmacists will be responsible for tracking down the customer in order to correct or verify the actual Medicare number. 
The Bill allows doctors and pharmacists to retain Medicare numbers for future use with the same patients. It does also require them to maintain privacy and obtain the consent of patients regarding the retention of the numbers. 
The legislation establishes various penalties for misusing or disclosing Medicare numbers. There are provisions allowing the correction of numbers during the phase-in but after that, the rules become quite a bit stricter.
The complexity of Medicare eligibility has made the proposal quite detailed. It includes a range of measures to provide for exceptions, the details of which will be spelt out fully in regulations. 
There are a number of groups of people who do not have Medicare cards but who are eligible for pharmaceutical benefits - including people with disabilities in the care of others, visitors from countries with which Australia has a bilateral agreement and people without a card in an emergency. 
There has been general support from all parties for the objective of ensuring people don't get pharmaceuticals they aren't eligible for. There is some concern however, particularly from pharmacists and consumers about several aspects of the scheme. 
The major concern regards the mandatory requirement for Medicare numbers to be put on prescriptions. Some people are particularly concerned that the Government has put the cart before the horse by effectively using the Medicare number as a ""unique patient identifier"" without putting an adequate privacy regime in place first. 
The Bill allows doctors and pharmacists to keep Medicare numbers and prohibits their misuse. We support this as a means to protect privacy but we will have to look closely in the future to ensure that any further expansion of the powers do not raise more privacy concerns.
The Bill also does not clarify to what purpose the data collected by the Health Insurance Commission can be used. There are currently specific Privacy Commissioner Guidelines about using pharmaceutical data and matching it with Medicare numbers. There is a case for the guidelines to be reviewed but any review needs to occur in the context of a national approach to health privacy.
This legislation forms part of the Government's overall plan for health medication. The Government has foreshadowed further legislation to implement other aspects of its overall plan and says that further privacy measures will be dealt with at that stage. We welcome the commitment to ensuring the privacy of patient's medical records. 
We do have some concerns about some practical aspects of this scheme and whether it will achieve its intended objective. It will not be necessary to have your Medicare card to get a prescription filled. It will only be necessary to quote your family's Medicare number and the expiry date of the card. Agents can still collect your prescription if they also know your Medicare card or at least can quote the same number on the top of the prescription.
There is the distinct possibility that this will leave open most of the currently used methods for ineligible people to obtain a prescription and have it filled. Those methods include borrowing a card, using a stolen card or impersonating another person. Given concerns recently about the various numbers on particular cards being used inappropriately, one wonders how safe this measure would be.
The problem of ""doctor shopping"", that is - obtaining multiple scripts for the same complaint, will not be solved by this measure.
The Health Insurance Commission estimates that in 1998-99 more than 8000 people were engaged in doctor shopping, costing an average of $21.68 for each prescription filled. The measures in this bill however, will do little to stop doctor shopping. People will not need their Medicare card to get medication. They will only have to quote the number and the expiry date. 
People who are ineligible will be able to access pharmaceuticals in exactly the same way they did before this legislation was suggested—they could impersonate someone they knew or borrow or steal a card.
The central issue of this bill revolves around privacy and fraud prevention. How is the Government planning to use the Medicare numbers it collects under the new system? Will they use that data to curb doctor shopping? If they do that, how will they then deal with the various privacy concerns? 
Unfortunately the Government seems to be willing to use Medicare numbers as unique patient identifiers without first establishing the all-important privacy regime.
Several practical difficulties also arise because currently a number of family members can share the same Medicare card number. The records held by the HIC will show the total use by all the people on the card and this could possibly lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn about the appropriateness of any pattern of use. 
Labor's alternative would be to use a unique patient identifier system based on the Medicare card, which would avoid several of the difficulties inherent in the Government's approach. Patients would each have a separate number instead of one per family and there would be a separation between the number used for claims and the patient identifier used to connect health records. 
Many pharmacists also have major concerns that they will carry the penalty for any incorrect information being supplied to the HIC about prescriptions issued.
There is a lot of concern about the timing of these measures. Pharmacy and doctor groups do not believe that this time frame is realistic and would like to see it moved back at least six months. These are legitimate concerns, especially when you look at the small amount of publicity the Government has undertaken with regard to this measure.
Currently it is proposed to implement the policy in three stages, with full mandatory observance, being required by July next year. 
Stage 1 establishes the privacy regime and gives explicit permission for Medicare numbers to be collected, placed on prescriptions and stored. This stage comes into effect as soon as the legislation is given assent.
Stage 2 of the bill requires that Medicare numbers be collected and put on prescription by pharmacists and other suppliers for the purpose of identifying entitlements to pharmaceutical benefits. Currently the Government plans to have that stage apply from January 1 next year, less than 16 working days away.
The third and final stage applies from July 1. It actually prevents payments to pharmacists or other suppliers in relation to dispensing prescriptions for pharmaceutical benefits if there has been a failure to comply with stage 2 of the process or where the number endorsed on a prescription does not match the number registered at the Health Insurance Commission.
That is an extraordinarily short time frame, especially when you consider the extra amendments included. I'd like to know a few things about the education campaign the Government is implementing to warn people about the possible introductions of these measures.
I'd like to know what consultation and feedback the Government has had from pharmacists, who will shoulder the job of implementing most of these measures. 
What is the Government telling the public about the changes? What information is the Government disseminating in the lead-up to this change? 
I'm sure it is reasonable for the Government to wait until the legislation actually passes before initiating a full publicity campaign. But they are running pretty close to the wind. 
We're less than a month away from the startup. And, given the understandable lethargy of these sorts of things over Christmas, I don't imagine much will be happening between when we pass the legislation and January 1.
The reality is that if we pass this legislation as it stands, from January 1 the public will have to provide pharmacists with their Medicare number as well as their prescription in order to verify that they are eligible to receive their full PBS benefit. 
If the patient cannot do that, they will be forced to either pay the full cost of the medicine or go back home and get their number and go back to the pharmacist and present their prescription for a second time.
I imagine there will be a lot of confused and annoyed people out there when this measure is put in place.
I also want to discuss briefly the proposed changes to the composition and terms of members of the PBAC that the Government is presenting. The PBAC is responsible for assessing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals and deciding whether a particular pharmaceutical should be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
Under the changes a health economist would be added to the current Committee membership of up to three general practitioners, one community pharmacist, one consumer representative and one clinical pharmacologist.
The changes also propose that each member of the PBAC for a term of not more four years and for a continuous period of up to eight years. No member would be reappointed if it resulted in them serving for a total of more than 12 years.
In addition the chair of the Committee may not be appointed for more than eight years. The final proposal is that any period a person who is a member of the current Committee, should be treated as a period during which the person was a member of the new committee.
It is this proposal that has caused serious concern for senior members of the current committee, as well as various academics and some clinicians. It is perceived that this measure is a way of dropping certain members of the committee, thus weakening its independence.
We would like to have more time to consider these changes. They are quite major changes and should not be hurried through. We would like more time to negotiate a balanced approach to these changes. In our opinion, this process has been rushed.
In conclusion let me reiterate our support of the general thrust of this Bill. It is a reasonable approach to a problem that does need addressing. That support we have shown however, does not come without any concerns. 
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the pillars of our public health system. We need to take measures to ensure its integrity. But while doing that we need to make it clear to everyone that uses it that any information that we collect from it will be used properly.
The Labor Party wants to see a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that reduces fraud and works effectively. In doing that however, we must ensure that it does not come at the expense of privacy.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MONITORING OF ENTITLEMENTS TO PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,40,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-12-07,"—Before I comment on the National Health Amendment (Improved Monitoring of Entitlements to Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2000, I want to discuss a related issue—a general health issue—and to remind the Senate that this morning the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation handed over the document Declaration towards reconciliation to the government and that the council will now hand over its role to Reconciliation Australia. One of the issues raised this morning was practical reconciliation. What more practical reconciliation can we have than adequate funding of the health system so that at the federal level Aboriginal Australians can enjoy the same level of funding as non-Aboriginal Australians. Again, I want to put on the record findings from research by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. I think the findings speak for themselves, because it is from Commonwealth funds that primary health care dollars come. The states put in what I guess could be described as the `acute end' by the time you end up in one of their hospitals. For every Medicare dollar spent on non-indigenous Australians, the records and information show us that only 27c is spent on an Aboriginal Australian. For every Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dollar accessed by non-indigenous Australians, indigenous Australians access 22c, and for specialist treatment it is 12 cents in the dollar for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I acknowledge there are a number of other Commonwealth programs, including the Aboriginal community health care programs; but, if you add it all up, the Commonwealth puts in 67 cents in the dollar for every non-indigenous Australian—in other words, we get a dollar; they get 67c when, in fact, looking at their health needs, it should be about $1.20. 
I wanted to make those points and support the comments made by Senator Crossin this morning relating to the education bill that went through this place earlier today. There again we see the way in which this government sorts out its priorities—tens of millions of dollars spent on the very wealthy end of the private school system when Aboriginal children do not get an opportunity to even go to secondary school. We are not talking about highly remote communities with small populations; we are talking about primary schools with 200, 250, 300 or 500 kids with no secondary school for them to go on to. 
Coming back to the bill in front of us, we support the thrust of this legislation and are pleased to see that the government has removed the more contentious points in it and now hopefully will have a rapid passage through this place. We support the inclusion of Medicare numbers on prescriptions for pharmaceuticals under the PBS. The PBS is a scheme that stands us in good stead with any scheme anywhere in the world. We have one of the best schemes for Australians as far as access to medications is concerned. If you look at the health systems in other countries, you will see that medicines are so expensive in places like the USA that treatable illnesses often get to the point where people die from them due to not being able to afford the drugs that they need. So we do need to protect the PBS, and it is a protective measure to include the Medicare numbers on prescriptions. There is evidence that people doctor shop for a range of reasons—some simply because they have an addiction to a particular form of medication but others because they want access to cheap drugs in order to onsell them. So being able to track in this way will hopefully reduce any misuse of the PBS and see us further able to protect the health of Australians.
I also wish to note that the government's amendments which make minor changes to the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee are also supported, and this is where the controversial measures disappear from and, as I said, we are pleased to see that. We support some of the amendments at least. I wait with interest to hear the debate on the opposition's amendments. But broadening the base from which recommendations can be taken, I think, is a good idea. Currently, only the AMA is able to make recommendations to the minister for vacancies. I think it is quite appropriate that we broaden this to include the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and others. We will deal with this as we get to the amendments.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MONITORING OF ENTITLEMENTS TO PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,40,1

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The Senate is considering Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000. I am pleased to welcome this into the chamber. This is the government's latest GST roll-back legislation. Labor intends to support this bill but with one amendment in regard to retrospectivity to remedy some absurd situations and administrative burdens that fall particularly on small business and that should never have been allowed to occur in the first place. In terms of roll-back, the total number of amendments to this so-called simple new tax system, the GST, now stands in excess of 1,650 and here we are, on the last day of sitting, considering further amendments to GST legislation. There have been 1,650 amendments to the GST in the last six months.
Many of the amendments we are considering involve roll-back but the government, of course, stubbornly refuses to recognise this and it stubbornly refuses to roll back on the one issue that is hitting the wallets of ordinary Australians hardest: petrol. I am glad that Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran are in this chamber today, because I have a few more comments to make about petrol.
—The Liberal-National Party government has increased the tax on fuel in this country, Senator Boswell, even though the Prime Minister promised that he would not. Labor has argued, and the Prime Minister has conceded, that this government has received a windfall tax gain because of the tax changes made in respect of fuel in this country.
—What about roads?
—Tell us about roads.
—What about fuel prices? That is what the people in your electorates are asking you.
—What about communications?
—The government should do one of two things, Senator Boswell—and the National Party in particular should take note—they need to honour their promise to drop the excise by the same amount that the GST goes up or they have to eliminate the GST inflation spike from the February indexation adjustment. I remind the chamber that, by the time we return next year in the second week in February, there will have been a further increase in fuel prices as a result of the GST. Either way, the result of the tax application to fuel will be a reduction of 2c a litre in the price of petrol next year if the inflationary spike is removed. Instead, motorists are facing a further breaking of the Prime Minister's word that the GST would not affect the price of fuel in this country. There will be a further breaking of the Prime Minister's word in February next year before the parliament resumes. I will be moving a second reading amendment to enable senators to vote on this important issue.
The federal parliamentary Labor Party's caucus committee, the petrol price inquiry, has travelled to 23 different locations throughout Australia to hear evidence from community organisations, transport operators, service station operators and local councils—amongst many others—about the unfairness of the impact of the new tax system on fuel costs. These are the same Australians who pay more in petrol tax because their petrol prices are higher. These people have not been fooled by the government's attempt to return only some of its windfall gain on local roads. Of course, Australian motorists deserve more than road funding from this government: it cut road funding in 1996 by hundreds of millions of dollars. Page 3-156 of Budget Paper No. 1 of the 1996-97 budget shows just one decision—`reduction in national highway system funding'—with over $620 million of funding cut out in that year and in the three subsequent years. So the government is not really increasing road funding; it is just putting back some of the funding that it cut out some years ago, but it is taking a massive petrol tax windfall off motorists. 
These motorists have been speaking to Labor's fuel price inquiry. They are telling us that what they want is lower petrol prices, because the Liberal and National parties, particularly the Prime Minister, refuse to listen to them, have refused an inquiry into the issue and refuse to honour the broken promise, the absolute commitment that the Prime Minister made, that fuel prices would not rise. They are aware, as the government appears not to be, that this broken petrol promise is making life all that harder. We have heard from a number of peak motoring organisations at our hearings. It is also important to note, as we approach the Christmas-New Year break, that this is a peak travel time for motorists. I have lost count of the number of times that members of the Liberal and National parties are lions in their electorates complaining about fuel prices—
—Hundreds of times.
—Yes. They complain about fuel prices in their electorates and yet when they come to Canberra they roll over. They are like little lambs: they are tickled by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and assured that everything will be okay. They do absolutely nothing about the high price of fuel in this country when they come to Canberra. They attempt to make names for themselves back in their electorates but they do not do anything about the issue. We will be moving a second reading amendment this afternoon. It says:
""... the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households and calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001"".
This will be the Senate's last opportunity to express its concern on this issue, which is the priority issue of policy concern amongst Australians at the present time.
I move to the issue of the GST in some further detail. We have heard many times from the government that it would simplify the tax system. The Treasurer in his press release of 13 August 1998 stated:
The introduction of the Australian Business Number, coupled with the simpler and more flexible payment arrangements, will substantially reduce the number of dealings business has with the Australian Tax Office.
The overwhelming majority of Australians, and certainly small business, know that that is simply not true. It is just fantasy. If you talk to anyone in small business at the present time, battling their way through the business activity statement and gritting their teeth, they will tell you it is very far from simple and is very costly to administer. Prior to the introduction of the GST, we heard a lot about simplification. But with this legislation comes at least an acknowledgment from the government that its GST and associated tax changes have instead made the tax system much more complex for small business. Some of the more significant changes in this bill allow the tax commissioner in certain circumstances to cancel an entity's GST registration, it allows the tax commissioner in certain circumstances to change an entity's tax period from monthly to quarterly and it gives the commissioner the ability to pay out a refund from a business activity statement rather than to take it off current or future tax liabilities such as company tax. These changes should not really be counted as benefits for business but rather are removing what is, frankly, the absolute idiocy of the earlier arrangements. 
There are some 48 other changes, plus numerous minor technical corrections. This is a lot of simplification, it is a lot of roll-back, but Labor support this simplification because of the numerous complaints we have had from small businesses who have been unwittingly caught up in the web of administrative problems created by the new tax system. For example, this bill will finally provide an escape clause to those who are not only tearing their hair out over the business activity statement because they were erroneously registered for the GST but who must pay GST even though their prices have not increased. According to the president of the National Tax and Accountants Association, Ray Regan, the GST is effectively coming directly from the pockets of many small businesses and it will likely bankrupt them because of the significant impact on cash flow.  
The Tax Ombudsman has received complaints about this issue. In fact, she has had about 80 complaints about the ABN and the GST registration process. She has reported:
Many complaints relate to timeliness, while others come from people who have experienced difficulty getting the ATO to remedy processing errors. For example, some entities were registered for GST when they had not asked to be. However, this bill does not provide for retrospective cancellation of GST registration. 
This is puzzling to the Labor opposition, and we would certainly like an explanation from the minister when he comes to the chamber on why it is not retrospective. Ray Regan is concerned that, as many businesses have decided to play it safe by registering for the GST and erring on the side of caution, they are now unnecessarily plagued by the business activity statement and its attendant complexities. I might say that many registered in order to play it safe because we had not had the complete package of legislation relating to the GST in the parliament prior to the 1 July start-up. As I said in my opening remarks, with the amendments we are dealing with in respect of the GST in this legislation, the total now comes to 1,650 amendments, six months after the introduction of the GST. These businesses should not be punished for attempting to do the right thing. That is why the amendment to the legislation in respect of registration should be made retrospective. 
This bill also proposes to amend the law to enable the commissioner to ensure that a business activity statement refund is not automatically offset against a current or future tax debt. Currently this situation is causing considerable problems for business. Acting on the current law, the tax office has reduced GST refunds for businesses by deducting company tax bills even when they have not fallen due. This should not occur. It creates cash flow problems for small businesses and the potential for prolonged interaction with the tax office to find out what has happened to the GST refund. One case I have been made aware of concerns a small business which submitted a business activity statement on 21 August and was entitled to a GST refund in the order of $92,000. The subsequent advice from the tax office was that the refund was put into the owner's account. However, on checking with his bank he discovered that the refund was reduced by $12,000, and he was left to find this out for himself. On checking with the tax office, he discovered that the tax office had taken his company tax out of his anticipated refund. Unfortunately, he had already separately payed his company tax bill. It has now been paid twice. This is a ridiculous situation. It should not have been allowed to occur, and with the passage of this bill it should not occur again.
There is also an administrative change with regard to the monthly BAS. This involves increasing flexibility to cancel monthly remittances of the GST. As things stand, people cannot change from monthly to quarterly until they have completed 12 months as monthly remitters. Again, this is a ridiculous situation, and the bill will fix that. However, the quarterly system itself is still not a simple one. In fact, its complexity led to the deadline being extended. The National Tax and Accountants Association conducted a comprehensive survey of accountants and tax agents and over 2,000 accountants responded. It showed that an estimated 400,000 BAS returns will fail to meet the extended deadline. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses cannot cope with the BAS, and in the wake of this survey the tax office has extended the deadline further. Of course, they did not even recognise the problem raised by Mr Regan and have just quietly extended the deadline by around three weeks. People still miss the deadline; indeed, there will be many who have still not lodged. 
The first quarterly payment was such a disaster that the second payment, which had already been granted a two-week extension until early February, has now had that deadline extended until the end of the month of February. So the so-called smooth implementation of the GST is just a bad joke and a very bad taste in the mouths of many small businesses and their accountants. Although this legislation addresses some GST related problems, there continue to be many more. Obviously Labor are happy to support removing some of the GST problems. This is roll-back. This is roll-back by the Liberal and National parties, and in particular Treasurer Costello. And we support this roll-back. It is a logical thing to do and it is consistent with Labor's pledge to make the GST simply and fairer. 
I notice that National Party Senators Boswell and McGauran scuttled out of the chamber when I referred to their appalling record on fuel prices in this country. The National Party have been trampled on by the Liberal Party in respect of this issue. I just want to give a couple of examples to the chamber before I move the second reading amendment. We did a survey of coalition senators. I am disappointed that Senator McGauran is not here. The survey was conducted of unleaded petrol and LPG prices, and this is from the Shell web site as of today. Senator McGauran has recently, after a prolonged period of 10 years, moved his office from Collins Street in Melbourne to the country—he does represent rural Victoria—to Benalla. In Benalla today unleaded petrol was 99.9c with a GST component of 9.08c. That is compared to Melbourne, where unleaded petrol is 91c and the GST is 8.27c. In Benalla, where Senator McGauran has suddenly decided to relocate, liquefied petroleum gas is 59.9c and the GST is 5.45c. That illustrates the enormous impact and the differential in respect of petrol prices in rural and regional areas and the city.
In New South Wales, which Senator Sandy Macdonald represents, in Tamworth West LPG is 56c and the GST component is 5.09c. In Sydney today the price of LPG varies, but it is around the low fifties. In Townsville, which Senator Ian Macdonald represents, unleaded petrol is 93.9 cents and the GST is 8.54c. In Rockhampton unleaded petrol is 92.2c and the GST is 8.38c. In Brisbane unleaded petrol is 81.2c and the GST is 7.38c. So that illustrates again the significant disadvantage that people in rural and regional Australia are suffering. They are suffering as a result of the GST. A percentage tax on a higher base rate leads to a widening of the differential and is a significant disadvantage to people in rural and regional Australia. In my home state of Tasmania, which Senator Newman also represents, in Launceston unleaded petrol is 101.5c today and the GST component is 9.23c. Senator Watson is also in Launceston. In Hobart unleaded petrol is 97.4 cents. That just again illustrates the major city and rural and regional divide. The National Party, of course, have done nothing for rural and regional Australia in respect of petrol.
I have to make a comment about the Australian Democrats' position on this legislation. Of course, they are responsible for the GST, along with the Liberal-National Party. I did read your minority report, Senator Murray, on the taxation laws amendment bill. Senator Murray describes the situation that has resulted and the problems that have emerged in respect of the GST as `mischief'. He says:
The mischief that the amendment seeks to remedy is the situation where a parent entity claims an input tax ...
I must say, Senator Murray, that for you and the Australian Democrats to describe the problems of the GST as mere mischief just understates the horrors that small business are experiencing in respect of the GST.
—It's a mischievous comment.
—It is a mischievous comment, that is right. It is an extremely misleading adjective to use and I think it is used in the context of the Australian Democrats' extreme embarrassment at having to front up here in the Senate chamber at this time of the year, six months after the GST, to roll back the GST in so many areas. Finally, the clock ticks over to 1,650 amendments.
—What does it weigh?
—I do not know what it weighs. I do know that the tax legislation in this country as a result of the GST is now about nine inches high. So much for a simpler tax system. I am told that the weight is five kilos. We are now up to five kilos of GST tax legislation. I will conclude my remarks there and move Labor's second reading amendment in respect of petrol prices. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
		""but the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households and calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001"".",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-12-07,"—I would describe the end of Senator Sherry's speech as reeking of Christmas spirit—impish, mischievous and, as he well knows, misrepresenting our position and our minority report. We were referring to one amendment in there and one amendment only. Let me move from that to the bill in substance. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 includes amendments to 14 different acts which cover a wide range of activities. The vast bulk of the provisions in this bill are non-controversial. I do note that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill, as they do support the GST and as they will support the GST when they go to the election, because they are certainly not going to repeal it.
One of the more significant amendments in the bill is the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to cancel an entity's GST registration where it has applied to the commissioner for cancellation before it has been registered for 12 months. My understanding is that that is a much desired amendment by small business and not-for-profits which have registered for GST purposes only to realise that they would have been better off staying out of the system and being input taxed.
This bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at the behest of the Democrats, and I would like to briefly discuss a couple of the issues raised in the submissions and during the hearings. We decided to refer the bill to the committee after receiving representations from the Association of Heads of Australian University Colleges and Halls. That organisation was concerned about the impact of a very innocuous looking amendment in schedule 6 of the bill. That amendment has the effect of applying an associate's test to the non-profit subentity provisions of the GST act.
The concept of a non-profit subentity was established to allow non-profit organisations—churches, schools, sporting clubs—to identify separate parts of their businesses as separate entities for GST purposes, even if those parts of the businesses were not separately incorporated. The purpose of deeming the entity as separate for GST purposes was to allow it to avoid the compliance burden of being a part of the registered entity. It was thought that the non-profit subentity would then be input taxed just like any other unregistered small business. The problem which has arisen is a scenario in which the parent entity—that is, the main club or school—purchases goods or services, pays GST to the supplier, claims the input tax credit based on the supply but gives those goods and services to the subentity, which then takes them out of the GST system. The ability of the parent entity to claim the input tax credit means that no GST has effectively been paid, but the subentity can on-sell the goods without charging GST. The amendments in this bill would require parent entities to value all gifts to non-profit subentities and to remit GST based on those values.
An example of the problem that the bill is trying to remedy would be as follows. The local school purchases uniforms and pays GST. It claims the input tax credits and gives the uniforms to the school shop. The school shop is a non-profit subentity, and the shop sells the uniforms to students effectively GST free. Item 18 of schedule 6 to this bill will apply an associates test to the parent entity—the school; and the subentity—the shop. Division 72 of the GST act deals with associates and provides rules which ensure that supplies without consideration to an entity's associates attract the GST and that supplies to an entity's associates for inadequate consideration are properly valued for GST purposes. The provision of new section 72-92 will result in supplies between non-profit subentities, or between a non-profit subentity and its parent entity or association with the parent entity, for a nil consideration or a consideration substantially below market value, therefore attracting GST. Therefore, parent entities will be required to put a value on every supply provided for less than its full market value or for nil consideration to and between its non-profit subentities and to account for the GST. 
There are two issues here. The first is the actual GST that would need to be remitted. That is not the major concern because, by and large, the revenue involved is relatively small. The sorts of examples that were given were things like allowing the use of meeting rooms and providing free use of photocopying and computer facilities. I do not envisage that the amount of GST on those sorts of transactions would be substantial, and the tax office could not confirm in our committee hearing that at that level they would be substantial. The second issue is, of course, compliance and the fact that this amendment will mandate the recording of all these often quite minor transactions with bodies that are often not commercial in nature. We are concerned about that compliance problem. One of the suggested partial solutions to the compliance problem was to alter the amendment to only catch the direct resale to the public of goods and services that are being gifted by or transferred at undervalue by the parent to the non-profit subentity. The problem with that solution is that it does not deal with the scenario where the parent entity purchases goods or services, claims input tax credits and gives those goods or services to the subentity, which then uses the goods or services to produce other goods. That would leave a reasonable gap in the law which we believe could be exploited.
The amendment that I will be moving when we reach the committee stage will have the effect of allowing a parent entity to make gifts to non-profit subentities to a limit of $5,000 per subentity each year. It is our hope that the threshold provided by the amendment would allow the ordinary run-of-the-mill operations of not-for-profit organisations to continue without there being a necessity to record and account for things like the use of meeting rooms. The amount of $5,000 was roughly derived by us to allow for about 20 meetings each year in meeting venues in central city locations—I know that it is an arbitrary figure, but that is how we arrived at it. I am thinking specifically of church synod offices, and I am advised that that would cover large numbers of these subentities and would serve to remove these activities from the parent's business activity statement preparation. 
I regret that the government will not, I understand, be supporting this amendment, and I regret that the opposition will probably not be supporting the amendment either. The amendment would have the effect of alleviating some of the burden of compliance that item 18 of schedule 6 will unnecessarily generate. It is a great pity that the amendment will probably be lost, despite the fact that it is one with low revenue consequences but very high compliance cost benefits through reductions in compliance costs. On this issue, the government is adopting an unnecessarily harsh and inflexible approach encouraged by the tax office. The Democrats and the not-for-profit sector represented at the hearing acknowledge the problem that the government is trying to remedy and that the tax office is concerned about, but we think we have found a reasonably simple way of alleviating the compliance burden which avoids creating a gaping hole through which tax revenue could escape.
The other issue raised before the Senate economics committee was the application of the goods and services tax to food supplied to boarding school students. Although it was raised at the hearing, it is not really part of the bill, but I draw attention to it because it was raised at the hearing. While it is not an issue raised directly by the bill, a couple of submitters to the inquiry raised the issue of GST applying to food supplied to children at boarding schools. At present, unless those supplies of food are subsumed in accommodation—which is GST free in schools—those supplies are ordinary taxable supplies and attract GST in the same way as restaurant or take-away prepared food. The simple question is: should food supplied to students in primary or secondary boarding schools be GST free or not?
There are a number of arguments for and against making food supplied in boarding schools GST free. In brief, the arguments for GST-free treatment are as follows. Food is GST free in hospitals, community and aged care centres and child-care centres—in other words, in institutions; education is GST free in philosophical and principle terms; and basic food is GST free. Therefore, food supplied as an integral part of providing education should be GST free. If the children did not board at school, the parents would be able to provide them with food purchased GST free and then prepared at home. The revenue forgone is low—it is only approximately $1.5 million per annum. The only significant argument in favour of applying the GST to such supplies is that the food provided is prepared food by definition—that is the GST versus no GST distinction—and it therefore follows that it should be consistently applied to boarding schools. 
The issue has apparently arisen because of a change to draft guidelines issued by the ATO. The original guidelines stated that food and accommodation are one supply. The guidelines were withdrawn, and food and accommodation must now be treated separately. I understand that the separate treatment must occur from 1 January 2001. I would strongly recommend that the government extend that deadline until 1 July 2001 and that they consult further with the sector. Since the amount of revenue involved is low, I see no reason why the ATO should not make that recommendation to the government and that the government should not respond to that recommendation. 
As I mentioned, the issue is not directly dealt with by this bill. Partially for that reason, and partially because of the fact that I am confident we would not have the agreement of either the government or Labor to change the treatment of those supplies, we will not be pursuing an amendment at this time. However, Minister, it is within your ability to extend the concession until 1 July and consult further. Our spokesperson on schools, Senator Allison, is currently reviewing a number of issues relating to schools in this area, several of which have arisen out of ATO rulings. The taxation of food provided in boarding schools will be considered by her in that context.
In terms of the remainder of the bill, the Democrats are supportive. I have always dismissed the idea that major tax legislation should not be amended and that it is a mess because it is amended. Every Labor tax initiative I have ever seen was amended, and it is just nonsense to pretend otherwise. I know why you make the argument. You enjoy making it, and I suppose we enjoy refuting it. I am glad that the government do amend legislation if it is found to be weak or poor in any effect. We are rapidly running out of time to deal with legislation this year, so this bill is urgent. Before I sit down I should deal with Senator Cook's second reading amendment as moved by Senator Sherry. This really is not a serious amendment. It has been brought on three times. It has been rejected twice. The first line of the amendment reads: 
... but the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households—
I return to the remarks I made the first time it was dealt with. I would like to know what taxation regime anywhere in the world does not have a serious impact on the households in the country. It would be a strange taxation system which had a minimal or a negative impact. Every taxation system has a serious impact, so this vague statement is meaningless. Does Senator Cook refer to price increases as a result of the imposition of the goods and services tax? If he does, he should say so. Or is it a reference to GST generally or just on petrol; or is it a reference to the income tax regime; or to bracket creep, which was instituted by his government; or is it a reference to the fact that taxation takes a slice of everybody's pay packet? The taxation regime covers every aspect of taxation in our tax regime, so that line of the amendment should have been corrected. However, we have still got it. What part of the total tax system, much of which the Labor government had a hand in, does Senator Cook refer to? That first line of the amendment is simply too vague and too meaningless for us to understand. The second part of the suggested second reading amendment does deserve serious attention. It reads:
... and calls on the Government to remove that effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001. 
The indexation affects not just petrol but all fuels. It also affects cigarettes, beer and spirits. We have indexation, courtesy of the Labor Party. It is a continuing policy supported by the government, so it is a bipartisan policy. There is no suggestion from Senator Cook or the Labor Party that indexation should not be continued. He is suggesting that one part—the fuel excise indexation adjustment—should be dealt with: only that portion of it occasioned by the GST spike and not by other forms of inflation. If you are going to make that recommendation, you should tell us what the costs would be. The other day I told you what the cost would be. The overall cost, as regards fuels, would be approximately $350 million, which is about 0.8 cents a litre. However, if it is applied to the entire GST indexation spike on excise, you end up with a cost of $600 million, of which about $50 million would be for beer, about $30 million for spirits and about $170 million for tobacco.
I tell the Labor Party: I think it is a legitimate policy proposal that the GST indexation spike on excise could be considered for removal, but it has to be considered across all excise and it can be considered only when the government tell us whether there is going to be enough revenue to do it. Until such time as we know what the consequences of the GST returns are, we are not going to know whether the surplus exceeds government estimates by such that they could afford it. It is only when we know we can afford it that we can consider the serious policy, and then when we consider the serious policy it is up to the government to recommend it. However, I acknowledge it is a serious policy proposal and it would kill two promises with one hit. It would go some way to meeting the government's promise on fuel, which we and others believe they underperformed on to the people of Australia. I recognise that it is not going to do that much for fuel. If you asked the motorists whether they would accept any cut, they would take a small cut.
—Particularly at this time of year.
—Particularly at this time of the year. The fact that it is 0.8 cents a litre is still worth something—in fact it is worth $300 million. It would fulfil one of the beer promises as well, because it would come off that. We all recognise that, if you adopt that policy, it will be giving a free kick to spirits and tobacco. We have to work out whether that is justifiable. As I said the other day, my own belief is that the pricing of cigarettes has reached the stage where any further price increase, in revenue generation terms, would be negative because the price effects are affecting consumption in the way they are.
The net summary of my evaluation of the opposition's second reading amendment is that the first line is vague and nonsensical; the second two lines are of interest but they do not refer to the entire GST indexation spike effect on the range of all excises, not just petrol; and, of course, they do not refer to how it should be funded. If you have excess GST revenue and the government show that—which of course they have not because they put out their reports so early that we do not know that, although the Democrats think they will have enough money—it might be a rather nice present to give people in the new year. I offer the view that the Democrats would consider that seriously. My party room has not come to a view on that but, certainly, we would be interested if the Labor Party and the government were interested. With those remarks, I look forward to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—The amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage is to remove the current threat to the Regional Forest Agreement Private Forest Reserve Program in Tasmania, where $60 million from the regional forest agreement and the Natural Heritage Trust Fund has been set aside, including $10 million from the Tasmanian government, to pay landowners to protect land of high conservation value rather than to have it woodchipped. Landowners moving to do that, who are of course acting in the community interest—because these woodlands or forests have rare and endangered species or ecosystems—have discovered that, on the one hand, they are being given money to protect those woodlands or forests for the next 20 years and, on the other hand, they face a capital gains tax. Close to half of the money will be taken back by the federal government, which established the scheme and which is the primary funder. That was never made public at the time the scheme was put forward as part of the RFA package. The Prime Minister never made it clear that this was subject to capital gains tax when he announced the program in Perth, in Tasmania, in 1998. I know this scheme has the real potential to fail in its intention to protect woodlands and forests of high conservation value on private land in Tasmania. 
The amendment I have simply says that `this program will not be subject to capital gains tax' and that it ought to be passed to remove doubt over this scheme, which is being implemented but is way behind schedule at the moment. It also should be passed to remove doubt from those landowners who are considering whether or not to log their block instead of keeping it. The longer that this is delayed, the more the damage that will occur. It is, therefore, not just an amendment but it is quite an urgent amendment, which I hope the Senate will support.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-12-07,"—I will say a few brief words to sum up, but there will be an extensive debate on most of the matters that have been raised in the second reading debate. I think it would be appropriate to address those issues during the committee stage. The government has successfully implemented probably the largest structural change to the Australian economy since the Second World War. Our economy is no longer being held back by an outdated, inefficient and uncompetitive tax system.
—It was not being held back.
—I think it is a great thing in this chamber that we almost have a bipartisan position on tax reform now. I think that is very important. It rather surprises many of us in the chamber, as did the debate that led up to 1 July. Despite what my colleague Senator Sherry has said, I think Senator Murray made a very useful contribution when he reminded us that, on 1 July, the Labor Party accepted the GST as part of their overall package. I think that is a very important point. Some people listening to this debate may not be aware of that and it is probably worthwhile recording that.
—You are being mischievous.
—Senator Sherry and I have had this debate on many occasions during question time—
—We will continue to have it.
—I have no doubt that this debate will continue. Just for the record, the significance of the tax reform that we have carried out—in fact, the tax reform now—is, it seems to me, supported by virtually all people in this chamber, possibly with the sole exception of you, Senator Bartlett, and I know your strong views on this, and there may have been one of your other colleagues. Essentially, that is now the position. I think that, as many people would have recognised, the bill before us is good for business, and if it is good for business it is good for jobs. It contains finetuning measures which will increase administrative simplicity and compliance, while ensuring protection of the revenue.
—It's a rollback, Rod—be honest, don't be mischievous.
—I am a bit surprised that Senator Sherry has used the `r' word as my understanding is that that word was to be banned by the Labor Party. I refuse to be provoked. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to monitor the implementation of the new tax system and listen to concerns raised by the community, tax practitioners, industry representatives, the ATO and the states and territories. The bill makes minor and technical changes in order to improve the operation of the new tax system. They are minor and technical changes, Senator Sherry—not a rollback; not the `r' word. While the bill contains no substantive policy issues, its measures will be welcomed by business. The main measures in this bill provide for increased flexibility to cancel GST registrations, changes to the way that debts are offset against business activity statement refunds, increased flexibility to revoke monthly tax period elections, finetuning of the treatment of financial services, changes to the GST treatment of representatives of incapacitated entities, finetuning of the treatment of reimportations and temporary importations, and a better interaction of the fringe benefits tax and GST. 
We will, of course, not be supporting the second reading amendment, for reasons which have been tirelessly stated in debates in this chamber. I will not take up the time of the chamber by re-running those debates. This government meets its commitments, except where the Senate has stopped us keeping our promises. As I have often said, this Senate has forced the government on a couple of occasions not to meets its election commitments it made to the people. But, again, that is a debate for another day. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment. I commend this very important bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Sherry's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The position of the Labor Party on these matters has been spelt out very clearly in the House of Representatives this afternoon and by me here in the Senate. In fact, the opposition has today tabled a private member's bill in the other house which would implement in legislative form Labor's policies in regard to future policy directions that might be followed in terms of trying to redress some of the most serious flaws in this legislation. The opposition was successful, with the Democrats, in having the Senate pass some 23 amendments to this bill, which covered issues such as the objects of the bill, the question of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, the strengthening of educational accountability, measures in regard to the Commonwealth assistance for capital projects, various listings for non-government schools and eligibility guidelines for assistance, and various other accountability measures in regard to information about grants, financial questionnaires and the like. These measures together would have made this bill a lot fairer than it currently is.
The enrolment benchmark adjustment was clearly the most serious issue, and the government here has remained intransigent. The EBA is a policy which all sectors of the education community are arguing ought to be abolished. The minister is quite alone on this question. The effect of this policy has seen the removal of moneys from the public education system. It has seen the operation of Dr Kemp's ideology, if you like, in terms of his discriminatory attitude towards public education in this country. What the minister has done is to effectively make a rod for his own back. I think that in due course this will come to be seen by even the government itself.
I have explained in detail to the Senate my concerns about the unfairness, the injustice and the divisiveness of this bill, so I will not go to those issues in any length, but I do believe that this government will be obliged to change its position, just as it was obliged to change its position on the issue of Greenwich University. It did, Minister, on the question of Greenwich University because when I raised the issue of Greenwich University you, Senator Tierney and Senator Abetz said that the concerns that I had were not justified—all of you. You, Minister, made it perfectly clear that the government's view in regard to that outfit out there at Norfolk Island, this interloper, was justified. I ask you, Minister: can you now confirm for me that the Gallagher committee of inquiry report into this dubious entity has discovered that this government effectively has now dumped Greenwich University, that the opposition's concerns in that regard have been completely vindicated and that the government has effectively given a thumbs down to this university? I am sure, just as it has done in the case of the university out at Norfolk Island, it will in due course have to understand that, in terms of the states grants policy, its attitude is completely wrong. As I understand it, the minister is likely to announce very shortly that the committee of inquiry has found that, in terms of the standards and the quality, for reasons relating to the failure to meet the normal standards for an Australian university, the government will not be allowing the Australian qualifications framework to recognise Greenwich University. I believe that the same sorts of questions will arise about the government's schools policy and you will see that the government will be obliged to reassess its attitude.
As I understand it, the report on the state-Commonwealth committee into Greenwich has in fact vindicated all the concerns that I raised initially in the parliament and through the Senate estimates committee. These, as I said, were dismissed by the government as trifling and misguided. In fact, Minister, it was the actions of the government that saw this matter raised through the Senate Privileges Committee. I was asked to retract my statements in respect of questions about the quality of teaching, scholarship and research at Greenwich. It is now clear why I did not retract those statements and why I firmly believe that the government's attitude in terms of quality in education has been so badly misguided. This government, in the schools area, will I am sure equally have to face up to the responsibility it has for the damage done through its cavalier and callous attitude towards the education of our young. 
The other issue I would like to briefly touch upon is the question of the Blue Gum School, which I raised on previous occasions. It was said by officers to you, Minister, at the previous hearing that the reason Blue Gum had not been allowed to receive Commonwealth assistance was that they had not applied. There were previous discussions here that they had not applied.
—No, they were not registered; I did not say they had not applied.
—That was the first question. At the Senate estimates you said that they had not applied and in here you said they had not applied. Then you said that they were not registered. What we have been able to discover since then is that there is a somewhat inconsistent attitude on this issue in terms of the statements made by the minister's office and by DETYA officers to Blue Gum regarding applications for federal government assistance. The registry of guidelines indicated, according to the correspondence I have from the school concerned, that state registration was not an issue that became apparent to them until it was raised here. For instance, when I asked the question on 30 November concerning the school, Minister, you stated that the Commonwealth assistance was contingent on a school being recognised and registered by a state and territory. I believe the statement you made was: `Blue Gum cannot meet the provisions for that Commonwealth assistance.'
This statement, according to Blue Gum, is false. In accordance with the requirements of ACT school registration, Blue Gum School notified the Australian Capital Territory education minister in 1999 that it intended to open as a registered school in 2001, after operating highly successful preschool and kindergarten classes throughout 1998. The Blue Gum School lodged comprehensive documentation detailing its philosophy, educational program and so on with the education department, as required, in early August 2000. As was the usual practice, the ACT education department planned to finalise their school registration just prior to the official school opening next year. As I understand it, the statements that have been made resulted from conflicting advice which had actually emanated from DETYA or Dr Kemp's office to this particular school. The statement I have from the school says that they received different advice from different sections of the government on this matter. On the one hand they were told that they must get registration and on the other hand that they did not require registration. I am concerned about that matter, Minister. I am concerned that the department may not have got all the information in relation to this particular school. 
I received a statement today from this school which says that the human rights office is investigating a religious discrimination claim by the Blue Gum School arising from the federal government's new SES schools funding model. It says that, under the new SES funding model, new Catholic schools in the Australian Capital Territory will receive $2,964 per student while comparable non-Catholic schools, such as Blue Gum, will attract only $1,947 per student—$1,000 less. It is claiming that it is blatant discrimination. It says that it is not fair, that it is not equitable, that it is not simple and that it is not transparent. It is arguing that this is a cynical exercise in vote buying. It is quite an interesting statement, Minister; I trust you have seen it or that your attention has been drawn to it. As I said, this school is taking its concerns up with the human rights office.
The fundamental position on these issues is that the government is seeking to blackmail 3.2 million Australian children. It is insisting upon this legislation going though without amendment irrespective of the demonstrable case, the overwhelming case, that has been made for why it is so unfair and so unjust. This government is holding 10,000 schools to ransom and, in doing so, it is bringing no credit to itself whatsoever. The Labor Party in government will address this. We will campaign on this issue in the run-up to the election, and we have made perfectly clear, by way of a private member's bill, the nature of our commitments, if those who are interested in this issue have not already understood the concerns that we have raised about this bill and the reason why we think it is so unfair, so unjust and so divisive.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Can I suggest—subject to other parties, of course—that we handle Nos 1, 5, 6, 17, 18, 19 and 20 together. I indicate that we will be pursuing No. 23, which is the clause that relates to the draft regulations being available for public comment for a period of the not less than 30 days before the regs are made. In relation to the others, No. 2 goes to the definition of `ecological sustainability'. We are in a bit of a bind right now, because we have asked the Senate staff to prepare an amendment to replace the existing one with the definition of `ecological sustainability' which appears in the EPBC legislation. It is a bit more comprehensive, and I understand that the government may be in a position to accept that. I flag that as one that needs to be treated separately. No. 24 goes to the opposition amendment which was passed after amendment by the Australian Greens. It goes to the review of the operation of the act. We will be moving that amendment in amended form. There are, essentially, one or two words that need to be added. 
—The House of Representatives has already made an amendment to No. 24. Are you going to amend that further?
—Yes, we are proposing a further amendment to that and, once again, the government may be amenable to that. Basically, it strengthens the amendment to—
—Have these amendments been circulated?
—Well, one of the reasons why I am actually giving a full explanation now is that we need another 10 minutes or so for the staff of the Senate to circulate them. So I thought it would be opportune to at least give other parties an idea of where we are going whilst this is proceeding. So No. 24 will be circulated but strengthened to include a review of the adequacy of the penalties, together with a review as to whether CPI indexation should be adopted. The review is to make an assessment of CPI indexation, and we will come to the words when it comes to us. The other amendment which is also a live one is amendment No. 7. That is the amendment which, at this stage, lists the eligible renewable energy sources. I understand the government may be seeking to amend that to include—as well as everything else that is there—hot rocks, wave and ocean, co-firing and fuel cell.
The amendment that we do have a problem with is amendment No. 22. That amendment embraces the concept of indexation in this legislation. Indexation has always been our major concern. We have had a concern that the charges set may not be adequate enough to drive the renewable energy that the government claims it would. We have been pursuing indexation. We have been advised that, because of constitutional problems, the indexation provision is best suited in the charge bill, which is the supplementary piece of legislation currently before us, and that this amendment should not be moved to this particular legislation. So we will be considering that in respect of the charge bill.
The other major concern that we have had is the degree to which this legislation would force reliance on native forests. Our approach in that respect has been to move amendments to ensure disclosure of quite a number of things—for example, the eligible renewable power sources from which the power is intended to be generated, which is an Australian Greens amendment which we support; and the estimated average annual output of each source listed under the previous subparagraph of that amendment. We have also adopted the Greens amendment that the regulator must enter details of the application on the register of applicants for accredited power stations. Another provision is to ensure that there must be publication on the Internet within 30 days after the regulator registers a certificate. Basically, there is a whole regime to ensure disclosure of the renewable energy source and the level of dependence on such source. We felt that that level of transparency is extremely important in ensuring, before the event, that this legislation is not abused to access more than the available waste from forests. I have to say at this stage of the debate that that is still a continuing concern on our part.
We are also concerned that, in many ways, this legislation has become the victim of an industry power play. We share the aspirations, I think of everyone in this place, to generate a renewable energy industry, and we saw this legislation as a vehicle to achieve that. Our concerns as to whether it will do that have been ever increasing. One of the reasons they have been ever increasing is that we find that, over the last couple of  months, different energies have locked in behind a different aspect or another of the legislation to the extent that they may have led to a total ossification of the political process. We are keen to achieve some sort of circuit-breaker to that and to do so in a way that does protect against some of the concerns we have.
I have taken this opportunity to explain the course that we will be pursuing in this part of the debate, in part to ensure senators are aware of what we are doing but also to give the Senate staff some time to prepare the actual final words to the amendments. But, as I indicated, the changes to those amendments are major only with respect to amendment No. 24. It is a major addition in terms of scrutiny and review. We are moving the other amendments in an amended form. With respect to amendment No. 2, `ecological sustainabilities', we believe we are strengthening that amendment by picking up the EPBC amendment. With respect to amendment No. 7, we look forward to the government's amendments to that.  
—Senator Brown, before you proceed, I was thinking that, if the chamber was agreeable, we could put the amendments individually, starting at No. 1 and working through, so that we could actually get some out of the way, and then put the amendments that are to be amended. Do you follow what I am saying?",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,45,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I do, but I think it is an unacceptable situation. We are being asked to consider amendments we have not yet seen to a piece of legislation which is very important to us. We were ready to debate the Gene Technology Bill 2000 at 7.30 p.m. The agreement was that that was going to be given the rest of the evening. Suddenly we are now confronted with not only a new arrangement between the government and the Labor Party as to how they carve up the amendments which the government has not agreed to in the House of Representatives but also some entirely new amendments which we have not yet seen. I think under those circumstances we should report progress and come back to this when the amendments have appeared. I think that will save a lot of time. It is testing our forbearance—it is testing mine, I can tell you—to be dealing with this at all. I think instead of it being a shambles, which it is at the moment, we should have everything in front of us. As far as I am concerned—and I am sure as far as my Democrat colleague is concerned—we are happy to deal with the gene technology bill as well as this bill because they are both in the environmental bailiwick. The other parties are asking us to give proper consideration to new amendments while we are having to deal with the amendments in front of the committee. That is not feasible and it is not fair. The best I can make of this is that we report progress and come back to this after the gene technology bill.
—Are you moving that way, Senator Brown?
—I will move that way and see if the government and the opposition will agree to that. I will move that progress be reported because I want to expedite matters, not obstruct them. But we do have to consider those amendments, and I think it would be better if we came back after the amendments have been fixed up and all parties have had at least some time to consider them.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,45,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—I support this move. We were to have moved on to the gene technology bill at 7.30 p.m. There are very major issues to be considered in that bill, and each of us is trying to limit our remarks on this legislation. I personally have tried to truncate what I need to say in respect of the matter that is currently before the committee when that bill comes before the chamber. Again, there are a large number of people who believed that at 7.30 p.m. we would come back to the gene technology bill. I have a feeling that we will be unjustifiably accused of speaking to exhaustion on that bill when there was no such intent on my part or, I believe, on the part of other persons intimately involved in the discussions on that legislation. The sooner we get to the gene technology bill the better. There are a lot of technical matters, and we need to be pretty wide awake. Other than that, let us adjourn at 10 o'clock and come back tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,45,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—While I understand what Senator Brown is saying, none of these issues is unfamiliar to him. There have been two long debates on this bill already. Changes such as substituting the definition of ESD from the EPBC Act are something that is not unfamiliar to Senator Brown at all. There are no real surprises here, and I think that, with cooperation, we could make significant progress in a relatively short time. If we have not got cooperation, then, as we all know, at this stage of the last night, things do take a long time. But I do not think it should be necessary in this instance.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—I actually have two amendments to be moved. One was not moved last night.
—Was that your amendment No. 1 on sheet 2029?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—That is correct, Madam Chairman, you are right up to scratch.
—Are you seeking leave to move those together?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—No. I move my amendment No. 1 on sheet 2093:
(1)	New clause 192B, page 127 (after line 23), definition of cloning of a whole human being, omit ""genetically identical to the original"", substitute ""so genetically similar to the original as to be substantially identical"".
You will recall that last night there was a gag motion and, really, my amendment at that stage was given scant consideration. It is an important amendment that shows that the definition of cloning in the bill in terms of producing duplicates or descendants who are genetically identical is scientifically wanting. I want to say something about the advice given by the government, by the NHMRC and by the department of health officials. 
By the way, I have not gone to the estimates hearings of the department of late, but some of the things that have been said here influenced me to make a visit to the estimates committee and to ask a few questions. The definition of `cloning' does not include the somatic cell nuclear transfer process, which is the Dolly process. An embryo formed by that process will not be completely genetically identical. The egg used is enucleated—by the way, I like to use the word `denucleated' rather than enucleated, but enucleated is apparently the more correct word—but still contains the extra nucleate material, including the mitochondria. The mitochondria contains up to one per cent of the DNA and RNA, hence an individual formed by somatic cell nuclear transfer will not be 100 per cent genetically identical. Furthermore, a scientist wanting to avoid such a prohibition could introduce a minor genetic change. Those matters, I thought, would have been or should have been obvious to the NHMRC and to the department of health. Clearly the government was misadvised in that respect.
I also indicate in passing that last night quite incorrect comments were made by the parliamentary secretary about my amendments which would prevent work being done in respect of either somatic cell nuclear transfers—and the cloning of a human being through that—or the obtaining of stem cells from an embryo. There was some suggestion by the parliamentary secretary that there was a great need for organs and other material for an ill person. The situation is that the earliest that organs can be obtained is when the human being reaches the foetal stage. That is the earliest they can be obtained; they can be obtained then right throughout life. In effect, the advice that was given to the parliamentary secretary—and I know it was not the parliamentary secretary's intention and it certainly wasn't the government's intention—was such that it almost approved of the abortion of the foetus and the transfer of organs from the foetus. That raises enormous ethical problems. But that is an aside. 
Another point that I should raise concerns the advice that has been given in respect of what the states will do. I have seen the whips and Senator Brown. Senator Harris, I will give one to you. I seek leave to table a document from the NHMRC to all heads of state and territory departments of health.
—The normal courtesy of seeing the document has not been extended to me. I am not standing in the way of it, but normally it is a courtesy to have such documents shown before seeking leave to incorporate or table. I have not had that opportunity.
—It has gone to your whip, I understand.
—Parliamentary Secretary, I apologise but I took it to the whips. I thought that was the place to take these matters for tabling. It is only a letter from the NHMRC to the state heads.
Leave granted. 
—When I received that letter, I expressed considerable concern because, as I understood it, the minister for health had stated that he would ensure that legislation came forward in both the federal parliament and the state parliaments in respect of cloning, probably as part of ART legislation. Clearly at least three of the states have attempted that anyhow. What concerns me about that is the type of advice that may be being given to the states by the officials of the NHMRC and others.
In a letter that I sent to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Michael Wooldridge, I said:
I would like to raise an extremely serious matter concerning the briefing of Heads of All State and Territory Departments of Health in relation to a national ban on human cloning.
In a briefing note dated 1st November 2000, Dr Clive Morris of the Centre for Health Advice, Policy and Ethics, Office of the NH&MRC, included background information to the decision by Health Ministers to ban the cloning of whole human beings.
That document from Dr Morris has been tabled. To continue:
The background information includes a report about the Australian Health Ethics Committee (1998) advice to the Minister for Health on Human Cloning. Dr. Morris's report states that AHEC identified a distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning.
Therapeutic cloning is widely understood, since the publication of the Australian Academy of Sciences Position Paper on Human Cloning—
there is a misprint there; that should read `February 1999'—
to include the cloning of human embryos for experimentation or therapy but not their development beyond eight weeks when they become foetuses.
That is the Academy of Sciences position. To continue:
The reality is that the AHEC—
in their report in December 1998 to the minister—
did not identify a distinction between reproductive and therapeutic cloning in that report to the Minister. Rather than endorse cloning human embryos for experimentation to develop therapies, AHEC recommended—
in recommendation 2—
that there be legislation to regulate human embryo research according to sections 6 and 11 of the NH&MRC Guidelines for Assisted Reproductive Technology and a ban on cloning of human beings. Section 11.1 of the Guidelines declares that producing human embryos for purposes other than for use in an approved ART treatment program— 
assisted reproductive technology treatment program—
that is a program that attempts to circumvent infertility by achieving pregnancy, should be prohibited ...
In other words, cloning is out for human embryos. The letter continues:
In effect the NHMRC Guidelines would limit embryo experimentation to spare embryos on IVF & embryo transfer programs.
It should be noted that those Guidelines were issued by AHEC. Under the NHMRC Act 1992, the NHMRC is obliged to adopt guidelines for research issued by AHEC. By reporting AHEC support for producing human embryo for purposes other than ART in this way, the Office of the NHMRC is not only misrepresenting the AHEC recommendations to the Minister, it is in grave danger of being in breach of its own statute.
It is a serious matter that the Health Ministers would appear to have been misled concerning the position of AHEC in relation to cloning. It also prompts a question about the origin of the phrase ""whole human being"" in the Government's amendment to the Gene Technology Bill 2000 and the fact that the position that appears to have been adopted by the Health Ministers was based on misrepresentation of the position adopted by AHEC. If the Ministers meant to adopt AHEC's advice, then I submit that they have been badly misled as to the nature of that advice.
Yours sincerely,
Senator Brian Harradine
The purpose of my amendment now is to give effect to the government amendment adopted last night. Unless there is a proper definition of cloning which will cover the cloning techniques that I referred to, then the whole thing is inoperative. I believe it is clumsy anyhow, because it relies on criminal sanctions for enforcement and I do not think that is the most effective way to go about preventing cloning of human beings in Australia. Nobody wants to see the state police charging through laboratories and getting evidence and all the rest of it. Whereas, if you had a licensing procedure—as in the amendment I put forward that was unfortunately defeated—you would simply look up the file when a scientist publishes the results of his work and ask, `Did he have a licence to do this or didn't he?' If he did not, then he or she or the institution would be liable. That is an aside. 
I ask the parliamentary secretary—I know we had trouble getting answers the last time we met—whether the government believe that their definition of cloning is effective? Do the government believe that it is scientifically accurate that, if the identicality cornerstone is built upon, it might crumble and the whole structure fall to the ground? If the government feel that it is effective, I am not going to proceed with it. It is on their head. That is the trouble with this debate. I am afraid certain things will happen in this area in the next few years of which we will all be ashamed. If the government say that their definition, which includes the identicality cornerstone, is satisfactory technically and scientifically, I will leave it to them.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I appreciate that this is an important issue, and I thank Senator Harradine for getting in before me with regard to getting the running sheet first because it forces us to deal with what is obviously a pressing and very important issue. If we can deal with the issues that have been raised, then I feel it will free the debate to a certain extent to enable us to make good progress throughout the rest of the evening. But I do appreciate the seriousness of the issues that Senator Harradine has been pursuing with me last week in the second reading debate and in the various committee stages, which at times have taxed us both, I am sure. As I said to him over dinner tonight, at times he posed a certain question to me about the definition of `whole human being'. I recounted the story to him that I have had a heart valve replaced and I have been circumcised, so does that make me less than a whole human being or perhaps genetically modified? I think I am no less a human being, Senator Harradine, for my operations that I have had to face. However, let me get serious with regard to the legislation and address the issues that Senator Harradine has raised relating to the necessity for comprehensive and proper legislation in this regard. 
The measures in the Gene Technology Bill 2000 are interim until each state and territory has implemented appropriate legislation. As has been referred to in this debate, some states—South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia—have already enacted state specific legislation with the object of prohibiting human cloning, while others are in the process of developing legislation. It is important that the work done to date by those jurisdictions is built on to ensure that Australia has a national, comprehensive and effective prohibition on human cloning. I also appreciate the points that Senator Harradine has made with regard to the need for urgency in that area.  
The Commonwealth, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, will work with states and territories to develop a nationally consistent scheme which will comprehensively address human cloning. The NHMRC has already initiated a process of consultation with state and territory jurisdictions, and the development of the national system, which will ensure comprehensive coverage in this important area, will be undertaken carefully and inclusively. The government is aware that there is a great deal of public interest in the issue of human cloning. The inquiry currently being undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, referred to as the Andrews committee, has undertaken a wide public consultation process seeking views on human cloning, including therapeutic cloning. Both the Andrews committee and the NHMRC are expected to report on their findings in March 2001. With the comprehensive stakeholder consultation of the Andrews committee, coupled with the NHMRC's consultation with states and territories, the Commonwealth will then be in a strong and informed position to determine the need for further regulation in this area. Senator Harradine's comments are certainly very helpful in that regard, particularly with regard to the matter of priorities.
Senator Harradine is of the view that the office of the NHMRC has misrepresented the views of the Australian Health Ethics Committee on the subject of cloning of human beings. In particular, Senator Harradine believes that the Australian Health Ethics Committee did not identify a distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning, whereas the NHMRC has relied on such a distinction in briefing state and territory health ministers on cloning issues. I am advised that this is not the case. The report that both Senator Harradine and the office of the NHMRC were quoting was a December 1998 report from the Australian Health Ethics Committee to the Minister for Health and Aged Care entitled Scientific, ethical and regulatory considerations relevant to cloning of human beings. In this report, the Australian Health Ethics Committee did make a distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. In fact, this was written into the terms of reference provided to AHEC by the minister. Reference No. 1 reads: 
distinguish between the cloning of human beings and human tissue and identify the considerations for each technique;
In its report, AHEC outlined and discussed considerations relevant to both the cloning of human beings and what is commonly referred to as therapeutic cloning. At the end of `Chapter 3—ethical issues' on page 31, the report states:
A distinction has been drawn between the cloning of human `wholes' and the cloning of the component `parts' of a human being.
The Office of the NHMRC has not misled, either intentionally or unintentionally, state and territory health ministers or state and territory departments of health on this matter. The guidelines were never intended to have a broader application than in the regulation of ART, for example, through the inclusion in the Gene Technology Bill. In terms of Senator Harradine's query about definitions, the government believes that its language is consistent with World Health Organisation resolutions on this matter.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,—I support Senator Harradine on this and I have not clearly heard from the government any reason as to why his amendment should not be adopted.,SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I also rise to speak to Senator Harradine's new amendment. I notice that he has changed the positioning of the definition. Senator Harradine's definition was originally intended for the front of the bill. The government put up an argument last time that it is more appropriate in the back of the bill in the miscellaneous section, so Senator Harradine has accommodated the government in that sense with his amendment. He has also moved closer towards what I believe the government should accept, because he has moved an amendment now only relating to the last section of the government's own amendment—that is, the reference to `genetically identical to the original'. Senator Harradine is asking this committee to accept the closing paragraph to read: 
so genetically similar to the original as to be substantially identical.
In identifying the problem that he had with the government's amendment and now proposing this change to the latter part only of the government's amendment, I believe Senator Harradine is also addressing an issue that I raised in relation to this same definition of the cloning of a whole human being, in that the process of transferring any gene or any string of DNA across would require a marker. It could be legally argued that the fact of that string of DNA coming across with the marker made it substantially different. I believe in moving in both of those directions: to place the definition in the area where the government believes it should be, and also accepting substantially the government's amendment and only amending that last section. I believe Senator Harradine has come up with an acceptable amendment and I commend it to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—I state again for the record the fact that the Australian Democrats have for many years argued the need for government action on the issue of banning human reproductive cloning. So I find myself once again in an interesting position tonight, because my only concern is the relevance of this debate in the context of the Gene Technology Bill. I think the government has made an attempt to respond to some of the justifiable concerns brought forward by Senator Harradine in the context of this debate. He raised these concerns before the debate commenced last Thursday night and had his amendments available to us. The issue of a definition of human reproductive cloning is a complex one. It is one that we should spend more time on, and I do not mean this evening or in the early hours of the morning. I think that we should take into account the public consultations that have occurred and the work of the NHMRC and the AHEC. Senator Harris, I take on board your comments in relation to the definition. I know that Senator Harradine has worked hard to come up with a definition, and I acknowledge the government has, but I want to spend more time on this. This is not the time to be having this debate.
Having said that, I again want to reiterate for the record that the Democrats have been very vocal on this issue for many years. I actually looked up an article that I wrote for the Canberra Times in June 1998, where I said:
... unfortunately he—
meaning the Minister for Health and Family Services, Minister Wooldridge—
has taken no action to prevent human cloning beyond the scope of existing regulation.
So I acknowledge that there is a role for the parliament in determining in legislation that human reproductive cloning is banned. I am glad that the government and others in the chamber recognise the difference between human therapeutic cloning, and its potential and dazzling benefits, and human reproductive cloning. This is a debate I look forward to having. I tried many years ago, in fact on a couple of occasions, to have a Senate select committee inquiry into some of these issues, and I thank Senator Harradine for his support on those occasions. Labor and Liberal both voted against that proposal on at least two occasions. But this is not the time to come up with a definition of human reproductive cloning and it is not the bill in which to ban it. I look forward to a government commitment to introduce separate legislation to do just that. I find it odd that the government would argue against Senator Harradine's amendments earlier this week not only on the grounds of difficulties with the definition but on the grounds of relevance and then respond to that with an amendment that I would consider equally hastily drafted. 
We know from the legislation that does exist in three of the states that human reproductive cloning is in essence banned and that the definitions that have been developed in a hasty fashion have caused problems—because of the nature of this technology, because of the fact that the science is happening so quickly. I am going to assume the bona fides of the government on this one. I am going to assume that Senator Tambling on behalf of the government is committed to banning human reproductive cloning in law. Certainly he has provided us much too much information about his own personal health experiences tonight—very interesting, Minister. I thought a knee reconstruction was good; but, no—you have certainly impressed us all. I am going to assume that the government is committed to this course of action. I do not think the government should have introduced `counter amendments', if you like, because I am not satisfied with the government amendments in their current form. Therefore, I do not see a need currently for Senator Harradine to amend those amendments put forward by government.
I actually think we should take some time out, we should wait for the report of the Andrews committee. I have already put on record some of my concerns with that committee process, and I have already cited some excerpts from the Academy of Science submission to that committee.
—Through you, Chair, to Senator Harradine: I know that there are vested interests too. I think there are also vested interests provided by those witnesses who appeared before the committee and who are not scientists. But I am one of the first people to acknowledge that we should take science out of the realm of simply the experts, that the community has to be involved in any legislative debate on science policy and science matters. That is why we should return to the substance of the Gene Technology Bill 2000 debate and we should be urging the government to adopt the amendments put forward by Senators Harris and Brown and me, on behalf of the Democrats, which actually give the public some reason to have faith in the national regulatory framework that we are trying to develop for GMOs. That is not to say I am against banning human reproductive cloning, because for a long time I have been in favour of such legislative action. But this is not the bill in which to do it; this is not the time frame in which to do it—certainly not 9 o'clock on the last night of the Senate session for this year.
I want us to include the community and I want it to be a much more well thought out process than what we have here, not because I doubt the commitment of those who are in the chamber, but I do doubt the commitment of the two old parties on this issue. That is why we find ourselves tonight debating this legislation when everyone else has either taken pairs to go home or has wanted to get their legislation, which they saw as more important or faster, over and done with. Chair, I have already put on the record that I am appalled—as is my party—by the way that this bill has been pushed aside, that the crossbench amendments have been dealt with in a peripheral fashion in an attempt to just speed this process up and rubber-stamp the Labor-Liberal deal. I think the public are much more concerned about the regulation of genetically modified organisms and GM foods. I think they are much more concerned than that. I am sure that anyone in this chamber who has looked at their emails over the past couple of days would know that.
So I would like to move on from the human reproductive-cloning debate, as much as I think it is important and as much as I have tried, since my first days in this place back in 1995, to debate these issues. So in some respects it breaks my heart that we cannot have a substantial debate about it at the moment. But I do recognise that we are dealing with legislation that is related but that it is not necessarily the best place in which to have this debate. So I put on record congratulations for Senator Harradine for raising the issues and for those people who support his amendments, but I find it a little odd that the government feels that it has had to offer a counter-argument, as opposed to giving a commitment to develop legislation that would deal with this issue in a much more comprehensive and publicly inclusive fashion. ",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I will get back to the amendment that is before the chamber. I put the position of the opposition last week and again earlier this week. Our position is one that I think originally was the position of the government and certainly has been also put by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats. That is, that we did not think at the outset that it was appropriate that we seek to include in this legislation provisions along the lines suggested by Senator Harradine to deal with that complex issue of human cloning. We dealt with the issue the other night when we debated the government's amendment and rejected the first amendment put by Senator Harradine.
I have to say I find myself somewhat in agreement with some of the comments made by Senator Stott Despoja about the position that was adopted by the government to try to clarify it, as it were, and, I think, to try to respond to reach some level of agreement with Senator Harradine. We were happy to support that because of the reasons that were specifically outlined, that the definition came from the NHMRC and was grounded in the area of that authority and it was a recognised definition from the World Health Organisation.
I understand that Senator Harradine believes that is inappropriate or insufficient, but that is a debate that needs to be had at another time in other legislation. I think we fall into the danger here of trying to draft legislation on the run. Rather, the various issues that have been raised in this bill and in all of the other amendments are ones, whether you agree or disagree with the various amendments being put forward by the various parties in the Senate, that have been out there in the public arena and before senators in one way or another for some time through the committee process and through the actual presentation of the legislation itself to the chamber. These are issues—as important as they may be, and as much as I respect Senator Harradine for the views that he holds on this issue, which I think are shared by all of us in respect of prohibiting human cloning—that have essentially been introduced into this debate on this legislation at the 11th hour. There is another time and another place, and we hope it will not be too long before we can have that debate properly and pass appropriate legislation, just as we are endeavouring to do in respect of this bill.
—The government appreciate the point that was made by Senator Harris and others about `identical'. A human clone will have an identical genome to the original, and therefore the government believe that the definition we have adopted is a practical way of instituting a ban on cloning. I state again that this definition is consistent with those in use elsewhere—and I hope this also satisfies Senator Brown in his quest for a reason for our actions in this regard.
I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that there are complex issues which are currently being addressed by processes under way in other places, and I restate the commitment and statement that I gave to Senator Harradine earlier this evening that we are mindful of the need for progressing the debate in a fast-track manner and with a certain degree of urgency. I hope he can accept our assurances that we will bring to bear pressures on the various bodies undertaking work in this area and also in collaboration with the states on this matter.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—First of all, I should make it perfectly clear that, over the many years I have been in this place, the National Health and Medical Research Council and some of the officers I have been in touch with or who have been in touch with me over the years, including at estimates committees, have been professional to the nth degree. But, frankly, I do disagree entirely with the impression that has been given to the states and the statement also that was made by the officer in the tabled document on the need to draw a basic distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. I think this is where the misunderstanding takes place. 
Therapeutic cloning is used by the Academy of Science as including the cloning of human embryos for experimentation or therapy but not the development beyond eight weeks, when they become foetuses. Quite frankly, that is certainly not what AHEC was saying. The parliamentary secretary referred to the distinction that was made between the cloning of human beings and human tissue—that is what the Australian Health Ethics Committee was about—and human tissue is not a human embryo. So I think there is a complete misunderstanding; obviously in the mind of Dr Morrison there is a misunderstanding. My worry is that that misunderstanding is going to go to the state people that will be involved. Furthermore, that is made perfectly clear later on in that document where it talks about a distinction being drawn between the cloning of human wholes and the cloning of component parts of a human being. That did not mean cloning human embryos; they were cloning human parts. As a scientist friend of mine who today sent me a very interesting document about that said: 
As ""whole"" and ""part"" are antonyms, there is no scope for having entities which are in between, or neither whole nor part. It will be ridiculous, both semantically and biologically to classify an embryo, irrespective of whether it is a single cell zygote or late blastocyst of hundreds of cells, as a part.
I will leave it at that. 
I think it is necessary, however, to reiterate what the Australian Health Ethics Committee in its report of December 1998 recommended in its advice to the minister for health, that advice being on human cloning, that there be legislation in accordance with the NHMRC 1996 guidelines for assisted reproductive technology. Now, 11.1 of these guidelines prohibits developing a human embryo other than for an approved ART treatment. Of course, that is a problem, but it cannot involve this piece of legislation because this is GMO legislation. The developing of a human embryo there does not involve cloning in an ART program. Thus, producing embryos is limited to producing them for transfer to a woman in order that she might become pregnant. Hence deliberately producing human embryos for research or other non-ART procedures such as for harvesting stem cells and culturing tissue for transplantation is to be prohibited. The NHMRC thus recommends limiting experimentation on embryos to spare embryos. Again, that is a problem, but it cannot be dealt with in this legislation. 
AHEC also recommends banning cloning in the terms of the UNESCO 1997 Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, which at least means not cloning embryos for use in an ART treatment procedure. UNESCO did not make the therapeutic reproductive cloning distinction but called for a ban on reproductive cloning without specifying the meaning. In fact, AHEC does not make that distinction either. Do I hear from the parliamentary secretary that the scientific experts are satisfied—obviously the NHMRC and health department are satisfied—that the definition of cloning you have adopted, which I am trying to amend, is scientifically accurate? If that is the case, I will withdraw the amendment I am putting forward. There is no point in carrying on about it and we ought to be able to get back to the other areas in this legislation, after one more thing which should not take more than about seven minutes or so.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I thank Senator Harradine for his comments in that regard and also the question that he has raised. I assure him we do believe that, on the advice we have, the definitions we have included are, as he says, scientifically based and meet the concerns in that regard. I have certainly attempted to cover Senator Harradine's concerns in this regard on this matter. In addition, I understand that the minister will be responding separately to Senator Harradine directly in writing on the issues he has canvassed both in here and in correspondence with the minister. Coupling that with the intent to look at the legislation separately and comprehensively, I would welcome his offer with regard to withdrawing the amendment.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—Whilst we are in the spirit of withdrawing, that would probably mean that it would be appropriate for the government also to not proceed with amendment No. 1 on sheet ED229 `after clause 192', on the top of page 6 of the running sheet.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—by leave—Obviously there is no point in proceeding with that, so I withdraw amendment No. 1 on sheet 2029. I still have amendment No. 1 on sheet 2073 to move. It is an amendment that was adopted at the end of the sitting on Tuesday morning. It was to qualify the use of the words `whole human being'. I think I am satisfied with what people are referring to as a whole human being. I will go back to my scientific colleague again and read into the Hansard what he said about the Hansard of Monday, 4 December 2000 in respect of a whole human being:
Reference is made to several points in the Senate Hansard of Monday, 4 December 2000 to a ""whole human being"". It appears that the intent of the Bill before the chamber is to use this term in an exclusion sense, namely that the procedure under discussion (cloning) shall not be undertaken to produce a ""whole human being"" but may be undertaken to produce other entities that cannot be so described.
In the absence of any definition of what is intended by a ""whole human being"" the reasonable, and I believe the only semantically logical construction, that can be placed on the phrase is that permissibility may extend to parts (of a human being) but that production of the whole is proscribed. This interpretation would be consistent with the terminology adopted in the AHEC report of 16 December, 1998. The distinction was drawn in the opening paragraph (1.1) of that report as follows: ""There is an international consensus that a distinction should be drawn between two categories of cloning: cloning of a human being and copying (cloning) of human component parts (italics in original) such as DNA and cells"" ...
When the issue before the chamber is presented as a definition of what may be permissible rather than that of what is prohibited, the answer must be procedures undertaken on parts, the semantic distinction intended by AHEC. As ""whole"" and ""part"" are antonyms, there is no scope for having entities which are in between, or neither whole nor part. It will be ridiculous, both semantically and biologically to classify an embryo, irrespective of whether it is a single cell zygote or late blastocyst of hundreds of cells, as a part.
If clarity is sought in the drafting of this legislation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the meaning of ""whole human being"" is in accord with the international consensus referred to by AHEC rather than having some idiosyncratic meaning peculiar to this legislation.

As part of the process, I will be pleased to refer them back to the NHMRC and the Andrews committee, and I will certainly draw them to the attention of the state health ministers.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-07,"—I refer to Senator Herron's response at question time to my question as to what is meant by the term `whole human being'. Senator Herron stated, after talking about Juvenal's satires:
I understand that Senator Harradine is speaking in the context of the present debate, so I will give it a try. As I understand it, a human being commences at the time of fertilisation of a human ovum by a human sperm and it continues until the death of that being.

 (Senator Watson)—Is that the wish of the committee? 
—What is meant by `the top of the running sheet'? 
—There are a number of amendments on the first page that have not been moved.
—I suggest, as I have been waiting for some time, that we move the Australian Greens amendments which are coming next, and then I will be happy to return to the sheet.
—It being the wish of the committee, you may proceed.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—by leave—I thank the committee. I move Australian Greens amendments (67) and (70):
(67)	Clause 61, page 42 (line 5), omit paragraph (a), substitute:
	(a)	the conditions set out in sections 63, 64, 65, 66, 66A or 66B;
(70)	Page 45 (after line 4), after clause 66, insert:
66A  Condition about confinement of licensed dealings to specified geographic area
		It is a condition of a licence that the licence holder and any person covered by the licence:
	(a)	carry out the licensed dealings only in the geographic area or areas specified in the licence; and
	(b)	use his or her best endeavours to confine the GMO or its genetic material to the geographic area or areas specified in the licence.
Following this, I will move amendment (71). Amendment (67) is consequential on amendment (70). It says that it is a condition of giving a licence to somebody who is planting genetically engineered crops that the licence holder carry out those plantings only in the geographic area specified and that they, using their best endeavours, confine the genetically modified organism to that area—in other words, they cannot let it escape.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—I am glad that Senator Brown separated amendment (71) from the other amendments because I think the insurance condition should be separate from the location issues. The Democrats will certainly support that very straightforward, very sensible first set of amendments, which make it clear that it is the responsibility of a person who holds a licence to make sure that the GM does not spread. These are some of the issues we discussed earlier on in the debate, certainly in response to Senator Harris's amendments. We were talking about transportation issues and the consequences of an open truck carrying canola, or whatever it might be, and potentially contaminating other crops unknowingly. 
I cannot see how the government would have a problem with these amendments, especially when it says that the licence holder must `use his or her best endeavours to confine the GMO or its genetic material to the geographic area or areas specified by the licence'. The licence already specifies the areas where the person is entitled to grow that crop or have that genetic material. The amendments are not really that prescriptive either: `use his or her best endeavours'. I think they are quite generous amendments in that respect. As for clause (a) of amendment No. 70, that it is carried out in the geographic area or areas specified in the licence, I think that should be a mandatory condition of any licence in relation to this approval process.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government opposes these amendments. The amendments propose the inclusion of an additional statutory condition of licence that requires that all dealings with GMOs only be carried out in specified geographic areas. The government does not support this. The amendments assume that one size fits all and that the same conditions should be applied to all licences. This is simply not workable. For example, in regard to Ingard, genetically modified cotton, it would be impossible to say that all dealings with the GM cotton would occur in specified locations. This is because the dealings would include transport of the cotton crop, milling of cotton, storing of cotton and all the things that may be done with cotton through growing, harvesting, transporting, packaging, selling and domestic use. It is clearly ridiculous to suggest that the licence should prescribe precisely where all of these activities take place. The regulator must have discretion to impose appropriate conditions on a case by case basis, and the government therefore opposes the amendments. ",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I would like to explore some of the extremely important issues that Senator Tambling has just raised in relation to cotton. I draw the honourable senator's attention to a bill which the government has recently passed through this chamber relating to the tobacco industry. What does the government require there? The government requires a person who is dealing with tobacco not only to have a licence to plant and grow it but also to have a licence to drive down the road to pick up the seed. Then, if they want to plant that seed on a property different from the one nominated on the licence, they need a licence to transport it to that property and a licence to grow it on the second property. When they are harvesting it, they then need a licence to move it as well.
What Senator Tambling is claiming is unworkable in this bill is apparently extremely workable in the tobacco industry. To my knowledge tobacco is not genetically modified. So we have the situation where one industry is required to have licences to drive down the road with a product that is not genetically modified; yet Senator Tambling is saying that it is impossible to control or to issue licences to people who are going to have the authority to release into the environment a genetically modified product. The two situations are opposites. If ever there is an industry that should be licensed for everywhere they plant and everywhere they cart, it should be a product that is genetically modified. You only have to drive around Central Queensland when the cotton is being harvested to find the product strewn along the road. This makes Senator Brown's amendment vital. People who wish to produce genetically modified cotton should be required to contain that product within the vehicles as they travel down the road, and should be licensed to do so.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—The whole point is that, if this industry is going to be properly regulated without causing damage to the organic farming industry and to agriculture which is not genetically engineered, then it needs tracing. There is a responsibility on those who plant GE crops to see that they are traced all the way through to the Kelloggs cornflakes box. If they are not, then the damage penalties can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, as was recently seen in the United States. If this industry is going to be properly regulated, it has to be responsible for where the genetically engineered material ends up because the world and consumer markets say, `We want GE free produce. We want GE free food.' The only way you can guarantee that is by keeping the GE contaminated product separate. Who does the responsibility go to? It goes to those who want to grow and deal in GE products.
This amendment says `Let us have a start to that process. For those people who get licences to put crops in certain geographical areas, this is where they have to keep them. If they are going to move their crops, then they have to have a licence for that as well.' This amendment is very important. It is clear the government is not going to support it. I expect the Labor Party might be able to follow the logic a bit better than the government. ",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—Briefly in response to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care said—that is, basically that licence holders have to be determined on a case by case basis—this amendment does not stop that case by case process. What it says, simply, is that, once you have determined the geographic area in which someone is growing a genetic material, then they have to carry out what they have applied for in the licence in that specific geographic area. It is just holding them predictably and presumably to the information they were already providing when they applied for the licence. I do not see why this is such a problem for the government. 
I suggest that Senator Tambling getting frustrated by the fact that Senator Harris may pop up to speak on this amendment—when we are deliberately trying to get through the 40-odd amendments quickly—is not going to endear him to the crossbenches. I say that because we have accommodated this debate in that it has been put on not at 7.30 p.m., as originally scheduled a couple of days ago, but at 8.30 p.m. on the last sitting night of the year. It has been designed—we are not on broadcast, for a start—in a way that gets rid of the so-called peripheral amendments of the crossbenchers, amendments which, in most cases—certainly some of those put forward by Senator Harris—reflect the recommendations outlined in the majority report of the committee that investigated this bill. Those amendments are quickly being abandoned in most cases by the Labor Party, which actually signed off on them. 
Senator Tambling can express his frustration but it is nothing compared to the frustration that some of us on the crossbenches are feeling in relation to the way this debate has been run and it is nothing compared to the frustration that the people of Australia are feeling, especially those who have tried to monitor this debate, given that they have strong feelings about GMOs. This is still one of the most fundamental pieces of legislation that this parliament will address. Yet a simple amendment that would ensure lesser conditions than those that apply to the tobacco industry, as Senator Harris has pointed out, is not acceptable to government. I have already expressed my concern about the way this debate is running. I think that coming back tomorrow may be not such a bad idea if it means that we do not have to fast-track a piece of legislation that is going to give us insufficient standards for the regulation and approval of GMOs.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The opposition will not be supporting these amendments. I think the comment made by the parliamentary secretary that one size does not fit all is appropriate in these circumstances. This is legislation that is not going to just regulate one specific industry, Senator Harris. This is legislation that is going to apply across a broad range of industries and activities. We would submit that it is appropriate that the regulator has the discretion to implement, for instance, the sorts of conditions that are contained in this clause, if it is appropriate in the circumstances. They, of course, are issues that the regulator will have to consider. The sorts of concerns that Senator Harris has outlined are the very concerns that can be put to the regulator when assessing applications—taking into account and specifying those licence requirements. There is plenty of scope for those issues to be dealt with. That is the appropriate manner to do it, not to try and make one size fit all in respect of this legislation.
In relation to the last comment of Senator Stott Despoja, it is probably going to be a long night, as we all anticipated. I hope it is not longer than it needs to be. I just make this point: when this debate is finished and when the analysis is done about the amendments that we have successfully moved and have been able to successfully negotiate and convince the government to adopt—despite their initial position—you will find that an overwhelmingly substantial proportion of the issues raised in the Senate committee report have indeed been implemented.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I would like to ask Senator Tambling whether it is the government's intention to ensure, either by legislation or by regulation, that all genetically modified crops that are either intended for stock food or are ultimately for human consumption will be separated and stored separately.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I am not asking Senator Tambling to alter this piece of legislation. What I am requesting is clarification from the government that we are going to be assured, when this bill does proceed and broadacre crops are planted, that one of the requirements—either by legislation or regulation—will be that those crops will be stored separately. If the government is not prepared to make that commitment now, we have serious concerns because of what has happened overseas. You only have to look at the issues that we reiterated the other evening regarding StarLink corn in America where, at this present moment, the industry is trying to recall nine million bushels of corn, because they cannot guarantee that they have not been mixed. I believe that it is perfectly acceptable, when we are passing or considering passing the legislation that will enable this industry to proceed, that we should have from the government an assurance that, when this industry is operating, the public will have confidence that genetically modified and non-modified food products will be separated and stored. If we cannot have that type of assurance from the government at this point in time, what assurance have we got in relation to any conditions in this bill about what would be carried out when these industries are in full production? This is the correct time for the government to make that condition or to make that indication that it will be a requirement. Yesterday, we had discussions in this chamber regarding the Internet gambling bill under which the government indicated to that industry, in a press release, that there was going to be a moratorium. That moratorium was supposedly indicated in December of last year. So the government can, and does, indicate to industries that there will be requirements. I believe it is absolutely essential that the government indicates to anybody who is going to enter into this industry that one of the requirements that they will have will be to guarantee separate storage. That is what we are asking, and I believe that is totally acceptable at this point in the debate of this bill.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—When Senator Tambling answers that question for Senator Harris, I would like him to also answer a question for me. He mentioned that there are other aspects of this legislation that take up some of these pressing issues. I am wondering if the parliamentary secretary could explain where in the legislation there is the specification of buffer zones or refuge zones.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—In answer to Senator Harris's question—which I hope he is not just getting by points off his laptop—about where it is necessary to manage risks, conditions will be imposed to address risks and, if necessary, the need for separation of crops. In answer to the questions posed by Senator Stott Despoja I indicate that the issues that she raised are in the areas of GM zones and the ability to set any licence conditions, including buffer zones and refuge zones. I would draw her attention to clause 62 of the bill. Under the section `conditions that may be prescribed or imposed', there are quite a number of conditions, going down to 2(o), in particular:
... limiting the dissemination or persistence of the GMO or its genetic material in the environment;",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I will not delay the debate on this amendment too much longer. Suffice to say to Senator Tambling: yes, the information that I am quoting from is from the laptop and it is sent from concerned Australian people. There are about 500 of them on the laptop. If I find that the issues they have asked me to raise are relevant to the amendments to the bill, I will raise them.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I move Australian Greens amendment No. 71 on sheet 1970:
(71)	Page 45 (after line 4), after clause 66A, insert:
66B  Condition about insurance
		It is a condition of a licence that the licence holder be insured for all loss or damage to human health, property or the environment that may be caused by the licensed dealing with the GMO or GM product. 
This amendment is the one to test out the government and the opposition about whether they are dinkum in believing that this bill is going to protect organic farmers around the country, genetically engineered free farmlands around the country as well as consumers. The amendment says:
It is a condition of a licence that the licence holder—
that is, the person who is licensed to deal with genetically engineered materials—
be insured for all loss or damage to human health, property or the environment that may be caused by the licensed dealing with the GMO or GM product.
This is a fundamental test of good faith. If people are growing crops that are genetically engineered, and we are assured, through the handling of their licensing by the regulator, that the safeguards under this legislation are going to guarantee the health, the environment and, indeed, the economic wellbeing of neighbours and consumers, there should be no concern about insurance premiums. In fact, the insurance premiums would be very low indeed. This is simply a fair measure which says that the alarm and concern in the community about the failure to properly regulate GMOs can be assuaged insofar as at least people will know that, if their wellbeing is threatened, there is a liability on the person from whom that threat comes that can be backed up and is backed up by insurance. I would like to hear an argument against that. This amendment is compelling and is essential if people are going to have faith in this bill.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—This amendment proposes that it be a condition of licence that all licence holders be insured. While we support the capacity for the regulator to require the licence holder to hold insurance if this is necessary, we do not support the requirement for all licence holders to hold insurance. Again, there needs to be a case by case assessment of risks, and the regulator needs to be able to apply appropriate conditions to manage risk. We will, therefore, be supporting the ALP amendment, which will be debated shortly, which enables the regulator to impose a condition of licence requiring insurance, if this is necessary, on a case by case assessment.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—As the parliamentary secretary has just indicated, the opposition will be moving an amendment to clause 62 which deals with the issue of insurance coverage. Our amendment is consistent with the recommendation of the Senate committee, which stated:
The Committee RECOMMENDS that the Bill be amended to require that in prescribing or imposing conditions of licences, the Regulator may satisfy him or herself that applicants have made provision for suitable insurance coverage to cover the risks associated with the dealings.
Our amendment picks up that recommendation entirely. The recommendation places the requirement on the regulator to make that assessment. The regulator, of course, needs to have the discretion, given that the regulator will be dealing with such a wide variety of applications, to make provision, if necessary, for suitable insurance cover to be provided.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,46,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I rise to support the Greens amendment and indicate that it is substantially similar to the amendment of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I would also take this time to comment on the amendment that the Labor Party has indicated it will move, the wording of which is similar to both the Greens amendment and the Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment. Where they differ substantially in their intent and effect is that the Labor Party amendment allows the Gene Technology Regulator the ability to decide whether insurance should be required as a part of the licence. I will just read the first line in the foreshadowed Labor amendment, which says in part:
Licence conditions may also include conditions requiring the licence holder to be adequately insured ...
However, the clear intent of the amendments of both the Greens and Pauline Hanson's One Nation is as stated in the Greens amendment, which is: 
It is a condition of a licence that the licence holder be insured for all loss or damage to human health, property or the environment that may be caused by the licensed dealing with the GMO or GM product.
So we have two totally different positions that we are coming from. The government have indicated that they will accept the Labor Party's amendment. I believe that part of the reason for that is that the insurance industry itself has clearly indicated that it has concerns relating to its exposure, should it accept insurance for genetic modification or the production of genetically modified organisms. The insurance industry is a very good measure when you are looking at whether a certain industry should or should not proceed. If the assessment of the insurance industry is such that the risk is too great for them to be exposed to, that is a clear indication that there are concerns about that operation.
So rather than have the situation where there is an independent assessment of a risk, by supporting the Labor Party's amendment the government will have the situation where these high-risk dealings with genetically modified organisms may be able to proceed without insurance—whereas it is very clear from the Greens amendment and the One Nation amendment that, if the insurance were not available, that action would not be able to be carried out. I believe that is the correct process. I would like to quote a couple of sections from an article that appeared in Switzerland on 6 September 1998. It is headed `Insurance companies fear because of genetic engineering'. It says:
The Swiss reinsurance company Rueck rings alarm in a study ...
This study is by one of the leading people in Europe. The article, which is a translation, goes on to say:
Zurich - Never before it was expressed so clearly as by the Swiss reinsurance company Rueck: The risks of genetic engineering cannot be insured anymore with traditional means.
So even the insurance industry is saying that they cannot approach the insurance of genetically modified organisms by traditional means. The article goes on to quote author Thomas Epprecht in the Sonntagszeitung:
The tone: The potential risks of genetic engineering can not be covered with classical liability insurance models: ""No, whatsoever high insurance coverage is capable to reduce the potential risk of genetic engineering.
The focal point of the rigorous analysis are the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food companies, which are applying unproportionally genetic technologies without in most cases being insured themselves against likely Genetic-damages. Therefore the Swiss Rueck not only on a global level intends to alert the primary level of the insured, but also the second level, industry and society.
So the insurance industry—not only at the primary level that would carry the initial insurance but also at the secondary level, the large reinsurance companies—is expressing concern. If the insurance companies are saying they are not willing to insure these large broadacre productions of genetically modified organisms because the risk is too high, it is clearly an indication to the government and to the opposition that, if they go forward with this intention to support Labor's amendment that the Gene Technology Regulator only may require insurance, they are allowing the exposure to the environment of risks that the insurance industry themselves clearly show are unacceptable.

	(3)	Licence conditions may also include conditions requiring the licence holder to be adequately insured against any loss, damage, or injury that may be caused to human health, property or the environment by the licensed dealing.
This amendment is to insert in clause 62 the provision that licensed conditions may also include conditions requiring a licence holder to be adequately insured against any loss, damage or injury that may be caused to human health, property or the environment by the licensed dealing. We have just had the debate about whether insurance should be specified in the act as compulsory in all situations. Our proposal is consistent with the recommendation of the Senate committee. We were criticised earlier by other parties for supposedly not following the recommendations of the committee's report. I would expect that on this occasion we would actually be congratulated for being successful in convincing the government—I believe they will support this amendment as they said earlier—to agree, and I hope all others to agree, to insert the recommendation on insurance from the committee's report into the legislation.

That is not the function of the Senate, it is not the function of the government and it should not be the function of the opposition. You should be able to answer a question like that.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I rise to indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support Labor's amendment No. 10, but indicate, as I have earlier, that it would be our preference that all dealings with GMOs as a condition of licence were insured. Part of the reason that we believe they should all be insured is that scientific evidence is showing us that there are side effects that we do not totally understand at the moment. Professor Arpad Pusztai at the Rowett Research Institute in Scotland found in experiments that the development of the brain, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and immune system were impaired in baby rats fed on genetically modified potatoes. At Cornell University, they discovered that monarch butterflies had a 50 per cent increase in mortality after eating leaves that had GE pollen on them. They were not the GE altered crops; they were just neighbouring crops that had GE pollen on them. I am using those two instances to raise the issue of what is actually unknown in relation to genetically engineered organisms. I indicate that I will support Labor's amendment. I commend them for having negotiated this amendment with the government, but I put on record that it would have been far more appropriate if insurance had been a condition of the licence and not an assessment of the Gene Technology Regulator.

	(2A)	Division 3 of Part 9 commences immediately after the Gene Technology (Licence Charges) Act 2000 commences.
These amendments deal with the issue of cost recovery. Our amendments are drafted to take cognisance of the fact that the biggest barrier that industry, research institutions and scientists in this country see to the appropriate development of gene technology is the government's policy of 100 per cent cost recovery. That strong view emerged very clearly in submissions to the Senate inquiry, in the evidence given at the public meetings and in various other consultations and discussions that we have had with representatives from both industry and science areas. Industry has made it very clear to us that if the 100 per cent cost recovery policy is implemented, particularly in the initial set-up period, the likelihood will be that Australia will miss out on what is clearly going to be a substantial area of business and research in coming years throughout the world. Simply put, 100 per cent cost recovery would be a barrier to Australian companies and overseas companies pursuing development of this technology in Australia. We are also very concerned that this policy will damage our own scientists, our own researchers, PhD students and others who are working in the field and who have made major breakthroughs in areas particularly associated with biotechnology. 
We are opposed to 100 per cent cost recovery. We have said that all along. We made those points in the majority report of the Senate committee. We are also concerned that the implementation of 100 per cent cost recovery erodes the independence of the regulator or certainly could create the perception that the independence of the regulator was less than otherwise desired. We have amendments both to this bill and to the Gene Technology (Licence Charges) Bill which would seek to defer any cost recovery until such time as the Productivity Commission report into cost recovery arrangements of government regulatory, administrative and information agencies delivers its findings in August 2001. We have endeavoured over a period of time to convince the government that they should adopt our amendments. I understand that the government are prepared to make a statement this evening about their approach to implementing any cost recovery measures in this legislation.

We certainly endorse the recommendation in the committee report that proposes the issues of cost recovery be further examined. I am glad to see some progress on this matter, although the Democrats have placed on record a number of times our concerns, and certainly a number of groups put on the record in their submissions to the Senate inquiry their concerns, that the regulator could be seen as a `captive of industry'. I think these are good amendments—a good start. But I place on record that we will monitor the feedback from KPMG and the Productivity Commission et cetera reports, and we think there is a very strong role for this body to be independent and perceived to be an independent regulator. We have already put on the record in the committee stage of the debate and also in the committee inquiry the concerns we have currently about the lack of perceived independent and rigorous scientific testing of applications that come from those people who might be applying for a licence. So I look forward to seeing the government provide funding for this body, and I think that is one way of instilling some of that public confidence to which I earlier referred—that is, if people are going to feel that this framework is working for them and that it is not held captive to the interests of industry and some of those huge multinational companies that have been mentioned in this debate already.

The position that has been outlined by the government will actually result in cost recovery being deferred for two years, which is beyond the period I referred to in relation to the amendments—that is, until the report of the Productivity Commission which is scheduled for August 2001. We note that any future cost recovery measures will need to be introduced by way of regulation as disallowable instruments, which means that they come back to this chamber and are debated and determined by the Senate. On that basis, we appreciate the undertaking given by the government and are happy to withdraw our amendments (1) and (2). I look forward with anticipation to reading Senator Brown's media release tomorrow morning and his web site where he will be congratulating the opposition for a significant achievement in actually being able to convince the government to pick up the spirit of our amendment, and even take it a bit further and give the guarantees they have given!

by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.

	(a)	provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or environmental degradation; and
I noticed earlier, when I think Senator Tambling said it would be good to return to the beginning of the running sheet, that my colleague Senator Bartlett interjected and said that it is actually hard to return to something that you have not already debated or dealt with. So I welcome, finally, belatedly, a discussion of some of the key issues that we should be debating: that is, the objects of the act. There have been a number of amendments moved by honourable senators that relate to the objects of the act. The amendment that I am moving on behalf of the Democrats firstly proposes that the objects of the act read:
	(a)	to protect the health and safety of people; and
	(b)	to promote ecological sustainability; and
	(c)	to protect the environment;
by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.
The second amendment standing in my name on behalf of the Democrats deals with the precautionary principle, following the recommendation as outlined in the Senate committee's majority report on this bill: that is, the legislation be amended to adopt the precautionary principle outlined in the EPBC Act.
I understand that Senator Hill is here to debate another piece of legislation. Perhaps it would be better to wait and discuss these amendments in the context of some of the other amendments that have been moved in relation to precautionary principles and the objects of the act. I am happy to adjourn my comments and allow the minister to proceed, much as I am sure that he would have a lot to say on the definition of the precautionary principle as contained in the EPBC Act. Perhaps he might join us later when we pursue these amendments in more detail.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Madam Chair, I suggest that, in place of the amendment that the Senate passed last time, we adopt the form of words that I have circulated. In essence, they come from the government's EPBC legislation, which at a previous stage was passed by the Senate with the support of the Democrats. I think it is a stronger definition of ecological sustainability and I would reckon that, given the origin of it, it would be very hard for the government to oppose this amendment. It ties in with amendment No. 1, which Senator Brown said, quite rightly, was one of his amendments. The objects would sit together with the definition, and I think this definition would probably strengthen the earlier interrelationship between the objects and the definition clause. I move:
(1)	Clause 5, page 3 (after line 22), after the definition of document, insert:
ecologically sustainable means that an action is consistent with the following principles of ecologically sustainable development:
	(a)	decision-making processes should effectively integrate both long-term and short-term economic, environmental, social and equitable considerations;
	(b)	if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation;
	(c)	the principle of inter-generational equity, which is that the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations;
	(d)	the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity should be a fundamental consideration in decision-making;
	(e)	improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms should be promoted.

If the forestry operation to which Senator Brown is referring is an operation that is being conducted according to those management plans, which I presume it is, then it would by definition be ecologically sustainable.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I will not go around in circles, but I will just tell you what I think of that. Here we have the destruction of the world's tallest hardwood forests, the wildlife in them, eagle nesting sites, the habitat of rare and endangered species, all the understorey and the rainforest underneath—the whole living ecosystem which has been evolving and persisting there over thousands of years—by a process of woodchipping, firebombing and poisoning, and this government calls that ecologically sustainable. That is dishonest. That is shameful. That is deceitful. That is a cheat. And it shows what we are going to get further out of this legislation. 
This government is saying under this legislation that the destruction of forests in Australia—and it will extend right through to woodlands in Queensland and forests in south-west Western Australia—is going to be permitted in order to produce electricity which is then going to be called ecologically sustainable and sold to the public as green energy. I do not know how Senator Hill as minister for the environment can look the Senate in the face on that one. No wonder the world is starting to see Australia as an environmental maverick. No wonder, Senator Hill, that at the recent World Conservation Union conference in Jordan, despite your best efforts to put somebody unknown to the public onto the global council of the world's most prestigious conservation body, the world elected Christine Milne from Tasmania, who is a defender of these forests, and voted your candidate last. I am talking about government voters as well as conservation voters. 
But that is not going to help the forests, because the Howard government has got an unfeeling, insensitive, incapable response to what is happening to the monumental forests and woodlands of this country and the wildlife that goes with them. It is an indictment of this government that it does that. The only reason that this government gets away with it is because this opposition supports it; that is why. Where you find the two big parties lining up together, the issue tends to go out of the news pages. Although 80 per cent of Australians do not want this happening, the majority of politicians in this place are gung-ho about it, because behind this is the corruption of the big logging companies, with their donations to the political parties and their power of lobbying in the halls of this place. But it is wicked that that is happening. It makes my blood boil. Nothing counts in this place but dollars. And this is a country which holds other values as important. 
So the Valley of the Giants, the Styx River Valley in Tasmania, is earmarked to be logged from end to end under the Howard government's regional forest agreement with the Tasmanian Labor Party, which is gung-ho about it as well. And we have got this legislation saying that they can build a furnace over the ridge in Judbury and put 300,000 tonnes of woodchips out of these wild forests into that each year and sell the power through Basslink up the line to unsuspecting Melburnians as green energy. The Tasmanian Labor Party, hand in hand with Mr Howard's government, says that if you stand up against that you are unTasmanian. There will be a protest in Hobart on Sunday from people in the areas to the south of Hobart which will show a truly Tasmanian point of view against this corrupt process which has the minister for the environment in this country saying that the destruction of the Valley of the Giants, the forests of the Picton, the Huon and the Weld, in the way that I have just described is ecologically sustainable.  
I have canvassed the heart of why this legislation is so rotten and why the deal that Labor is going into with the government to get this legislation through is so rotten. It should have been so good. The motivation is to give a fillip to truly ecologically sustainable energy, solar power and wind power, in this country. But the government has determined, under the suasion of the woodchip industry, to put forests through furnaces and to put the electricity production from that into the list of things that is allowable under this ecologically sustainable process. Well, there it is. But it is going to be an election issue next year, I can tell you.

They were the four that were added to the pre-existing definition in this area. In essence, we will not be insisting on our amendment technically but will be moving an amended form of it, which is amendment No. 1 on sheet 2098.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I would like to raise some questions about the new insertions. It seems to me that ocean and wave are renewable but fuel cells and co-firing may well not be renewable; that is, co-firing could involve fossil fuels in the co-firing process. Certainly gas and coal and other petroleum products could be included. Likewise, whilst fuel cells largely use hydrogen, hydrogen is produced in many cases from natural gas, sometimes with the addition of solar energy to produce it. I would have some concern about including those last two items, (s) and (t), because they are not necessarily renewable.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I am seeking some clarification here as to what we are specifically dealing with. There is an amendment that has been circulated by the Democrats on sheet 2091, which is to be moved by Senator Allison for the Democrats in place of Senate amendment No. 7. Are we dealing with that?
—No, at the moment the question before the chamber is that the committee does not insist on amendment No. 7 not made by the House. There have been some foreshadowed amendments by Senator Bolkus.
—I understand. I have a question, then, with regard to what has been accepted by the House. It goes to what is an eligible renewable energy source. In (f) it is listed as `wood waste'. I would ask the minister to define what wood waste is.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—I think that wood waste would be any wood or timber product that has resulted from an activity for which the primary purpose was other than creating that particular product. In other words, it might flow from a native forest operation, for example, where the primary purpose is sawlogs. Further detail, as Senator Murphy will find, can be prescribed by regulation, which we would expect to do in due course. Such regulations, he will also see from the amendments before us if this is the view of the Senate, are going to not only have the disallowance process with which we are all very familiar but also require a period of public consultation in advance of being made. ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I have a further question with regard to that. Given that that is your definition at this point in time, subject to further regulation, wood waste in respect of this amendment to the bill is very open ended because it leaves it open to waste from both native forest harvesting and plantation harvesting. I notice the Democrats have an amendment—I am not sure when we are going to deal with that—on sheet 2091, which goes to the question of non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes. I find that intriguing to say the least, given that the amendment here moved by the Democrats has already been accepted. Where I have a concern with this is that the definition listed as (f) is very broad and could well lead to significant problems, with misuse of a whole range of forest products that are derived from either native or plantation forests. I think that this bill would be much better served not necessarily through regulation but, in the first instance, by having a definition that went very specifically to what forest residue is and what wood waste is.
In most states that have hardwood forest operations, definitions are gazetted at a state level that would cover this sort of issue. I put it to the government that not only is it essential that we have very clear definitions in this bill but it is also very important that we have a mechanism for policing those definitions. This is one of the issues that I have come across in respect of regional forest agreements. I had a `good' experience from the government minister of the day, Mr Wilson Tuckey, in respect of RFAs. The department puts out a regional forest agreement newsletter, which states that there is a Regional Forest Agreement Monitoring Unit that is supposed to monitor the application of the regional forest agreement. The newsletter lists contact phone numbers and the people you can speak to. I rang the monitoring unit to raise with them some issues of concern that I had. I asked them if they had ever been to Tasmania to inspect the forests to see whether or not the criteria set out in the regional forest agreement, particularly as it goes to ecologically sustainable management, had been adhered to—and they said no. So I invited them to come down to Tasmania—as I would invite them to Victoria, to New South Wales and to any other state that currently has a regional forest agreement. I do not want to misrepresent them, but I think they told me that they had never conducted an in-field inspection. That really worries me, because practices are going on that are clearly not within the criteria—poor as they are—that are contained within a regional forest agreement.
After I invited the Regional Forest Agreement Monitoring Unit to come and do an inspection in-field, they said, `We'll have to get back to you. We'll have to speak to our superior.' They did not say the minister, I do not think, but then I received a letter from the minister, Mr Wilson Tuckey, who accused me of harassing his officers. Bear in mind that this big, glossy newsletter promotes to the Australian public a process of consultation, a process of input. That is, if the Australian public in any state have some reason to think that the criteria of the regional forest agreement is not being met, there is a process through which they can have input and through which they can object and raise concerns, which will be dealt with. But this is not so. As I said, the minister wrote a letter to me which, coming from a member of this federal parliament, was absolutely ridiculous. I probably should have brought the letter down here to the chamber to read out to people. I say to Senator Hill as minister for the environment that this is unacceptable. With regard to federal guidelines, federal law or a federal-state agreement—as is the case with a regional forest agreement—if you are going to set criteria which you expect the state to adhere to and if it is not being adhered to, or if it is alleged that it is not being adhered to, then you must have a process for checking this, for checking the veracity of the circumstances—and likewise with this bill. 
What does wood waste mean? Let me tell you. In the last five years in this country, there has been a huge growth in plantation forestry, with no real strategic plan as to what will happen to a lot of that wood in five, 10, 15 or 20 years time. I have the view that we ought to be developing our industry in terms of value adding, import replacement, et cetera. But, if we allow the opportunity to exist whereby an industry can have wood available to it at a reasonable price because of the global demand for a particular wood product, then we will have a real problem. The problem will be that that wood will be funnelled into biomass energy plants, either in a dual sense or in a singular sense. That is a real problem. 
With regard to the definition of wood waste, I cannot accept that we adopt the position that the Democrats have of using `non-plantation native forests, wood products and wood waste'. If we are to use wood or forest residue as a biomass energy source, then we ought to define it very clearly in the interests of the timber industry in this country. I am not sure that having regulations that are disallowable will do that. We have got to go one step further. We really have to monitor this industry very carefully, but we have to have a monitoring process that has some teeth in it. Once these power plants are built and are linked to some form of employment, I doubt that any government will want to say, `Sorry, the resource that you have been using as a source of biomass is now no longer acceptable.' It will not work. That is a real problem and it is a problem that we ought to address now and not some five or 10 years down the track when it is too late. That is the issue that this bill has to confront. It is not confronting it at the moment.
I know that the Democrats and Senator Brown have a very significant position in that they do not want to see native forest residue or native forest wood waste used at all. To me, that is a totally unacceptable position. We need to define what can be used and what cannot be used. We should do that in this bill, if we are to deliver good outcomes from what is a very important piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—I do appreciate where Senator Murphy is coming from in this debate. I recognise him as a supporter of the forestry industry and as someone who has also demanded not only that forest management plans be ecologically sustainable but that they should be implemented in a way that is consistent with those goals. Many of the concerns which Senator Murphy expresses today and which I have heard him express before are concerns that show, in implementation of the plans, that there is insufficient monitoring and supervision and the like to ensure that the spirit of the law is reflected in the letter of the law. I do not quarrel with him on that. It is important that sustainable plans are implemented in that way. In many ways, it gets back to responsibilities of states, but Senator Murphy also says that, if the Commonwealth enters into an RFA, perhaps the Commonwealth should take greater responsibility as well. The Commonwealth does have powers under the RFA if the states are breaching their obligations in relation to implementing sustainable forestry practices.
However, it was the government's intention not to even include categories such as this in the bill itself but rather to do the whole of the categorisation and the detail in regulations. This is a provision which was passed previously by the Senate. It sets out a category of wood waste and it will be capable of being further defined in the regulations. Certainly, on this side of the chamber we are happy to talk to Senator Murphy in the development of those regulations in an effort to see that they might meet his objectives. Even so, there is an issue beyond the letter of the law here—that is, the issue of proper management and enforcement. But I would respectfully suggest to Senator Murphy that that goes beyond the scope of this particular bill. I acknowledge the problem, but I am suggesting that this is not the place to solve it. In relation to Senator Allison's point, by virtue of the exclusions that appear in this clause—that is, sources that are not eligible which are fossil fuels or product derived from fossil fuels—it is obvious that, in the case of co-firing, it is only the renewable element that attracts the benefit. ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I would like to ask the minister: did the Business Council say that it did not want woodchips in this bill? What part has the New South Wales Forest Products Association had in seeking the government's assurance that the reverse would happen and that woodchips would stay in the bill? Also, the government advised that it thought that the woodchips would take up a maximum of three per cent of the renewable energy growth that we are looking at, but my office has done a quick assessment of proposals that have surfaced in recent times. In Tasmania, the Southwood project at Judbury of 30 megawatts would consume 300,000 cubic metres or tonnes of woodchips. In Victoria at Morwell there is the 35 megawatt project for up to 350,000 cubic metres; in New South Wales at Moruya, 300,000 tonnes; at Grafton, 300,000 tonnes; at Raymond Terrace, 300,000 tonnes or cubic metres; in Queensland at Maryborough it is the same, 300,000 tonnes. This does not include the prospect of two other similar generating stations in the north-west and north-east of Tasmania. That comes to 185 megawatts or 1.85 million cubic metres of woodchips, which is equivalent to 15 per cent of the 9,500 gigawatt hour target that this bill incorporates. Under the amendments that are being dealt with here tonight, if the bill goes through as amended, what will be the limit that is going to be placed on the burning of so-called forest waste, remembering that wherever that is certified under this legislation, it is solar power or wind power that is going to lose out?",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,—There is not a cap as such in this legislation. It is true that in a previous debate on this bill I indicated that the government had received independent advice from expert consultants if they did not expect more than about three per cent—I think it was a fraction over three per cent—of the total energy to be derived from native forest products and native forest waste. I do not know the Business Council's position in relation to woodchips or whether they have a position. In relation to forest industry bodies generally—Senator Brown referred to a New South Wales body—it is true that the forest industry bodies do not wish to have wood wastes excluded from this legislation. They want the opportunity to be able to utilise some wood waste as circumstances permit to add to the value of their total forest operation through the provisions of this legislation.,SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I want to respond to the confusion that Senator Murphy suggested there was in terms of the earlier Democrats' amendment and his bemusement that it did not include native forest waste and that we have a subsequent amendment which would. Our original amendment did, indeed, have a specific exclusion of native forest timber products, but that was removed by an amendment to our amendment. 
I want to pursue a bit more the two inclusions, (s) fuel cells and (t) co-firing. I hear what the minister says about only those renewable elements attracting the eligibility, but if we already have solar, bagasse, crop waste and so on—which you would expect to contribute to those two methods of generating electricity rather than being sources—it seems to me to be unnecessary and confusing to put them in. Firstly, I cannot see any purpose; secondly, it seems to me to be possibly confusing and gives the wrong kind of signal about what we are talking about here in terms of sources, not methods of generating electricity. I am not persuaded that those the last two points—(s) fuel cells and (t) co-firing—ought to be there.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I would just ask Senator Hill if he has had any further information from his experts that would put the lie to the 15 per cent figure that I put forward and if his experts are aware of the various wood burning projects that have been flagged. Finally, he said that, in his view, wood waste would have to come from a project which was primarily aimed at some other object such as sawmilling. I ask Senator Hill: does that mean that a 60 per cent woodchip operation could send 40 per cent wood waste to a furnace for the production of renewable energy and qualify under this legislation? ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—I understand that the consultants have had a further think about this matter and believe that their original figures are still in the ballpark in relation to native forest waste. I may have missed the second question that was asked, which, I think, was, `If 60 per cent was going to woodchips and 40 per cent was being used for energy production, would the 40 per cent qualify as wood waste?' If that was the question, then I cannot see why it wouldn't.
—We have two amendments here. On the running sheet the first one to be moved is the Democrats' amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 2091. Senator Allison, what is your wish?",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—Thank you, Chairman, I actually need to amend that amendment, since the clause being amended already includes part of the amendment that I am proposing. We do not need amendment No. 1, so I just withdraw that amendment. But if we could remove in amendment No. 2 everything after `add' up to `(c) non-plantation and native forest wood products and wood waste' and have (c) remain as the amendment. Is that clear? Should I mark up an amendment here and pass it down?
—So you are withdrawing amendment No. 1 and you are amending amendment No. 2 to read `Clause 17, page 11 (after line 25), at the end of the clause, add: (c) non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes'?
—That is correct. Judging by the debate so far and back in October when we dealt with this bill, I do not expect support from the two major parties for this amendment. I nonetheless put it up because, for the Democrats, this is perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bill representing the greatest problems as far as we are concerned. I do not want to canvass all of the arguments again, but in the period of time between 10 August, when we last debated this bill, and today there has been an opportunity for us to spend more time talking with, particularly, forest groups about what is going on in their areas, and I remain seriously concerned about the likelihood that this legislation will give further impetus to logging which is, I am convinced, unsustainable in so many forests. We know that in New South Wales, in Western Australia, in Tasmania and in parts of Victoria there is so much forest material taken out of those forests which is supposedly waste but in some cases we know it to be already 70 per cent to 90 per cent of the—
—Senator Allison, before you continue with your amendment, I think the best course of action would be for us to pass the motion that the committee does not insist on amendment No 7. We then get Senator Bolkus to move his amendment, and yours can then become an amendment to his amendment, because it is actually adding a clause to the end of Senator Bolkus's clause (2). Is it the wish of the committee that you defer your amendments so that we can actually get something to attach yours to?
—Chair, have we dealt with the question of whether Senator Bolkus's amendment should replace the one which was our amendment No. 2?
—No.
—Could we deal with that first because I have already expressed some concerns about the amendments to our amendment, which added fuel cells, co-firing, hot dry rock, ocean, wave and tidal. I have already expressed some concerns about that, and I think we would like to vote on whether that should be the replacement of the previous amendment.
—Yes. So the question will be, first of all, that the committee does not insist on amendment No. 7 not made by the House of Representatives. I would expect that the opposition and government will vote in favour of that. I do not know what you are going to do, Senator Allison. That is your decision. I put the question that the committee does not insist on amendment No. 7 not made by the House of Representatives.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 2, as amended:
Clause 17, page 11 (after line 25), at the end of the clause, add:
(c) non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-12-07,"—This amendment would exclude non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes. So one has to assume that it is acceptable if it comes from plantation forests. With the greatest of respect, I have to say to the Democrats that this about saying to one section of the industry that the residue or the wood products, including logs and the whole box and dice, can come from a plantation forest and be funnelled down a biomass energy plant.
—You can now; there's nothing stopping you.
—Insofar as this country's trade deficit in wood products is concerned, that would be an unacceptable position from my point of view. When I look at my own state insofar as native forests are concerned—and they are commercial harvesting operations, which are happening and will continue to happen for a reasonable period of time at least—in my state alone there is burned each year on the forest floor at least six million tonnes of residue. It just goes up in smoke. I question very seriously any proposal that says that that is acceptable. If I went to Senator Allison's state of Victoria, it would not be much different. If I went to New South Wales, it would not be much different. Yet we have a proposal from the Democrats that says that you can put it into what is a cleaner burning process. I am not saying that is the best thing, but when I watch some six million tonnes of residue being burned on the forest floor in my state, whether it be from land clearing—because it does include some land clearing exercises by the rural sector in my state—or is attributed to forest activity in native forests, I find that unacceptable. I just cannot understand the logic of that.  
—I will ignore that comment. But I have to say that it is a pity that a few more people in this chamber do not have a really good understanding of what exactly is happening out there in the forest industry. It would be very useful if a few people did have some understanding of that. They might then proceed to put up some amendments that would be relevant to ensuring that this country is better off both in terms of biomass energy and in terms of its forest industry—and that is more the pity for this parliament. 
—You put them up.
—I would like to.
—Come on.
—I would like to, but I would not put up this amendment that Senator Allison has put up because it does not solve the problem one iota. This is a philosophical amendment that says, `We are against native forest harvesting by the forest industry of this country.' That is what this is about, and some people ought to come to grips with that—on all sides of politics. Frankly, if this amendment gets up, you will deny my state, in particular, which has a very significant native forest harvesting industry, the opportunity to deal with its residue in a better way than it currently does. I will oppose this amendment. Frankly, I do not care what the position of any party is, I will oppose it. This is an important bill, and it could be made a much better bill. This amendment does not make it a better bill. I hope that the government will not accept the amendment. 
As I said to the minister before, I still do not necessarily accept that regulation will deal with the problem of definition. I think we have to go further than regulation. It is unfortunate that this bill happened to be brought on at this point in time. I had hoped that it would be dealt with in the new year, because it is a very important bill in terms of renewable energy. I would like to see us actually strive to get an appropriate renewable energy industry in this country, and I would like to see my state play a very important role in that. That is why I express some serious concern about some aspects of the bill. I have to say that, frankly, I do not care what the position of any party is about this particular amendment; I will vote against it.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—You are safe there, Senator Murphy, because your party is going to vote against it, but not for the reasons that you have put forward. One thing I will say about Senator Murphy is that he does have a very deep understanding of the problems within the Tasmanian forest industry. I do not come to the same conclusions as him but I respect his understanding, and he is dead right: it is a pity that people on both sides of the chamber do not share that knowledge and are not savvy with the mismanagement that is rampant in the forest industries around the country, not least in Tasmania. This year in Tasmania five million tonnes of woodchips will be exported overseas, coming from 150,000 trucks drawing them out of the great forests of Tasmania, which are being decimated at the greatest rate in history, for the lowest price in history, for the fewest jobs in history. That is what Mr Howard and Premier Bacon got together and signed the prescription for in 1998.
Now Senator Hill, the minister for the environment, is telling us that we will be able to have these forests divided up, with 60 per cent off to the woodchip mill and 40 per cent off to the furnace to create electricity, and that will be called ecologically sustainable. I agree with Senator Allison on the matter, not with Senator Murphy. That is different from not respecting Senator Murphy's knowledge of the mismanagement and corruption that occurs in the Tasmanian forest industry, which ought to be subject of a royal commission. That having been said, this is an important amendment. It is very similar to an amendment I moved when the bill was originally before the Senate. It would protect native forests from being slaughtered, fed into furnaces—and, through Basslink, as far as Tasmania is concerned into the Melbourne market—and as I read out earlier, to suffer the same fate as all the other forest estates, and the woodlands of Queensland as well. 
One thing Senator Murphy will know is that, when the woodchip industry set up in New South Wales and Western Australia and then Tasmania in 1969 and 1970, it promised to take the waste up to the sawmilling. But it very quickly became the core taker of the whole forest, and the sawmill industry was left on the periphery. You have to learn from that. Now we are faced with a potentially voracious furnacing of forests to create electricity, a new market that may very well leave pulpwood on the periphery. Senator Murphy says that six million tonnes of residue is burned on the ground in Tasmania each year and that is not going to change very much. That is not what this industry is after. It wants logs. It wants to put them into furnaces and it wants to burn them to make power. It is an economically run industry; it is not an environmentally run industry. One of the reasons for that is that we do not have an environment minister who will stand up for the forests.
The minister has brought on this legislation tonight. I agree with Senator Murphy: it should have been brought on in the new year. It has the whole parliament waiting. But he has brought it on knowing how important this matter is to the environmentally minded parties, the Greens and the Democrats, in particular. It is a core issue for us. It is fundamental. One of the great tragedies of modern Australia is this destruction of forests and woodlands, and here we are being asked to put our imprimatur on a new, potent, destructive agent of the natural realm of Australia. I will not stand for it. I am not going to support that. I will support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,47,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I do not want to prolong this debate. We have had it many times over and over. But I do object to Senator Murphy suggesting that he is the only one in this place who knows anything about forests. That is clearly nonsense. We have all been out into forests and we all know what happens. To suggest that this measure, if it includes native forest residual material, will solve the problem of burning residue on the forest floor is wrong; it will not. The only way we will stop that problem is to stop clear-fell logging so that we do not end up with treetops and every growing matter in the forests being knocked down and left on the forest floor. That is why it is burned. It is not put on trucks and taken somewhere to be woodchipped. That is the great myth put about by the forest industry: that woodchippers were simply taking the residue. We know they do not do just that; they like nice, big, strong, straight logs like the sawmillers do—the fewer bends the better, the fewer the branches, the less rotting material and the less bark, the more the woodchippers like them. So this measure is not going to see trucks trundling down the road in forest areas taking with them the residue off the forest floor. It will still be burned in the same way it is now.
In the same way, this amendment would not stop the use of native forest timbers for burning, for sawmilling, for woodchipping or for anything else. It simply does not give them the advantage that we think renewable energy ought to have—that is, that ought to be primarily wind and solar. What this is doing is likely providing far greater opportunities for what is already a lucrative business, because we charge so little for our native forest timbers. Again, I think Senator Murphy underestimates the degree of interest in this subject by those at this end of the chamber. I have spent a great deal of time in forests, I have seen the operations, I know what happens and I know why the timber is burned on the forest floor; this measure certainly will not stop that.

We believe the indexed charge should go in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2000. Instead of insisting on this amendment to this bill, we will move it by way of the supplementary legislation—the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000.

—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order. I could not hear what Senator Bolkus said.
—Before Senator Bolkus continues his remarks, perhaps there could be less conversation in the chamber. Some groups of people on the left are having conversations which are causing Senator Bolkus and Senator Brown difficulty in hearing what is being said.
—I had also considered this sort of amendment but, in essence, unless we are successful in pursuing the actual rate indexation in the charge bill, then this sort of amendment is in a sense superfluous. I know what Senator Brown is trying to do, but I think it already hinges on whether we can successfully pursue the CPI rate in respect of the charge bill. I do not think it really adds all that much to it, Senator Brown.

Page 94 (after line 23), at the end of the bill, add:
162  Review of operation of Act
	(1)	The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of this Act, including consideration of:
	(a)	the extent to which the Act has:
	(i)	contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and
	(ii)	encouraged additional generation of electricity from renewable energy sources; and
	(b)	the extent to which the policy objectives of this Act have been achieved and the need for any alternative approach; and
	(c)	the mix of technologies that has resulted from the implementation of the provisions of this Act; and
	(d)	the level of penalties provided under this Act; and
	(e)	the need for indexation of the renewable energy shortfall charge to the Consumer Price Index to maintain the real value of the charge and the associated penalty charge; and
	(f)	other environmental impacts that have resulted from the implementation of the provisions of this Act, including the extent to which non-plantation forestry waste has been utilised; and
	(g)	the possible introduction of a portfolio approach, a cap on the contribution of any one source and measures to recognise the relative greenhouse intensities of various technologies; and
	(h)	the level of the overall target and interim targets;
to be undertaken as soon as practicable after the second anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
	(2)	A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
	(3)	The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 12 months after the second anniversary of the commencement of this Act.
	(4)	In this section:
independent review means a review undertaken by persons who:
	(a)	in the Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review; and
	(b)	include one or more persons who are not employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and have not, since the commencement of the Act, provided services to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract.""
This is an important amendment. It is one that has been driven by a need for transparency and scrutiny of this legislation, given that there are such great concerns about it. What we are doing with this amendment is ensuring that there is a review of the legislation not after three years, as was initially agreed to by the Senate, but within 12 months after the second anniversary of the commencement of the act. We are talking about some fairly specific provisions that have to be addressed by the reviewer. The independent review is what we are anticipating embodying in this clause. The independence of the review is defined in subclause (4) of proposed section 162. We are talking about, for instance, at least one or more people involved in the review who are not employed by the Commonwealth or in connection with a contract of the Commonwealth. So we are talking about an independent review. The review document has to be written and tabled in parliament after the review is completed. So we have that mechanism to ensure scrutiny and independence of the review.  
We also specify in this particular provision that the review has to extend to a certain number of issues such as the extent to which the act has contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraged additional generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and the extent to which the policy objectives of the act have been achieved. Importantly, the review has to report on the mix of technologies that have resulted from the provisions of the act. Importantly, also in the context of this debate, the review must report on the level of penalties and the need for indexation. In paragraph (f) we are talking about the review addressing other environmental impacts and particularly important of those and specified in the paragraph is the impact on the non-plantation forestry waste to the extent that that has been utilised. 
What I would like to insist on here is a fairly strong independent review capacity earlier in the piece as opposed to what we had in the previous amendment and one that I think will impose an enormous degree of scrutiny. Together with the other clauses, we will be in a position to know the source of the renewable energy and the degree to which such source has been accessed. This review, within two years, will give the parliament a fairly immediate snapshot of how the legislation is working. I think it is critical that we adopt that. Unless we do know that within two to three years, then there is a real possibility that unforeseen consequences that people, in a sense, are signalling now as being quite possible may in fact eventuate and we may do environmental damage that this legislation should not be doing and this parliament should not be sanctioning. 
I indicate that we want to insist on the pre-existing clause 24 but in an amended form that will ensure that the need for indexation is taken into account by the review and that the review will take place after two years, not after three.
—I do not seem to have that ALP amendment.
—It is on sheet 2094. The easiest way to deal with this is if we knock out the original request back from the House of Representatives and then vote on Senator Bolkus's amendment. The question is that the committee not insist on amendment (24) not made by the House.

This bill is an absolutely tragic piece of legislation, and the opposition should be ashamed of itself for having let the government get away with this. It is an environmental monstrosity. The opposition has failed to give the people of Australia a choice, again. This is going to lead to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tonnes of Australia's wild forests being fed into furnaces and turned out as so-called green energy. It is an absolutely shameful piece of legislation. I am not surprised at it coming from the Howard government, because it has a shameful record, but I would have thought this far into opposition there could have been some distance put between the government and itself by the opposition. But the Labor Party walks hand in hand with Prime Minister Howard on the matter of forests and the environment generally. It is time they put some distance in there.

That is something that is totally anathema to me and probably to him as well. I know it is late at night, but it is something I do not really think I should accept. Secondly, Senator Brown, I think in your previous contribution you acknowledged that this is not easy, and there is a renewable energy industry that actually wants an outcome here tonight. Just a few minutes ago you were advocating that the government start the legislation earlier than April. So there is a bit of inconsistency in you saying now that this is just an obnoxious piece of legislation when three minutes ago you actually wanted it started earlier than is anticipated by the legislation. I understand what your concerns are. I share a lot of those concerns, but I think at the same time there is enormous pressure on the parliament to get this structure of legislation in place.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—I seek leave to move a motion to exempt this bill from the provisions of standing order 111.
—Is leave granted? 
—I ask why we should. Can the minister give an explanation? Here is a very late amendment to a piece of totally unsatisfactory legislation. The government has been considering this for months and suddenly it finds it has to make a total change.
—Senator Brown, are you seeking leave to ask a question or make a statement on this?
—I have finished my statement. The government can respond to that if it has the wherewithal.
—Is leave granted for Senator Hill to move a motion?
Leave granted. 
—I thought a moment ago Senator Brown was pressing the point that these bills must move in tandem. What we are seeking, through this amendment, is to link the starting dates of the charge bill with the bill that we have just passed. Senator Bolkus is going to take the opportunity then to move an amendment to add the indexation provision, which Senator Brown supports, to this bill, because it was unconstitutional under the previous bill. I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2000, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—The Labor opposition will continue to support the two amendments moved to the legislation: one that we moved to the legislation earlier in the day and the other we supported from the Australian Democrats. Firstly, with regard to the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, which effectively removes the GST from swim survival courses, the Labor opposition sees no good reason for the GST to apply to swim survival courses offered by organisations such as the Royal Lifesaving Association of Australia. We think it is outrageous that the government has even contemplated applying the GST to these very important community organisations that offer this form of service. So we will not be backing down from our support of that amendment.
The second amendment relates to those businesses that inadvertently registered for the GST. Of course, this includes many thousands of small businesses which were registered for the GST by their accounting firms or themselves registered and in fact did not have to go ahead with that registration. The government has proposed that those businesses can be deregistered, but they cannot be deregistered retrospectively. We think it is a matter of commonsense for the tax commissioner to be given the discretion to register those businesses, particularly small businesses, that have been inadvertently caught in the GST registration net.

On behalf of the Democrats, I seek to include a different set of objectives of the act in relation to the protection of the health and safety of people, the promotion of ecological sustainability—that is a reference that I do not think is made in any of the other amendments before us—and the protection of the environment. Apart from that, I seek to insert the precautionary principle as recommended by the committee that inquired into this bill. It is the precautionary principle that provides that, where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or environmental degradation. I think you will find that that is the best definition of the precautionary principle that has been used in this debate. It is echoed by others on the crossbenches who are moving amendments. I am concerned about the Labor Party amendment that deals with a similar issue but seeks to insert the precautionary principle without reference to health. Perhaps that is a debate that we can have in this context so that we do not have to delay the debate too much longer. I commend the amendments to the Senate. The committee report made it very clear that the majority recommendation of the committee was to include:
The committee recommends that the objects of the bill contain the same words that appear in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in relation to the precautionary principle.
There is no shortage of information in that committee report to explain why the precautionary principle is not only relevant but fundamental to the bill. That is why some of us in this debate have put on record that we are concerned and disappointed that we have not debated the objects a little earlier.
I think there are many more pressing reasons for the precautionary principle to be included. Obviously, we need to save time because we are all quite tired. It is disappointing that this debate has been rejigged in such a way that senators are too tired and the public was necessarily excluded—and I make that particular point in relation to the broadcast. It was very interesting hearing the House of Representatives members thank the relevant members of their political party et cetera, but I actually think members of the public might have been more interested to tune in to the legislative debates that were taking place in the Senate tonight. Nonetheless, I congratulate the government on making sure this bill was dealt with in a way that minimised public involvement. I am sorry we are not debating these issues which should have been the third amendments that we dealt with—that we did not debate them in a more comprehensive fashion and earlier. I commend the amendments to the Senate, and I hope the Labor Party is not pursuing its amendment, which is clearly a deficient definition of the precautionary principle.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—We are addressing the issue of objects and precautionary principle. I indicate that the government will oppose the amendments proposed by the Democrats. The government would prefer to deal with this matter in the context of the ALP amendment (3) to clause 4 of the bill. The government is prepared to entertain further enhancement of the bill in terms of a precautionary approach but will do so in the context of that forthcoming amendment. With respect to the Democrats amendment to clause 4 on the precautionary principle, the government does not support the Democrats' referencing of the precautionary principle in clause 4 for two key reasons. Firstly, the terminology used references to human health. This varies from the Rio 15 statement of the precautionary principle, which is limited to taking measures to prevent environmental degradation. Consideration still needs to be given in the international arena as to how the precautionary principle should be applied in the context of public health. The government is reticent to commit Australia to a path that may have difficulties and be inconsistent with international best practice.  
Secondly, the amendment does not incorporate the words `cost-effective' as they appear in Rio 15. The government is, however, prepared to include words taken from Rio 15 in relation to the precautionary principle and will follow this intention through in the context of the ALP amendment to clause 4. The Democrats are proposing a separate definition of `ecological sustainability' in addition to the existing definition in the bill of `environment'. Ecological sustainability refers to the need to use, conserve and enhance the community's resources so that ecological processes on which life depends are maintained and the total quality of life now and in the future can be increased. We do not consider a separate definition is required, because ecological sustainability is not separate and distinct from the environment.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—We know what `ecologically sustainable' means to this government, because we just debated it in the previous session. It means `anything goes'. It is pretty disgusting that it can be part of this international `greenwash', which says you put up terms like that but you don't live up to them. Certainly, if somebody comes along and wants to define them in a way which gives honesty to those terms, then you oppose it. That is what is happening here. I am going to support the Democrat amendments. I think the Green amendment coming after, as far as the object of the act is concerned, is stronger in that it does include that the object of the act should protect the right for non-GMO production systems, including organic systems, to exist. There is a very clear statement not only about the right of the natural environment to exist without being contaminated by genetically engineered organisms but about the right of the organic farming industry to do so. There is the gilt-edged value added frontrunner for growth as far as Australian food production is concerned; and yet it is not explicitly written into the objects we have before us.
The objects as put forward by the Greens would also give local government the ability to determine what happens in its area. We have had that debate before, but the Greens stand by that. We also have a provision for the provisions of the act to be conducted in a transparent way which encourages public participation in decisions concerning the `development, use and release of GMO and GM products'. Of course, doing that at the local level is fundamental.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting these amendments of the Democrats. As Senator Stott Despoja correctly identified and as the government referred to, the opposition will be moving an amendment which will insert reference to the precautionary principle in the legislation in clause 4. I do not think I need to speak at length about the importance of having this reference to the precautionary principle in the legislation; it was one of the major issues raised during the Senate inquiry and public hearings. However, I do wish to take up the allegation that has been made by the Democrats that our wording is deficient because it does not refer to human health. I just point out that the wording that we have adopted is essentially the same as that which was picked up in the EPBC Act—neither in that act nor in the Rio declaration is there any reference to human health—and our proposal is consistent with the approach adopted in both that legislation and in the Rio declaration. 
The other point I make is that this was another issue which, initially, the government were not prepared to entertain; they did not include in the original legislation or the bill that is before the chamber any reference to the precautionary principle. We believe it is a significant improvement to have that now recognised by the government and indeed all the parties in the Senate. Therefore I should take the opportunity to refute the proposition put forward by the Greens on their web site on 1 December when Senator Bob Brown condemned the ALP—and I quote from the release on the site—by stating the `precautionary principle has been gutted'. If that is the case, Senator Brown must obviously think that the precautionary principle as adopted in the Rio declaration and as included in the EPBC Act has been gutted. That might be his view but, firstly, that is indeed what I understand the Democrats signed up to in terms of that legislation, and, secondly, has been adopted and supported by environmental groups throughout the world in respect of the Rio environmental declaration. Our position is consistent with the approach in both those cases.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—Just briefly in response to Senator Forshaw's contribution, I understand from the government's explanation tonight that cost-effectiveness is going to be discussed or included in the amendment that will be supported by the government tonight. I do not see that in the EPBC legislation, and I point out that one of the objects of the EPBC act—
—It's in Rio.
—Yes, I acknowledge that. One of the objects of the EPBC Act is to protect the environment. This bill is supposedly giving equal weight to not only the protection of the environment but also health and safety issues. So there is particular relevance in that this precautionary principle would refer to the issue of health. While I take on board Senator Forshaw's reference to the EPBC Act definition—and I acknowledge that it is the committee's recommendation that it be included in the bill—we have to acknowledge that the object of this legislation is to protect health and the environment, and therefore they deserve equal weighting and reference to in the precautionary principle as well as in the objects of the act.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I indicate to the chamber that I will not be moving Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment (1) on sheet 2030 because its aim is encompassed within the Democrats amendments. I would like to very briefly speak to the Democrats amendments, particularly amendment (1), which relates to the objects of the act. The objects of the act are the actual heart of the act because, by going to the objects of the act, substantial argument can be raised in relation to whether a person is in compliance with the act. Rather than being merely an expression of the direction of the act, they have an extremely important role to play; therefore, they must express explicitly the direction of the act and indicate clarity to any judicial person who is ruling on them. That is exactly what Democrats amendment (1) does. Amendment (1) goes to clause 3, `Objects of the act', and reads:
	The objects of this Act are:
	(a) 	to protect the health and safety of people; and
	(b) 	to promote ecological sustainability; and
	(c) 	to protect the environment;
by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.
The Democrats second amendment is identical to the amendment that Pauline Hanson's One Nation proposed, which is:
(a) 	provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or environmental degradation ...
With the combination of both of those amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats, there would be clarity in the act and there would be certainty. That is equally important: there would be certainty for the people who are going to operate under that act. To highlight the necessity for certainty, I would like to quote from a paper that was presented on 31 October 2000. The title is `The Precautionary Principle is Coherent'. The paper says: 
We want to emphasise that the precautionary principle is not an algorithm for making decisions. It does not make decisions for us, but it is a principle on which to base decisions. It is a principle for assigning the burden of proof, in much the same way that the defendant in a criminal court is assumed innocent until proven guilty `beyond reasonable doubt'. ... This important rule reflects society's view that convicting the innocent is far worse than acquitting the guilty. It has a profound effect on the outcome of many trials, but it still leaves the jury with a lot to do. They still have to weigh up the evidence, and they have to decide for themselves what constitutes `reasonable doubt'.
In the same way, the precautionary principle requires us to assign the burden of proof to those who want to introduce a new technology, particularly in cases where there is little or no established need or benefit and where the hazards are serious and irreversible. It is up to the perpetrators to prove that the technology is safe `beyond reasonable doubt'. We cannot expect the precautionary principle by itself to tell us what to do about GM crops or any other new technology. Like a jury, we have to weigh up the evidence, and like a jury we have to come to a decision. ...
So, what is the evidence on GM crops? There is practically no evidence that they are safe, of the kind that could stand up in a court of law. There is less than a handful of papers on the subject of safety assessment published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The vast majority consists of unpublished reports submitted to regulatory bodies for product approval, and these, far from supporting claims of safety, actually provide evidence to the contrary. ... The published papers from the industry are no better. For example, Monsanto's study on Roundup Ready soya was seriously flawed. The two papers (Hammond et al, 1996, Journal of Nutrition 126, 717-26; and Padgette et al, 1996, Journal of Nutrition 126, 702-16) showed, among other things, significant increases in milk fat in cows and lower weight gains in male rats fed GM soya. There was also a 26.7% increase in a major allergen and growth inhibitor, antitrypsin, in the GM soya. Monsanto had failed to submit even more damning data indicating that another allergen, a soya lectin, was increased by 100% in retoasted soya beans.
So in promoting the necessity for the precautionary principle, it is very clear that there is a necessity and a requirement for that in this bill. There is clearly scientific evidence which shows that there are dangers relating to genetic manipulation. I would like to return briefly to the issue I raised before about the necessity for the objects of the act to be concise. I would like to refer to some correspondence I received which says:
My understanding is that the regulator, because of the objects of the act, can only consider and address risk that is in keeping with the objects of the act to protect public health and safety and the environment. Can the regulator address the risk of contamination that is trade related only not public health and safety or environment risk? If so, under what section of the bill? If the regulator can impose conditions to reduce risk of trade related contamination, could the regulator impose buffer zones and segregation of supply chain systems? If the regulator was to impose such conditions that were trade related only, then could the GMO licence applicant take an objection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review on the grounds that the regulator had imposed a condition on a licence that was outside the objects of the act?
That is what goes to the heart of the necessity to get the objects of the act correct, because if we do not do that then the decisions of the Gene Technology Regulator will be challengeable by appeal. It is on that basis that Pauline Hanson's One Nation supports the objects of the act as set out by the Australian Democrats both in clause 1 and especially in clause 2, which brings in the principle that a lack of scientific evidence should not be used as a means for going ahead and granting a licence with reference to a genetically modified object. I commend the Democrats amendments to the chamber and indicate to the chair that I will not be moving Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment (1) on sheet 2030.

(R1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 6 to 10), omit the clause, substitute:
3  Object of the Act
	(1)	The object of this Act is to ensure that the development and application of gene technology is conducted in a manner that: 
	(a)	protects:
	(i)	the health and safety of people; and 
	(ii)	the environment; and
	(iii)	the right for non-GMO production systems, including organic systems, to exist; and
	(b)	is consistent with the exercise of the precautionary principle; and
	(c)	provides each State and each local government body, through an appointed Authority, with the right to prevent the release of GMOs and GM products within each respective State and local government area; and
	(e)	is transparent and encourages public participation in decisions concerning the development, use and release of GMOs and GM products. 
	(2)	A person on whom a function is imposed or a power is conferred under this Act must perform that function or exercise that power in a manner that is consistent with the object of this Act.
 (12)	Clause 10, page 9 (after line 16), after the definition of person covered by a GMO licence, insert:
precautionary principle means that where there is a threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage, or a serious or irreversible threat to human health, lack of full scientific certainty can not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or the environment.
This is an even stronger set of objectives and precautionary principles. I just want to say that, as far as the precautionary principle as we would see it is concerned, the word `gutted' used on my web site stands true. I am reminded of a cartoon at the time of the Rio gathering in which President Bush wheels into Rio declaring, `I am the environmental President,' There were three other world leaders sitting there, and one said, `Yes, I am Goldilocks,' and the other said, `Yes, I am the Tooth Fairy,' and the third said, `Yes, I am Alice in Wonderland.' We also have to recognise that the amendment we are going to end up with here brings in commercial considerations but leaves out health. This is about concerns the consumers in the community have about their health. So it should be in there. It is not going to be because the ALP with the government has got the numbers.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government is opposed to Senator Brown's proposed amendment to the object of the act. It does two things: it proposes to reference the precautionary principle as defined in clause 10 and, as I have mentioned in relation to the Democrats amendment, the government proposes to accept the opposition's amendment to clause 4 of the bill to reference the precautionary principle subject to one minor change. This brings the reference to the precautionary principle into accord with the referencing of the precautionary principle in Rio 15.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I will speak briefly to Senator Brown's amendment.
—Promise?
—Promise. His amendment (12) is substantially the same as One Nation's. I will briefly speak to the merits of his R1 on sheet 2065. Senator Brown is seeking to bring into the objects of the act a provision for states and each local government through a local authority to have the right to prevent the release of GMO and GM products within each respective state and local government area. I believe that is the correct section in the act in which to have that with clarity. The amendment goes on further to say:
(e) is transparent and encourages public participation in decisions concerning the development, use and release of GMOs and GM products. 
These amendments go to the rights of state and local governments. The Greens amendment contains one other area that I believe is very important; that is, it places a requirement in the objects of the act to comply with the act. Greens amendment (2) states:
(2) A person on whom a function is imposed or a power is conferred under this Act must perform that function or exercise that power in a manner that is consistent with the object of this Act.
In regard to my point earlier, if the regulator had this type of description in the objects of the act then his decisions would be far less challengeable in the courts. 
—Or hers.
—I accept Senator Stott Despoja's interjection—his or her powers would be far less challengeable in the court. I commend the Greens amendments to the chamber.

	(a)	provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation; and
I do not think I need to say anything further about our amendment. It is, as I said when we were dealing with the earlier amendments, to insert the precautionary principle into clause 4 of the bill. That is the appropriate place to put it, we believe, and I will ask the Senate to support our amendment. I understand the government is going to indicate that it is prepared to accept our amendment, with some additional words incorporated into it which reflect the terms of the Rio declaration.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I appreciate the importance of this amendment. Before I actually address this, there was an issue I was asked to attend to that related to an earlier matter and I should just make this clear. In relation to the policy guidelines issued by the ministerial council, which were dealt with in an earlier debate on this bill, I would like to make a further remark. The government agreed to make the guidelines publicly available, and I would like to add that the guidelines will also be provided to the committees for comment after they have been issued. I appreciate that that is a separate issue to the point on discussion, but I have been asked to clarify it. 
With regard to the opposition amendment that is currently before us, I indicate that the government had some reservations about the amendment proposed by the ALP. However, we would be able to accept a change to clause 4 of the bill to reference the precautionary principle if the wording to be used in clause 4 reflects the wording of the precautionary principle appearing in Rio 15. In other words, we would accept the following words in clause 4:
... provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation ...
The change is important so that the legislation references the precautionary principle as it appears in Rio 15, a declaration that the Australian government has endorsed.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,—I would ask the opposition not to do that because putting in the term `cost-effective' is a weasel word to simply give the Monsantos of the world an avenue for copping out of the precautionary principle.

",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-12-07,"—I suppose anything is better than nothing. To that extent, one should acknowledge the extensive work of Senator Forshaw and the opposition in relation to this. But we are talking about an area that is of great significance to the Australian community, particularly in terms of environmental areas. Not only that; it is what the Rio convention was particularly about. I suppose to the credit of the government—and I really do not want to get into an argument about the EPBC Act now—we do have stronger words in relation to that, as we should. When we are talking about public confidence in this whole area of gene technology, this amendment proposes something that is weaker than what exists in that act. Not unsurprisingly, that is something that generates great concern not just to the Democrats but to many people in the community. If the government are genuine about trying to ensure community confidence in what we are doing, I think they need to reconsider what sort of words they use in relation to this crucial area of the precautionary principle.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I believe that there could be an unusual twist to the government's request for Labor to amend their amendment. If you read that section very carefully, it now says:
... a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures ...
The cost-effective measures could be determined as the cost involved in effecting the measures to prevent environmental degradation. If that is the intention of the government and the opposition, I believe that the amendment could stand and in actuality could be very effective. So a lack of retraction of that understanding of the amendment would cause me to support it.
—The question is that the amendment, as amended by leave, moved by Senator Forshaw be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—Chair, would you have my no on that last vote recorded?
—Yes, that will be done. We now move to amendments 37 and 116 on sheet 2030, to be moved by Pauline Hanson's One Nation.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—by leave—I move:
(37)	Clause 64, page 43 (line 27) to page 44 (line 3), omit subclause (1), substitute:
	(1)	It is a condition of a licence that a person authorised by the licence to deal with a GMO must allow the Regulator, or a person authorised by the Regulator, to enter premises where the dealing is being undertaken, for the purposes of auditing or monitoring the dealing.
	[NB: To be moved in alternate form by replacing ""Regulator"" (wherever occurring) with ""Authority"", if amendments relating to the Gene Technology Regulatory Authority are agreed to]
(116)	Page 125 (after line 32), after clause 190, insert:
190A  Audit of transitional dealings
	(1)	As soon as practicable after the commencement of this Part, the Regulator or a person authorised by the Regulator, must cause an audit to be undertaken of any dealing with a GMO in respect of which an advice to proceed was in force at the time this Part commenced.
	(2)	The Regulator must publish the results of an audit undertaken for the purposes of subsection (1) on the Regulator's Internet web site.
[NB: To be moved in alternate form by replacing ""Regulator"" with ""Authority"" (wherever occurring) and ""Regulator's"" with ""Authority's"", if amendments relating to the Gene Technology Regulatory Authority are agreed to]
The purpose of these amendments again is to bring about clarity in the bill. Section 64 deals with a condition about monitoring and audits. In the bill as it stands, under subsection 1 it says:
It is the condition of the licence that if—
and `if' is the operative word—
(a) a person is authorised by the licence to deal with the GMO; and
(b) a particular condition— 
and that again is a very operative phrase—
of a licence applies to the dealing by the person ...
The bill goes on to say that the person must allow the regulator or person authorised by the regulator to enter the premises where the dealing is being undertaken for the purpose of auditing or monitoring the dealing. The effect of the Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendments would make it a condition of the licence, irrespective of whether a person is authorised by the licence or a particular condition applied to that licence. For clarity, the bill would read:
It is a condition of a licence that a person authorised by the licence to deal with the GMO must allow the Regulator, or a person authorised by the Regulator, to enter premises where the dealing is being undertaken, for the purposes of auditing or monitoring the dealing. 
What it clearly does is give the government's proposed bill far more clarity and, from the point of the Gene Technology Regulator—and I will keep hammering this all of the way through—gives the regulator far more security against challenges to the regulator's decisions if the bill has the clarity that I propose it should have in relation to monitoring and auditing. If we need an example of why these amendments should be adopted by the government and the Labor Party, we only have to look at the Mount Gambier situation to see the appalling way in which the interim gene technology regulator—I stress that it is the interim gene technology regulator—failed to ensure that the conditions of the licence were met. These amendments would make it mandatory, irrespective of the conditions of the licence, that the regulator could enter premises for the purpose of monitoring and auditing.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government is opposed to these amendments. In relation to the amendment involving entry of premises, the amendment cannot be supported. Senator Harris's amendments would infringe civil liberties by requiring that any person covered by a licence, regardless of whether they are required to comply with certain conditions, must allow the GTR to enter their premises. The way the bill is currently drafted, if conditions are imposed on farmers about how crops should be grown or on the producers of seed about how the seed should be labelled, the GTR will be able to enter their premises to conduct monitoring and auditing.
The government cannot agree with the amendment relating to audits either. The Gene Technology Bill 2000 as currently drafted ensures that the GTR has the power to conduct audits of all GMOs covered by a licence, including all transitional dealings. The bill also provides the most extensive repertoire of monitoring, enforcement and surveillance powers possible. In addition, the transitional arrangements are only in place for a maximum of two years. If the applicant wishes to continue the dealings with the GMOs beyond two years, the applicant must reapply for a new licence fully reviewed by the GTR. The amendments are opposed.

(68)	Heading to clause 66, page 44 (line 27), omit ""may"", substitute ""must"".
(69)	Clause 66, page 44 (line 28), omit ""may"", substitute ""must"".
These amendments would require that a person who is aware of additional information about risks to the health and safety of people through the licensing of GMOs must, rather than may, inform the regulator. I commend these amendments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (72) on sheet 1970:
(72)	Clause 67, page 45 (after line 9), at the end of the clause, add:
	(2)	A person does not incur any civil liability in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because the first person gave information to the Regulator in good faith otherwise than under section 65 or 66.
This amendment refers to clause 67 of the bill, which reads: 
A person ... does not incur any civil liability in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person because the first person gave information to the Regulator. 
The clause is protecting that person. I am adding to that: `in good faith otherwise than under section 65 or 66'. It is just giving protection to a person who in good faith is acting in the public interest.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government is opposed to this amendment. The bill already provides in clause 67 that people do not incur any civil liability if they give information to the regulator and if another person suffers loss or damage as a result. It appears that Senator Brown is including an additional subclause that mirrors the existing clause but is subject to the additional requirement that the information be given in good faith. We do not believe the amendment substantively adds to the existing provisions, and we do not support it.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

(42)	Clause 37, page 26 (lines 14 to 25)
(77)	Part 6, page 50 (line 2) to page 55 (line 5).
The object of opposing these is to simply get rid of the provision that so-called notifiable low-risk dealings do not have to be licensed by the regulator—of course, they should be. We want, across the board, accountability for people dealing in GMOs and GM products. To allow this part to remain not only establishes a whole range of such dealings that would not have to be licensed but puts the regulator in the position of having to define where the boundary is in terms of determining that. We want a one-stop shop. We want transparency. We want anybody to be able to know what is going on as far as GM technology in the country is concerned. To create a whole order of so-called low-risk dealings which do not have to be recorded or notified, or therefore licensed, is contrary to that ideal of transparency and the public interest.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government believes that the clauses should stand as printed. As the simplified outline in the bill explains, part 6 of the bill established a mechanism for the regulations to regulate certain dealings with GMOs that do not involve the intentional release of GMOs into the environment. These dealings are called notifiable low-risk dealings. Notifiable low-risk dealings are dealings that the GTR considers to be particularly low risk. This is because the GMO is biologically contained—that is, it has a reduced ability to survive or reproduce in the open environment. It is not pathogenic and does not produce new proteins that are of high risk because they are toxic. 
The regulations describe the categories of notifiable low-risk dealings, as well as the requirements and conditions that must be complied with by a person proposing to undertake notifiable low-risk dealings. The Greens amendments propose to delete the streamlined and sensible notifiable low-risk dealings arrangement, as well as the register of GMOs, in part through these amendments but also through amendments yet to be debated but which have been circulated. The register and the notifiable low-risk dealings are important components of the regulatory system. They ensure that the level of regulation can be tailored to the level of risk. The government will not support amendments that would see these categories deleted. The government understands the adverse effect that this would have on Australia's research and development base.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—I commend Senator Brown on the last question. I want to make reference yet again to the amount of delegated legislation that we will be dealing with as a consequence of this legislation. I think that some of these issues should well be included in the bill and that it is an unfortunate and increasing trend by governments to ensure that they have as much discretion and flexibility as they can to put these things in a delegated form. 
I was also going to ask for an example of what would be classified as a low-risk dealing. I am wondering if Senator Tambling is opposed to referring to the broad outline of the regulations and what they will contain, which is obviously available. Certainly, there is a general indicator in the bill, but I am wondering if there are specific examples that Senator Tambling can provide. Obviously, he made reference to the research base and research industry. I am wondering if we are talking about work largely based in laboratories or research institutions. Perhaps Senator Tambling could elaborate on that point. I have received an interesting email from a member of the public who was curious to know what Senator Tambling was reading from. I have assured them that it is the advice provided to him by advisers and the department, but I am happy to stand corrected. I thought that was an interesting observation.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,—I am advised that the circumstance of the issue that is being considered is that it is always in a contained situation.

There is wide consultation on this whole process.,SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I would like to seek some clarification from Senator Tambling on two issues. Senator Tambling is saying that the determination of a low-risk dealing will be based on scientific evidence. A reprint of the Canadian Journal of Health and Nutrition that was put out in March this year, which refers to toxin seepage from Biotech corn, states:
Corn has been genetically engineered to contain a toxin called Bt to kill insect pests that eat the corn. Research at New York University shows that the Bt toxin is leaking through the roots of the plants into the soil. Scientists and environmentalists are concerned that the toxin may harm beneficial soil organisms, produce Bt-resistant super-bugs, or cause other ecological damage.
I ask Senator Tambling: how would the gene technology regulator have been able to, on scientific evidence that did not exist, allow that Biotech corn to proceed on the basis that it was a low risk? When the senator has an answer to that one, could he give us an answer to this particular section, which states:
Research published in the scientific journal Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease (No 4, 1999) warns that a virus that is inserted into many transgenic crops may result in widespread crop damage. The virus in question, the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), is used to activate genetically-engineered genes. However, the researchers state that it may also reactivate dormant viruses—
this is the section that I would like Senator Tambling to address—
or create new viruses that attack the host species and spread to other plants.
Taking into consideration Senator Tambling's point that these would be contained dealings, my question to Senator Tambling is: how will the gene technology regulator perceive the unforeseen and rule something a low risk?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I will take the two very specific questions on notice. Senator Harris has drawn to my attention at a very late stage in the debate particular detailed issues of magazines that have not previously been put before me or of which I have no knowledge whatsoever. I do not have those in detail, so I will take those on notice. I indicate to him that if he had looked at the Explanatory guide to the draft Commonwealth Gene Technology Regulations 2000 that were issued to him in August 2000, he would have seen that the issue of notifiable low-risk dealings would only be those that—and let me quote from page 42 of that explanatory guide: 
·	have been assessed over time as presenting minimal biosafety risks where such risks can be properly managed through containment of the GMO in a laboratory certified to physical containment level 2.
For example, some of the factors considered in assessing a GMO to be of lowrisk (with the low risk able to be managed through containment measures) include the extent to which the GMO is ` biologically contained' (because it has a reduced ability to survive or reproduce without human intervention) and the properties of the GMO including the inability of the GMO to be a pathogen or pest or produce toxic proteins.
·	do not involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment.
That is the end of the quote from the explanatory guide. The whole point of the regulatory scheme is that it adopts a very cautious and transparent approach based on science. The regulator has access to expert scientific advice through the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee and public comment but also has the capacity to undertake independent research if that is what is necessary to identify risks.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I thank Senator Tambling for his answer. I would just like to seek some clarification. Once a licence is issued for a particular dealing, if the Gene Technology Regulator received an application for a similar dealing, would the subsequent dealings have to be licensed? To phrase that another way: if a corporation in the industry applied for and received a licence for a particular dealing, could the remainder of the industry also carry out that dealing without a licence?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I am advised that the answer to the first part of the question posed by Senator Harris is yes; to the second part, the answer is no.

(2)	Clause 78, page 53 (lines 14 to 16), omit subclause (1), substitute:

	(a)	the dealing is, or has been, authorised by a GMO licence; or
	(b)	the GMO concerned:
	(i)	is a GM product; and
	(ii)	is a genetically modified organism only because of regulations made under paragraph (c) of the definition of genetically modified organism.
This amendment clarifies the intention that the GMO register will contain only GMOs that have previously been licensed by the Gene Technology Regulator and that GM products that are not live, viable GMOs but that have been prescribed under the bill as GMOs may also be included on the register. This amendment has been discussed in detail with officials from all states and territories and is agreed across all jurisdictions.

	(a)	a person who is a member of the Consultative Group;
	(b)	a person who is a member of the Ethics Committee.
The Minister is not required to be satisfied that these persons have skills or experience in an area mentioned in subsection (5).
This amendment seeks to amend clause 100 with respect to the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee. It is our view that it is important to ensure greater transparency and more community involvement on this committee. Therefore, we are proposing that the minister must ensure that the committee includes a person who is a member of the consultative group and a person who is a member of the ethics committee. This will ensure that the ethical concerns and the consumer concerns will be represented and heard in the major decision influencing forum established by the legislation.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—The Democrats will be supporting the amendment.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government agrees with and accepts this amendment which ensures that the scientific committee established under the legislation will also include a member of the community consultative group and the ethics committee. While this does not add additional costs to the running of the committee as it increases membership, it does ensure that there is sufficient communication and cross-membership between the committees. Therefore, the government accepts it. I would like to assure senators of the government's intention in relation to the broader composition of the Gene Technology Community Consultative Committee. The government will ensure that the committee is by no means hostage to a particular interest group or scientific view. The bill ensures this by providing that the membership of the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee must be very broadly based. Not only must the committee include experts in specific scientific disciplines such as molecular biology, virology, entomology and microbiology, but the legislation also requires experts in areas such as public health, risk assessment and occupational health and safety. Importantly, the committee must also include a layperson. This will ensure that the committee is representative of a range of disciplines and that it is not hijacked by one point of view. The committee will contain members who represent both reductionist perspectives and holistic perspectives, to ensure that all risks are properly identified and assessed on both macro and micro levels.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

The only difference between Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment and Labor's amendment is that we would have asked for a layperson to be present on that technical committee. As well as having somebody from the consultative committee on the technical committee, I believe it is important that there be a representative of the community or a community group. It was with that in mind that Pauline Hanson's One Nation initially moved that amendment. I support Labor's amendment to bring on a person from the consultative committee and commend the amendment to the committee.

	(b)	a representative of the Australian Conservation Foundation; 
	(c)	a representative of the Organic Federation of Australia.
The Minister is not required to be satisfied that a person mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c) has skills or experience in an area mentioned in subsection (5).

	(a)	term of appointment;
	(b)	resignation;
(c)	leave of absence;
	(c)	dermination of appointment to the extent that it is not covered by this Division.
These amendments would quite specifically bring onto the committee, besides a layperson, a representative of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the umbrella organisation for conservation in Australia, and a representative of the Organic Federation of Australia, which represents organic growers, who are most alarmed about the potential for contamination. Let us remember: if they get GM contaminated, their livelihood will be gone, they will be done for. Yet organic food is arguably the fastest growing, most gilt-edged part of food production in Australia. Certainly at family farm level, that is true. This is the case in my state of Tasmania, as you would know, Temporary Chairman Sherry. This is not in conflict with the amendment which we have just passed. I strongly recommend these amendments to the chamber. I do hope that the government and the opposition can support these amendments.

If that is correct, I would support the addition of those two groups. I think it is balanced in that you have someone as a representative of the conservation groups but, equally as important, it would also bring on a representative from the organic farming industry.

These amendments would remove conflict of interest from the committees and the regulator.

It is a clean-up clause. It simply puts to rest the great fear that many of us have that it will not be very long at all before this technical advisory committee, which is quite an important one, is simply going to have appointees with a vested interest in the industry. That is a conflict of interest.

(b) the need for policy principles, policy guidelines, codes of practice and technical and procedural guidelines in relation to GMOs and GM products and the content of such principles, guidelines and codes.
Our amendment inserts a further subclause (aa) which reads:
matters of general concern identified by the Regulator in relation to applications made under this Act;
Whilst we would have preferred to see the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group have a role in assessing individual applications, we believe that the acceptance of a representative from the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group on the Gene Technology Advisory Council, which has already been agreed to in an earlier amendment, plus the explicit statement in our amendment that I have just read out, will provide for greater community involvement and hearing than currently exists in the clause as it stands. Our amendment will mean that concerns raised about individual applications, either through the public submission process or other forums identified by the regulator, can be referred to the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group for advice. This broadens considerably the functions of the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group and, accordingly, we ask the committee to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I rise also to support Labor's amendment. Pauline Hanson's One Nation has a similar amendment (47). As Senator Forshaw has indicated, it would be the preference of the Labor Party for each individual application to be assessed by this committee. However, he has indicated that those negotiations with the government have failed and, therefore, we now rely on the regulator's request from the consultative group. I believe it would be far more appropriate if the consultative group had the ability to comment on the policy principles, the guidelines, the codes of practice and the technical and procedural guidelines, as well as individual applications. It is very obvious that there is no support from the government for the committee to have, as of right, an ability to comment on individual applications. There is nothing in these amendments that binds the regulator to accept the advice from the consultative group. That would be an improvement to clause 107 of the bill. In speaking to and supporting Labor's amendment, I indicate that I will not proceed with Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment (47).

(10)	Page 69 (after line 15), after clause 107, insert:
107A  Citizens' juries
	(1)	The Consultative Committee may appoint a citizens' jury on an ad hoc basis to assist in the performance of its functions.
	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), a citizens' jury may assist the Consultative Committee to: 
	(a)	formulate advice on a question of policy of significant public interest; or
	(b)	raise awareness and promote education in relation to an issue of significant public interest.
	(3)	The Consultative Committee is to appoint 18 members of a citizens' jury with the aim of ensuring that the jury is randomly selected and demographically representative.
	(4)	The regulations may prescribe matters relating to the following:
	(a)	the basis for selecting the jury;
	(b)	the mode of operation of the jury, including procedures for collecting evidence and questioning witnesses;
	(c)	the preparation of jury reports;
	(d)	the publication of the jury's findings and recommendations.
(5)	The Regulator must adopt any recommendation made by a citizens' jury or publish reasons for not doing so.
This amendment relates to public involvement and public confidence in not only the regulator but also the whole regime and the debate about GMOs, their approval and application processes. I think Senator Tambling and others would be aware of some things that have happened internationally: the bodies, conferences and committees that have been formed to ensure maximum public consultation and input, particularly in the UK. That is basically the concept of a citizens' jury. In Australia, probably the closest thing we have come to it in relation to the debate on GMOs was the consensus conference, which saw a combination of lay people and representatives from industry and various sectors of the population debating some of their concerns and questions about GMOs. 
I have had brief discussions with the government and I understand that this amendment in its current form may not be acceptable. I am happy to listen to the suggestions of the government in relation to how we could pass something that constitutes a similar concept to this; that is, the opportunity to randomly select people from all over Australia and from the standard range of different demographic groups based on geography, educational background, gender, age, ethnicity, et cetera, to participate in these juries. So the 18-member juries would have those characteristics, which I think are necessary to ensure a diverse range of views are reflected and represented in relation to this issue of debate. I ask the government to outline what they are prepared to consider in the form of this amendment—certainly in relation to maximising public participation and consultation. I do commend the concept of citizens' juries and hope that we do follow some of world's best practice—examples of which we are seeing in places like the UK—in relation to this issue.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—While the government will not support this amendment, the government will agree to establish a consensus conference rather than a citizens' jury. The government agrees with the principle that good policy decisions are informed by extensive consultation through various means. The First Australian Consensus Conference on Gene Technology in the Food Chain made a number of recommendations which informed this bill. We see future conferences being equally useful. Therefore, while agreeing to the principle, we do not accept the amendment, seeing other avenues to achieve the outcome. We will convene this conference within the first 12 months of operation of the GTR and we will be happy to consult Senator Stott Despoja on the details.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—While I am sorry that the citizens' jury concept is not one we are adopting in Australia, I think it is only a matter of time; I will be a bit of a pollyanna on this one; maybe it is just the time of the morning. I nevertheless thank Senator Tambling for that commitment. I am sure he will be a man of his word and the government will not only fulfil this commitment to me but to the Australian people—now that it is on record in the federal parliament. Unlike the commitment that was given by the government—indeed, by Senator Hill, who is sitting here today—to the Democrats to include a strong role for the environment minister in relation to the approval process of GMOs under this legislation, I am sure this promise will not be broken.  
I do believe that Senator Tambling and his advisers have a clear understanding of how beneficial that consensus conference was. I do not think anyone who attended it, regardless of whether they were from Monsanto or from the Consumers Association, doubted the extraordinary benefits of that discussion. I highly recommend that the senators and members of the public read the communique, which outlines some of the issues for discussion. I think all sectors of the industry have probably learnt from that communique, just as it made an impression on government. In the hope that it has made an indelible impression on the parliamentary secretary, I thank him for his commitment and can assure him that the Democrats will endeavour to hold him and the government to it.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

These are amendments to ensure that the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group has amongst the membership a layperson, a representative of the Australian Conservation Foundation and a representative of the Organic Federation of Australia. I would again ask the Labor Party to consider making that appointment. It is probably even more right that these appointments should be made to this particular group. It is the community consultative group, and if representatives of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Organic Federation of Australia are there in this consultation group then a lot of people are going to feel better about that, particularly those who feel most vulnerable or concerned about the spread of genetic technology into the natural and rural environments in Australia.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

I move these amendments so that the same community groups have representation on the Gene Technology Ethics Committee membership, but I recognise that Labor has just copped out totally as far as community representation here is concerned and is going to leave it to the government.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government does not support these amendments. The states, territories and Commonwealth believe that a broad right of review would be costly, would diminish certainty and decision making, and could have a very negative effect on research and development which currently represents over 90 per cent of the Interim Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—Which, paraphrased, says that the public, to quote a phrase I heard earlier in the night, are `pests and possibly pathogens'! We are simply extending public involvement in this, and the government is saying no. It is a pretty simple test. There is public concern about GE. The government would be doing itself a favour if it allowed more public involvement and not less. But the opportunity is not being taken here. I think that is simply going to lead to greater controversy about this matter, as people feel frustrated: they cannot get the information, they do not have community representatives on the relevant committees, they do not have adequate standing and they feel frustrated and left out of the process. I think the government is making a rod for its own back. That is a political decision that it is making.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—The Greens amendments would go a long way to having much better public confidence in this bill. Senator Tambling has indicated the government will not support this. The government is not even prepared to support the rights of adjoining property owners. The amendments that have been put forward by the Greens would have, under this amendment, given those people standing. It is a pity that the government and the Labor Party will not recognise that people adjoining have rights, and those rights should be respected.

183A  Extended standing for judicial review
	(1)	This section extends (and does not limit) the meaning of the term person aggrieved in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for the purposes of the application of that Act in relation to:
	(a)	a decision made under this Act or the regulations; or
	(b)	a failure to make a decision under this Act or the regulations; or
	(c)	conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision under this Act or the regulations.
	(2)	A State is taken to be a person aggrieved by the decision, failure or conduct.
	(3)	A term (except person aggrieved) used in this section and in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act.
Senators will recall that, when we were dealing with amendment No. 4 relating to GM-free zones, I foreshadowed that we would also be moving a Labor amendment which would allow for states that believe that the regulator has not taken account of a state's specific environmental concerns to have standing to appeal such a decision to the Federal Court. That is the purpose of amendment No. 16. Senators will note that the definition of a `person aggrieved' in subclause (2) will include a state and, accordingly, the amendment supports that earlier amendment that we passed regarding extending the rights of states in this particular area.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government will accept this amendment. Minister Llewellyn, the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industries, Water and Environment, has sought confirmation that, in addition to being invited to make comments on risks associated with a GMO, the regulator will have to take this advice into account and that states will be closely involved in the development of risk assessment criteria. I am happy to give this assurance.
I would like to put on record the fact that the bill provides that the GTR must seek the advice of states and territories in making a licensing decision where the release of the GMO would be into the open environment. The GTR must take the states' advice into account in terms of both risk assessment and the risk management processes. In addition, states and territories will be closely involved in the development of the risk assessment criteria which will underpin the regulator's scientific assessment of risks posed by the GMOs. The risk assessment criteria will ensure that the regulator must take into account advice provided by states, including any specific risks peculiar to an individual state or a geographic region within a state.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 2067.
 (1)	Clause 185, page 120 (after line 28), after subclause (2), insert:
	(2A)	The Regulator must refuse to declare that information is confidential commercial information if the information relates to one or more locations at which field trials involving GMOs are occurring, or are proposed to occur, unless the Regulator is satisfied that significant damage to the health and safety of people, the environment or property would be likely to occur if the locations were disclosed.
Note:	This means that, in general, information about sites where dealings with GMOs are occurring will be required to be disclosed under sections 54 and 138, unless the Regulator is satisfied that disclosure would involve significant risks to health and safety.
 (2)	Clause 185, page 120, after line 30, after subclause (3), insert:
	(3A)	If:
	(a)	the Regulator declares that particular information is confidential commercial information, and
	(b)	the information relates to one or more locations at which field trials involving GMOs are occurring, or are proposed to occur;
the Regulator must make publicly available a statement of reasons for the making of the declaration, including, but not limited to:
	(c)	the reasons why the Regulator was satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1); and
	(d)	the reasons why the Regulator was not satisfied under subsection (2) that the public interest in disclosure of the information outweighed the prejudice that the disclosure would cause; and
	(e)	the reasons why the Regulator was satisfied under subsection (2A) that significant damage to the health and safety of people, the environment or property would be likely to occur if the locations were disclosed.
These amendments relate to confidential commercial information. The Senate inquiry recommended that, where an application for an intentional release of a GMO into the environment includes the size and location of the proposed release, this information should be made available. We have been advised that, while location and size of field trials will be required by the regulator, in the case of commercial release this information would only be provided to the extent that it was possible to do so and would most likely be general information, such as releases above or below certain latitudes. We have, therefore, in our amendment sought to ensure that locations and sizes of field trials will be disclosed unless there is proof that significant damage to property, human health and the environment would occur as a result of this disclosure. In such a case, the regulator must publish the reasons for withholding the location information. This allows for public scrutiny of the suitability of the decision and provision of information to anyone who should seek to challenge the decision in the Federal Court.

		Nothing in this Division limits, or is to be taken as limiting, the discretion of a person to make a decision under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to grant access to a document.
This is a standard amendment that the Democrats put forward, normally by Senator Andrew Murray, as our accountability spokesperson.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—The government will oppose this amendment. The government cannot agree to it. The effect of the amendment would be that information that is declared to be confidential information by the regulator, having satisfied the very limited criteria for declaration in the legislation, would then be released under the Freedom of Information Act 1982.

192A  Interference with dealings with GMOs
	(1)	A person is guilty of an offence if:
	(a)	the person engages in conduct; and
	(b)	the conduct:
	(i)	results in damage to, destruction of, or interference with, premises at which dealings with GMOs are being undertaken; or
	(ii)	involves damaging, destroying, or interfering with, a thing at, or removing a thing from, such premises; and
	(c)	the owner or occupier of the premises, or the owner of the thing (as the case requires) has not consented to the conduct; and
	(d)	in engaging in the conduct, the person intends to prevent or hinder authorised GMO dealings that are being undertaken at the premises or facility; and
	(e)	the person knows, or is reckless as to, the matters mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c).
		Maximum penalty:	Imprisonment for 2 years or 120 penalty units.
Note:	Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.
	(2)	In this section:
authorised GMO dealings, in relation to premises or a facility, means dealings with GMOs being undertaken at the premises or facility: 
	(a)	that are authorised to be undertaken at the premises or facility by a GMO licence; or
	(b)	that are notifiable low risk dealings; or
	(c)	that are exempt dealings; or
	(d)	that are deregulated GMO dealings.
We have, by virtue of earlier amendments, provided for penalties, and we toughened those penalties in respect of companies which engaged in actions which, for instance, unlawfully or deliberately released GM products into the environment. Those amendments were adopted by the chamber.
This amendment, amendment (19), would provide for penalties where persons engage in conduct which results in damage to, destruction of, or interference with, premises at which dealings with GMOs are being undertaken, and similar actions. It is our view that information obtained by persons, for instance, about where GM trials are being undertaken or other similar activities are occurring must be used responsibly. We cannot and should not tolerate either threats of damage to GMO sites or such damage being carried out. Accordingly, we believe that this provides a balance in terms of illegal activities that are undertaken against the gene technology sector.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—All night we have had the government and the opposition backing away from having strong regulation and a strong hand on the GE industry. Now, when it comes to people involved in taking action against crops—like we have seen elsewhere around the world—we stiffen the penalties. You cannot have this. I have a friend currently facing some months jail in Tasmania because she peacefully stood in front of a bulldozer in the forest. We are seeing this great tendency towards giving totally untoward penalties for people standing up for the environment or the public good by protesting in good faith against something which is wrong, yet tonight we could not even pass an ironclad insurance policy for the people who would be damaged by this industry. There is no compensation fund. Time and again, the requirement that this industry be responsible for what it has done is ducked, but we end up saying that people who stand up against it and make a peaceful protest against the spread of GMOs are going to be penalised even more strongly because Labor thinks that the government is being too soft on them. What a situation!",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I would like to briefly respond to Senator Brown. I note Senator Brown was quite prepared to support our earlier amendments which increased the severity of the penalties where breaches of licence conditions occur. I remind Senator Brown that we actually strengthened those penalties substantially by introducing provision for imprisonment terms of two years for lesser offences and five years for serious offences. Senator Brown was quite happy to support that because such penalties would clearly apply to persons or companies engaged in GMO research or gene technology work; however Senator Brown has just stood up and said that it is appropriate for those who seek to wreck this industry, who seek to damage it, to get off scot-free and not be subject to any real penalty at all. I point out that the penalties contained in our amendment have a maximum term of two years, which is substantially less than the maximum term that is provided in the other section. I think the real proof of Senator Brown's approach in this area has just been demonstrated.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—There is the champion defender of verballing, if you don't mind. Let me just say again that we have seen Labor support the government time after time tonight in ducking strong provisions to defend the community against the big end of town. But it has ended the night by increasing the penalties against the other end of town. What has the Labor Party come to? ",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-07,"—I support Labor's amendment in principle, but I have just one concern and would seek some clarification from either Senator Forshaw or Senator Tambling in relation to 1(e), which states:
(e) the person knows, or is reckless as to, the matters mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c).
As I said, I support the amendment in principle but I am questioning: what would be a definition of a person who is reckless in relation to (b) and (c)? ",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-07,"—Might I just respond by saying that the concept of recklessness is actually recognised within criminal law. Without wanting to get into a long dissertation about it, my recollection from my earlier law student days is that a person can be guilty of an offence where their approach is of such a reckless nature that they essentially do not care about the consequences of their actions, which they should have known would have been likely to have arisen. Generally speaking, under criminal law, there needs to be an intention to commit a crime and to do the damage as well. I am sorry that it is a very brief summary, but recklessness is a concept clearly recognised at law. No doubt it would be something that would be determined under any proceedings that occurred.

 (2)	Clause 34, page 25 (lines 10 and 11), omit ""a fine of not more than whichever of the following amounts applies"", substitute ""whichever of the following applies"".
These amendments are consequential to earlier amendments that we moved, which were amendments Nos 5 and 8. Those amendments provided for the increase in penalties related to imprisonment for breaches of licence conditions. But we did notice that, after those amendments were carried, we also needed to alter the wording of the actual clause in the bill from it providing just for a fine to providing for a fine or a term of imprisonment. That is the effect of these amendments—that either of those two penalties would be applicable.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-07,"—I want to ask a question of Senator Tambling. In the context of my question earlier about refuge and buffer zones, you talked about the regulator's ability to make a risk assessment. Is it not the case that an assessment of risk has to be in keeping with the objects of the act? I am wondering how the regulator would be able to address an issue of assessment of risk in relation to contamination that was trade related, for example, as opposed to being within the objects of the act; that is, the parameters of health, safety and environmental issues. So, if there is an assessment based on contamination in relation to trade or a risk that has a trade relation, is that outside the scope of the regulator's power to assess risk under the bill?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-07,"—I would like to follow up Senator Stott Despoja's point because it is important and I wonder if the minister understood it. She was asking about the risk that is involved in a commercial way, that is involved in the handling of GE and GMO products, as against those things listed up front—environmental safety and health. It seems to be a pretty important one and I wonder, if it is not there in the legislation, how the government is going to transmit to the council that it, in its development of policy, should consider that matter.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,50,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-12-07,"—I am advised that the ministerial council has the capacity to make GM-free zones, as was done in the Labor Party's amendment. In addition, the regulator looks at the spread of GMOs in the environment, and `the environment' is defined very broadly.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—by leave—I said to Senator Faulkner earlier in the day that I would attempt to respond to the return to order instructing me in relation to GST polling. We have been working long and hard to achieve the requirements of the Senate in this regard, and I have to confess that the project is only part complete. I can tell Senator Faulkner that, in the case of the Department of the Environment and Heritage, I do not know of any GST related polling and that my department advised me that it has not commissioned any GST related polling. The office of the Attorney-General has responded to us and said that neither the Attorney-General's Department nor any portfolio agency has commissioned or conducted any public opinion poll on the GST. In the case of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I am advised by his office that no such polling has been conducted by the Department of Transport and Regional Services.
The office of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, advises me that that department did not commission any GST related public opinion polling between 1 January 1999 and 30 September 2000. The office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has confirmed that no GST related public opinion polling was undertaken by that department. The office of the Minister for Finance and Administration advises me that his department has conducted no GST public opinion polls between 1 January 1999 and 30 September 2000. The office of the Minister for Defence advises that the department has not commissioned any GST related public opinion polling.
The chief of staff of Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, has informed us that the Department of Industry, Science and Resources conducted public opinion polling in the context of a wide biotechnology awareness program. The research, conducted in February 2000, formed part of the proposed strategy for a biotechnology public awareness program put forward by Turnbull Porter Novelli, who were chosen through a tender process to deliver aspects of the Biotechnology Australia public awareness program.
Quantum Market Research was the nominated research firm that formed part of Turnbull Porter Novelli's tender proposal. The primary focus of the research was not the GST. Information about this research was included in a response to a question placed on notice by Senator Faulkner on 3 March 2000, which I think was notice No. 1987. Senator Faulkner would have that response. In the case of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, I am advised that the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business did not commission any GST public opinion polling between 1 November 1999 and 30 September 2000 inclusive. So we have been successful in excluding a large number of departments. That is as much information as we have been able to get in the short period available. We are continuing to press the remaining ministries, and I can see no problem with tabling other responses as they become available during the recess, which I think was what was requested by me of Senator Faulkner.  ",SENATE,<title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PUBLIC OPINION POLLING</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,53,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-12-07,"—by leave—The truth of the matter is that the opposition moved this order of the Senate on 30 November. It followed an answer in question time the day before from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp, of course, did not answer the question that was asked of him—hardly surprising, because that is a pattern that we are used to with Senator Kemp. He produced some filler material and rabbited on about how well the GST had gone down with the public. As we know, the small business people and the members of the community who contact the opposition complaining about the complexity and cost of the requirements of the new tax system would beg to disagree with Assistant Treasurer Kemp on those matters.
What the opposition did was to give notice of motion requiring the government to produce the evidence, to come up with the public opinion polling research on the goods and services tax, so the parliament could judge for itself whether the new tax system had been as well received as Senator Kemp claims. We know that the government has spent more than $5 million of taxpayers' money in undertaking all manner of opinion polling, market research and tracking exercises to assess the introduction of the tax system. We believe that as the taxpayers have paid for it they are entitled to have access to that information. Of course there is no reason to deny the parliament this information. I think Senator Hill has at least grudgingly accepted that. I acknowledge the fact that Senator Hill has agreed to comply with my request earlier that this material be tabled as it comes to hand.
I find it inexplicable that the odd contact with Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office could not have made this task a great deal easier than it seems to have been. I am disappointed that in the time available the government has not been able to provide this important information to the Senate. We accept that in some of these orders of the Senate there is a difficult coordination task and, as my colleagues would acknowledge, the opposition always takes a very reasonable approach in relation to these sorts of issues. I think I can say on behalf of my colleagues that we are prepared to agree on this occasion to the approach that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has outlined. We would ask of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to work assiduously to ensure that this material is collected and tabled out of session as soon as possible. I can see the level of commitment from my colleagues in relation to this matter. On that basis, the opposition will be looking forward to this information as soon as it comes to hand.",SENATE,<title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PUBLIC OPINION POLLING</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,53,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—While we are waiting, I might just bring the Senate up to date in relation to matters still to be dealt with. The Senate is awaiting a message from the House of Representatives, the first on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Bill 2000, which we hope will be with us in the not too distant future. That debate has been completed in the House—
—It is a very complex process, apparently, writing and forwarding these messages. That is the first message that we are to receive back, which we are now told will get to us in about 30 minutes time, and we hope that it will be followed shortly thereafter by a message on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000. Unless somebody advises me otherwise, I think that is about the last of the legislative business that we need to deal with in this session, unless the Senate was of a mind to fill in the time with one of the bills that we so generously withdrew from the Notice Paper earlier in the evening.
As I do not sense that the Senate is of the mood to start another piece of legislation at 10 past three in the morning, I suggest to the Senate that we could say a few words to wind up the year in good spirit. Hopefully, it would mean that it would not be necessary to have an adjournment debate a little later. ",SENATE,<title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PUBLIC OPINION POLLING</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,53,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-12-07,"—I move:
That the committee agrees to the amendment made by the House of Representatives to the bill.
I am assuming that what the House has done is to take the indexation part out of the bill. I am assuming that with confidence and I commend the House for that wise decision. To include indexation in this particular bill is, in my view, unwise for the reasons that I outlined earlier. But, as we have some new blood in the Senate at this time of the night, I will run through them again.
This bill sets a charge which is really the inducement for the purchase of renewable energy, and it is important to get the charge at the right level. The opposition has argued that an indexation provision will keep the charge at the right level. We on this side have said that there is no real link between CPI increases and the charge level that is necessary to meet the objectives of the bill. Therefore a better course of action is to use the provision of the bill that requires that the bill be reconsidered after a period of years—and that provision has been included within the legislation. One of the specific charges of that inquiry process is, in fact, to look at the appropriate level of the charge. If it is found through that process that the charge, as it has been set at $40, is no longer sufficient to achieve the objectives of the bill, then we can assume that the government of the day will act to alter the charge. Obviously, it would do that because the government would have an interest in ensuring that the act worked effectively.
Therefore I submit to the Senate that to include indexation, whilst I understand the motive of the opposition in doing so, is not well founded and will not achieve the purpose which Senator Bolkus is seeking to achieve, and that the mechanism of the review and the consideration of all factors as to whether the charge is adequate for the time being is a better way to proceed. It is on that basis that I urge the Senate to agree to the amendment by the House of Representatives and to accept that the indexation is not appropriate for inclusion within this bill and should therefore be removed.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) (CHARGE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,56,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—This is a pretty disappointing response from the minister and from the government. This is an important piece of legislation. It is one that the Senate has already recognised as being flawed in many respects. We have been successful in getting quite a number of amendments up this evening, but I think it would have been in the government's interests to have accepted the indexation measure, a measure which would have put some real ongoing value into the charge and, as a consequence, could have driven some of the industries that are really necessary under the government's objectives here. 
It does not leave us with an easy decision. There are different driving forces, different pressures—competing industry pressures, for instance. Senator Brown mentioned earlier our large renewable energy sector out there wanting to get going under this legislation. We have had representations from the Sustainable Energy Industry Association, from the Renewable Energy Generators Association, the Stanwell Corporation, a number of state governments, Pacific Hydro and Tasmanian Hydro—a whole range of industries keen to get this legislation in place. At the same time there are some pretty substantive environmental concerns, and we have been trying to address those during the course of the debate, although coming to this part of the debate we have to make a decision now as to what we do with our insistence on the amendment. As I say, the environmental concerns are essentially twofold. There are concerns about the protection of native forests from this measure and also the transparency of the government's legislation. 
Let me weigh up where we are at the end of this debate. On the one hand, in terms of maintaining the value of the charge, we have been able to get the government to concede that the charge not be tax deductible. As a consequence, the measure is maintained to some degree in real value. On the other hand, having brought forward the review of the measure, what we are really arguing about here is something like $3 over the next couple of years: the index of the charge will increase it by about $3 over two years or by about $5 over three years. We were very keen to get the review brought forward by a year to ensure that we had some protection in case the government was not going to accept the indexation. The scrutiny provisions that we have picked up, drawing on the amendments moved by the Democrats, by the Greens and by us, essentially give us a much more transparent process, and that is not just to the benefit of the public interest but also in the interests of protecting the environment. Essentially, therefore, we have been quite successful in getting a whole batch of amendments up to ensure transparency and to ensure that the measure is enhanced in value—although not as enhanced as we would like. There are problems with the bill. There are problems as to whether it will achieve what it sets out to do. There are also problems as to ensuring that the environmental damage that people are concerned about will not flow from the passage of the legislation.
It is a hard decision to make, but at the end of this process it falls on the side of letting the legislation through. Given the balance of considerations and the balance of amendments that we have been able to wrangle out of the government, and given that the value has been maintained—particularly through the tax-deductible concession of the government—we are prepared to give the legislation a chance. We do not do it wholeheartedly, but we acknowledge that there is a driving force in the renewable energy sector that could benefit from this. However, we warn the government that there are a number of areas in the legislation that we will be monitoring closely with a view to redressing them when we win government in some 12 months time.
As I said, the index measure probably amounts to about $3 over two years. For that amount of money, it is probably not worth bowling over the legislation at this stage. Senator Hill, you have not done this in your best interests. You have probably been driven to do this by people like Senator Ferris, Senator Heffernan and Senator Minchin. But we will not stand in the way of this reform as a consequence, and I indicate that we will not be insisting on our amendments—though I do so without much enthusiasm.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-12-07,"—I suppose we have won a few small improvements to the bill this evening, but the big one that the ALP have been delaying this bill for—CPI adjustment—has just been given away. I really wonder why a special amendment bill had to be introduced just a few hours ago and why the debate we had to have at that stage went ahead only to have the ALP cave in a few hours later. We really could have done all of this two months ago and had the measure up and running in January. 
I do not want to extend this debate any longer than is necessary, but I think it is essential to put a few points on the record. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 debate was unfinished business in more than one sense. The last time it was in the Senate was on 10 October. The debate then was not concluded for a number of reasons. Obviously, the ALP did not want the bill passed before COP6. I was very surprised when the ALP did their turnaround by, at the end of debate, declaring that they would insist on their CPI adjustment of the penalty after all, having not supported our efforts to remove native forests from the measure and a number of other amendments as well.
I did say on 10 October that we would do what so many players had asked, and that was to try to improve the bill—there were certainly plenty of ways that we could do that—and to make sure that it passed the Senate in the best form that the Senate could manage. Senator Bolkus's efforts to talk out the bill, so it would not come to the vote back then, were successful. To some degree I am grateful for the time that provided for us to regroup and to consult and talk with the people with the most at stake. Painful as Senator Bolkus's attacks on me and my colleagues were, I am grateful to have had that opportunity—although, at the end of the day, the outcome is hardly any different. We already had tax deductibility. Senator Bolkus is making much of that, but we already had that stitched up. We had most of the other amendments that finally got through this evening too.
As I have said many times in this debate, the Democrats were torn by the difficult position the government and the Labor Party had forced us into on this bill. On the one hand, the legislation offends against core Democrat territory because the bill has the potential to put so much more pressure on our native forests. The presence in the parliament of the forest industry in the last few weeks is testament—although I might say that they did not come and see me—to how important it is to them to have native forests included in this measure. On the other hand, it is critically important to give the renewable energy sector the start it needs to grow. As I said back in October, this bill could have been a small step on the way of weaning this country off dependence on fossil fuels for its energy needs. Senator Bolkus said in the previous debate that the reason he could not support native forest exclusion was that it would be likely to sink the bill. He said:
We are saying that, despite some fundamental concerns we have in respect of it—
that is, the bill—
we think it should be passed, and we think that an amendment such as the one that Senator Brown moved will ensure that the legislation does not get through this place and the House of Representatives in time for it to be implemented and to have any impact at all.
It is basically a question of whether we want the legislation or whether we want to make an amendment to it at this stage. ... But we have already signalled a review of the legislation, and one of those close areas of scrutiny will be the way that native forests may be encompassed by the impact of the legislation. As I say, the judgment of the opposition is that the jury is out with respect to that, but we should approach this with a degree of scrutiny to ensure that the measure does not result in an increased biomass extraction in non-plantation forests.
So two months ago Senator Bolkus wanted the legislation passed and then changed his mind, or apparently so. After indicating right throughout the debate on this bill that the ALP would not do anything to stop the passage of the bill, that they would not support most of the Democrats amendments, including taking out native forests, and therefore they would not insist on their amendments, Senator Bolkus did an about-face: yes, Labor would insist on CPI adjustment of the penalty after all and the Democrats could wear the odium of allowing this bill to pass with no restriction on native forests. We will not be party to supporting this bill, CPI adjustment or otherwise, as long as it includes native forests. I just wanted to make that clear. 
I also need to defend myself, for the record, on a couple of cheap shots that Senator Bolkus took in my direction back then. He said I was dishonest in claiming that the amendment passed to ensure that the penalty for this measure was not tax deductible was a Democrat amendment. What he failed to mention at the time was the fact that Labor's amendment and mine were identical. Labor's appeared first on the running sheet, as is always the case in the hierarchy of this place, so it was put first. I suppose we could have put ours as well, but it hardly seemed sensible. This is petty stuff and hardly worth the time of the chamber.
Senator Bolkus also said I was gullible and cowardly. He said there was absolutely no imperative for me to fold within 12 hours of the legislation coming back from the House of Representatives. `Make them stew for a while; let them cogitate,' he said. Two months of letting the government stew does not seem to me to have achieved anything much at all, just a lot of time lost, and for what? It was for a three-month delay in the start-up of the measure. There will still be major incentives in the bill to cut down more of our native forests which, as I said, is of the greatest concern to us. It is bad news for forests and for other renewable energy sources. If we end up with biomass burners on the edge of every forest in this country producing cheap electricity, there will be little room in the market for wind or solar. 
Having said that, the native forest issue is not yet dead. I hope the general public will be affronted, as we are, by the notion of burning biodiversity to produce electricity in this country. I hope they will demand of their electricity retailer that no energy is sourced this way. The Democrats will include this in their list of election campaign issues, along with schools, on which the two major parties have let the environment and the vast majority of Australians down. I hope this legislation does provide the necessary boost to solar and wind energy in this country. One of the recommendations in the global warming report suggests that Australia could capture five per cent of the global market for renewable energy by the year 2015. I think it will actually take much more renewable industry assistance to achieve that than this bill provides, but perhaps it will at least be a start.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-12-07,"—I move:
That the committee does not insist on the amendment disagreed to by the House of Representatives.
The government will not be supporting the Democrat and Labor sponsored amendment to this bill. This amendment by the Democrats seeks to expand the GST-free treatment of first aid and lifesaving with a scope so wide that it will include currently taxable swimming lessons. This goes beyond the agreement between the government and the Democrats, whereby lifesaving and similar courses became GST free. I repeat: lifesaving is GST free and so are similar courses. In addition, the Senate well knows that the GST revenue goes to the states and territories, and they have insisted therefore, under the terms of the intergovernmental agreement, on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations, which is a schedule to A New Tax System that the Commonwealth seek the agreement of the states and territories before making any change to the GST base.
The Commonwealth intends to stick with this agreement. For these reasons, the government will be opposing the amendment. I point out to the Senate that any delay in the passage of this bill will be the result of the Democrats and Labor. Their manoeuvring will jeopardise measures which businesses have sought in relation to more flexible GST registration provisions and restricting the tax liabilities that can be offset against BAS refunds. The government has also agreed to an amendment to provide the Commissioner of Taxation with the discretion to backdate GST registrations. We urge the fact that, as I pointed out to you, we will not be supporting— 
—Stop urging, sit down or get on with it.
—Why don't you just keep quiet for the moment? Just go back for a drink, John. On that basis, I make the point that once again the government will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Democrats and Labor.
—You'll be waiting a long time to find me having a drink, you drunken bum.
—Senator Faulkner! Would you please withdraw that unparliamentary language?

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I think this is a particularly unfortunate note to end the year on in respect of the goods and services tax. That is the issue we are dealing with here. This afternoon we considered the 1,665th amendment to the GST roll-back, and the government cannot find it in its heart at this time of year to exempt the GST from personal aquatic survival skills—swimming lessons. This is a minister who wants to impose a GST on swimming lessons offered by the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia just prior to the Christmas-New Year break. This is a particularly unfortunate episode and it highlights the mean spiritedness of this minister and of this government at this time of year. 
We have not received a satisfactory explanation from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about the apparent disagreement between the Australian Democrats and the government in respect of the deal that they signed earlier this year when they agreed to pass the GST. On the one hand, Senator Kemp said that this particular area, swimming lessons—which impacts on hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly young Australians—would be excluded from the GST. On the other hand, the Democrats have argued that it was part of that deal. Who are we to believe? Senator Kemp or Senator Murray? I know it is a bit difficult. It was a hard call. But, in the end, we decided on the basis of fairness and equity that you should not be applying a GST to hundreds of thousands of young people in this country who are undertaking swimming lessons offered by the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia. Here is the minister attempting to blackmail the Senate and the parliament by arguing that he is going to abandon the 60-odd roll-back GST amendments in this bill that are so important to small business, that they claim were unnecessary but we now have to consider on the basis that they want to put a GST on swimming lessons—swimming lessons. The minister should be ashamed of himself.
The other justification the minister gave for imposing a GST on swimming lessons this afternoon was to assure the Australian public that everyone has tax cuts and increases in allowances. I would wish him well on the beaches of Australia this summer explaining to people in trouble that they should be rescued by tax cuts and increases in allowances. This is an appalling performance by this government. It typifies their approach on the GST, and the Labor Party will not be accepting the concept of a GST on swimming lessons.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-12-07,"—I make it very clear for the benefit of the Assistant Treasurer that this is not in any way a move away from our agreement; it is simply a clarification of what was originally intended. The original amendments were drawn up with the Royal Life Saving Society and the Surf Life Saving Society with advice from Treasury. It was not until after the legislation passed that we had a new ruling from Treasury that drew the line at where lifesaving courses became GST free—five or six levels up from what are your basic survival skills at the level of where you start saving someone else. I think it is quite extraordinary, as one who used to be an instructor and examiner with the Royal Life Saving Society, to suggest that you cannot know something about saving yourself—and it does not seem to be of any great interest to the government; you tax all of that—but once you actually jump in the water, presuming you know when, because all of the previous courses seem to be of minor consideration, all of a sudden it is something that the government considers worth learning.  
I say to the government that this is not exempting—and I will just read it in case the minister has forgotten—swimming lessons per se. We are not talking about people who go to their local coach, wanting to perfect their backstroke style or swim like Michael Klim in the butterfly or whatever. These are—and I read—including `personal aquatic survival skills'. If the minister has not looked at the manuals recently of the Royal Life Saving Society or the Surf Life Saving Society, they include things like when to go in the water and when not to go in the water—or rather how you actually do go in the water. It is more than just saving lives; it will also save a lot of spinal injuries if people actually know how to enter the water.
Given the hour, I will not go through a full list of the various survival skills that a person needs, but I will say that the first few courses and the first few certificates simply assist people to know the basics of how to look after themselves. I think it is quite extraordinary that this government is such a penny-pinching mob. Considering the amount of revenue we seem to have raised and the size of the surplus, we can suddenly find $23 billion for defence, but we cannot think of basic survival courses for kids who need to be able to look after themselves. Considering the number of Australians who are going to be spending time at the beach or the local creek this summer, it should be a priority for government to actively encourage them into courses that teach them something about how to look after themselves.
What I really do find offensive about this message that has come back is this bit on the end about `delay will not be of the government's doing'. I assure you, Senator, that delay will be of your doing, because we are going to insist on what is quite a simple measure and what is a clarification of an undertaking and a clarification of the earlier amendments that were changed by later rulings—and that was nothing we did or implied. We are going to insist on this new amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,57,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-12-07,"—There are three brief points I want to make. Firstly, whilst I appreciate the power of Senator Sherry's address, the actual phrase is `including personal aquatic survival skills'. It does not say `including swimming lessons'. The government has said that this amendment has a scope so wide that it is going to put the entire GST base at risk.
Secondly, the government have said—it is just ludicrous, isn't it?—that this affects their Commonwealth-states agreement. I would make the point to the Senate, which Labor senators might not be aware of, that Senator Lees wrote to the Prime Minister some considerable time back. If the Commonwealth had really wanted to get busy with this and had their hearts in it, they have had plenty of time to talk to the states about it. So this is not a sudden thing that has emerged. This idea that you have not had the time to consult the states, as is implied here, is wrong.
Thirdly, I want to mention this quite ridiculous statement: `any delay will not be of the government's doing'. Senator Faulkner, you have a peculiar sense of humour sometimes. I want to imagine the government going out to small business and saying, `Small business, the reason you haven't got this bill in time is that we wouldn't accept ""including personal aquatic survival skills"".' How absolutely pathetic! Imagine that: the government are going to knock on the door of the hardware store and say, `Sorry you couldn't get your amendment. It's because we wouldn't accept a Democrat amendment, which was supported by Labor, which said ""including personal aquatic survival skills"".' I think it is a pathetic performance by government.

Therefore, it is the intention of the government that the message be sent to the House of Representatives to be dealt with and that the bill return to us at a later hour of the morning.

That the committee does not insist on amendment no. 1 to which the House of Representatives has insisted on disgreeing and agrees to the amendment made by the House in place of that amendment.
The government indicated earlier this morning that it would not support the Democrats and Labor sponsored amendment to the bill concerning the expansion of the GST-free treatment for first aid and lifesaving, which would have had a scope so wide that it would have included swimming lessons. This would have gone beyond the policy intent of the government and beyond the agreement between the government and the Democrats whereby lifesaving and similar courses became GST free. It would have resulted in some swimming lessons being GST free and others being taxable. The government also opposed the amendment because, under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, which is a schedule to the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Act 1999, the Commonwealth has to seek the agreement of the states and territories before making any changes to the GST base.
However, this is an important bill that contains many measures beneficial to taxpayers. The government has therefore agreed to amend the Democrats proposal so that it fits more closely to the policy intent of the GST-free treatment of lifesaving and similar courses. The new amendment is designed to allow survival skills courses taught by the Royal Lifesaving Society and the surf lifesaving society, but not including their specific swimming lessons, to be GST free. As this new amendment is a clarification of the existing policy intent of the Commonwealth, the government does not consider that a state agreement is necessary.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,59,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-12-07,"—The problem we have had all along is in the Australian Taxation Office ruling that was given to the Royal Lifesaving Society. Basically, the ruling was that the swim and survive courses do not satisfy the requirements of first aid lifesaving courses and are therefore subject to the GST. I just want to make it very clear as we accept what the government has done that this is what has now been overturned, that the swim and survive courses that involve the element of personal survival are now to be GST free. I thank the government for finally agreeing to this measure.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,59,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-07,"—I should firstly state on behalf of the Labor opposition that we are opposing this compromise. Let me next state that we will not be dividing. Our reasons for being concerned about the compromise that has been negotiated—and if I heard the minister correctly, he indicated that swimming lessons offered by the royal Australian lifesaving association would not necessarily be GST free—are that we see the issue being fraught with definitional problems. This is an important issue of public safety. We will be monitoring the outcome over the next year. We reserve our right to roll back—
—Roll-back! It's finally come out.
—Here we are at 6:15 a.m. in the morning and, if you want to be provocative, we are considering the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000, which includes some 60-odd amendments—principally roll-back of the GST, Senator Hill—and that total now comes to 1,665 amendments since July 1.
—I am well aware of that, Senator. If you will just be quiet, I will conclude very quickly. We are not happy with the outcome. We reserve our right. It is an important issue of public safety. Finally, I would note an important Labor amendment in this roll-back Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000 which is further roll-back, and you have accepted it, Senator Hill, I am glad to say. It relates to the thousands of small busiesses that have inadvertently registered for the GST for a variety of reasons that I have stated on the record. If small businesses will be allowed to deregister, they should be allowed to deregister retrospectively. The Labor amendment to this bill 
gives the commissioner the power to decide on cancellation of registration back to 1 July. This will be of considerable benefit to small business in this country, which will be released from the paperwork and bureaucracy of the GST. This represents a significant roll-back and a significant benefit to those businesses. With those remarks, I state again that we will not be dividing. I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a happy New Year.
