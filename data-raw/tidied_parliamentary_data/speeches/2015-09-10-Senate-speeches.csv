Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:32):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to continue my remarks in relation to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. At the end of my previous contribution on this bill I was talking about changes the government have already made to Centrepay which we believe need to have the opportunity to take effect before we start launching into anything new. There is no doubt that Centrepay is an extremely valuable bill paying service that helps very many Centrelink customers manage their ongoing expenses. In May this year the government announced changes to Centrepay which we think are going to go a long way to protecting the most vulnerable Centrelink customers.


The changes that have been put forward mean that Centrepay no longer supports consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. Senator Cameron wanted  us to ban all consumer leases from being able to be paid through Centrepay. Instead the government took a more responsible approach and said, 'Let's ensure that any consumer leases that are available are regulated by what would otherwise be a normal regulation that every other consumer in the community would seek to have regulated.' That was instead of a knee-jerk reaction that says anybody who is on Centrelink cannot access their lease payments through Centrepay.


The legislative changes are not required to make changes to Centrepay. The government are looking to change and improve outcomes for customers without taking away the important avenue of support for customers with limited options to obtain necessary credit. There is no doubt that many people on Centrelink would not otherwise have access to payment terms because of their lower income and their lack of a credit rating. It is really important that we as a government make responsible decisions to make sure that people who are on Centrelink still do have access to the kind of payment options that everybody else in the community is able to get and not discriminate against them just because they happen to be on Centrelink.


The government do not support Senator Cameron's private bill because we believe it is fundamentally flawed. By prohibiting consumer leases from Centrepay for all consumer leases, the bill discriminates against people who are currently on Centrelink. The main objective of Centrepay was simply to assist customers in managing expenses, which is consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments, and reduce financial risk by providing a facility to have regular deductions made from welfare payments. This bill overreaches by being overly prescriptive about not just the types of things that these people wish to purchase but also how they are able to access them.


Following a review and a subsequent stakeholder consultation, the Department of Human Services introduced a range of changes to Centrepay to improve its operation and provide greater information for customers. These changes were only introduced in May this year. They have not actually had the opportunity to even filter their way through so we can see whether they are working. I would suggest that Senator Cameron should have delayed the introduction of his more restrictive and prescriptive bill until after we had the opportunity to see whether the new changes had worked or not. As I said, the particular relevant change that occurred in May that relates to Senator Cameron's bill is the change to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act. I think this certainly goes a long way to dealing with many of the issues that Senator Cameron raised about people scamming or taking advantage of those in our community who, possibly, are not in a position to absorb any fluctuations in their expenditure from week to week. The expansion of Centrepay is also to support alternative consumer leases such as low-interest loans, savings plans and lay-by.


The government are seeking to give as much flexibility and opportunity as possible to people on Centrelink to manage their own finances in the way that they would like to manage them and to make their own decisions about their day-to-day expenditure. I think it is incumbent on government not to interfere in people's lives to the extent where we tell them what they can buy or not buy. As I said in my last contribution, to say that somebody on Centrelink is not able to purchase a washing machine or a refrigerator by using the Centrepay opportunity, which may be the only way they are able to get access to these fundamental necessities of life, needs a serious rethink of legislation that would even seek to do that.


For that reason the government are not supporting this private member's bill of Senator Cameron. The house needs to be assured that the government are very mindful of making sure that we protect everybody in our society from organisations that would seek to take advantage, so we have strengthened our credit laws across the board. Those credit laws have been strengthened for the benefit, not just of people on Centrelink, but of all members of our community who would seek to purchase items through some form of credit or alternative consumer lease or activity.


The department is working to build strong assurance practices for consumer-leasing industry groups and to influence their behaviour. We believe that the best way for us to protect consumers is to ensure that the people who are in this particular space in terms of consumer credit and leasing through providing credit to consumers understand their responsibilities and obligations, and are monitored, checked and reviewed to make sure that they are operating within a set of laws and guidelines that the Australian public would deem responsible. To be very, very clear the government do not disagree with the need to have strong consumer credit laws that protect all Australians and obviously take into account those in our society that are more vulnerable because they do not have the extra cash or disposable income to protect them from fluctuations or unexpected expenses. But to go to the extent of the overreach of this bill and to start proscribing what people can spend their money on is not something that the government could support.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2015-09-10,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (09:41):  I rise to make a contribution to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 debate. The point has already been made that the government do not support this private member's bill. The intent of the bill, as we understand it, on the part of Senator Cameron, the author of the bill, is that he wants to prohibit all consumer leases from Centrepay, but this bill clearly does not do that. It does not have the capacity to achieve that. Indeed the government through the Department of Human Services have already introduced a range of changes that will address most of the concerns of Senator Cameron.


The changes have been made to improve the operation of the scheme by providing greater information to its customers. These changes include, but are not limited to, exclusion of consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. So, in effect, the government through the agency had a close look at where some of the vulnerabilities might be and have risen to the occasion to make adjustments in the operation of the scheme to see that the consumers are protected. The legislation also takes on, in excluding the expansion of Centrepay, to support alternatives to consumer leases such as low-interest loans in addition to no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-bys. This, in effect, is providing the people with choice. It allows them to function their household budgets and operate with the necessities of life within the scope of those things that might be of that available to the rest of us in the community when we are trying to manage the affairs of our budgets.


Apart from the strengthening protections we need to go back and have a look at who the people are that are affected by these arrangements, the Centrelink customers. These are people who often find themselves in difficult circumstances. We are talking about difficult economic or budgetary circumstances. The legislation is more inclined towards people who find themselves in lower socio-economic circumstances where this current assistance is valuable. From our life experiences we all know people who have grave difficulties in managing money. I have a number of relatives who fall into that category. When you do not have that ability—when you do not have an ability to budget, to save and to make contingency provision for the essential things in life where you are in more difficult or measured economic circumstances—these difficulties become writ very large in your life. We spoke yesterday about the fact that these programs are meant to help these people manage their circumstances, not to hinder them. We are not here to take away the fundamental and basic right of people to choose what they do with their money, but this process aids them to be much more alert to what they might next do and guides them in ensuring that they have covered the general necessities of life.


Regulated customer leases are not going to be excluded from Centrepay. Welfare recipients are generally unable to access most forms of credit such as credit cards in any event, and regulated consumer leasing is one of the few ways of obtaining essential household goods quickly. As we all know, without security being provided, when you make application for any form of financial assistance where you enter into an otherwise contractual arrangement with a consumer lease, a low-doc loan or a low-interest or no-interest loan, the credit agency or individual or corporation extending the credit has regard not just to your security position but to your capacity to service the loan commitment. This program allows security for those lenders where they know that, through the Centrelink payments, these loans or other financial arrangements will be serviced.


When we look at alternatives to general consumer leases, such as the no-interest loan scheme operated by the Good Shepherd microfinance scheme, this bill of Senator Cameron's would exclude people from having access to these financial facilities, which are particularly designed to help these people who are in otherwise somewhat difficult circumstances. Let's just think for a moment about where they might find themselves. Many people who are on Centrelink support are not receiving it simply because they are unable to get employment. That is one of the main reasons, but there are any number of reasons and we have to remember that we need to think beyond the individual themselves. In some cases, a person whom this bill would seek to exclude from accessing any sort of consumer lease or low-interest loan may well be a parent, and that parent may well be in difficult circumstances.


We heard yesterday in contributions made on a related matter that a lot of these households and homes find themselves with someone or, on occasions, multiple people within the household who have some form of addiction, whether it be a drug addiction or an alcohol addiction. Indeed, it may well be a gambling addiction or they are just people who are completely incapable of managing their own personal finances—exacerbated, as I pointed out earlier, by the very difficult circumstances they might find themselves in through the perils of life. Just think about this for a moment. If this bill were to take effect, it might prevent a parent, even the addicted parent or, indeed, another partner in that household, from being able to, for example, purchase a fridge or a washing machine. Just imagine the circumstances where you have a parent who is financially struggling in any event due to any number of perils, some of which I have mentioned, and there are many others, and is unable to purchase a fridge.


Let's take a household where you are living in the suburbs. You may not even have a car; you might rely upon public transport or some other form of making your way around, and now you find yourself with a young family of four or five school-aged children. Your fridge is broken and beyond repair. You might not even have the capacity to meet the costs of repairs to a fridge, but let us assume for the purpose of this example that the fridge is no longer functioning and you need to get a new fridge. If this bill were to take effect, some of these people would not be able to enter into a consumer lease arrangement, firstly because it would be prohibited by this proposed legislation, but in reality it may be that they cannot enter into an arrangement if they do not have proof—if they cannot convince the consumer lender—that they are able to repay the loan. Entering into arrangements where a loan is serviced by a part of their Centrelink payments, of course, allows that household to replace that fridge. As burdensome as that purchase may be, it puts that family back on a fair footing, as we would all want to see, in relation to the necessities of that household.


In a similar fashion, if the washing machine in the house were to break and you have a family of six or seven who are already in difficult circumstances, in many cases exacerbated by some of the scourges in the household with these addictions, you could be left with a mother of young children who then has no capacity to wash the linen or the clothes of the family unless they are able to access some form of consumer lease, low-interest or no-interest loan or, as I said before, finances operated by schemes such as NILS, which is the Good Shepherd microfinance scheme.


Essentially, the impact of this bill is very clear: either we are prepared to support these people in these difficult circumstances by, in essence, guaranteeing the payment of the lease payments or the interest payments on these loans or we are not. There needs to be no confusion here and no crossover. I do understand the spirit of what Senator Cameron has tried to achieve. None of us want to see any unscrupulous lenders taking advantage of people who are in very difficult circumstances, who otherwise would not have a choice and who, in some cases, are in very desperate circumstances being exploited by lenders and financiers. Nobody wants to see that happen—me in particular.


In a former life, I had a lot to do with families who found themselves in quite tragic circumstances. I understand these stresses of day-to-day life. As a former police officer, I have been in their homes, I have seen their struggles and I have seen the pain of a mother who is a spouse to sometimes an abusive father, who was addicted to either drugs or alcohol. The circumstances in their homes are very pitiful. If this bill were to go ahead, on balance, it would prevent those mothers from being able to enter into any sort of consumer arrangements to bring to them some of the very basic necessities of life.


It may even extend beyond the basic necessities. I am not one of those who is of the school of thought that these people find themselves in these circumstances should be denied the opportunity to have some of those other things in life that we all experience and take the granted. You have got a young family coming through in that household, you want them to have the ability to be introduced to some of the technologies of life, either in an essential form, from an educational perspective or from a social development perspective. Might I say, to the cry of some others, it may be just to allow their children to be able to enjoy some of the functions in life that come with some computer games and the sorts of things that young people seem to be attracted to more and more these days. If this bill was take effect, for those mothers in those households—or a father, before I hear the cry of discrimination come my way from our side of the building—it would prevent them from being able to enter into leases or loan arrangements to bring those things into their family. I think that is completely wrong and, in effect, discriminatory in and of itself.


What this program does is assist them in doing this. Some people, believe it or not, are just not quite financially literature enough or have enough life experience to be able to wade their way through certain regulated lease agreements and the like. That is why the changes of policy—the Centrepay policy terms list and the categories and goods and services eligible for Centrepay deductions—that I indicated earlier have been done. This gives a guide to these households and, along with the consumer protection act, is meant—as best it can, in harness with each other and having a symbiotic impact—to in effect guide them.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I will not take the interjection. This guides these families who might not be as fortunate as some in terms of financial literacy to be able to make decisions and, as I have pointed out all the way through, guides them in what they do in making these purchases of things that you and I all fairly well take for granted.


We have also sometimes got the additional situation of the complexity of these agreements, which might involve—along with the lender—a finance institution such as a bank, where these people have to then start to engage in complicated arrangements as to how the periodic payments for these leases or loans may occur. I think we are all familiar with modern banking terms and that there is a cost involved in that, whereas this service provided for Centrelink customers has no cost.


When I talked about no interest loan schemes, we have got areas—like Good Shepherd Microfinance—which I am quite certain Senator Cameron did not mean to catch in this bill but would catch them. We have got areas where even these things are not available. I am instructed that in Normanton, for example, in the far northern part of my state, there is no NILS provider. As a result, an individual in that area who found themselves in these circumstances would have no alternative if it was not for the Centrelink program to be able to, as we have talked about, secure these essentials of life.


During the thin years of 2013-14, the NILS itself—which is, as I have referred to, operated by the Good Shepherd Microfinance—approved 24,378 loans with a total value of $22 million. I want to stay more with the number of loans. Whilst accepting that some people may have taken multiple advantage of the Centrelink program, there are in essence—even allowing for 20 per cent to be duplicate applications—some 20,000 households and 20,000 families who we know already probably in very ordinary or very difficult financial circumstances who have used the scheme to get the necessities of life. Those necessities are quite regulated in terms of what they can do and where they can do it. With that Centrepay for household goods, in just six months from July to September 2014, there were 136,000 customers with a total deduction of some $148 million. Not all of those deductions are for consumer leases, but the comparative volume does tend to indicate a significant demand for household goods—those goods that I referred to as the basics of life.


In closing my contribution, I have recognised Senator Cameron's intent with this legislation. I think we all have great sympathy for any measure that might protect the vulnerable in our society, particularly those who are really disadvantaged—for example, a mother and children in circumstances not necessarily of their making. Every one of us wants to join Senator Cameron in protecting these people so that they are not exploited by unscrupulous lenders of money or those who extend lease and finance arrangements. But because there have been changes which perhaps Senator Cameron was not previously alive to we believe the bill is not necessary. Indeed, limiting people's capacity to do this will just impact on their ability to take on the most basic things in life which we have all become somewhat accustomed to. So I think we should not support the bill. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:01):  I congratulate Senator Cameron on bringing to the parliament a bill that at least heads in the right direction and has a concern and a solution for a problem that abounds. Having said that, I think Senator Cameron, whilst meaning well, has got it wrong again. But let that not withdraw from my acknowledgement that the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 is one of the more sensible contributions that my friend and colleague Senator Cameron has brought to the chamber. It is good that we are having a debate on this.


In reading some of the material about this, it reminded me of when I was a 17-year-old. I had just left school and could not afford to go to university. I started work as an articled clerk on about half the pay an apprentice would get. I studied externally through the University of Queensland at night to get my legal qualifications. I was certainly a poor Australian. Senator Cameron's wish is that his bill be all about harm minimisation for poor Australians. I remember the days when I certainly fitted into that category.


I lived some distance away from my work in the town of Ayr in North Queensland and, somehow, I had to get to work. It was too far to walk. I would rely on friends to give me a lift if they were going in to town at the same time. But because I wanted to be independent I bought myself a Honda 55 motor scooter. I emphasise '55' because it was five cc better than the regular Honda 50 at the time. I bought it on what was then called hire purchase. A lot of the ills that Senator Cameron talks about were, in fact, there in those days of hire purchase. You do not see hire purchase around much these days. I am wondering if it is still relevant. The idea of hire purchase is that you pay a deposit and then pay your purchase off in instalments. In my case, I got the motor scooter. I had to pay some sort of a deposit and then I had to pay it off. As I recall, I used to pay about two pounds—or $4—a month. I had the use of the motor scooter for a couple of years, whilst each month I would go into the hire purchase agency and pay my two pounds to enable me to continue operating the motor scooter.


Whilst I was responsible for maintenance and upkeep, and obviously for fuel and repairs, the actual ownership of the unit, the motor scooter, stayed with the lender all the time. The idea of hire purchase in those days—very similar to the situation that now applies under different bills—was that the lender retained ownership of the goods. At the end of the lease—I think my lease was for three years—the motor scooter effectively went back to the lender because they still had the ownership entitlement to it. But, as with all of those contracts provided at the time, in the goodness of their heart the lender could actually sell you the three-year-old motor scooter for a nominal price. It was very similar to the arrangements that apply in the situation Senator Cameron has highlighted.


As with a lot of the propositions that have been raised in this debate, I remember that the amount I actually ended up paying for the motor scooter was much greater than the purchase price. Adding up all the payments I made over the term of the hire purchase agreement, I paid something like three times the original cost of the motor scooter. But, of course, in those days there was no alternative. I did have the use of the motor scooter from day one and it allowed me to get around. Again, this is very similar to a lot of the situations that are highlighted in Senator Cameron's speech and in other contributions to this debate. Senator Cameron in his introductory speech on this bill said that the government should expedite the broader review of consumer leases that it announced and look at the national credit code and the implications of consumer leases on a broader basis.


On 7 August this year the Hon. Josh Frydenberg MP, the Assistant Treasurer, indicated that the government was establishing a review of the small-amount credit contracts, which I and probably everyone else in this debate have referred to as SACCs, and related provisions of the national Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The establishment of that review fulfilled a statutory requirement under the credit act to examine and report on the effectiveness of the law relating to SACCs that was provided in the credit act. In doing this the government recognised that the small-amount lenders can play an important role in the economy by providing credit to consumers who are excluded from mainstream forms of finance. The government wanted to ensure that the regulatory framework strikes the right balance by protecting vulnerable consumers without imposing any undue regulatory burden on the industry. These small-amount credit contracts are loans of less than $2,000 to the consumer, with a maximum term of 12 months. Since 2013 the credit act has placed specific obligations on small-amount credit contract arrangements and on the providers, including a cap on costs and a rebuttal presumption that a loan is unsuitable when the customer is in default under another small-amount loan.


The government's review also provides an appropriate opportunity to consider the laws that apply to regulated consumer leases. A consumer lease allows a customer to lease an item, such as a fridge—perhaps even a motor scooter!—until the term of the lease finishes, when the item is returned to the lease provider. It is similar to what happened in the case I was relating, about buying a motor scooter all those years ago. Consumer leases regulated under the credit act include those that are for a set period of four months or longer. While the customer base for small-amount loans and regulated consumer leases is similar, many of the regulatory requirements for small-amount credit contracts do not apply to consumer leases. The review announced by Mr Frydenberg will consider whether the provisions that apply to small-amount credit contracts should apply to consumer leases as well. While the customer base for small-amount loans and regulated consumer leases are similar, many of the regulatory requirements of these SACCs do not apply to consumer leases. The review, as I indicated, will consider whether the provisions that apply to small-amount credit contracts should also be extended to consumer leases.


I am pleased that, as Mr Frydenberg announced, the review will be chaired by Ms Danielle Press, the CEO of Equipsuper, who will be joined by panel members Ms Catherine Walter, the deputy chair of Funds Management Victoria, and Mr Stephen Cavanagh, a partner in HWL Ebsworth. The minister announced that the consultation process would involve the panel calling for submissions from interested parties. It will consult widely with stakeholders. The terms of review are quite extensive. I will not go through them all, but they include the review to make recommendations about effectiveness and where necessary to recommend any changes to the requirement to obtain and consider a consumer's bank account statements in certain sections of the credit act. The terms of reference also require the inquiry to look into the rebuttable presumption that a loan is unsuitable if the consumer is in default under another small-amount credit contract or has held two other small-amount credit contracts in the past 90 days in accordance with several provisions of the credit act. The inquiry will also look at the prohibitions on entering into and increasing the credit limit of a loan contract that has a term of 15 days or less with a consumer and on suggesting to consumers or assisting them to do all that is required by certain relevant provisions of the credit act.


The review panel is also required to look into the requirement to display a warning statement about alternatives available on small-amount credit contracts in several relevant provisions of the credit act. Also, the inquiry has to look at the cap on fees on charges, including the maximum of a 20 per cent establishment fee and of a monthly four per cent fee that, again, is referred to in several sections of the act. The inquiry will look at the requirement that consumers who do default under a small amount credit contract must not be charged an amount that exceeds twice the amount of the relevant loan in section 39B of the National Credit Code. 


I cannot equate these things precisely with what happened 50 or more years ago when I bought my first 'vehicle' under a hire-purchase contract, but clearly these sorts of issues have been around for a long time. One often wonders about all this regulatory work that governments do from time to time. I note this National Consumer Credit Protection Act came into play in 2009 in the term of the previous Labor government. At times I think we should pause and think about whether we should be encouraging individual responsibility rather than having governments—big brother—trying to regulate every aspect of our lives to protect us from ourselves. I am not sure that my instance, where I paid, if I remember correctly, three times the amount of my motor scooter back in those days, was something that really needed regulation by government. I was aware of that as a 17-year-old when I went into it, but to me the convenience and use I got from that motor scooter was worth the extra amount that I paid in total, and it allowed me to pay it off by almost affordable payments every month until I completed the contract. 


Whilst there was some legislation and regulation around hire-purchase agreements in those days, one wonders if at times we try, as a parliament, as various governments, just a little bit too hard to save people from themselves. There used to be the old legal principle of caveat emptor—be careful of what of you buy, think about what you buy—but unfortunately in this day and age there has grown up this view that bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra are better able to regulate the lives and responsibilities and obligations of individual Australians than those individual Australians are themselves. 


What we have to strive to do in Australia, and what we do obviously do and have done for many years, is to make sure that every Australian has an education that equips them to be able to properly assess whether they should be taking out a small amount credit contract. Back in my days, you took out a hire-purchase agreement. Ensuring Australians are better informed and the better educated is a better way of addressing these things than having governments and bureaucrats in faraway Canberra trying to regulate what they think is in the best interests of the people of Australia. 


I often make the same point in relation to Indigenous people. I find it offensive that people in this parliament in Canberra and bureaucrats are always trying to pass laws, to do things, to make special rules for Indigenous people. To me that always seems to suggest that we think Indigenous people are simply incapable of making the decisions that other Australians make. I find that very offensive. I have some caution with some of the things even my government does in relation to Indigenous people. I think that the best thing we can do for Indigenous people is to treat them exactly the same as every other Australian, with the same rights and responsibilities and opportunities and benefits that every other Australian gets. But some of the things we do from this building and from Canberra seem to me to be almost designed to ensure that that paternalistic situation continues to apply for Indigenous people, and I for one totally oppose that. I know a lot of Indigenous people, and they are equally as good as, if not better in most cases, than every other Australian. I think they are as well able to control their own lives and look after themselves as every other Australian. Again, I emphasise that education, training, the ability to participate fully in Australian society applies there, as it applies to every other Australians.


Senator Cameron said in his opening speech this was an attempt to help minimise harm to poor Australians. Of course, if we did not have any poor Australians in the country then perhaps Senator Cameron might not have thought it necessary to bring this bill forward. We, as a government, try our very best to make sure all Australians benefit from living in this lucky country. Having said that, and whilst I again acknowledge the good ideas and good principles behind Senator Cameron's introduction of this bill, I think he has got it wrong. The government is already addressing many of the issues that Senator Cameron indicated concerned him. When the reviews that the government has set up and other actions the government has taken come into play, this bill will be unnecessary. For that reason I intend to oppose it and I urge the Senate similarly to oppose the bill.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:21):  I also rise to address the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. I would like to address this in three key ways. Firstly, I want to talk about what Centrepay actually is, which is the mechanism that is being discussed. Secondly, I want to talk about the problem that the bill seeks to address. Thirdly, I want to talk about what the most effective approach is to actually mitigating the risk and the poor consequences and outcomes that Senator Cameron raises. I do this because my background, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, is that of an experimental test pilot, so I have seen many cases where people identify a problem and launch into what they think is a fix. But, if you do not identify what the crux of the problem is, what system needs rectification and what the possible unintended consequences are, you can spend a lot of time and effort but not address the problem you are seeking to fix. So I think it is important that we look at these factors.


What is Centrepay? It is a deduction service that is offered to customers of Centrelink by the Department of Human Services. It is free for recipients of Centrelink payments. It means that people can have payments for things like bills, utilities and other costs deducted from their Centrelink payments to meet those ongoing expenses, and then the residual Centrelink payments are deposited into their accounts. So it helps people to manage their funds, particularly people who, because of their own life circumstances and their ability to manage, or because in some communities there is an expectation that 'what you have is mine and you should share it', find it very hard to maintain control of their own income. Because of those social or familial pressures, Centrepay can be an invaluable tool to them.


Centrepay was used to transfer more than $2.1 billion deductions last financial year, so it is of substantial size in terms of its transactions. It is widely acknowledged as a very valuable service by the sorts of community organisations that get alongside people who are struggling in this area. It is used by around 600,000 people who are in receipt of Centrelink payments, and they represent about nine per cent of the total Centrelink customer base. 


One of the things it does is link businesses who have met the policy and terms of Centrepay with these consumers. It does not operate carte blanche; it has a process whereby businesses have to agree to abide by certain policies and terms, and conditions in some cases, to be linked up and be able to receive those payments. So it is a fairly well-developed system.


The system has been developed over time, particularly in the area of consumer leases. The Department of Human Services has conducted a review of the system to change the way it works and to provide more information to more consumers—and I will get onto that a little bit later—but it has also excluded consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Protection Act 2009, and that is important. One of the roles of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I chair, is to oversee ASIC, the corporate regulator, and one of the benefits that a regulated scheme brings is that people have to comply with the requirements of, and get approval from, ASIC in terms of how they run their business. For schemes that are not regulated, there is not that same oversight or that same framework to comply with, so this review has already excluded those kinds of businesses from the Centrepay model. 


Importantly, this bill also expands the alternatives to consumer leases, and these are things like low-interest loans or no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-bys. That means that, when people are attracted by one of those lease-to-buy options because they need whitegoods or some service in their house, they know, 'I can buy those goods more cheaply with a low-interest loan or a lay-by plan than through that rental scheme.' There has been a lot of effort put into making those alternatives available and appropriately regulated, and making sure people are aware of them. The changes in the bill to the Consumer Protection Act and to Centrepay are to make more of those alternatives available to people, which then help them to make informed choices about their options when procuring household items they need for day-to-day living in a way that is ethical and fair in terms of the impact on them.


You need to bear in mind, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that many of the people we are speaking about are excluded from normal avenues of credit, whether credit cards or store accounts, because they may be unemployed—and, in some cases, the unemployment is intergenerational. I certainly know from my time as the member for Wakefield in the other place, when I represented some communities in the Peachey Belt area, that there were a lot of long-term unemployed people. The work there of groups such as Anglicare and others who sought to get alongside people and help them with their financial literacy and understanding was critical in helping them to bridge these gaps between what the rest of us take for granted and what is available to them.


The new Centrepay policy and terms categorise goods and services that are eligible deductions and list a number of things that are specifically excluded so that people are only using the system for things that are important. The Centrepay terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods, and I encourage those who have a deep interest in this to go and have a look at the Centrepay policy and terms. 


This is where I think we move from looking at what Centrepay is to looking at mechanisms to bring about change. We have described Centrepay, and it is good. The problem with consumer leases, which is fairly well known—and I applaud Senator Cameron for his concern for people—is that somebody can make rental payments over a number of years for an item that might cost $600, but the amount they end up paying can be around the $1,100, $1,200 or $1,300 mark. Clearly, they pay far more for the item because they do not have the option of getting that up-front capital. It is a well-defined problem. But the mechanism to bring about change is not the act, because, if we exclude even regulated consumer lease options from this system, there are a few things that can happen. One is that the leases that are then made available to people will often not be regulated. So people who are under pressure to have a fridge or a washing machine in the house will still go to companies who have no obligations either through ASIC or, indeed, under the policy and terms of Centrepay to provide additional information to these people about alternative credit sources such as the low-interest loans et cetera or to operate in a fair and ethical manner. People will then be using the residual money they have from their Centrelink entitlement to pay for these items. So we are actually reducing the protections for them if we exclude the regulated consumer leases from Centrepay in this legislation. 


If we were to try and do things in a different way through Centrepay, as opposed to ASIC—and I will come back to ASIC in a minute—then we would look at Centrepay's policy and terms. Under 7.3 in the policy and terms, any company that has an agreement to use the Centrepay system has to comply with the policy and terms and any additional conditions which are placed on it. So, we are talking about a regulated scheme which already has the calming effect of ASIC requirements and then the additional requirements that can be placed on the policies and terms. If we look at section 8.1.b, it says that Centrepay can approve an application to be part of this scheme either in its standard policy and terms or it can approve it with additional conditions. This is one of the options that would be far more precise in achieving the outcome that Senator Cameron is looking for, if we find that the other mechanisms are not having the desired effect—and, as I say, I will come back to those in a minute. The policy and terms and additional conditions could be a mechanism to say, 'If you want to be part of the Centrepay scheme'—and, for companies, that is obviously an attraction, because there is a lower risk profile for them if they are receiving these payments under agreement where Centrepay is an intermediary—'then Centrepay could use additional conditions to set caps on interest or other options.' So there are ways that those sorts of conditions could be used to deliver more protection to the consumer than just by eliminating these kinds of things from the legislation altogether. 


It seems a self-defeating object, to my mind, to say that we are concerned that people are being exploited, therefore, remove these products altogether, as opposed to saying, 'Let's use the system to provide additional protections for people so that what they are asked to sign up to is equitable, fair and ethical for them.' The policy of the Centrepay system itself, under a regulated product, provides the sort of protection that we should be aiming for, as opposed to just excluding it and putting it out in the free market. 


Part of the reason I say that is that the people who are responsible for regulating these products are ASIC. ASIC are responsible for the regulation of consumer leases under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. They undertake a range of research and activities to promote business compliance with the act, and they also provide a number of educational materials for the consumer. When it comes to education, I am very aware, having been the member for Wakefield where I have gone into schools and seen that in the foyer there are no written hand-outs. The schools have given up providing them to parents because they have realised that in some cases some parents cannot actually read. They will not admit it, and they do not get the information. So, for that cohort, no amount of brochures that highlight information is going to protect them. What these schools have done is put information onto an audio—so, it is a video or a power-point presentation with audio. They find that the parents will stand around and have a cup of tea that is provided. The whole object is to provide an environment where you convey information. So there are ways that we can convey information to people. 


Part of ASIC's remit is educating consumers. They have their MoneySmart website and system, where they try to provide financial guidance. What we are seeing is that people like Centrepay are linking through to that information. So, in the increasingly online environment, people are being pointed to the fact sheets that are produced by ASIC around MoneySmart. ASIC have a whole section just on consumer leases, which explains how the leases work and the terms. It highlights the fact that, at the end of a lease, you might actually not own the item, despite the sometimes misleading advertising; you can be responsible if the item is damaged or stolen; and the terms and conditions can be complicated and they may need to seek additional support. They highlight the fact that leasing may not be the best way to buy something, the fact that there is often no cooling-off period and the fact that you may be better off with lay-by or low-interest type schemes. They also help people to working whether they can actually afford these repayments—so there is budget planning. They also point people to things like the no-interest loan scheme, which offers specific purpose loans for things like fridges or washing machines. There is the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Service, who can link people up with providers of these low-interest schemes. So there is a range of information available there. 


By keeping these schemes within the Centrepay system, we can do things under its terms and conditions. For instance, if you as a business want to attract customers and want to have the security of using the Centrepay system then you need to provide them with this information. ASIC provides links to additional explanation, and advocacy and support groups in the community can use that information to help inform consumers. With the regulated schemes, ASIC takes action to make sure that schemes do comply. I am the first to admit—and it is the whole reason we have ASIC—that there are people who do the wrong thing. I look at ASIC's website and see that in February this year ASIC took action against five different companies—Goldhype, the Smart Link Rentals group, Keep Easy rentals, Rent To Keep, the RentEzi appliance rentals and the Wanted Rented group. They are obviously all aimed at getting people into this scheme as an easy and quick way for them to get something. As a result of ASIC's actions, over $230,000 has been refunded to 115 consumers, the majority of whom were in this cohort. They were people on Centrelink benefits who had entered into contracts with these lease providers.


Under the outcome that ASIC has imposed on these businesses, the businesses have agreed to collect only the cost price of the rented goods and to refund any amount that has already been received from the consumer over that amount. They have also agreed to transfer ownership of the goods to the consumer once the cost price has been paid and to stop offering regulated consumer leases. In other words, ASIC has said, 'Your conduct has been so poor that not only are we going to make you fix up the problem with your existing customers but you are no longer going to be offering leases in this space.' So ASIC is fixing the problem with companies like that but, by then saying, 'You cannot offer regulated products,' it means that Centrepay will no longer be offering the product.


So the whole intent of Senator Cameron's bill in this case does not achieve anything, because the system has already worked to exclude those people. People would get more protection by still coming through Centrepay with Centrepay's terms and conditions and regulated schemes than they would by going into a marketplace where people who have been prevented from providing regulated lease options are operating.


In June this year we saw another action by ASIC against a firm called Amazing Rentals. ASIC required that that company stop operating. The area where they had most noncompliance was in Darwin. ASIC said, 'You have to cease operating in Darwin for a minimum of 12 months.' That company had to terminate all the consumer leases that had been entered into at the Darwin store between October 2011 and May 2015. They had to cancel the payment arrangements in relation to those leases and transfer ownership of the goods to the consumers. They had to refund to consumers all credit charges and the difference between the retail and lease costs and they had to pay a total of $10,000 to some of the advocacy agencies that supported people—the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency and the Top End Women's Legal Service, who provided support to consumers in this case. They also had to engage an independent and external compliance expert to conduct an assessment and report to ASIC on Amazing Rentals' policies and procedures to ensure compliance with credit compensation in relation to responsible lending documentation obligations and make any recommendations about required changes.


To come back to my starting point, Centrepay is a useful system. It supports 600,000-odd people, about nine per cent of Centrelink recipients in the country. It has been recognised by ASIC as a useful system. There is a problem with leases that charge people far more than a product is worth, but the answer is not to exclude regulated leases from the Centrepay system, for the simple reason that we want people to be using regulated leases because that allows ASIC to take the kinds of actions I have just outlined that they have taken against six companies this year alone. But also importantly it brings it under the Centrepay system, where there is the policy, the terms and the additional conditions that they can apply, which will provide more protection, not less, to the consumer.


For those reasons, whilst I commend Senator Cameron for his concern for the people involved, I believe that the Centrepay system is worthwhile and that excluding regulated consumer leases is not the best way to provide protection to consumers, and so I will not be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:41):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today and address some of the measures proposed by Senator Cameron's bill, which is known as the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. I am particularly interested in this bill because it relates to a longstanding concern of mine about financial literacy not just amongst those who are on income management or income support but amongst our community generally.


One of the greatest things we as a nation can do is to ensure that young people develop an understanding of finance and money. That is not because they need to pursue money as their life's goal but because the astute management of money can prevent a great deal of misery and hardship in their lives. If they understand what the impacts of consumer credit and the long-term implications of not paying off your debts can be, it can prevent a lifetime of hardship.


I have been interested in this space for a very long time, particularly the benefits of teaching children about financial literacy. I wrote a little children's book, which I entitled The Money Tree, which was designed for parents to help their children understand money management through a fictional tale. I regret to say that it did not meet with widespread acclaim, but it has been distributed to schools and various other bodies for free at my own expense because I passionately believe that this is something that can change the lives of people forever.


I respect Senator Cameron trying to enact a bill which is designed to prevent people from getting in over their heads and facing financial hardship. The intention of Senator Cameron, I have no doubt, is quite sound and solid. But there are some flaws in this bill. We have to consider what the potential implications could be for those most impacted by this. What might sound intuitively like a really good idea can often have some impacts which need to be given consideration.


If this bill were enacted, it would mean that welfare recipients who are benefiting—and I strongly emphasise the word 'benefiting'—from income management would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, whether they are regulated or unregulated, using their income managed money. Let's think about that for a moment. Those on income management would still be able to get involved in regulated or unregulated leases with their non-income-managed money. They could still do it with cash or various other things. But we have to ask ourselves: when people are going into what are generally longer-term obligations to buy whitegoods or merchandise, which is often very important to their lives and wellbeing, isn't it better for them to be in circumstances where their repayment schedules are managed and are not going to be subject to what I would call the weaknesses of indulgence that we all have? Marketers spend enormous amounts of money trying to part us from our cash, and if we have cash we can be vulnerable to those sorts of marketing overtures. That is fair enough, but not if it is going to leave you short for an ongoing repayment. It is not fair enough then. 


We are talking about people who are welfare recipients, many of whom are doing it tough, many of whom need to purchase things which they cannot initially afford, so they need to go into a finance arrangement. Rather than risk those people losing their asset because they are vulnerable or their cash management skills are probably on par with most of Australia, we are better off providing them with some certainty and surety. That is what I sense. 


This bill does not allow that to happen. As I mentioned, you can go to unregulated or regulated leases, and they can pay for that through their non-income-managed money. The risk here—and I seriously think it is a risk that Senator Cameron has not considered—is that this can cause further financial hardship for people that are already in very difficult circumstances. As I mentioned, for many welfare recipients this sort of surety is the only way that they are going to have a prospect of getting reasonable lease terms or rental arrangements, because there is a certainty that the financier is going to receive the regular payments. It does not mean it is going to be fair; it does not mean it is going to be good. It does not mean any of that, but it does mean that there is access to opportunity for people where otherwise there might not be or there is access to opportunity under terms that are probably much more appropriate and attractive than some of the payday lending terms or other less attractive options that are out there.


It is very clear to me from listening to the previous speaker that the government does want more lower cost options available for people. There are good Samaritans out there, including the Good Shepherd's No Interest Loan Scheme. I have had meetings over the years with members of the National Australia Bank and their social finance organisation, in which they provide no-interest or very-low-interest loans and support other organisations that are doing the same thing. These are very small programs in the scheme of things, but they make a huge difference. I think making a difference in this space is what we are all trying to do to get better outcomes for people and to make sure that government and taxpayers' money is used wisely and to the best effect. I think there is a general consensus that we want to stop predatory lending processes or make them as unattractive as possible, because of the difficulties that they cause. 


I have seen it firsthand. I have been involved in the finance industry for a very long time. I understand how money worries can plague people. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor; if you cannot manage money effectively, you end up in a very dark place. If you start borrowing from some of the less-regulated lenders at some of the extortionate interest rates which are payable, or in some of the unregulated areas, it can cause enormous grief for you and your family because a lot of the less salubrious lenders are linked to very unsavoury characters. I know that firsthand because unfortunately I have had friends and clients who have gone down that path. 


I think the Department of Human Services has to continue to ensure that people have access to goods using the most reasonable means that are available to them. That means giving some certainty to the vendor—the lender or financier in this case. The best possible way to do that is to allow access to income management. It takes it out of the discretionary hands of the recipient and provides that certainty to the vendor. There are a number of other things that we can do that would be positive in this sense, which I would like Senator Cameron to consider, if he wants to put forward another bill. 


In the end, as I have said before, we need to make sure that the government and the taxpayer are getting appropriate value for money. We have to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used as wisely as possible. We also have to acknowledge that the interests of the welfare recipient have to play a significant part in this. It is not enough for us to wash our hands and say, 'You can have this bundle of cash every week'—it is hardly a bundle, I should say—'you can have this taxpayers' funding every week or fortnight and you can spend it on whatever you want.' We know that some people cannot or will not spent it appropriately, and that leads on to greater societal difficulties. It leads on to individual difficulties in health and wellbeing as well. We know that in some instances children are impacted by the choices that their parents make. We need to acknowledge that and we need to put in place measures that will protect the wellbeing of all participants in this process. 


We have seen the success of income management in many areas. I know that in the previous government there were calls from the member for Wakefield for income management to be rolled out in his area—against the will of his government at the time. I remember there were calls from other members of parliament saying: 'No, this is a good idea. This will help alleviate suffering. It will help alleviate hardship. It will make things easier for people to make the necessary decisions for themselves because some decision making is actually being taken out of their hands.' It sounds a bit perverse, but limiting choices, even for a section of expenditure, makes for better choices. If people are compelled to provide for their rent and to provide, for their children, food and those sorts of things before some of the other discretionary items, they can be better off. And that was the intention. It has been hailed, I think, by most sides of the chamber—with some exceptions, I would say.


That is what the Centrepay policy and terms effectively do: they list the categories of goods and services that are eligible for these Centrepay deductions. They also list the categories that are explicitly excluded. But I need to be very clear here: the new Centrepay policy and terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods. And that is why I would suggest that, no matter how well-meaning this bill may be, it is actually not needed, because this bill does not actually exclude consumer leases from Centrepay. As part of the transition to the new Centrepay policy and terms, businesses that are actually approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases, and unregulated consumer leases are being excluded from Centrepay. The businesses are also required to provide positive agreement to comply with the new policy and terms. I will just state that again: businesses approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases, which are being excluded from Centrepay. They are also required to provide positive agreement to comply with the new policy and terms.


We are also obtaining more detailed data on the usage of Centrepay for consumer leases, which was probably an omission because it was not the case previously. That is not in any sense a criticism; it is just one of these things that sometimes slips through the net. That will enable us to monitor much more closely the usage of Centrepay for unregulated consumer leases during the grandfathering period.


I will make a point here on regulation. The Department of Human Services is not a regulatory authority—and I do not think it should be. We have regulatory authorities. We have the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which is the body responsible for the regulation of consumer leases. That is done under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, as I am sure you will recall. It undertakes research and activities to promote compliance with the national credit act.


Of course, ASIC has taken a great deal of action over the years. There are some in this chamber who are quite critical of ASIC for not taking action where it needs to take action and for prioritising the wrong agendas, but it has taken action against a number of consumer lease providers for failure to comply with the requirements of the national credit act, and particularly in regard to the responsible lending obligations.


ASIC is our regulator. It is meant to inquire into these sorts of things. The Department of Human Services should not be the regulatory authority in this space. However, the Department of Human Services should have a very close and ongoing relationship with the regulatory agencies, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. And I understand that it does. I understand that it has a very strong and close working relationship with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and that cooperation has led to some businesses actually being removed from Centrepay. That is government as it should be working: the regulator and the department talk, and they come to determinations that are in the best interests of the taxpayer, the welfare recipient and the consumer credit supplier.


In that respect, I understand that the department recently provided information to assist ASIC with its current research to better understand consumer leasing practices and the impact on welfare customers. This is very important work, to establish the impact of consumer leases.


I want to come back to where I started. Understanding how money works and understanding personal finance—budgeting; your obligations; the implications of accepting credit at particular rates and not paying it off, and what that can do to your financial future, and the long-term effects it can have on your health and wellbeing—is one of the most important things we can ever instil in people in this country. If we could get people to think about the consequences of managing their money and the consequences of managing their health, this country would be immeasurably better off.


For many, I have to say, it is a bit too late. It is very difficult to get people to change their habits much later in life. But our responsibility is to instil in the next generation—in the boys and girls who are at school, some of whom I have seen touring this parliament today—the need to learn about and understand the implications of credit. In advance of that generation finally going into adulthood with that information, we now have to implement measures such as income management to assist people in making the right choices.


Once again, I say to Senator Cameron: this is a well-meaning bill; I understand perfectly what you are trying to do here, and I sense that you understand what I am trying to do as well, Senator Cameron. But there are consequences that the government has considered. I have to say that I stand with the government on this because the consequences of, and the omissions from, this bill mean I cannot support it. That may come as a surprise to you, Senator Cameron, but I am unable to support your bill today in its current form because I think the government has a persuasive case as to some of the implications of it—which I do not think are of benefit to those people who deserve our full support.


I will use the brief time I have left to encourage the government to continue its diligence in examining the implications of changes to consumer credit codes and financial management. I would encourage them even more warmly to invest in the next generation. The two best things they can do for the future of this country are, first, to instil in young people an understanding of how money works and how they can live a lifetime of financial independence by adopting some very simple practices and, second, to encourage them to take better care of their health.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (11:01):  Senator Cameron says he wants to exclude all consumer leases from Centrepay. We in the government believe that his private senator's bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015, will not do that and is flawed. The objective of Centrepay is to assist customers in managing expenses which are consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments and reducing financial risk by providing a facility to have regular deductions made from their welfare payments. The government has already taken action in this area. Following a review and subsequent stakeholder consultation, the Department of Human Services introduced a range of changes to Centrepay to improve its operation and provide greater information to customers. These changes include the exclusion of consumer leases not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009—referred to as the National Credit Act— and the expansion of Centrepay to support alternatives to consumer leases such as low-interest loans, no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-by. We argue that it is important to ensure that people who have very limited access to most forms of credit—or to alternatives to consumer leases—are still able to access necessity goods, as we call them, such as refrigerators and washing machines. 


The department works to build strong assurance practices for the consumer leasing industry and to influence its behaviours. Centrepay is currently transitioning to a new contract and assurance framework that will provide more options in responding to poor business behaviour and will provide additional dedicated assurance resources. The new Centrepay policy and terms list the categories of goods and services eligible for Centrepay deductions. The policy and terms also list the categories that are explicitly excluded. Let me be clear: the new Centrepay policy and terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods. This bill is not needed and this bill will not exclude consumer leases from Centrepay. 


As part of the continuing transition to the new Centrepay policy and terms, businesses approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases which are being excluded from Centrepay. They are also required to provide positive agreement to compliance with the new policy and terms. We are also obtaining more detailed data on usage of Centrepay for consumer leases, which was not the case previously. Usage of Centrepay for unregulated consumer leases during that grandparenting period—we do not call it 'grandfathering' or even 'grandmothering' anymore; it is now 'grandparenting'—will be monitored closely. 


I turn to the issue of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC. The Department of Human Services is not a regulatory authority, nor should it be. It is a payment authority of the federal government. ASIC are responsible for the regulation of consumer leases under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. They undertake research and activities to promote compliance with the National Credit Act. ASIC has undertaken enforcement action against a number of consumer lease providers for failing to comply with the requirements of the National Credit Act, particularly for failure to comply with the responsible lending obligations in the act. 


The Department of Human Services has a close relationship with the regulatory agencies, including ASIC. This has led to some businesses being removed from Centrepay. So action has been taken. ASIC has been doing its job and the Department of Human Services has been doing its job; they have been working closely together in dealing with businesses that deserve to be removed from Centrepay. I understand the department recently provided information to assist ASIC with its current research aimed at better understanding consumer leasing practices and the impact on welfare customers. That is important work.


We all know there are concerns about the behaviour of some consumer leasing businesses and we are working with ASIC to address that. Some consumers, often welfare recipients, pay far too much for leased goods. It is those providers we need to address. This is something that has recently been acknowledged by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. The department is going about addressing this issue in an informed and planned way, the way any good government would. There is no point rushing in with half-baked measures. That is why, at the minister's request, the Department of Human Services is chairing a working group which is consulting with business and non-government organisations about a requirement for Centrepay-approved businesses to disclose to their customers the effective interest that would apply for any consumer lease product. This will help ensure people make informed choices. 


It is very easy to say those words, but think about what it means in practice. This is about transparency. This is about saying to someone, before they enter into a contract: 'This is the effective interest rate. This is what you will have to pay over that period. You think you are buying this refrigerator for X. However, because you are paying over time'—depending on the terms they may be able to buy the piece of equipment at the end of the term—'the effective cost to you is X times two.' This is the point. This is transparency at work. This is how you get people to make responsible decisions. They can then say: 'Okay, I cannot afford to do this. The interest rate is too high.' That is transparency, which is very important.



At the same time, the Assistant Treasurer, my friend the Hon. Josh Frydenberg MP, has announced an independent review of the small amount credit contract provisions of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The review has been given terms of reference which include consideration of whether the small amount credit contract provisions should also be applied to consumer leases. The government is closely considering consumer leases and will take further steps as appropriate. When the Assistant Treasurer announced the review on 7 August 2015 he indicated that it fulfils a statutory requirement under the credit act to examine and report on the effectiveness of the law relating to small account credit contracts. He acknowledged there:


The Government recognises that small amount lenders can play an important role in the economy by providing credit to consumers who are excluded from mainstream forms of finance. 




That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about people who do not qualify for most normal forms of finance. This is an issue for the banking system and for the financial service providers as much as it is for society
—
finding a way in which we can help those people who do not have access to other more mainstream forms of finance. Mr Frydenberg announced:



The Government wants to ensure that the regulatory framework strikes the right balance by protecting vulnerable consumers without imposing an undue regulatory burden on industry.


This review will have a consultation process. The panel will call for submissions from interested parties and consult widely with stakeholders and will report by the end of this year. We do not have to wait until the middle of next year for the report of this group—we will have it by the end of the year. That will provide us with the opportunity to consider all of these measures that Senator Cameron has rightly raised in the context of full information including a proper structured review by experienced people of the small amount credit contracts. The review will be chaired by Ms Danielle Press, the CEO of Equipsuper, and will include Ms Catherine Walter, Deputy Chair of Funds Management Victoria, and Mr Stephen Cavanagh, partner at HWL Ebsworth. So this is a blue-ribbon panel that I think will do an excellent job in looking at this matter. 


The government has made it clear that it concedes the point that Senator Cameron has made. Mr Frydenberg conceded that there were issues, and while Senator Cameron was out of the chamber I made the point that we support greater transparency around disclosure of effective interest rates. We need to put consumers in a position to be informed. The other element of this, and it is not covered here, is that we also need to make sure that we are rolling out financial literacy programs to those most vulnerable people. Not everybody may have access to the ASIC website or to some of the programs that the banks and others have rolled out, so it is important for us to supplement what we are doing by having appropriate financial literacy programs.


I want to consider the impact of this bill on income management. If the bill were enacted there would be welfare recipients on income management who would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, regulated or unregulated, using their income managed money. Those on income management would be able to continue to pay for regulated leases using their non-income managed money via Centrepay or unregulated leases via other private payment arrangements. This could place these vulnerable people in financial distress, which is what income management was designed to avoid. Excluding consumer leases from income management has the potential to cause further hardship to already vulnerable people. Some people have existing arrangements to pay consumer leases from income managed funds, and the Department of Human Services would be obliged to end these arrangements. For some people on income management this type of arrangement may be the only option available to them to obtain basic household goods. The government does want more lower cost options available to people, which is why it continues to support the Good Shepherd no-interest loan scheme and why Centrepay is expanding to include low interest loans, savings and layby.


I commend the financial system because over the last few years a number of the banks and others have sought to address issues in this area through mechanisms like no-interest loan schemes. Ironically, these are in part based on the experience in developing countries. In places like Pakistan and Bangladesh, the Grameen Bank provided low- or no-interest loans—very small loans—to people and they found, remarkably, that people were not frittering these loans away. They were either getting basic goods they needed or they were starting small businesses. The repayment rate was very high. If you backed these people, they more than repaid your faith in them by not just repaying the money but often by starting new businesses and getting their lives and their families in order. 


I fully support the rollout of these sorts of alternative loan and payment options for lower income people, but that must go hand in hand with continuing to expand financial literacy and putting the Assistant Treasurer in a position by the end of the year, when we have the fruits of that review, to institute small loans. That will give us the chance to have a comprehensive package around this whole area. It will give us just a bit more time. Senator Cameron just has to wait until the end of the year and we can do things in a more comprehensive package, and this private member's bill and the debate on it will help inform the government's further consideration of options. That is very important, and it is a very useful thing that we have been able to do. It is particularly important that we look at how the government can encourage these alternative loan options that I talked about before. We should do whatever we can to link these options to broader strategies within government; to encourage people who are on the fringes of society—Indigenous groups are a particularly large part of that—into the mainstream by linking what we do in this area with workforce participation and other measures. This is not about being punitive; that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about how we, in a whole-of-government way, can address the sources of disadvantage that people have so that they are in a position where they do not see themselves as passive welfare recipients condemned to a life on the dole or condemned to two or three generations of poverty. The intergenerational transmission of poverty is one of the biggest challenges we face with these groups on the margins of society. It is very important to take a whole-of-government approach to all of this.


In relation to the matters which are being considered in the context of this private member's bill, I think it would be good to have a whole-of-government approach which would take account of what the Assistant Treasurer will be providing to us in the form of a report by the end of this year. That report in part will be informed by work that is being done by ASIC, which released its report into small-amount credit contracts in March. That was focused on compliance. It did not look at policy questions such as whether the existing rules are effective or appropriate. ASIC found that compliance with some regulations was working well, including a requirement to provide a warning about alternative credit options. However, ASIC did find some issues present in the sector, including adequate documentation and record keeping, as I alluded to before. ASIC has put the industry on notice that it needs to improve. Since 2010 its enforcement action has resulted in close to $2 million in refunds to more than 10,000 customers who have been overcharged. The government fully supports ASIC's actions to date in ensuring that all lenders are complying with the law. I look forward to further debate on measures which can strengthen appropriate regulation and compliance in this area.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-09-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:16):  This bill introduced by Senator Cameron reminds me of a saying I quite like: 'Just as an oyster needs a grain of sand to grow a pearl, precious ideas might grow from vigorous argument. So we should probably value irritants in public debate, and welcome challenges to accepted norms.' In what Senator Cameron has done here—clearly he has irritated some in this chamber with this idea, saying that there is another way forward—he has actually dealt with an important issue that is affecting many thousands of Australians every day of every week and that has a profound impact on their financial welfare. In the absence of a better alternative, I have no choice but to support the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015, because what this bill is saying, effectively, is that we need to stop aiding and abetting practices where consumer leases are effectively ripping off some of the most marginal in our community. Senator Cameron's favourite economist, Joseph Stiglitz, in The Price of Inequality talks about these issues: about that entrenched inequality and those traps that people who are vulnerable, who are poor, simply cannot get out of. Senator Sinodinos made a point about the Grameen Bank. Muhummad Yunus won a Nobel Peace Prize for his microloans. What have microloans got to do with peace? If you give people economic security, if you give them economic stability, if you give them jobs and hope, that is one of the best ways to drive away the evil influences of terrorism, extremism and fundamentalism. Poverty is a factor in making people vulnerable to the evil of terrorist influences.


The reason why I support this bill is, I think, contained in a table that Senator Cameron has referred to and that has been provided in very useful briefing material—it comes not from him but from the Consumer Action Law Centre—on the hidden costs of rent-to-own in September 2013. I will give two examples. For a high-definition television with a retail price of $749 to $1,049, the rent-to-own price can be between $3,112 and $3,893. That is between 371 per cent and 415 per cent. For a mid-range stroller—this is what a young family puts their baby in—the retail price is between $100 and $300; the rent-to-own price is between $772 and $1,392—a 464 per cent to 772 per cent mark-up. We need to do something about this. I think that Senator Cameron's bill, being an irritant perhaps to those who think we should just have business as usual, will prompt change. I am not sure whether this bill in its current form will get through both houses of parliament but I can practically guarantee that, as a result of Senator Cameron's very fine work on this, we will see changes in the law that will achieve, if not all of what he wants, a significant amount of what he wants. I still think this bill is the best vehicle forward.


The system of automatic deductions from government payments via Centrepay has been around since 1998. It has been an effective budgeting mechanism whereby the costs of utilities and rent were deducted each fortnight before the balance was paid to the Centrelink client. But since the recent clampdown on unscrupulous payday lending providers there has been a massive expansion in the advertising and take-up of consumer lease agreements. Disturbingly consumer lease providers such as chain stores providing televisions, computers or stereos are approved for deductions from Centrepay. While utility bills account for about one-third of Centrepay deductions for 600,000 Centrelink clients, consumer leases have risen to account for 14 per cent of deductions. But the statistics mask the damage to people's lives brought about by these consumer lease payments, as their meagre government payments get eaten up by high interest payments which can make the price of goods being used more than double their retail price—or in fact seven, almost eight, times the retail price.


I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed by government senators—including Senator Ruston, who is in the chamber—saying that we should not be treating Centrelink clients any differently to other Australians. I agree with Senator Ruston that Centrepay should not be used as a form of mandatory income management. Centrepay is voluntary and will continue to be so—but with a clear purpose. Centrepay was always designed to be an effective way to ensure that essential items like electricity and rent could be paid for by some of the poorest people in our community. This bill should be seen as a prudent measure to safeguard people's social security benefits—funds that should not be flowing in increasing amounts via exorbitant interest payments to consumer lease providers. I note that Centrepay cannot be used for the repayment of credit card debt or any other kind of consumer credit. But these rent-to-pay agreements are a loophole. They are a rort that is occurring. In the same way, I believe, consumer leases should also be excluded. This bill will ensure that it continues to be used for that purpose. That is why I will be supporting it. I commend Senator Cameron for bringing this bill. We need reform sooner rather than later, and this bill is a very good vehicle for that.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:22):  I want to comment on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 as proposed by Senator Cameron. And I want to record that I am in absolute lock step with Senator Cameron in his motivation behind presenting this bill before this chamber. I sense that the dialogue in the discussion by others is in accord with that. I say that because in this society people who would try to use their influence, their retail capacity, their expertise or their marketing to prey on those who simply cannot afford the type of product or service that these people are trying to peddle are parasites. If legislation needs to be put into place to exclude these people, to expose them, to out them, then I am absolutely in agreement with that. I am, as many in this chamber have been and maybe still are, associated with organisations such as St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, the Salvation Army and other non-government organisations associated with people who are in need, often financial need. I say very strongly that the motivation behind Senator Cameron's bill is to be applauded.


However, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, and as I will in the brief time available to me point out, if by passing Senator Cameron's bill we actually place vulnerable people at greater risk rather than less risk, then Senator Cameron's noble objectives will not have been met. That is the concern I have. We know the objective of Centrepay. It is to assist customers in managing their expenses—expenses that are consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments—to reduce the financial risk to them, to provide them with a facility that will allow regular deductions to be made from their welfare payments that will still leave them with adequate resources to lead a fulfilling life, to look after their families and to look after their own wellbeing.


Whether Senator Cameron's bill has been the catalyst or not I do not know. As Senator Xenophon has just said, if the dialogue that we have in this place today leads to further improvements to make the administration of this process better, then I certainly concur that Senator Cameron's time will have been well spent. But, as has been pointed out, some of the elements within the bill will actually put these worthy people at greater risk rather than less risk. For example, if we exclude under the Centrepay arrangements the consumer lease for goods that are regulated now, what will probably happen is that people will go outside the system, where they will be vulnerable to these people whom I refer to as parasites—people who would prey on those whom they very well know are, for whatever reason, unable to afford what it is they are trying to sell them, often at inflated prices. Those who are on income management may use a cash component, for example, to purchase when they could have used, under a properly structured process, the Centrepay mechanism. If it encourages them to go and purchase unregulated goods, then nobody is better for this process.


Why do people often find themselves in these circumstances? I refer back to the comments of my colleague Senator Fawcett, and that is that we know there are instances in which adults are illiterate. Therefore, giving them written information about the risks or the opportunities associated with either lease or purchase or other means of acquiring products is meaningless, because they simply do not understand them. There are other people who, for whatever reason, may at some time in their past have had the necessary skills to manage their money but for various reasons may not now be in that position. I guess that is where the Centrepay system comes into its own.


What are some of the services that are included under the regulated category? Very briefly, they are accommodation services; education and employment; health; finance, particularly that associated with community group loans; legal and professional services, if they are required, such as court fines; travel and transport; motor vehicle registration, associated with the good conduct of their family and often used to obtain and then arrive for work; utilities; and the council services, such as electricity et cetera. And then there are of course these household goods that are more the subject of the consumer lease exclusion about which Senator Cameron spoke. I also want to talk about household goods lease and rental, which is the subject of our discussion, and provision of food, home care and trade services. What is excluded? Rental or lease payments for goods where the consumer lease is not regulated under the national Consumer Credit Protection Act. And then there are payments made to a broker, an arranger—a person who acts as a middleman, who, I say again, parasitises that process—rather than the provider of the Centrepay-approved good or service. Also excluded are short-term loan repayments to cash lenders, payday lenders and pawn brokers. These are excluded and of course unable to be used.


I want to refer for a moment to the relationship between the department that has oversight and ASIC. As we know, ASIC is the party responsible for the regulation of consumer leases. It falls then to ASIC to ensure the good and proper activity of retailers and others under the regulated process. As has been pointed out, it is ASIC's role to enforce compliance, for example. I am pleased to learn that even this year there have been retail organisations that have been named, shamed and, more importantly, excluded from offering the regulated products which in ASIC's view they have abused. They are excluded for periods of time, which are clearly punitive, and put on notice that if they were to continue that activity they would not be able to offer the regulated goods through this process.


It is my view that Senator Cameron's motivations are quite correct. But if his bill is enacted, it will be welfare recipients on income management who would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, whether regulated or unregulated, using their income-managed funds. There is also the associated risk of them using the cash component to engage in the sorts of activities that Senator Cameron is alerting us to, placing vulnerable people in financial distress—which is exactly what income management was designed to avoid.


We know that there are mechanisms other than leasing. There may be no- or low-interest loans through philanthropic and other organisations. There may be lay-by. There may be the opportunity to obtain a necessary product by alternative means. It was interesting to listen to the comments made by Senator Sinodinos and Senator Xenophon in relation to the excellent work of Muhammad Yunus and others who have followed him in relation to microfinancing. It is worth recording that the bad-debt rate from microfinance loans to deserving people, particularly deserving women, in countries like Pakistan, India and Malaysia, is, as I understand it and in my experience, infinitely lower than in the wider banking system. These loans give these people the opportunity to improve their lot, to start a small business and to work their way out of that cycle of poverty.


I applaud Senator Cameron for his motivation in introducing this bill. I concur with him about the concern he raises about the most vulnerable people, who need to be protected from the activities of those who would undo them. But the measures that have been undertaken by the government and the department, with the involvement of ASIC and ACCC, are the way to go. We do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-09-10,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:32):  I must say that I am still trying to recover from some of the speeches this morning, where those opposite actually praised my motivation. It is a highly unusual approach from those opposite. But when you get the chance, you should take it the way it was meant.


I want to deal with some of the technical issues that have been raised in relation to my private senator's bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. One of the issues that this debate has clearly demonstrated is that there is no legislative base for Centrepay. Centrepay is regulated by the policy and terms determined by the Department of Human Services, and those policy and terms can be changed by the secretary—obviously in consultation with the minister. Given that a number of coalition senators who participated in the debate raised this issue, I want to place on record now that the opposition would be amenable and supportive of sitting down with the minister and the government to develop a proper legislative base for what is one of the most successful programs for many years. It is a successful program that does good things. What I am concerned about is the misuse of Centrepay by some of the most unscrupulous business people in the country.


I do not think the policy and terms of such a wide-ranging, important program, that is worth $3 billion—that is the amount of money going through this program—and which is accessed by 600,000 citizens, should simply be left to the secretary of the department to determine in consultation with the minister. There has always been a bipartisan approach to Centrepay, and I think that bipartisan approach should continue by sitting down and looking at the legislative base to see how we can protect all citizens who access Centrepay and make sure that the rip-off merchants do not get their claws into people who are doing it tough.


I might be one of the few sitting in the Senate who have used a consumer lease. Many years ago when I was involved in a pretty tough industrial scene in the Hunter Valley and at the electricity commission I had a single income. For one year I earned $8,000. That was my total income for the year. We were in all sorts of strife trying to pay our mortgage and put food on the table for our kids. We were desperate at the time for a fridge, I think it was. A leaflet came through that made it look so easy. I made a mistake: I got the fridge and I paid through the nose for it.


Again, I am one of the few here who has, from time to time, battled to put food on their family's table, because of having a single income, being a blue-collar worker and doing it really tough, so I know from personal experience what this means. At the end of a three-year or four-year lease, you think, 'Why did I do that? Why didn't someone advise me that this was the wrong thing to do? Why did I, in a moment of weakness, get caught up in this web of business process that leaves me much worse off at the end?' I do come to this from some experience. It would probably have been over 30 years ago when I was in that position. I understand that many people would be in that position.


A company, rent4keeps, sets up their pop-up business in the middle of a shopping centre in Penrith, where I still shop, targeting single mums and low-socioeconomic families. Surely the lessons that individuals like myself learnt all those years ago and the lessons that society should have learnt should be put in place and people should not be hunted down by these jackals in their smart suits who tell people on welfare that everything is okay if you pay four or five times the price for a consumer good. We have an obligation to expose that and we have an obligation to deal with it. I looked at this some time ago. Rent4keeps did not target me because I was not in the age demographic that they were looking for. I asked for the leaflet, got the leaflet and looked up their website. On the website I did the calculation for a couple of the goods that they had. One was, I think, a Hisense flat screen, fairly big television. You could pick it up for about 900 bucks. I did the calculation of what it would cost from rent4keeps over four years and it came to $5,700. This is a TV you could get for 900 bucks at Harvey Norman. You could probably get it cheaper if you went online.


There are a number of options for the young people who are getting caught up in this. Even credit cards, which are regulated, would be cheaper than rent4keeps, and we all know about the problems with getting into the credit card cycle of poverty, so that is even worse. We have regulated payday loans and payday lenders, and yet what we are finding now is that a lot of the payday lenders are moving from payday lending to consumer leasing, because consumer leasing is the next way that is unregulated to rip citizens of this country off, and I think the Senate has an obligation to deal with that.


I looked at the rent4keeps website, as I have indicated, and there were plenty of examples of why nobody should ever go near them. They are also letterboxing the Housing Commission areas in Penrith. Their stuff looks pretty flash. They have a happy, smiling family getting all the consumer goods that wealth brings, yet these people are not wealthy. It is not just in areas like Penrith; they are targeting Indigenous communities. We must say, 'Enough is enough.' We must do that. Why are some people doing this? On their website, rent4keeps say, 'Set a franchise up with us. We've got 100 operating franchises around the country'—and, remember, this is one of the minor players. They have 'numerous exciting and profitable ""lifestyle friendly"" franchise opportunities'. I will tell you: it is not lifestyle friendly if you are a citizen they have their claws in. There is no friendly lifestyle for them. They say:


If you enjoy being busy and having a business you can run, that does not run you, then maybe R4K is worth a look.


So they are saying, 'Hey, there's a great business opportunity here. Let's do it.' And they say:


The business model is very profitable


No wonder it is very profitable when they are getting four and sometimes five times the price of the consumer good, paid through some poor citizen who is being screwed by the company. They say:


Is easy to run from home


You have no big overheads like we hear in some of the arguments: 'You have to increase the cost of the consumer good because you've got overheads.' This company is saying, 'That ain't an issue. You can run this from home.' They go on to say:


Affordable initial outlay given the returns


Again, there is the argument: 'If you've got to invest in your business, you've got to get a return.' They are saying it is really affordable and that you could do it easily. Here are the kickers:


Huge customer demand


Very low overheads


Significant franchisor support


So it is all upside for the people who are getting their claws into the poorest people in this country and it is all downside once citizens have rent4keeps and Radio Rentals claws in them. This is a huge issue in my view that has to be dealt with.


Another argument that we have heard is that the government are moving on this issue. The government made an announcement back in May 2015 after this issue was becoming public and Labor had made some comments on it. The government said they would 'restrict the type of consumer leases that consumers can pay for using Centrepay payments.' They went on to say:


... leases that run for an indefinite period, or have a duration of four months or less, will be excluded from Centrepay ...


That did not deal with the fundamental issue that these consumer leases are still readily available under Centrepay. They said that the Department of Human Services would work with Treasury and key stakeholders to review the policy and whether you would disclose the effect of interest rate by Centrepay registered providers. If people in trouble think that Centrepay is available to do this, they will think that there is some government support for this. 


I do not think that we should be giving any impression that we support Radio Rentals, rent4keeps or Rent the Roo. Some of these companies have been before ASIC and have been fined in the Federal Court and are then still part of Centrepay. Why should we be allowing that to happen? If there is one thing that this Senate should be doing it is protecting those that cannot protect themselves. That is what we should be doing.


Minister Payne said that there will be 'links to ASIC's MoneySmart website'. I can imagine the poor person down in the housing commission house will be thinking, 'I'd better go and have a look at the ASIC website to see what they say about this mob that are telling me I should pay four times the amount for the consumer goods.' Funeral insurance would be excluded, which has been a rip-off. Minister Payne also said that there would be:


…increased cooperation between the department and consumer protection regulators.


In my view—and I will not be unkind to Senator Payne—that was the smokescreen the government put up to try to avoid dealing with the fundamental issue that citizens in this country were mercilessly being ripped off, and the government at that stage was not prepared to do anything about it. That is why my bill was put forward, and I am glad to say that it was supported within the caucus of the Labor Party. It is an important way forward. 


Then the kicker really comes in Senator Payne's press release. She says:


While customers may still use Centrepay for regulated consumer leases—


'regulated consumer leases'—there is no regulation on whether they charge you 400 or 500 or 600 per cent, so I do not know where this regulation comes in—


I would encourage people to carefully read the fine print and consider all of their options.


Senator Payne does recognise that there is a big problem here that should be fixed. That problem could easily have been fixed if the minister and the secretary of the department had sat down and changed the policy and terms to exclude the rip-off merchants using Centrepay—Radio Rentals, Rent the Roos, rent4keeps, and I could go on and on. All these people are making masses of profit at the expense of the poorest citizens in our country. 


I say it is important that this bill passes in the Senate. It is important to send the message to the rip-off merchants in our community that this Senate does not support the rip-off of the poorest people in this country, and this bill is the first step. I would call on the government to look at the bill in the House of Representatives and pass the bill in the House of Representatives as well because that will send a clear and unequivocal message to the rip-off merchants in our community that we will not allow them to use a government department to facilitate their rip-offs, because that is what is happening. I have heard the arguments that people should have a choice. This bill does not stop anyone going into rent4keeps or Radio Rentals or Rent the Roo and getting a bank deduction and being ripped off. I say that should be looked at by Mr Frydenberg in the other place to make sure that we put a limit on those rip-offs and we stop these rip-offs, but my view is that we should pass this bill to send a clear message to the rip-off merchants that the game is up.


Radio Rentals run almost half of their consumer lease business through Centrepay. A recent analysis said that Radio Rental's business model was unsustainable because of its rip-off nature. It is a subprime approach to people in this country. When an analysis was done and when Radio Rentals made some comment to the stock exchange about what these Centrepay changes that the government had put in place would mean for them, they said that it would mean nothing to their profits, it would mean nothing for the business model. So the rip-offs continue. With all the arguments that we have heard from those opposite—that the government moved on this, that the government made these changes to stop poor people ripped off—Radio Rentals say that it did not have one effect on them at all. The rip-offs continue. 


We need to be clear about what this bill is about: stopping the rip-offs and making sure that people are treated fairly. This is supported. I convened a round table of welfare groups back in March. At that round table there was overwhelming support to do something about this because the welfare groups—the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family and the various faith-based support groups—are the ones who are picking up the pieces on this. I did an interview this morning on FIVEaa with Leon Byner. He asked people to ring in after I had said we should stop this. Seven people rang in. Six of them gave practical examples of how their families had been left in a terrible position as a result of using consumer leases. Only one came in and said it was okay, and my view was that they were someone from the industry. 


I commend this bill. I ask the Senate to support this bill. It is about protecting the most vulnerable in the community.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:32):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to continue my remarks in relation to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. At the end of my previous contribution on this bill I was talking about changes the government have already made to Centrepay which we believe need to have the opportunity to take effect before we start launching into anything new. There is no doubt that Centrepay is an extremely valuable bill paying service that helps very many Centrelink customers manage their ongoing expenses. In May this year the government announced changes to Centrepay which we think are going to go a long way to protecting the most vulnerable Centrelink customers.


The changes that have been put forward mean that Centrepay no longer supports consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. Senator Cameron wanted  us to ban all consumer leases from being able to be paid through Centrepay. Instead the government took a more responsible approach and said, 'Let's ensure that any consumer leases that are available are regulated by what would otherwise be a normal regulation that every other consumer in the community would seek to have regulated.' That was instead of a knee-jerk reaction that says anybody who is on Centrelink cannot access their lease payments through Centrepay.


The legislative changes are not required to make changes to Centrepay. The government are looking to change and improve outcomes for customers without taking away the important avenue of support for customers with limited options to obtain necessary credit. There is no doubt that many people on Centrelink would not otherwise have access to payment terms because of their lower income and their lack of a credit rating. It is really important that we as a government make responsible decisions to make sure that people who are on Centrelink still do have access to the kind of payment options that everybody else in the community is able to get and not discriminate against them just because they happen to be on Centrelink.


The government do not support Senator Cameron's private bill because we believe it is fundamentally flawed. By prohibiting consumer leases from Centrepay for all consumer leases, the bill discriminates against people who are currently on Centrelink. The main objective of Centrepay was simply to assist customers in managing expenses, which is consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments, and reduce financial risk by providing a facility to have regular deductions made from welfare payments. This bill overreaches by being overly prescriptive about not just the types of things that these people wish to purchase but also how they are able to access them.


Following a review and a subsequent stakeholder consultation, the Department of Human Services introduced a range of changes to Centrepay to improve its operation and provide greater information for customers. These changes were only introduced in May this year. They have not actually had the opportunity to even filter their way through so we can see whether they are working. I would suggest that Senator Cameron should have delayed the introduction of his more restrictive and prescriptive bill until after we had the opportunity to see whether the new changes had worked or not. As I said, the particular relevant change that occurred in May that relates to Senator Cameron's bill is the change to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act. I think this certainly goes a long way to dealing with many of the issues that Senator Cameron raised about people scamming or taking advantage of those in our community who, possibly, are not in a position to absorb any fluctuations in their expenditure from week to week. The expansion of Centrepay is also to support alternative consumer leases such as low-interest loans, savings plans and lay-by.


The government are seeking to give as much flexibility and opportunity as possible to people on Centrelink to manage their own finances in the way that they would like to manage them and to make their own decisions about their day-to-day expenditure. I think it is incumbent on government not to interfere in people's lives to the extent where we tell them what they can buy or not buy. As I said in my last contribution, to say that somebody on Centrelink is not able to purchase a washing machine or a refrigerator by using the Centrepay opportunity, which may be the only way they are able to get access to these fundamental necessities of life, needs a serious rethink of legislation that would even seek to do that.


For that reason the government are not supporting this private member's bill of Senator Cameron. The house needs to be assured that the government are very mindful of making sure that we protect everybody in our society from organisations that would seek to take advantage, so we have strengthened our credit laws across the board. Those credit laws have been strengthened for the benefit, not just of people on Centrelink, but of all members of our community who would seek to purchase items through some form of credit or alternative consumer lease or activity.


The department is working to build strong assurance practices for consumer-leasing industry groups and to influence their behaviour. We believe that the best way for us to protect consumers is to ensure that the people who are in this particular space in terms of consumer credit and leasing through providing credit to consumers understand their responsibilities and obligations, and are monitored, checked and reviewed to make sure that they are operating within a set of laws and guidelines that the Australian public would deem responsible. To be very, very clear the government do not disagree with the need to have strong consumer credit laws that protect all Australians and obviously take into account those in our society that are more vulnerable because they do not have the extra cash or disposable income to protect them from fluctuations or unexpected expenses. But to go to the extent of the overreach of this bill and to start proscribing what people can spend their money on is not something that the government could support.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2015-09-10,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (09:41):  I rise to make a contribution to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 debate. The point has already been made that the government do not support this private member's bill. The intent of the bill, as we understand it, on the part of Senator Cameron, the author of the bill, is that he wants to prohibit all consumer leases from Centrepay, but this bill clearly does not do that. It does not have the capacity to achieve that. Indeed the government through the Department of Human Services have already introduced a range of changes that will address most of the concerns of Senator Cameron.


The changes have been made to improve the operation of the scheme by providing greater information to its customers. These changes include, but are not limited to, exclusion of consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. So, in effect, the government through the agency had a close look at where some of the vulnerabilities might be and have risen to the occasion to make adjustments in the operation of the scheme to see that the consumers are protected. The legislation also takes on, in excluding the expansion of Centrepay, to support alternatives to consumer leases such as low-interest loans in addition to no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-bys. This, in effect, is providing the people with choice. It allows them to function their household budgets and operate with the necessities of life within the scope of those things that might be of that available to the rest of us in the community when we are trying to manage the affairs of our budgets.


Apart from the strengthening protections we need to go back and have a look at who the people are that are affected by these arrangements, the Centrelink customers. These are people who often find themselves in difficult circumstances. We are talking about difficult economic or budgetary circumstances. The legislation is more inclined towards people who find themselves in lower socio-economic circumstances where this current assistance is valuable. From our life experiences we all know people who have grave difficulties in managing money. I have a number of relatives who fall into that category. When you do not have that ability—when you do not have an ability to budget, to save and to make contingency provision for the essential things in life where you are in more difficult or measured economic circumstances—these difficulties become writ very large in your life. We spoke yesterday about the fact that these programs are meant to help these people manage their circumstances, not to hinder them. We are not here to take away the fundamental and basic right of people to choose what they do with their money, but this process aids them to be much more alert to what they might next do and guides them in ensuring that they have covered the general necessities of life.


Regulated customer leases are not going to be excluded from Centrepay. Welfare recipients are generally unable to access most forms of credit such as credit cards in any event, and regulated consumer leasing is one of the few ways of obtaining essential household goods quickly. As we all know, without security being provided, when you make application for any form of financial assistance where you enter into an otherwise contractual arrangement with a consumer lease, a low-doc loan or a low-interest or no-interest loan, the credit agency or individual or corporation extending the credit has regard not just to your security position but to your capacity to service the loan commitment. This program allows security for those lenders where they know that, through the Centrelink payments, these loans or other financial arrangements will be serviced.


When we look at alternatives to general consumer leases, such as the no-interest loan scheme operated by the Good Shepherd microfinance scheme, this bill of Senator Cameron's would exclude people from having access to these financial facilities, which are particularly designed to help these people who are in otherwise somewhat difficult circumstances. Let's just think for a moment about where they might find themselves. Many people who are on Centrelink support are not receiving it simply because they are unable to get employment. That is one of the main reasons, but there are any number of reasons and we have to remember that we need to think beyond the individual themselves. In some cases, a person whom this bill would seek to exclude from accessing any sort of consumer lease or low-interest loan may well be a parent, and that parent may well be in difficult circumstances.


We heard yesterday in contributions made on a related matter that a lot of these households and homes find themselves with someone or, on occasions, multiple people within the household who have some form of addiction, whether it be a drug addiction or an alcohol addiction. Indeed, it may well be a gambling addiction or they are just people who are completely incapable of managing their own personal finances—exacerbated, as I pointed out earlier, by the very difficult circumstances they might find themselves in through the perils of life. Just think about this for a moment. If this bill were to take effect, it might prevent a parent, even the addicted parent or, indeed, another partner in that household, from being able to, for example, purchase a fridge or a washing machine. Just imagine the circumstances where you have a parent who is financially struggling in any event due to any number of perils, some of which I have mentioned, and there are many others, and is unable to purchase a fridge.


Let's take a household where you are living in the suburbs. You may not even have a car; you might rely upon public transport or some other form of making your way around, and now you find yourself with a young family of four or five school-aged children. Your fridge is broken and beyond repair. You might not even have the capacity to meet the costs of repairs to a fridge, but let us assume for the purpose of this example that the fridge is no longer functioning and you need to get a new fridge. If this bill were to take effect, some of these people would not be able to enter into a consumer lease arrangement, firstly because it would be prohibited by this proposed legislation, but in reality it may be that they cannot enter into an arrangement if they do not have proof—if they cannot convince the consumer lender—that they are able to repay the loan. Entering into arrangements where a loan is serviced by a part of their Centrelink payments, of course, allows that household to replace that fridge. As burdensome as that purchase may be, it puts that family back on a fair footing, as we would all want to see, in relation to the necessities of that household.


In a similar fashion, if the washing machine in the house were to break and you have a family of six or seven who are already in difficult circumstances, in many cases exacerbated by some of the scourges in the household with these addictions, you could be left with a mother of young children who then has no capacity to wash the linen or the clothes of the family unless they are able to access some form of consumer lease, low-interest or no-interest loan or, as I said before, finances operated by schemes such as NILS, which is the Good Shepherd microfinance scheme.


Essentially, the impact of this bill is very clear: either we are prepared to support these people in these difficult circumstances by, in essence, guaranteeing the payment of the lease payments or the interest payments on these loans or we are not. There needs to be no confusion here and no crossover. I do understand the spirit of what Senator Cameron has tried to achieve. None of us want to see any unscrupulous lenders taking advantage of people who are in very difficult circumstances, who otherwise would not have a choice and who, in some cases, are in very desperate circumstances being exploited by lenders and financiers. Nobody wants to see that happen—me in particular.


In a former life, I had a lot to do with families who found themselves in quite tragic circumstances. I understand these stresses of day-to-day life. As a former police officer, I have been in their homes, I have seen their struggles and I have seen the pain of a mother who is a spouse to sometimes an abusive father, who was addicted to either drugs or alcohol. The circumstances in their homes are very pitiful. If this bill were to go ahead, on balance, it would prevent those mothers from being able to enter into any sort of consumer arrangements to bring to them some of the very basic necessities of life.


It may even extend beyond the basic necessities. I am not one of those who is of the school of thought that these people find themselves in these circumstances should be denied the opportunity to have some of those other things in life that we all experience and take the granted. You have got a young family coming through in that household, you want them to have the ability to be introduced to some of the technologies of life, either in an essential form, from an educational perspective or from a social development perspective. Might I say, to the cry of some others, it may be just to allow their children to be able to enjoy some of the functions in life that come with some computer games and the sorts of things that young people seem to be attracted to more and more these days. If this bill was take effect, for those mothers in those households—or a father, before I hear the cry of discrimination come my way from our side of the building—it would prevent them from being able to enter into leases or loan arrangements to bring those things into their family. I think that is completely wrong and, in effect, discriminatory in and of itself.


What this program does is assist them in doing this. Some people, believe it or not, are just not quite financially literature enough or have enough life experience to be able to wade their way through certain regulated lease agreements and the like. That is why the changes of policy—the Centrepay policy terms list and the categories and goods and services eligible for Centrepay deductions—that I indicated earlier have been done. This gives a guide to these households and, along with the consumer protection act, is meant—as best it can, in harness with each other and having a symbiotic impact—to in effect guide them.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I will not take the interjection. This guides these families who might not be as fortunate as some in terms of financial literacy to be able to make decisions and, as I have pointed out all the way through, guides them in what they do in making these purchases of things that you and I all fairly well take for granted.


We have also sometimes got the additional situation of the complexity of these agreements, which might involve—along with the lender—a finance institution such as a bank, where these people have to then start to engage in complicated arrangements as to how the periodic payments for these leases or loans may occur. I think we are all familiar with modern banking terms and that there is a cost involved in that, whereas this service provided for Centrelink customers has no cost.


When I talked about no interest loan schemes, we have got areas—like Good Shepherd Microfinance—which I am quite certain Senator Cameron did not mean to catch in this bill but would catch them. We have got areas where even these things are not available. I am instructed that in Normanton, for example, in the far northern part of my state, there is no NILS provider. As a result, an individual in that area who found themselves in these circumstances would have no alternative if it was not for the Centrelink program to be able to, as we have talked about, secure these essentials of life.


During the thin years of 2013-14, the NILS itself—which is, as I have referred to, operated by the Good Shepherd Microfinance—approved 24,378 loans with a total value of $22 million. I want to stay more with the number of loans. Whilst accepting that some people may have taken multiple advantage of the Centrelink program, there are in essence—even allowing for 20 per cent to be duplicate applications—some 20,000 households and 20,000 families who we know already probably in very ordinary or very difficult financial circumstances who have used the scheme to get the necessities of life. Those necessities are quite regulated in terms of what they can do and where they can do it. With that Centrepay for household goods, in just six months from July to September 2014, there were 136,000 customers with a total deduction of some $148 million. Not all of those deductions are for consumer leases, but the comparative volume does tend to indicate a significant demand for household goods—those goods that I referred to as the basics of life.


In closing my contribution, I have recognised Senator Cameron's intent with this legislation. I think we all have great sympathy for any measure that might protect the vulnerable in our society, particularly those who are really disadvantaged—for example, a mother and children in circumstances not necessarily of their making. Every one of us wants to join Senator Cameron in protecting these people so that they are not exploited by unscrupulous lenders of money or those who extend lease and finance arrangements. But because there have been changes which perhaps Senator Cameron was not previously alive to we believe the bill is not necessary. Indeed, limiting people's capacity to do this will just impact on their ability to take on the most basic things in life which we have all become somewhat accustomed to. So I think we should not support the bill. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:01):  I congratulate Senator Cameron on bringing to the parliament a bill that at least heads in the right direction and has a concern and a solution for a problem that abounds. Having said that, I think Senator Cameron, whilst meaning well, has got it wrong again. But let that not withdraw from my acknowledgement that the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 is one of the more sensible contributions that my friend and colleague Senator Cameron has brought to the chamber. It is good that we are having a debate on this.


In reading some of the material about this, it reminded me of when I was a 17-year-old. I had just left school and could not afford to go to university. I started work as an articled clerk on about half the pay an apprentice would get. I studied externally through the University of Queensland at night to get my legal qualifications. I was certainly a poor Australian. Senator Cameron's wish is that his bill be all about harm minimisation for poor Australians. I remember the days when I certainly fitted into that category.


I lived some distance away from my work in the town of Ayr in North Queensland and, somehow, I had to get to work. It was too far to walk. I would rely on friends to give me a lift if they were going in to town at the same time. But because I wanted to be independent I bought myself a Honda 55 motor scooter. I emphasise '55' because it was five cc better than the regular Honda 50 at the time. I bought it on what was then called hire purchase. A lot of the ills that Senator Cameron talks about were, in fact, there in those days of hire purchase. You do not see hire purchase around much these days. I am wondering if it is still relevant. The idea of hire purchase is that you pay a deposit and then pay your purchase off in instalments. In my case, I got the motor scooter. I had to pay some sort of a deposit and then I had to pay it off. As I recall, I used to pay about two pounds—or $4—a month. I had the use of the motor scooter for a couple of years, whilst each month I would go into the hire purchase agency and pay my two pounds to enable me to continue operating the motor scooter.


Whilst I was responsible for maintenance and upkeep, and obviously for fuel and repairs, the actual ownership of the unit, the motor scooter, stayed with the lender all the time. The idea of hire purchase in those days—very similar to the situation that now applies under different bills—was that the lender retained ownership of the goods. At the end of the lease—I think my lease was for three years—the motor scooter effectively went back to the lender because they still had the ownership entitlement to it. But, as with all of those contracts provided at the time, in the goodness of their heart the lender could actually sell you the three-year-old motor scooter for a nominal price. It was very similar to the arrangements that apply in the situation Senator Cameron has highlighted.


As with a lot of the propositions that have been raised in this debate, I remember that the amount I actually ended up paying for the motor scooter was much greater than the purchase price. Adding up all the payments I made over the term of the hire purchase agreement, I paid something like three times the original cost of the motor scooter. But, of course, in those days there was no alternative. I did have the use of the motor scooter from day one and it allowed me to get around. Again, this is very similar to a lot of the situations that are highlighted in Senator Cameron's speech and in other contributions to this debate. Senator Cameron in his introductory speech on this bill said that the government should expedite the broader review of consumer leases that it announced and look at the national credit code and the implications of consumer leases on a broader basis.


On 7 August this year the Hon. Josh Frydenberg MP, the Assistant Treasurer, indicated that the government was establishing a review of the small-amount credit contracts, which I and probably everyone else in this debate have referred to as SACCs, and related provisions of the national Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The establishment of that review fulfilled a statutory requirement under the credit act to examine and report on the effectiveness of the law relating to SACCs that was provided in the credit act. In doing this the government recognised that the small-amount lenders can play an important role in the economy by providing credit to consumers who are excluded from mainstream forms of finance. The government wanted to ensure that the regulatory framework strikes the right balance by protecting vulnerable consumers without imposing any undue regulatory burden on the industry. These small-amount credit contracts are loans of less than $2,000 to the consumer, with a maximum term of 12 months. Since 2013 the credit act has placed specific obligations on small-amount credit contract arrangements and on the providers, including a cap on costs and a rebuttal presumption that a loan is unsuitable when the customer is in default under another small-amount loan.


The government's review also provides an appropriate opportunity to consider the laws that apply to regulated consumer leases. A consumer lease allows a customer to lease an item, such as a fridge—perhaps even a motor scooter!—until the term of the lease finishes, when the item is returned to the lease provider. It is similar to what happened in the case I was relating, about buying a motor scooter all those years ago. Consumer leases regulated under the credit act include those that are for a set period of four months or longer. While the customer base for small-amount loans and regulated consumer leases is similar, many of the regulatory requirements for small-amount credit contracts do not apply to consumer leases. The review announced by Mr Frydenberg will consider whether the provisions that apply to small-amount credit contracts should apply to consumer leases as well. While the customer base for small-amount loans and regulated consumer leases are similar, many of the regulatory requirements of these SACCs do not apply to consumer leases. The review, as I indicated, will consider whether the provisions that apply to small-amount credit contracts should also be extended to consumer leases.


I am pleased that, as Mr Frydenberg announced, the review will be chaired by Ms Danielle Press, the CEO of Equipsuper, who will be joined by panel members Ms Catherine Walter, the deputy chair of Funds Management Victoria, and Mr Stephen Cavanagh, a partner in HWL Ebsworth. The minister announced that the consultation process would involve the panel calling for submissions from interested parties. It will consult widely with stakeholders. The terms of review are quite extensive. I will not go through them all, but they include the review to make recommendations about effectiveness and where necessary to recommend any changes to the requirement to obtain and consider a consumer's bank account statements in certain sections of the credit act. The terms of reference also require the inquiry to look into the rebuttable presumption that a loan is unsuitable if the consumer is in default under another small-amount credit contract or has held two other small-amount credit contracts in the past 90 days in accordance with several provisions of the credit act. The inquiry will also look at the prohibitions on entering into and increasing the credit limit of a loan contract that has a term of 15 days or less with a consumer and on suggesting to consumers or assisting them to do all that is required by certain relevant provisions of the credit act.


The review panel is also required to look into the requirement to display a warning statement about alternatives available on small-amount credit contracts in several relevant provisions of the credit act. Also, the inquiry has to look at the cap on fees on charges, including the maximum of a 20 per cent establishment fee and of a monthly four per cent fee that, again, is referred to in several sections of the act. The inquiry will look at the requirement that consumers who do default under a small amount credit contract must not be charged an amount that exceeds twice the amount of the relevant loan in section 39B of the National Credit Code. 


I cannot equate these things precisely with what happened 50 or more years ago when I bought my first 'vehicle' under a hire-purchase contract, but clearly these sorts of issues have been around for a long time. One often wonders about all this regulatory work that governments do from time to time. I note this National Consumer Credit Protection Act came into play in 2009 in the term of the previous Labor government. At times I think we should pause and think about whether we should be encouraging individual responsibility rather than having governments—big brother—trying to regulate every aspect of our lives to protect us from ourselves. I am not sure that my instance, where I paid, if I remember correctly, three times the amount of my motor scooter back in those days, was something that really needed regulation by government. I was aware of that as a 17-year-old when I went into it, but to me the convenience and use I got from that motor scooter was worth the extra amount that I paid in total, and it allowed me to pay it off by almost affordable payments every month until I completed the contract. 


Whilst there was some legislation and regulation around hire-purchase agreements in those days, one wonders if at times we try, as a parliament, as various governments, just a little bit too hard to save people from themselves. There used to be the old legal principle of caveat emptor—be careful of what of you buy, think about what you buy—but unfortunately in this day and age there has grown up this view that bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra are better able to regulate the lives and responsibilities and obligations of individual Australians than those individual Australians are themselves. 


What we have to strive to do in Australia, and what we do obviously do and have done for many years, is to make sure that every Australian has an education that equips them to be able to properly assess whether they should be taking out a small amount credit contract. Back in my days, you took out a hire-purchase agreement. Ensuring Australians are better informed and the better educated is a better way of addressing these things than having governments and bureaucrats in faraway Canberra trying to regulate what they think is in the best interests of the people of Australia. 


I often make the same point in relation to Indigenous people. I find it offensive that people in this parliament in Canberra and bureaucrats are always trying to pass laws, to do things, to make special rules for Indigenous people. To me that always seems to suggest that we think Indigenous people are simply incapable of making the decisions that other Australians make. I find that very offensive. I have some caution with some of the things even my government does in relation to Indigenous people. I think that the best thing we can do for Indigenous people is to treat them exactly the same as every other Australian, with the same rights and responsibilities and opportunities and benefits that every other Australian gets. But some of the things we do from this building and from Canberra seem to me to be almost designed to ensure that that paternalistic situation continues to apply for Indigenous people, and I for one totally oppose that. I know a lot of Indigenous people, and they are equally as good as, if not better in most cases, than every other Australian. I think they are as well able to control their own lives and look after themselves as every other Australian. Again, I emphasise that education, training, the ability to participate fully in Australian society applies there, as it applies to every other Australians.


Senator Cameron said in his opening speech this was an attempt to help minimise harm to poor Australians. Of course, if we did not have any poor Australians in the country then perhaps Senator Cameron might not have thought it necessary to bring this bill forward. We, as a government, try our very best to make sure all Australians benefit from living in this lucky country. Having said that, and whilst I again acknowledge the good ideas and good principles behind Senator Cameron's introduction of this bill, I think he has got it wrong. The government is already addressing many of the issues that Senator Cameron indicated concerned him. When the reviews that the government has set up and other actions the government has taken come into play, this bill will be unnecessary. For that reason I intend to oppose it and I urge the Senate similarly to oppose the bill.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:21):  I also rise to address the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. I would like to address this in three key ways. Firstly, I want to talk about what Centrepay actually is, which is the mechanism that is being discussed. Secondly, I want to talk about the problem that the bill seeks to address. Thirdly, I want to talk about what the most effective approach is to actually mitigating the risk and the poor consequences and outcomes that Senator Cameron raises. I do this because my background, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, is that of an experimental test pilot, so I have seen many cases where people identify a problem and launch into what they think is a fix. But, if you do not identify what the crux of the problem is, what system needs rectification and what the possible unintended consequences are, you can spend a lot of time and effort but not address the problem you are seeking to fix. So I think it is important that we look at these factors.


What is Centrepay? It is a deduction service that is offered to customers of Centrelink by the Department of Human Services. It is free for recipients of Centrelink payments. It means that people can have payments for things like bills, utilities and other costs deducted from their Centrelink payments to meet those ongoing expenses, and then the residual Centrelink payments are deposited into their accounts. So it helps people to manage their funds, particularly people who, because of their own life circumstances and their ability to manage, or because in some communities there is an expectation that 'what you have is mine and you should share it', find it very hard to maintain control of their own income. Because of those social or familial pressures, Centrepay can be an invaluable tool to them.


Centrepay was used to transfer more than $2.1 billion deductions last financial year, so it is of substantial size in terms of its transactions. It is widely acknowledged as a very valuable service by the sorts of community organisations that get alongside people who are struggling in this area. It is used by around 600,000 people who are in receipt of Centrelink payments, and they represent about nine per cent of the total Centrelink customer base. 


One of the things it does is link businesses who have met the policy and terms of Centrepay with these consumers. It does not operate carte blanche; it has a process whereby businesses have to agree to abide by certain policies and terms, and conditions in some cases, to be linked up and be able to receive those payments. So it is a fairly well-developed system.


The system has been developed over time, particularly in the area of consumer leases. The Department of Human Services has conducted a review of the system to change the way it works and to provide more information to more consumers—and I will get onto that a little bit later—but it has also excluded consumer leases that are not regulated by the National Consumer Protection Act 2009, and that is important. One of the roles of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I chair, is to oversee ASIC, the corporate regulator, and one of the benefits that a regulated scheme brings is that people have to comply with the requirements of, and get approval from, ASIC in terms of how they run their business. For schemes that are not regulated, there is not that same oversight or that same framework to comply with, so this review has already excluded those kinds of businesses from the Centrepay model. 


Importantly, this bill also expands the alternatives to consumer leases, and these are things like low-interest loans or no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-bys. That means that, when people are attracted by one of those lease-to-buy options because they need whitegoods or some service in their house, they know, 'I can buy those goods more cheaply with a low-interest loan or a lay-by plan than through that rental scheme.' There has been a lot of effort put into making those alternatives available and appropriately regulated, and making sure people are aware of them. The changes in the bill to the Consumer Protection Act and to Centrepay are to make more of those alternatives available to people, which then help them to make informed choices about their options when procuring household items they need for day-to-day living in a way that is ethical and fair in terms of the impact on them.


You need to bear in mind, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that many of the people we are speaking about are excluded from normal avenues of credit, whether credit cards or store accounts, because they may be unemployed—and, in some cases, the unemployment is intergenerational. I certainly know from my time as the member for Wakefield in the other place, when I represented some communities in the Peachey Belt area, that there were a lot of long-term unemployed people. The work there of groups such as Anglicare and others who sought to get alongside people and help them with their financial literacy and understanding was critical in helping them to bridge these gaps between what the rest of us take for granted and what is available to them.


The new Centrepay policy and terms categorise goods and services that are eligible deductions and list a number of things that are specifically excluded so that people are only using the system for things that are important. The Centrepay terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods, and I encourage those who have a deep interest in this to go and have a look at the Centrepay policy and terms. 


This is where I think we move from looking at what Centrepay is to looking at mechanisms to bring about change. We have described Centrepay, and it is good. The problem with consumer leases, which is fairly well known—and I applaud Senator Cameron for his concern for people—is that somebody can make rental payments over a number of years for an item that might cost $600, but the amount they end up paying can be around the $1,100, $1,200 or $1,300 mark. Clearly, they pay far more for the item because they do not have the option of getting that up-front capital. It is a well-defined problem. But the mechanism to bring about change is not the act, because, if we exclude even regulated consumer lease options from this system, there are a few things that can happen. One is that the leases that are then made available to people will often not be regulated. So people who are under pressure to have a fridge or a washing machine in the house will still go to companies who have no obligations either through ASIC or, indeed, under the policy and terms of Centrepay to provide additional information to these people about alternative credit sources such as the low-interest loans et cetera or to operate in a fair and ethical manner. People will then be using the residual money they have from their Centrelink entitlement to pay for these items. So we are actually reducing the protections for them if we exclude the regulated consumer leases from Centrepay in this legislation. 


If we were to try and do things in a different way through Centrepay, as opposed to ASIC—and I will come back to ASIC in a minute—then we would look at Centrepay's policy and terms. Under 7.3 in the policy and terms, any company that has an agreement to use the Centrepay system has to comply with the policy and terms and any additional conditions which are placed on it. So, we are talking about a regulated scheme which already has the calming effect of ASIC requirements and then the additional requirements that can be placed on the policies and terms. If we look at section 8.1.b, it says that Centrepay can approve an application to be part of this scheme either in its standard policy and terms or it can approve it with additional conditions. This is one of the options that would be far more precise in achieving the outcome that Senator Cameron is looking for, if we find that the other mechanisms are not having the desired effect—and, as I say, I will come back to those in a minute. The policy and terms and additional conditions could be a mechanism to say, 'If you want to be part of the Centrepay scheme'—and, for companies, that is obviously an attraction, because there is a lower risk profile for them if they are receiving these payments under agreement where Centrepay is an intermediary—'then Centrepay could use additional conditions to set caps on interest or other options.' So there are ways that those sorts of conditions could be used to deliver more protection to the consumer than just by eliminating these kinds of things from the legislation altogether. 


It seems a self-defeating object, to my mind, to say that we are concerned that people are being exploited, therefore, remove these products altogether, as opposed to saying, 'Let's use the system to provide additional protections for people so that what they are asked to sign up to is equitable, fair and ethical for them.' The policy of the Centrepay system itself, under a regulated product, provides the sort of protection that we should be aiming for, as opposed to just excluding it and putting it out in the free market. 


Part of the reason I say that is that the people who are responsible for regulating these products are ASIC. ASIC are responsible for the regulation of consumer leases under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. They undertake a range of research and activities to promote business compliance with the act, and they also provide a number of educational materials for the consumer. When it comes to education, I am very aware, having been the member for Wakefield where I have gone into schools and seen that in the foyer there are no written hand-outs. The schools have given up providing them to parents because they have realised that in some cases some parents cannot actually read. They will not admit it, and they do not get the information. So, for that cohort, no amount of brochures that highlight information is going to protect them. What these schools have done is put information onto an audio—so, it is a video or a power-point presentation with audio. They find that the parents will stand around and have a cup of tea that is provided. The whole object is to provide an environment where you convey information. So there are ways that we can convey information to people. 


Part of ASIC's remit is educating consumers. They have their MoneySmart website and system, where they try to provide financial guidance. What we are seeing is that people like Centrepay are linking through to that information. So, in the increasingly online environment, people are being pointed to the fact sheets that are produced by ASIC around MoneySmart. ASIC have a whole section just on consumer leases, which explains how the leases work and the terms. It highlights the fact that, at the end of a lease, you might actually not own the item, despite the sometimes misleading advertising; you can be responsible if the item is damaged or stolen; and the terms and conditions can be complicated and they may need to seek additional support. They highlight the fact that leasing may not be the best way to buy something, the fact that there is often no cooling-off period and the fact that you may be better off with lay-by or low-interest type schemes. They also help people to working whether they can actually afford these repayments—so there is budget planning. They also point people to things like the no-interest loan scheme, which offers specific purpose loans for things like fridges or washing machines. There is the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Service, who can link people up with providers of these low-interest schemes. So there is a range of information available there. 


By keeping these schemes within the Centrepay system, we can do things under its terms and conditions. For instance, if you as a business want to attract customers and want to have the security of using the Centrepay system then you need to provide them with this information. ASIC provides links to additional explanation, and advocacy and support groups in the community can use that information to help inform consumers. With the regulated schemes, ASIC takes action to make sure that schemes do comply. I am the first to admit—and it is the whole reason we have ASIC—that there are people who do the wrong thing. I look at ASIC's website and see that in February this year ASIC took action against five different companies—Goldhype, the Smart Link Rentals group, Keep Easy rentals, Rent To Keep, the RentEzi appliance rentals and the Wanted Rented group. They are obviously all aimed at getting people into this scheme as an easy and quick way for them to get something. As a result of ASIC's actions, over $230,000 has been refunded to 115 consumers, the majority of whom were in this cohort. They were people on Centrelink benefits who had entered into contracts with these lease providers.


Under the outcome that ASIC has imposed on these businesses, the businesses have agreed to collect only the cost price of the rented goods and to refund any amount that has already been received from the consumer over that amount. They have also agreed to transfer ownership of the goods to the consumer once the cost price has been paid and to stop offering regulated consumer leases. In other words, ASIC has said, 'Your conduct has been so poor that not only are we going to make you fix up the problem with your existing customers but you are no longer going to be offering leases in this space.' So ASIC is fixing the problem with companies like that but, by then saying, 'You cannot offer regulated products,' it means that Centrepay will no longer be offering the product.


So the whole intent of Senator Cameron's bill in this case does not achieve anything, because the system has already worked to exclude those people. People would get more protection by still coming through Centrepay with Centrepay's terms and conditions and regulated schemes than they would by going into a marketplace where people who have been prevented from providing regulated lease options are operating.


In June this year we saw another action by ASIC against a firm called Amazing Rentals. ASIC required that that company stop operating. The area where they had most noncompliance was in Darwin. ASIC said, 'You have to cease operating in Darwin for a minimum of 12 months.' That company had to terminate all the consumer leases that had been entered into at the Darwin store between October 2011 and May 2015. They had to cancel the payment arrangements in relation to those leases and transfer ownership of the goods to the consumers. They had to refund to consumers all credit charges and the difference between the retail and lease costs and they had to pay a total of $10,000 to some of the advocacy agencies that supported people—the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency and the Top End Women's Legal Service, who provided support to consumers in this case. They also had to engage an independent and external compliance expert to conduct an assessment and report to ASIC on Amazing Rentals' policies and procedures to ensure compliance with credit compensation in relation to responsible lending documentation obligations and make any recommendations about required changes.


To come back to my starting point, Centrepay is a useful system. It supports 600,000-odd people, about nine per cent of Centrelink recipients in the country. It has been recognised by ASIC as a useful system. There is a problem with leases that charge people far more than a product is worth, but the answer is not to exclude regulated leases from the Centrepay system, for the simple reason that we want people to be using regulated leases because that allows ASIC to take the kinds of actions I have just outlined that they have taken against six companies this year alone. But also importantly it brings it under the Centrepay system, where there is the policy, the terms and the additional conditions that they can apply, which will provide more protection, not less, to the consumer.


For those reasons, whilst I commend Senator Cameron for his concern for the people involved, I believe that the Centrepay system is worthwhile and that excluding regulated consumer leases is not the best way to provide protection to consumers, and so I will not be supporting the bill.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:41):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today and address some of the measures proposed by Senator Cameron's bill, which is known as the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. I am particularly interested in this bill because it relates to a longstanding concern of mine about financial literacy not just amongst those who are on income management or income support but amongst our community generally.


One of the greatest things we as a nation can do is to ensure that young people develop an understanding of finance and money. That is not because they need to pursue money as their life's goal but because the astute management of money can prevent a great deal of misery and hardship in their lives. If they understand what the impacts of consumer credit and the long-term implications of not paying off your debts can be, it can prevent a lifetime of hardship.


I have been interested in this space for a very long time, particularly the benefits of teaching children about financial literacy. I wrote a little children's book, which I entitled The Money Tree, which was designed for parents to help their children understand money management through a fictional tale. I regret to say that it did not meet with widespread acclaim, but it has been distributed to schools and various other bodies for free at my own expense because I passionately believe that this is something that can change the lives of people forever.


I respect Senator Cameron trying to enact a bill which is designed to prevent people from getting in over their heads and facing financial hardship. The intention of Senator Cameron, I have no doubt, is quite sound and solid. But there are some flaws in this bill. We have to consider what the potential implications could be for those most impacted by this. What might sound intuitively like a really good idea can often have some impacts which need to be given consideration.


If this bill were enacted, it would mean that welfare recipients who are benefiting—and I strongly emphasise the word 'benefiting'—from income management would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, whether they are regulated or unregulated, using their income managed money. Let's think about that for a moment. Those on income management would still be able to get involved in regulated or unregulated leases with their non-income-managed money. They could still do it with cash or various other things. But we have to ask ourselves: when people are going into what are generally longer-term obligations to buy whitegoods or merchandise, which is often very important to their lives and wellbeing, isn't it better for them to be in circumstances where their repayment schedules are managed and are not going to be subject to what I would call the weaknesses of indulgence that we all have? Marketers spend enormous amounts of money trying to part us from our cash, and if we have cash we can be vulnerable to those sorts of marketing overtures. That is fair enough, but not if it is going to leave you short for an ongoing repayment. It is not fair enough then. 


We are talking about people who are welfare recipients, many of whom are doing it tough, many of whom need to purchase things which they cannot initially afford, so they need to go into a finance arrangement. Rather than risk those people losing their asset because they are vulnerable or their cash management skills are probably on par with most of Australia, we are better off providing them with some certainty and surety. That is what I sense. 


This bill does not allow that to happen. As I mentioned, you can go to unregulated or regulated leases, and they can pay for that through their non-income-managed money. The risk here—and I seriously think it is a risk that Senator Cameron has not considered—is that this can cause further financial hardship for people that are already in very difficult circumstances. As I mentioned, for many welfare recipients this sort of surety is the only way that they are going to have a prospect of getting reasonable lease terms or rental arrangements, because there is a certainty that the financier is going to receive the regular payments. It does not mean it is going to be fair; it does not mean it is going to be good. It does not mean any of that, but it does mean that there is access to opportunity for people where otherwise there might not be or there is access to opportunity under terms that are probably much more appropriate and attractive than some of the payday lending terms or other less attractive options that are out there.


It is very clear to me from listening to the previous speaker that the government does want more lower cost options available for people. There are good Samaritans out there, including the Good Shepherd's No Interest Loan Scheme. I have had meetings over the years with members of the National Australia Bank and their social finance organisation, in which they provide no-interest or very-low-interest loans and support other organisations that are doing the same thing. These are very small programs in the scheme of things, but they make a huge difference. I think making a difference in this space is what we are all trying to do to get better outcomes for people and to make sure that government and taxpayers' money is used wisely and to the best effect. I think there is a general consensus that we want to stop predatory lending processes or make them as unattractive as possible, because of the difficulties that they cause. 


I have seen it firsthand. I have been involved in the finance industry for a very long time. I understand how money worries can plague people. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor; if you cannot manage money effectively, you end up in a very dark place. If you start borrowing from some of the less-regulated lenders at some of the extortionate interest rates which are payable, or in some of the unregulated areas, it can cause enormous grief for you and your family because a lot of the less salubrious lenders are linked to very unsavoury characters. I know that firsthand because unfortunately I have had friends and clients who have gone down that path. 


I think the Department of Human Services has to continue to ensure that people have access to goods using the most reasonable means that are available to them. That means giving some certainty to the vendor—the lender or financier in this case. The best possible way to do that is to allow access to income management. It takes it out of the discretionary hands of the recipient and provides that certainty to the vendor. There are a number of other things that we can do that would be positive in this sense, which I would like Senator Cameron to consider, if he wants to put forward another bill. 


In the end, as I have said before, we need to make sure that the government and the taxpayer are getting appropriate value for money. We have to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used as wisely as possible. We also have to acknowledge that the interests of the welfare recipient have to play a significant part in this. It is not enough for us to wash our hands and say, 'You can have this bundle of cash every week'—it is hardly a bundle, I should say—'you can have this taxpayers' funding every week or fortnight and you can spend it on whatever you want.' We know that some people cannot or will not spent it appropriately, and that leads on to greater societal difficulties. It leads on to individual difficulties in health and wellbeing as well. We know that in some instances children are impacted by the choices that their parents make. We need to acknowledge that and we need to put in place measures that will protect the wellbeing of all participants in this process. 


We have seen the success of income management in many areas. I know that in the previous government there were calls from the member for Wakefield for income management to be rolled out in his area—against the will of his government at the time. I remember there were calls from other members of parliament saying: 'No, this is a good idea. This will help alleviate suffering. It will help alleviate hardship. It will make things easier for people to make the necessary decisions for themselves because some decision making is actually being taken out of their hands.' It sounds a bit perverse, but limiting choices, even for a section of expenditure, makes for better choices. If people are compelled to provide for their rent and to provide, for their children, food and those sorts of things before some of the other discretionary items, they can be better off. And that was the intention. It has been hailed, I think, by most sides of the chamber—with some exceptions, I would say.


That is what the Centrepay policy and terms effectively do: they list the categories of goods and services that are eligible for these Centrepay deductions. They also list the categories that are explicitly excluded. But I need to be very clear here: the new Centrepay policy and terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods. And that is why I would suggest that, no matter how well-meaning this bill may be, it is actually not needed, because this bill does not actually exclude consumer leases from Centrepay. As part of the transition to the new Centrepay policy and terms, businesses that are actually approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases, and unregulated consumer leases are being excluded from Centrepay. The businesses are also required to provide positive agreement to comply with the new policy and terms. I will just state that again: businesses approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases, which are being excluded from Centrepay. They are also required to provide positive agreement to comply with the new policy and terms.


We are also obtaining more detailed data on the usage of Centrepay for consumer leases, which was probably an omission because it was not the case previously. That is not in any sense a criticism; it is just one of these things that sometimes slips through the net. That will enable us to monitor much more closely the usage of Centrepay for unregulated consumer leases during the grandfathering period.


I will make a point here on regulation. The Department of Human Services is not a regulatory authority—and I do not think it should be. We have regulatory authorities. We have the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which is the body responsible for the regulation of consumer leases. That is done under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, as I am sure you will recall. It undertakes research and activities to promote compliance with the national credit act.


Of course, ASIC has taken a great deal of action over the years. There are some in this chamber who are quite critical of ASIC for not taking action where it needs to take action and for prioritising the wrong agendas, but it has taken action against a number of consumer lease providers for failure to comply with the requirements of the national credit act, and particularly in regard to the responsible lending obligations.


ASIC is our regulator. It is meant to inquire into these sorts of things. The Department of Human Services should not be the regulatory authority in this space. However, the Department of Human Services should have a very close and ongoing relationship with the regulatory agencies, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. And I understand that it does. I understand that it has a very strong and close working relationship with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and that cooperation has led to some businesses actually being removed from Centrepay. That is government as it should be working: the regulator and the department talk, and they come to determinations that are in the best interests of the taxpayer, the welfare recipient and the consumer credit supplier.


In that respect, I understand that the department recently provided information to assist ASIC with its current research to better understand consumer leasing practices and the impact on welfare customers. This is very important work, to establish the impact of consumer leases.


I want to come back to where I started. Understanding how money works and understanding personal finance—budgeting; your obligations; the implications of accepting credit at particular rates and not paying it off, and what that can do to your financial future, and the long-term effects it can have on your health and wellbeing—is one of the most important things we can ever instil in people in this country. If we could get people to think about the consequences of managing their money and the consequences of managing their health, this country would be immeasurably better off.


For many, I have to say, it is a bit too late. It is very difficult to get people to change their habits much later in life. But our responsibility is to instil in the next generation—in the boys and girls who are at school, some of whom I have seen touring this parliament today—the need to learn about and understand the implications of credit. In advance of that generation finally going into adulthood with that information, we now have to implement measures such as income management to assist people in making the right choices.


Once again, I say to Senator Cameron: this is a well-meaning bill; I understand perfectly what you are trying to do here, and I sense that you understand what I am trying to do as well, Senator Cameron. But there are consequences that the government has considered. I have to say that I stand with the government on this because the consequences of, and the omissions from, this bill mean I cannot support it. That may come as a surprise to you, Senator Cameron, but I am unable to support your bill today in its current form because I think the government has a persuasive case as to some of the implications of it—which I do not think are of benefit to those people who deserve our full support.


I will use the brief time I have left to encourage the government to continue its diligence in examining the implications of changes to consumer credit codes and financial management. I would encourage them even more warmly to invest in the next generation. The two best things they can do for the future of this country are, first, to instil in young people an understanding of how money works and how they can live a lifetime of financial independence by adopting some very simple practices and, second, to encourage them to take better care of their health.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (11:01):  Senator Cameron says he wants to exclude all consumer leases from Centrepay. We in the government believe that his private senator's bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015, will not do that and is flawed. The objective of Centrepay is to assist customers in managing expenses which are consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments and reducing financial risk by providing a facility to have regular deductions made from their welfare payments. The government has already taken action in this area. Following a review and subsequent stakeholder consultation, the Department of Human Services introduced a range of changes to Centrepay to improve its operation and provide greater information to customers. These changes include the exclusion of consumer leases not regulated by the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009—referred to as the National Credit Act— and the expansion of Centrepay to support alternatives to consumer leases such as low-interest loans, no-interest loans, savings plans and lay-by. We argue that it is important to ensure that people who have very limited access to most forms of credit—or to alternatives to consumer leases—are still able to access necessity goods, as we call them, such as refrigerators and washing machines. 


The department works to build strong assurance practices for the consumer leasing industry and to influence its behaviours. Centrepay is currently transitioning to a new contract and assurance framework that will provide more options in responding to poor business behaviour and will provide additional dedicated assurance resources. The new Centrepay policy and terms list the categories of goods and services eligible for Centrepay deductions. The policy and terms also list the categories that are explicitly excluded. Let me be clear: the new Centrepay policy and terms do not rely on social security law to exclude particular goods. This bill is not needed and this bill will not exclude consumer leases from Centrepay. 


As part of the continuing transition to the new Centrepay policy and terms, businesses approved for the household goods categories have been required to specify whether they provide regulated consumer leases or unregulated consumer leases which are being excluded from Centrepay. They are also required to provide positive agreement to compliance with the new policy and terms. We are also obtaining more detailed data on usage of Centrepay for consumer leases, which was not the case previously. Usage of Centrepay for unregulated consumer leases during that grandparenting period—we do not call it 'grandfathering' or even 'grandmothering' anymore; it is now 'grandparenting'—will be monitored closely. 


I turn to the issue of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC. The Department of Human Services is not a regulatory authority, nor should it be. It is a payment authority of the federal government. ASIC are responsible for the regulation of consumer leases under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. They undertake research and activities to promote compliance with the National Credit Act. ASIC has undertaken enforcement action against a number of consumer lease providers for failing to comply with the requirements of the National Credit Act, particularly for failure to comply with the responsible lending obligations in the act. 


The Department of Human Services has a close relationship with the regulatory agencies, including ASIC. This has led to some businesses being removed from Centrepay. So action has been taken. ASIC has been doing its job and the Department of Human Services has been doing its job; they have been working closely together in dealing with businesses that deserve to be removed from Centrepay. I understand the department recently provided information to assist ASIC with its current research aimed at better understanding consumer leasing practices and the impact on welfare customers. That is important work.


We all know there are concerns about the behaviour of some consumer leasing businesses and we are working with ASIC to address that. Some consumers, often welfare recipients, pay far too much for leased goods. It is those providers we need to address. This is something that has recently been acknowledged by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. The department is going about addressing this issue in an informed and planned way, the way any good government would. There is no point rushing in with half-baked measures. That is why, at the minister's request, the Department of Human Services is chairing a working group which is consulting with business and non-government organisations about a requirement for Centrepay-approved businesses to disclose to their customers the effective interest that would apply for any consumer lease product. This will help ensure people make informed choices. 


It is very easy to say those words, but think about what it means in practice. This is about transparency. This is about saying to someone, before they enter into a contract: 'This is the effective interest rate. This is what you will have to pay over that period. You think you are buying this refrigerator for X. However, because you are paying over time'—depending on the terms they may be able to buy the piece of equipment at the end of the term—'the effective cost to you is X times two.' This is the point. This is transparency at work. This is how you get people to make responsible decisions. They can then say: 'Okay, I cannot afford to do this. The interest rate is too high.' That is transparency, which is very important.



At the same time, the Assistant Treasurer, my friend the Hon. Josh Frydenberg MP, has announced an independent review of the small amount credit contract provisions of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. The review has been given terms of reference which include consideration of whether the small amount credit contract provisions should also be applied to consumer leases. The government is closely considering consumer leases and will take further steps as appropriate. When the Assistant Treasurer announced the review on 7 August 2015 he indicated that it fulfils a statutory requirement under the credit act to examine and report on the effectiveness of the law relating to small account credit contracts. He acknowledged there:


The Government recognises that small amount lenders can play an important role in the economy by providing credit to consumers who are excluded from mainstream forms of finance. 




That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about people who do not qualify for most normal forms of finance. This is an issue for the banking system and for the financial service providers as much as it is for society
—
finding a way in which we can help those people who do not have access to other more mainstream forms of finance. Mr Frydenberg announced:



The Government wants to ensure that the regulatory framework strikes the right balance by protecting vulnerable consumers without imposing an undue regulatory burden on industry.


This review will have a consultation process. The panel will call for submissions from interested parties and consult widely with stakeholders and will report by the end of this year. We do not have to wait until the middle of next year for the report of this group—we will have it by the end of the year. That will provide us with the opportunity to consider all of these measures that Senator Cameron has rightly raised in the context of full information including a proper structured review by experienced people of the small amount credit contracts. The review will be chaired by Ms Danielle Press, the CEO of Equipsuper, and will include Ms Catherine Walter, Deputy Chair of Funds Management Victoria, and Mr Stephen Cavanagh, partner at HWL Ebsworth. So this is a blue-ribbon panel that I think will do an excellent job in looking at this matter. 


The government has made it clear that it concedes the point that Senator Cameron has made. Mr Frydenberg conceded that there were issues, and while Senator Cameron was out of the chamber I made the point that we support greater transparency around disclosure of effective interest rates. We need to put consumers in a position to be informed. The other element of this, and it is not covered here, is that we also need to make sure that we are rolling out financial literacy programs to those most vulnerable people. Not everybody may have access to the ASIC website or to some of the programs that the banks and others have rolled out, so it is important for us to supplement what we are doing by having appropriate financial literacy programs.


I want to consider the impact of this bill on income management. If the bill were enacted there would be welfare recipients on income management who would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, regulated or unregulated, using their income managed money. Those on income management would be able to continue to pay for regulated leases using their non-income managed money via Centrepay or unregulated leases via other private payment arrangements. This could place these vulnerable people in financial distress, which is what income management was designed to avoid. Excluding consumer leases from income management has the potential to cause further hardship to already vulnerable people. Some people have existing arrangements to pay consumer leases from income managed funds, and the Department of Human Services would be obliged to end these arrangements. For some people on income management this type of arrangement may be the only option available to them to obtain basic household goods. The government does want more lower cost options available to people, which is why it continues to support the Good Shepherd no-interest loan scheme and why Centrepay is expanding to include low interest loans, savings and layby.


I commend the financial system because over the last few years a number of the banks and others have sought to address issues in this area through mechanisms like no-interest loan schemes. Ironically, these are in part based on the experience in developing countries. In places like Pakistan and Bangladesh, the Grameen Bank provided low- or no-interest loans—very small loans—to people and they found, remarkably, that people were not frittering these loans away. They were either getting basic goods they needed or they were starting small businesses. The repayment rate was very high. If you backed these people, they more than repaid your faith in them by not just repaying the money but often by starting new businesses and getting their lives and their families in order. 


I fully support the rollout of these sorts of alternative loan and payment options for lower income people, but that must go hand in hand with continuing to expand financial literacy and putting the Assistant Treasurer in a position by the end of the year, when we have the fruits of that review, to institute small loans. That will give us the chance to have a comprehensive package around this whole area. It will give us just a bit more time. Senator Cameron just has to wait until the end of the year and we can do things in a more comprehensive package, and this private member's bill and the debate on it will help inform the government's further consideration of options. That is very important, and it is a very useful thing that we have been able to do. It is particularly important that we look at how the government can encourage these alternative loan options that I talked about before. We should do whatever we can to link these options to broader strategies within government; to encourage people who are on the fringes of society—Indigenous groups are a particularly large part of that—into the mainstream by linking what we do in this area with workforce participation and other measures. This is not about being punitive; that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about how we, in a whole-of-government way, can address the sources of disadvantage that people have so that they are in a position where they do not see themselves as passive welfare recipients condemned to a life on the dole or condemned to two or three generations of poverty. The intergenerational transmission of poverty is one of the biggest challenges we face with these groups on the margins of society. It is very important to take a whole-of-government approach to all of this.


In relation to the matters which are being considered in the context of this private member's bill, I think it would be good to have a whole-of-government approach which would take account of what the Assistant Treasurer will be providing to us in the form of a report by the end of this year. That report in part will be informed by work that is being done by ASIC, which released its report into small-amount credit contracts in March. That was focused on compliance. It did not look at policy questions such as whether the existing rules are effective or appropriate. ASIC found that compliance with some regulations was working well, including a requirement to provide a warning about alternative credit options. However, ASIC did find some issues present in the sector, including adequate documentation and record keeping, as I alluded to before. ASIC has put the industry on notice that it needs to improve. Since 2010 its enforcement action has resulted in close to $2 million in refunds to more than 10,000 customers who have been overcharged. The government fully supports ASIC's actions to date in ensuring that all lenders are complying with the law. I look forward to further debate on measures which can strengthen appropriate regulation and compliance in this area.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-09-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:16):  This bill introduced by Senator Cameron reminds me of a saying I quite like: 'Just as an oyster needs a grain of sand to grow a pearl, precious ideas might grow from vigorous argument. So we should probably value irritants in public debate, and welcome challenges to accepted norms.' In what Senator Cameron has done here—clearly he has irritated some in this chamber with this idea, saying that there is another way forward—he has actually dealt with an important issue that is affecting many thousands of Australians every day of every week and that has a profound impact on their financial welfare. In the absence of a better alternative, I have no choice but to support the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015, because what this bill is saying, effectively, is that we need to stop aiding and abetting practices where consumer leases are effectively ripping off some of the most marginal in our community. Senator Cameron's favourite economist, Joseph Stiglitz, in The Price of Inequality talks about these issues: about that entrenched inequality and those traps that people who are vulnerable, who are poor, simply cannot get out of. Senator Sinodinos made a point about the Grameen Bank. Muhummad Yunus won a Nobel Peace Prize for his microloans. What have microloans got to do with peace? If you give people economic security, if you give them economic stability, if you give them jobs and hope, that is one of the best ways to drive away the evil influences of terrorism, extremism and fundamentalism. Poverty is a factor in making people vulnerable to the evil of terrorist influences.


The reason why I support this bill is, I think, contained in a table that Senator Cameron has referred to and that has been provided in very useful briefing material—it comes not from him but from the Consumer Action Law Centre—on the hidden costs of rent-to-own in September 2013. I will give two examples. For a high-definition television with a retail price of $749 to $1,049, the rent-to-own price can be between $3,112 and $3,893. That is between 371 per cent and 415 per cent. For a mid-range stroller—this is what a young family puts their baby in—the retail price is between $100 and $300; the rent-to-own price is between $772 and $1,392—a 464 per cent to 772 per cent mark-up. We need to do something about this. I think that Senator Cameron's bill, being an irritant perhaps to those who think we should just have business as usual, will prompt change. I am not sure whether this bill in its current form will get through both houses of parliament but I can practically guarantee that, as a result of Senator Cameron's very fine work on this, we will see changes in the law that will achieve, if not all of what he wants, a significant amount of what he wants. I still think this bill is the best vehicle forward.


The system of automatic deductions from government payments via Centrepay has been around since 1998. It has been an effective budgeting mechanism whereby the costs of utilities and rent were deducted each fortnight before the balance was paid to the Centrelink client. But since the recent clampdown on unscrupulous payday lending providers there has been a massive expansion in the advertising and take-up of consumer lease agreements. Disturbingly consumer lease providers such as chain stores providing televisions, computers or stereos are approved for deductions from Centrepay. While utility bills account for about one-third of Centrepay deductions for 600,000 Centrelink clients, consumer leases have risen to account for 14 per cent of deductions. But the statistics mask the damage to people's lives brought about by these consumer lease payments, as their meagre government payments get eaten up by high interest payments which can make the price of goods being used more than double their retail price—or in fact seven, almost eight, times the retail price.


I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed by government senators—including Senator Ruston, who is in the chamber—saying that we should not be treating Centrelink clients any differently to other Australians. I agree with Senator Ruston that Centrepay should not be used as a form of mandatory income management. Centrepay is voluntary and will continue to be so—but with a clear purpose. Centrepay was always designed to be an effective way to ensure that essential items like electricity and rent could be paid for by some of the poorest people in our community. This bill should be seen as a prudent measure to safeguard people's social security benefits—funds that should not be flowing in increasing amounts via exorbitant interest payments to consumer lease providers. I note that Centrepay cannot be used for the repayment of credit card debt or any other kind of consumer credit. But these rent-to-pay agreements are a loophole. They are a rort that is occurring. In the same way, I believe, consumer leases should also be excluded. This bill will ensure that it continues to be used for that purpose. That is why I will be supporting it. I commend Senator Cameron for bringing this bill. We need reform sooner rather than later, and this bill is a very good vehicle for that.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:22):  I want to comment on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015 as proposed by Senator Cameron. And I want to record that I am in absolute lock step with Senator Cameron in his motivation behind presenting this bill before this chamber. I sense that the dialogue in the discussion by others is in accord with that. I say that because in this society people who would try to use their influence, their retail capacity, their expertise or their marketing to prey on those who simply cannot afford the type of product or service that these people are trying to peddle are parasites. If legislation needs to be put into place to exclude these people, to expose them, to out them, then I am absolutely in agreement with that. I am, as many in this chamber have been and maybe still are, associated with organisations such as St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, the Salvation Army and other non-government organisations associated with people who are in need, often financial need. I say very strongly that the motivation behind Senator Cameron's bill is to be applauded.


However, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, and as I will in the brief time available to me point out, if by passing Senator Cameron's bill we actually place vulnerable people at greater risk rather than less risk, then Senator Cameron's noble objectives will not have been met. That is the concern I have. We know the objective of Centrepay. It is to assist customers in managing their expenses—expenses that are consistent with the purposes of their welfare payments—to reduce the financial risk to them, to provide them with a facility that will allow regular deductions to be made from their welfare payments that will still leave them with adequate resources to lead a fulfilling life, to look after their families and to look after their own wellbeing.


Whether Senator Cameron's bill has been the catalyst or not I do not know. As Senator Xenophon has just said, if the dialogue that we have in this place today leads to further improvements to make the administration of this process better, then I certainly concur that Senator Cameron's time will have been well spent. But, as has been pointed out, some of the elements within the bill will actually put these worthy people at greater risk rather than less risk. For example, if we exclude under the Centrepay arrangements the consumer lease for goods that are regulated now, what will probably happen is that people will go outside the system, where they will be vulnerable to these people whom I refer to as parasites—people who would prey on those whom they very well know are, for whatever reason, unable to afford what it is they are trying to sell them, often at inflated prices. Those who are on income management may use a cash component, for example, to purchase when they could have used, under a properly structured process, the Centrepay mechanism. If it encourages them to go and purchase unregulated goods, then nobody is better for this process.


Why do people often find themselves in these circumstances? I refer back to the comments of my colleague Senator Fawcett, and that is that we know there are instances in which adults are illiterate. Therefore, giving them written information about the risks or the opportunities associated with either lease or purchase or other means of acquiring products is meaningless, because they simply do not understand them. There are other people who, for whatever reason, may at some time in their past have had the necessary skills to manage their money but for various reasons may not now be in that position. I guess that is where the Centrepay system comes into its own.


What are some of the services that are included under the regulated category? Very briefly, they are accommodation services; education and employment; health; finance, particularly that associated with community group loans; legal and professional services, if they are required, such as court fines; travel and transport; motor vehicle registration, associated with the good conduct of their family and often used to obtain and then arrive for work; utilities; and the council services, such as electricity et cetera. And then there are of course these household goods that are more the subject of the consumer lease exclusion about which Senator Cameron spoke. I also want to talk about household goods lease and rental, which is the subject of our discussion, and provision of food, home care and trade services. What is excluded? Rental or lease payments for goods where the consumer lease is not regulated under the national Consumer Credit Protection Act. And then there are payments made to a broker, an arranger—a person who acts as a middleman, who, I say again, parasitises that process—rather than the provider of the Centrepay-approved good or service. Also excluded are short-term loan repayments to cash lenders, payday lenders and pawn brokers. These are excluded and of course unable to be used.


I want to refer for a moment to the relationship between the department that has oversight and ASIC. As we know, ASIC is the party responsible for the regulation of consumer leases. It falls then to ASIC to ensure the good and proper activity of retailers and others under the regulated process. As has been pointed out, it is ASIC's role to enforce compliance, for example. I am pleased to learn that even this year there have been retail organisations that have been named, shamed and, more importantly, excluded from offering the regulated products which in ASIC's view they have abused. They are excluded for periods of time, which are clearly punitive, and put on notice that if they were to continue that activity they would not be able to offer the regulated goods through this process.


It is my view that Senator Cameron's motivations are quite correct. But if his bill is enacted, it will be welfare recipients on income management who would not be able to pay for any consumer lease obligations, whether regulated or unregulated, using their income-managed funds. There is also the associated risk of them using the cash component to engage in the sorts of activities that Senator Cameron is alerting us to, placing vulnerable people in financial distress—which is exactly what income management was designed to avoid.


We know that there are mechanisms other than leasing. There may be no- or low-interest loans through philanthropic and other organisations. There may be lay-by. There may be the opportunity to obtain a necessary product by alternative means. It was interesting to listen to the comments made by Senator Sinodinos and Senator Xenophon in relation to the excellent work of Muhammad Yunus and others who have followed him in relation to microfinancing. It is worth recording that the bad-debt rate from microfinance loans to deserving people, particularly deserving women, in countries like Pakistan, India and Malaysia, is, as I understand it and in my experience, infinitely lower than in the wider banking system. These loans give these people the opportunity to improve their lot, to start a small business and to work their way out of that cycle of poverty.


I applaud Senator Cameron for his motivation in introducing this bill. I concur with him about the concern he raises about the most vulnerable people, who need to be protected from the activities of those who would undo them. But the measures that have been undertaken by the government and the department, with the involvement of ASIC and ACCC, are the way to go. We do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-09-10,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:32):  I must say that I am still trying to recover from some of the speeches this morning, where those opposite actually praised my motivation. It is a highly unusual approach from those opposite. But when you get the chance, you should take it the way it was meant.


I want to deal with some of the technical issues that have been raised in relation to my private senator's bill, the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Consumer Lease Exclusion) Bill 2015. One of the issues that this debate has clearly demonstrated is that there is no legislative base for Centrepay. Centrepay is regulated by the policy and terms determined by the Department of Human Services, and those policy and terms can be changed by the secretary—obviously in consultation with the minister. Given that a number of coalition senators who participated in the debate raised this issue, I want to place on record now that the opposition would be amenable and supportive of sitting down with the minister and the government to develop a proper legislative base for what is one of the most successful programs for many years. It is a successful program that does good things. What I am concerned about is the misuse of Centrepay by some of the most unscrupulous business people in the country.


I do not think the policy and terms of such a wide-ranging, important program, that is worth $3 billion—that is the amount of money going through this program—and which is accessed by 600,000 citizens, should simply be left to the secretary of the department to determine in consultation with the minister. There has always been a bipartisan approach to Centrepay, and I think that bipartisan approach should continue by sitting down and looking at the legislative base to see how we can protect all citizens who access Centrepay and make sure that the rip-off merchants do not get their claws into people who are doing it tough.


I might be one of the few sitting in the Senate who have used a consumer lease. Many years ago when I was involved in a pretty tough industrial scene in the Hunter Valley and at the electricity commission I had a single income. For one year I earned $8,000. That was my total income for the year. We were in all sorts of strife trying to pay our mortgage and put food on the table for our kids. We were desperate at the time for a fridge, I think it was. A leaflet came through that made it look so easy. I made a mistake: I got the fridge and I paid through the nose for it.


Again, I am one of the few here who has, from time to time, battled to put food on their family's table, because of having a single income, being a blue-collar worker and doing it really tough, so I know from personal experience what this means. At the end of a three-year or four-year lease, you think, 'Why did I do that? Why didn't someone advise me that this was the wrong thing to do? Why did I, in a moment of weakness, get caught up in this web of business process that leaves me much worse off at the end?' I do come to this from some experience. It would probably have been over 30 years ago when I was in that position. I understand that many people would be in that position.


A company, rent4keeps, sets up their pop-up business in the middle of a shopping centre in Penrith, where I still shop, targeting single mums and low-socioeconomic families. Surely the lessons that individuals like myself learnt all those years ago and the lessons that society should have learnt should be put in place and people should not be hunted down by these jackals in their smart suits who tell people on welfare that everything is okay if you pay four or five times the price for a consumer good. We have an obligation to expose that and we have an obligation to deal with it. I looked at this some time ago. Rent4keeps did not target me because I was not in the age demographic that they were looking for. I asked for the leaflet, got the leaflet and looked up their website. On the website I did the calculation for a couple of the goods that they had. One was, I think, a Hisense flat screen, fairly big television. You could pick it up for about 900 bucks. I did the calculation of what it would cost from rent4keeps over four years and it came to $5,700. This is a TV you could get for 900 bucks at Harvey Norman. You could probably get it cheaper if you went online.


There are a number of options for the young people who are getting caught up in this. Even credit cards, which are regulated, would be cheaper than rent4keeps, and we all know about the problems with getting into the credit card cycle of poverty, so that is even worse. We have regulated payday loans and payday lenders, and yet what we are finding now is that a lot of the payday lenders are moving from payday lending to consumer leasing, because consumer leasing is the next way that is unregulated to rip citizens of this country off, and I think the Senate has an obligation to deal with that.


I looked at the rent4keeps website, as I have indicated, and there were plenty of examples of why nobody should ever go near them. They are also letterboxing the Housing Commission areas in Penrith. Their stuff looks pretty flash. They have a happy, smiling family getting all the consumer goods that wealth brings, yet these people are not wealthy. It is not just in areas like Penrith; they are targeting Indigenous communities. We must say, 'Enough is enough.' We must do that. Why are some people doing this? On their website, rent4keeps say, 'Set a franchise up with us. We've got 100 operating franchises around the country'—and, remember, this is one of the minor players. They have 'numerous exciting and profitable ""lifestyle friendly"" franchise opportunities'. I will tell you: it is not lifestyle friendly if you are a citizen they have their claws in. There is no friendly lifestyle for them. They say:


If you enjoy being busy and having a business you can run, that does not run you, then maybe R4K is worth a look.


So they are saying, 'Hey, there's a great business opportunity here. Let's do it.' And they say:


The business model is very profitable


No wonder it is very profitable when they are getting four and sometimes five times the price of the consumer good, paid through some poor citizen who is being screwed by the company. They say:


Is easy to run from home


You have no big overheads like we hear in some of the arguments: 'You have to increase the cost of the consumer good because you've got overheads.' This company is saying, 'That ain't an issue. You can run this from home.' They go on to say:


Affordable initial outlay given the returns


Again, there is the argument: 'If you've got to invest in your business, you've got to get a return.' They are saying it is really affordable and that you could do it easily. Here are the kickers:


Huge customer demand


Very low overheads


Significant franchisor support


So it is all upside for the people who are getting their claws into the poorest people in this country and it is all downside once citizens have rent4keeps and Radio Rentals claws in them. This is a huge issue in my view that has to be dealt with.


Another argument that we have heard is that the government are moving on this issue. The government made an announcement back in May 2015 after this issue was becoming public and Labor had made some comments on it. The government said they would 'restrict the type of consumer leases that consumers can pay for using Centrepay payments.' They went on to say:


... leases that run for an indefinite period, or have a duration of four months or less, will be excluded from Centrepay ...


That did not deal with the fundamental issue that these consumer leases are still readily available under Centrepay. They said that the Department of Human Services would work with Treasury and key stakeholders to review the policy and whether you would disclose the effect of interest rate by Centrepay registered providers. If people in trouble think that Centrepay is available to do this, they will think that there is some government support for this. 


I do not think that we should be giving any impression that we support Radio Rentals, rent4keeps or Rent the Roo. Some of these companies have been before ASIC and have been fined in the Federal Court and are then still part of Centrepay. Why should we be allowing that to happen? If there is one thing that this Senate should be doing it is protecting those that cannot protect themselves. That is what we should be doing.


Minister Payne said that there will be 'links to ASIC's MoneySmart website'. I can imagine the poor person down in the housing commission house will be thinking, 'I'd better go and have a look at the ASIC website to see what they say about this mob that are telling me I should pay four times the amount for the consumer goods.' Funeral insurance would be excluded, which has been a rip-off. Minister Payne also said that there would be:


…increased cooperation between the department and consumer protection regulators.


In my view—and I will not be unkind to Senator Payne—that was the smokescreen the government put up to try to avoid dealing with the fundamental issue that citizens in this country were mercilessly being ripped off, and the government at that stage was not prepared to do anything about it. That is why my bill was put forward, and I am glad to say that it was supported within the caucus of the Labor Party. It is an important way forward. 


Then the kicker really comes in Senator Payne's press release. She says:


While customers may still use Centrepay for regulated consumer leases—


'regulated consumer leases'—there is no regulation on whether they charge you 400 or 500 or 600 per cent, so I do not know where this regulation comes in—


I would encourage people to carefully read the fine print and consider all of their options.


Senator Payne does recognise that there is a big problem here that should be fixed. That problem could easily have been fixed if the minister and the secretary of the department had sat down and changed the policy and terms to exclude the rip-off merchants using Centrepay—Radio Rentals, Rent the Roos, rent4keeps, and I could go on and on. All these people are making masses of profit at the expense of the poorest citizens in our country. 


I say it is important that this bill passes in the Senate. It is important to send the message to the rip-off merchants in our community that this Senate does not support the rip-off of the poorest people in this country, and this bill is the first step. I would call on the government to look at the bill in the House of Representatives and pass the bill in the House of Representatives as well because that will send a clear and unequivocal message to the rip-off merchants in our community that we will not allow them to use a government department to facilitate their rip-offs, because that is what is happening. I have heard the arguments that people should have a choice. This bill does not stop anyone going into rent4keeps or Radio Rentals or Rent the Roo and getting a bank deduction and being ripped off. I say that should be looked at by Mr Frydenberg in the other place to make sure that we put a limit on those rip-offs and we stop these rip-offs, but my view is that we should pass this bill to send a clear message to the rip-off merchants that the game is up.


Radio Rentals run almost half of their consumer lease business through Centrepay. A recent analysis said that Radio Rental's business model was unsustainable because of its rip-off nature. It is a subprime approach to people in this country. When an analysis was done and when Radio Rentals made some comment to the stock exchange about what these Centrepay changes that the government had put in place would mean for them, they said that it would mean nothing to their profits, it would mean nothing for the business model. So the rip-offs continue. With all the arguments that we have heard from those opposite—that the government moved on this, that the government made these changes to stop poor people ripped off—Radio Rentals say that it did not have one effect on them at all. The rip-offs continue. 


We need to be clear about what this bill is about: stopping the rip-offs and making sure that people are treated fairly. This is supported. I convened a round table of welfare groups back in March. At that round table there was overwhelming support to do something about this because the welfare groups—the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family and the various faith-based support groups—are the ones who are picking up the pieces on this. I did an interview this morning on FIVEaa with Leon Byner. He asked people to ring in after I had said we should stop this. Seven people rang in. Six of them gave practical examples of how their families had been left in a terrible position as a result of using consumer leases. Only one came in and said it was okay, and my view was that they were someone from the industry. 


I commend this bill. I ask the Senate to support this bill. It is about protecting the most vulnerable in the community.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be read a second time.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) urgent action is needed to ensure that Australia does not lose its steelmaking capacity, in the wake of the global steel industry crisis, and


(ii) steel-producing nations are responding to the oversupply and dumping of sub-cost steel with a range of strategies that include increasing public procurement, restructuring and emergency safeguards in the form of temporary targeted tariffs; and


(b) calls on the Abbott Government to:


(i) immediately refer matters related to dumped sub-cost steel into Australia to the Anti-Dumping Commission for a preliminary report within three weeks to include an assessment of the possible harm to local industry, and options for action including duties and World Trade Organization emergency safeguards,


(ii) ensure that the Anti-Dumping Commission is suitably resourced to pursue ongoing improvements to Australia's anti-dumping system and reduce harm to local industry resulting from dumped imports,


(iii) work with the steel industry, unions, businesses and communities to minimise the impact on local jobs and living standards, particularly at the Port Kembla site in the Illawarra, from the world-wide over-supply of steel by developing:


   (A) a constructive Steel Industry Plan, including comprehensive policies for improvements in Australian Industry Participation, and


   (B) public procurement frameworks that include whole of life cost methods for assessing and determining procurement contracts,


(iv) prioritise structural adjustment and jobactive assistance to the Illawarra to minimise the impact on local jobs and living standards, 


(v) reinstate the Local Employment Coordinator to assist steelworkers losing their jobs to retrain and gain alternative employment, and


(vi) continue the work of the International Trade Remedies Forum to address the need for ongoing improvements to Australia's anti-dumping system, and any outstanding matters from the previous Government's suite of reforms to streamline Australia's anti-dumping system.

Leave granted. 




Senator FIFIELD:
  The minister for industry convened a meeting in Wollongong on 7 September 2015, which focused on strengthening the economic future of the Illawarra region. Discussions involved all layers of government, along with representatives from the steel industry, unions, tertiary institutions, the wider business community and local members of parliament, including Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Ann Sudmalis. 


Safeguards provisions and the anti-dumping regime are two separate systems and should not be confused. The industry has access to both the anti-dumping regime if there are concerns about dumped imports. And it has the ability to initiate a safeguards investigation, which it has not done, if it believes that a very sudden and major influx of product has occurred and not in response to an ongoing market trend, which in this case reflects a changing steel market and global commodity prices. 


The industry needs a clear plan developed with all affected stakeholders and not knee-jerk reactions. The government will not be supporting this motion. I do also note that a substantial amendment was circulated to this motion about 10 minutes before housekeeping, which I do not think is particularly good practice.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:39):  The Water Amendment Bill 2015 is an important piece of legislation that will have a great impact on my home state of South Australia as well as the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin. A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of joining my colleague the Hon. Bob Baldwin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, when he was in Adelaide announcing the results of the independent stocktake of levels in the Murray-Darling Basin, which confirmed that we were on track to meet our environmental targets. The sustainable diversion limits stocktake showed the projects were on track to deliver the environmental targets that were outlined under the Basin Plan. The report showed that over 500 gigalitres less water is needed to meet the environmental targets in the plan, and that means that the Basin Plan continues to be on track to deliver a triple bottom line outcome. That means that we are not just looking after the environment but, importantly, we are looking after the communities that live and work in the Riverland and looking after the economic impact and benefit that those communities and the agricultural sectors they represent deliver. 


It is important to canvass how did we get to this point. For more than a century Australia has struggled with its management of water. We all know the history. Despite the fact that we have had centenary droughts and we have had floods—everyone knows Dorothea Mackellar's poem—we have not managed water well. Various state governments have over allocated water to push development without due regard either to the environment or, importantly—and I speak as a South Australian—to the states who are downstream and suffer the consequences of inadequate flows. In 2007, when I was in the other place as the member for Wakefield—again representing communities in South Australia—it was fantastic to be part of a government that under the leadership of then Prime Minister Howard and environment minister Malcolm Turnbull put forward the National Plan for Water Security. This was not just a short-term, 'let's get to the next election' type plan. Abraham Lincoln said that a politician has an eye on the next election but a statesman has an eye on the next generation, and this was one of those times when finally Australian politicians, the parliament, came to the point of having a statesman-like plan that said, 'How do we try to fix a system that has been broken for over 100 years and make it work to the benefit of our communities, to the benefit of our environment and to the benefit of our economy in years to come?' 


Under that plan some $10 billion was put forward—they put their money where their mouth was—to revolutionise the way water was managed. There were a couple of key elements. Traditionally, despite the hydrology of how waters run in catchment areas and usage, we had managed water according to lines that people had drawn on maps. Clearly that was foolish. The concept was to have a national authority and an independent expert body behind that. That was, of course, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I pause to note that my good friend the Hon. Neil Andrew, my predecessor in the seat of Wakefield, is currently the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, having himself, before his long career in Australia's parliament, been an irrigator from the Riverland. That group was given the task of setting sustainable limits on the extraction of surface and ground water based on what has become the CSIRO's analysis of environmentally sustainable diversions in each valley. That leads us to that stocktake that I just talked about.



The act expressly requires the authority and the minister to act on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge and socioeconomic analysis and consider the consumptive and other economic uses of basin water resources. We probably all remember the consultations that went on from there. There was a fairly turbulent period when government swapped sides, and Minister Burke had a pretty rough time—I will not say it was his fault; it was just this process of bringing a new system to a century's worth of management. A lot of people objected to what was being put forward and particularly to the simple solution from a bureaucratic perspective, which was to just go and buy water and throw it back at the environment.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:59):  My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to the job losses in our home state of Tasmania of 36 seafarers of the Alexander Spirit, a ship which has since returned to Australia staffed with a foreign crew paid at rates as low as $2 an hour. What is the government doing to prevent the further loss of Australian seafaring jobs to cheaper foreign crews—or does he share the view of the Deputy Prime Minister that Australian shipping job losses are trivial issues?

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:00):  The Deputy Prime Minister never said that about any job loss in this country. The Deputy Prime Minister is a man who is dedicated, along with the rest of the government team, to doing everything possible to grow job opportunities for our fellow Australians. In relation to the Alexander Spirit of which the honourable senator speaks, what she does not tell the Australian people or the Senate is that this ship has come from a foreign port and is delivering into Australia. It is not engaged in coastal trading. That is where Senator Urquhart, along with her friends from the Maritime Union of Australia, seeks to mislead the Australian people.


If any ship has replaced its crew with a foreign crew, and if what Senator Urquhart says is correct, do you know under what law it was done? It was done under the laws that the Labor Party and Greens forced through this place without proper debate and discussion. It is being done under Labor-Green laws. Indeed two of the ships, including the Alexander Spirit, even when it was engaged in coastal trading—




Senator Moore:
  On a point of order, Mr President, the question asked was: 'What is the government doing to prevent the future loss of Australian seafaring jobs?' That was the core question. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question had a second part about the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Moore, which the minister has answered. He has 28 seconds to complete his answer.




Senator ABETZ:
  What we are very concerned about is that, within the coastal shipping laws foisted upon this country by the previous Labor-Green government, there are elements that are prejudicing jobs in the cement industry, in the sugar industry and in all sorts of industries.




Senator Cameron:
  Rubbish! Absolute rubbish!

That stands to reason. But what I would invite them to do is ask a simple question. Why is it that they lost their job? Why was it that, regrettably, the Caltex refining company found it could no longer produce or refine petroleum product in Australia? That is why the Alexander Spirit is no longer engaged in coastal shipping in Australia. It used to cart the refined petroleum product from Brisbane to domestic ports around Australia. The refinery closed—no more production. It is now imported from overseas, from Singapore. As a result, it is no longer coastal shipping; it is foreign shipping bringing imports into Australia—a completely different category. (Time expired)

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


What sort of government is it that actively sets out to destroy Australian jobs? What sort of government would tell an Australian business owner that they might want to consider registering their business interests in a foreign country, sacking their Australian staff and hiring foreign workers at a fraction of the pay? What sort of government puts forward legislation to this place that will kill off a vital industry and, with it, strategic national skills capacity? I will you what sort of government that is: the government of Australia under the reckless leadership of Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Yet again we have seen a government that has savagely and vindictively targeted an important national industry. We saw it with car making. We saw it with renewables. We saw it with science. And now the government has Australian industry in its sights.


The Abbott government's proposed coastal shipping legislation will create the wholesale destruction of the Australian shipping industry through the complete deregulation of our coastal shipping for foreign-flag ships. The loss of vital strategic seafarer jobs is not an unfortunate side-effect of the legislation; it is the very purpose of it. It is not an accidental by-product; it is the very reason for its existence. In fact economic think tank the Australia Institute found that 1,089 Australian seafarer jobs, or 93 per cent of the current work force, will be lost if the Abbott government's coastal shipping legislation proceeds. This is a very serious threat for my home state of Tasmania, which is incredibly reliant on stable, reliable shipping services to link us to the mainland and the rest of the world. Official government modelling outlines the conclusion that this shocking legislation will see four of the six ships serving Bass Strait make a decision to sail under a foreign flag. It notes that if the legislation passes only 35 per cent of the crews on Bass Strait will be fully Australian. The remaining 65 per cent of crews are predicted to be what the government calls 'mixed'. What the government is not so up front about is that there will be only a pathetic token requirement of two senior Australian seafarers in each mixed crew. Worse, these people do not even need to be Australian nationals.


In the same document the government notes the assumption that the two Sprit of Tasmania ships will remain Australian flagged. I was very concerned about this assumption and whether the local flagging of our iconic Tasmanian ships would be protected. So I asked the department at a hearing of the inquiry into the Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 on Monday whether there was anything within the legislation to guarantee that this would be the case. Their answer was very clear: no—there would be no protections. There would be nothing to prevent the government, if this legislation gets through, from registering these Tasmanian icons in another country. The other two regular freight services across Bass Strait are run by Toll and SeaRoad. The government presumes that its legislation will cause these companies to make the decision to foreign flag. Bass Strait shipping operator SeaRoad Holdings put in a submission to the inquiry into this bill, and national marine and terminals manager Dale Emmerton appeared before the committee on Monday night. There Mr Emmerton warned that if the bill proceeds the company may have no choice but to hire foreign workers, creating a massive redundancy liability. On this matter he said:


If you look at a worst-case situation where nobody is operating with Australian crews, then I assume that SeaRoad would be forced to respond to that and seek to lower cost by employing foreign crews. That, in itself, has some enormous impacts that have not been particularly well publicised—that is, what do we do with the 60-odd seafarers we currently employ?


The reality is that under the government's plan for the wholesale deregulation of Australia's coastline to foreign-flag ships the local industry simply will not survive. Australian shippers, sailing under Australian flags with Australian crew being paid Australian wages, will not be able to compete. But this is not just about jobs; this goes to the very core of national security. A nation's maritime capacity is a strategic strength that must be maintained. If Australia loses our maritime and seafarer skill base, we will put ourselves in a very precarious position. The Abbott government needs to cease this reckless course of action and turn its mind to creating Australian jobs and building up our industries. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:07):  I too rise to take note of answers to the questions asked by Labor senators. I would like to follow up on the point that was just raised by Senator Urquhart. I agree countries do need to maintain their maritime capacity, which is why this government is investing heavily in our maritime construction industry and has brought forward the construction of future frigates and the offshore patrol vessel and announced a continuous build of naval ships so that we can actually provide that continuity and capacity in the industry.


I am intrigued by the opposition's comments in this area. Under the current coastal shipping legislation, which is legislation that they created in 2012, we have seen a 63 per cent drop in the carrying capacity of the major Australian coastal trading fleet. So despite the fact that we have seen an increase in the amount of freight that is carried, the number of ships has decreased from around 30 to around 15. There has been a large drop in that capacity under the legislation that the Labor Party brought in, and yet they come in here complaining that something that we are looking to put in place may damage the capacity. Well, that is already happening under the current scheme.


I also notice that some of the statistics that were used throughout the MUA's submission to the Senate committee referred to a $4.25 billion benefit in output and an additional 9,000 jobs under the current system on the assumption that there were 100 ships registered on the Australian international shipping register, and yet not a single ship has been registered on this register under Labor's system. So part of the problem is they are forecasting great things, but the reality is that under the system they put in place it just has not developed that way. And yet, in areas such as naval ship construction this government is investing money, unlike the previous Labor government, into making that a sustainable future.


I would also like to talk briefly about the response to questions from Senator Bullock, where he talked about employment growth. I want to highlight the fact that it is the actions of this government that have created more than 300,000 new jobs at a rate significantly higher than in the same period under Labor. Members opposite have made much of the fact that in recent times we have seen an increase in the unemployment rate. Again, I come back to the fact that statistics can be misleading. ABC journalist Michael Janda—and remember that the ABC are no great fans or advocates for the coalition generally—wrote in an article when those figures were released:


The reason why unemployment jumped despite much better-than-expected jobs growth is that the participation rate soared 0.3 percentage points to 65.1 per cent.


What that means is that the actions taken by the coalition government have created an increased confidence and expectation, certainly nationally. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for my own state of South Australia, where, after 14 years of Labor government, we have the nation's highest unemployment rate because of the conditions there that are not favourable to people interested in creating jobs. Nationally, we are seeing this job creation and we are seeing an increased confidence, and so the measure of that ratio—the number of people in work versus the number of people looking for work—has gone up, yes. But we are also creating more jobs, which is a positive thing. That has come about because we have got rid of things like the carbon tax. Qantas attribute that as one of the reasons they have turned their profits around, because we got rid of the carbon tax. The mining tax has gone. And despite the peddling of fear by the opposition at the behest of the CFMEU, things like the China free trade agreement will mean more jobs for Australians. The protections that are in place for Australian jobs are no different under the chapter 10 provisions to those that existed under Labor. There has been no change, and there will be no change under ChAFTA, to domestic legislation that impacts on when people from overseas can take jobs. The ChAFTA will be good for Australian jobs.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:12):  I rise to take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash, to a question without notice I asked today on allegations of abuse at the Regional Processing Centre at Nauru.


I want to say at the outset that this is a really serious issue. For Minister Dutton to label the inquiry a witch-hunt before it started, for coalition senators to denigrate the excellent work done by the secretariat and the committee as a whole, is not only disappointing it is also deeply concerning. We are not talking about a to-and-fro issue here, we are not talking about political point-scoring; we are talking about human beings, the way they are being treated, their redress to justice and the law. We know that the tiniest republic in the world, Nauru—a place of only 10,000 people, with a GDP of US$112 million—has had this regional processing centre, negotiated and agreed to by both Labor and the Liberals, placed there. We know that the Chief Magistrate had his visa cancelled and left. We know that the Australian Federal Police officer charged with assisting and training the Nauruan police force had his position terminated.


We know that the Chief Magistrate, the Chief Justice and the Australian Federal Police, who were assisting the tiniest republic in the world to upgrade their justice and legal systems and their police force, have all been thrown out, so to speak. We know that it costs $8,000, which is non-refundable, for a journalist to apply for a visa, but there is no guarantee of getting there. We know that all of these things, collectively and combined, create an atmosphere of no transparency.


The allegations that we heard were not simply publicised; they were sent to the respective people concerned for their response to the adverse comment. If there was evidence that rebutted the allegations, it was published together with the allegations. It was a very careful process that involved almost all of the committee resources of the Senate. Advice was taken from all of the people who normally support this excellent committee system. We produced a report which includes some very serious recommendations. To have those decried or denigrated is deeply concerning to me as the chair of the committee and, I believe, anybody who served on that committee.


More importantly, we are talking about Australia. Australia is the best country in the world. We all know that. But we have to be seen to be doing the right thing. We have to show the world that we are doing the right thing. We cannot do that when we have an area where people cannot go and investigate. We cannot do that when we have allegations that the Nauruan police force lacks the forensic capabilities of adjudicating in a rape case and where there are no child protection laws. We cannot have a minister who is capable of looking the other way when human beings are not being afforded the basic principles of human dignity and the same rights that we would expect any Australian to have. We cannot have a minister looking the other way and saying, 'It's all down to the government of Nauru,' because we know from the evidence that the government of Nauru does not have the wherewithal in their justice, prosecutorial and police systems to do the things that need to be done.


There are allegations of people being raped, and they have not been acted on. There are allegations of child assault, and they have not been acted on. There are allegations of reprehensible behaviour by contractors paid for by Australian taxpayers, and no justice has been seen to be delivered there. We cannot have that. We are Australians. These people are entitled to humane protection under the spend of our taxpayers' dollars.


Take even our simplest recommendation—that when they are spending money in Nauru, they should be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. That is what they are supposed to do, and they have not followed that. The most basic principles of transparency and probity have not been followed. It is reprehensible! The minister should enact every one of those recommendations. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:18):  I rise also to take note of answers and, most particularly, to refute some of the comments that Senator Gallacher made in relation to his commentary on Nauru. The inquiry that was established by the opposition and their Green alliance partners was a politically-motivated one. It was done to advance Labor's Left and Green opposition to Operation Sovereign Borders, which has stopped the boats. I know that they do not like that, but the reality is that the boats have been stopped and lives have been saved.




Senator Gallacher:
  It has nothing to do with that!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Senator Gallacher, I spent many years as a government lawyer doing my fair share of immigration work. This area is fraught with complexity. But it is also fraught at times with people making allegations. In this instance, it is clear that the inquiry brought forward little more than a series of vague, untested, unsubstantiated claims, lacking in credibility and amounting to little more than hearsay. Embarrassingly, Labor and the Greens could not even agree on a single set of recommendations for their inquiry, so Senator Hanson-Young from the Greens was forced to write an additional report to perpetuate her failed political claims.


Well before this political inquiry began, the government had carried out an independent review by the former head of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, Mr Moss, into allegations of inappropriate behaviour at the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is implementing the review's 19 recommendations. Over and above the Moss recommendations, the government has established a child protection panel to provide independent advice on child protection in detention and has provided additional Australian Federal Police resources to assist the NPF.


It was the former Green-Labor-alliance government that filled the detention centres with men, women and children after 50,000 people arrived illegally on 800 boats over the six years of Labor government. We hear a lot from those opposite, but the reality is that 1,000 people died at sea. We did stop the boats. Yesterday's announcement in relation to the Syrian humanitarian crisis is a direct, positive dividend of having stopped the boats, because we are now able to make the sort of contribution that we are making for people who are genuine refugees under UNHCR processes and assist them to come to Australia.


Going back to the issues raised by Senator Gallacher: there would be no illegal maritime arrivals in detention today if Labor and the Greens had not opened the borders to people smugglers. Let me take you back to the dismantling of these programs. At that time, I was the shadow parliamentary secretary in the immigration area. I remember vividly Senator Evans dismantling 26 separate programs in the border protection area. What do you think that did to the fabric of a previously organised process? It gave free rein to the people smugglers. It is little wonder that they had a very successful business model, but we ended that business model, because we ended the illegal trafficking of people into Australia. We have stopped the boats, we have stopped the deaths at sea and we have restored integrity to our borders.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:23):  It is great to have the opportunity to take note of answers given. I want to confine my comments to the question I asked around paid parental leave changes that were introduced in the budget. It is appropriate that, two years on from this government being elected, we reflect on some of the language that the Prime Minister used at the time, prior to the election, about keeping commitments. He said he wanted to be known as the Prime Minister who keeps commitments. He said:


I will do what I say we will do.


…   …   …


… we will keep the commitments that we make. All of the commitments that we make will be commitments that are carefully costed and the savings to fund them will ... be well-known well before people go to the polls on Saturday, September the 7th.


What we saw with the Paid Parental Leave scheme was certainly an overpromise in terms of what has been delivered. We saw the changes that were made to the very generous scheme that the Prime Minister went to the election with to one that was more focused and much more in line with the scheme that Labor had introduced which was working so successfully. We then saw some comments in the election campaign by the Prime Minister in the document entitled Our plan. The Prime Minister said:


Australia is one of only two countries where parental leave isn't based on a mother's actual wage. If people receive their actual wage while sick or on holiday, they should ... receive their actual wage while on parental leave. Parental leave is supposed to be a workplace entitlement, not a welfare payment.


We can see how the situation has changed in such a short time. That is what was said before the election and, in this year's budget, what started as a workplace right, a workplace entitlement, all of a sudden turned the same women into welfare cheats. The language was that these women were double-dipping and that their families were double-dipping. Words like 'fraud' were being tossed around and words like 'rort' were being tossed around. In fact, the Prime Minister, in his press conference after handing down their budget, singled out the ACT, of course, because we are a fair target. He said:


For instance, here in the ACT, there are lots of Commonwealth public servants who have quite a generous paid parental leave scheme. Why should there be double-dipping—once, as a public servant and another ... through the social security system?


With that, he attacked hardworking public servants. At the same time as he was doing that, the nodding senator, Senator Seselja, the resident ACT senator, stood behind the Prime Minister, nodding away. Actually, the smile that he usually has on his face did wobble just a little bit as the Prime Minister launched his attack on Canberra public servants, because I think it did pass his brain that his constituents were being openly targeted by the Prime Minister. Nonetheless, there he was, still nodding away and congratulating the Prime Minister on such a wonderful attack on Canberra public servants. Then we saw, in the Senate committee that is now looking into it, the distress that this sort of language has caused women who have previously been unable to access this entitlement. There was the evidence of Sandra Croft, who appeared in a personal capacity to talk about how distressed she was at the language that was being used by the Prime Minister and senior ministers.


We did see one of the first cabinet splits post the budget on this issue, with Senator Sinodinos and Malcolm Turnbull distancing themselves from the poisonous language that was being used as the government went on a rampage attacking the rights and entitlements of women and families who were having a baby. Just two days after the budget was handed down, we saw quite a number of coalition members distancing themselves from that language, but by then the damage was done. Women who had previously had a universal entitlement to top-up payments that supported the employer funded component had been singled out by the leader of this nation as double-dippers, welfare cheats and rorters. The damage was done and it remains today. The language might not be used, but it is there in the budget papers describing the savings—'stopping double-dipping'. It is there for all to see. This impacts on women who are quite rightly trying to access an entitlement. They will remember this the next time they cast their vote. (Time expired)

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:35):  At the request of Senator Siewert, I move:


That parliamentary approval should be required for Australian forces to be deployed to Syria.


You would be aware, I think, that the first bill that I introduced when I came into this place in mid-2008 was to pick up a bill by the former Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett on parliamentary approval for Australian troops to deploy into conflict zones. It was a bill that had been on the Notice Paper in this place in one form or another since the mid-1980s. I acknowledge the work, in particular, of the former Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, who was a long-time advocate for the transfer of what is called, somewhat casually, the 'war power' from the executive to the parliament.


This may sound a little bit dry and anodyne but what it means in principle and practice is this: at the moment there is nothing at all preventing the Prime Minister of Australia, on the advice from a very small handful of individuals, from deploying the Australian Defence Force into a theatre of war on the other side of the world, no matter what the consequences—without thinking through the strategic situation, without thinking through the risk to those on the ground, without thinking through or properly evaluating the risk to the personnel that we would be sending overseas or whether our participation in such a conflict would make matters worse. I am very strongly of the view, as are many other supporters of the proposal for parliamentary approval that that decision should never again rest in the hands of the Prime Minister alone.


I made a deliberate decision not to bring that war power bill back for debate in this chamber. It has been debated and voted on twice. It has been defeated twice by the government, voting in concert with the opposition, because the executive prefers to keep this power to itself. I am very strongly of the view that the bill and many of the arguments for it have been thoroughly misrepresented by its opponents, and I will go into that in a little bit of detail this afternoon.


The principal argument is the lessons of 2003, when Prime Minister John Howard committed Australian forces to the illegal invasion of another country on the other side of the world. That resulted in the unravelling of the security environment in Iraq and other consequences that, in part, we are grappling with today. The vicious insurgency that has emerged and evolved almost in viral form into something that now calls itself a state—and, indeed, as some analysts have pointed out, exhibits some of the characteristics of a state—was born in that cauldron of hideous sectarian violence in Iraq, particular during and immediately after 2006. 


That decision to invade Iraq was based on false pretences. It was not because intelligence services read that situation wrongly, which is what they have been, I think, quite unfairly blamed for doing, but because politicians warped and twisted the defence and intelligence reports that they were being given by entities such as the ONA here in Australia and their counterparts in the United States and the UK, to suit a predetermined political agenda, which was to unseat Saddam Hussein and remake the Middle East in the image of secular Western democracies. Well, hasn't that been a resounding and spectacular success! If we needed more of a profound argument as to why the decision to send Australians into war should be made by the parliament, here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, it is that grotesque miscalculation in 2003. To then turn around and pin the blame on our intelligence services, saying, 'They got it wrong; let's hold an inquiry into how they got it wrong,' really compounds the injustice. 


I decided, however, that this motion today should stand alone, as it represents the principle that the Australian Greens and our allies inside and outside this parliament, picking up where the Australian Democrats left off, have been arguing for years—that this parliament is the proper place for those decisions to be made. 


But I want to make this distinction very clear at the outset: once a decision has been made to deploy Australian forces into a conflict, parliament should not involve itself in tactical or battlefield decisions. That was not the purpose of the bill. I say that because I have no doubt that government and opposition senators will shortly be filing in here and telling us that parliament is not qualified to conduct a war on the other side of the world—and it isn't. Those are strategic and tactical decisions for military commanders in the event that a deployment is considered justified and necessary. However, the decision to participate in a war by choice, which is what this is, is a political decision, and it is my firm view that, before we line up in front of flags and farewell Australian service personnel who may not return or who, if they do, may return broken, we should sign our names to such a decision in this place if we support such a deployment and that we should consider very, very carefully the consequences for not just those that we send overseas but also those who will be subject to that Australian military commitment on the far side of the world.


Here again we see more than a decade later, 12 years later, a Prime Minister, having clearly made up his mind already, unilaterally committing Australian personnel to the Syrian civil war. I heard the comments that Mr Abbott has already made and those of the defence minister this morning, and they were almost unbelievably vague as to the intent of this deployment or its necessity, its purpose, its outcome, its objectives, its legality. 'Vague' barely does it justice. How long will we be there? What are the success criteria? Can you demonstrate in any meaningful way at all—and I genuinely invite a response to this from government senators and senators on the Labor Party side who again have uncritically signed off on this and simply failed to turn up to work—that this will not make things worse? It is the view of not just the Australian Greens that hurling Australian munitions into the Syrian civil war will make things worse. It is also the view of many others in the diplomatic community and in the defence community here and overseas that Australia's involvement would not be that of another foreign combatant merely trying to do our bit to preserve the global order and that it may in fact be precisely the wrong time for another foreign power to intervene militarily in the Syrian civil war. 


On the news wires just before I came down here, there appears to be confirmation that the Russian government, which has long been understood to be providing weapons, training and substantial material support to the Assad regime, now has, in the vernacular, boots on the ground, that Russian forces are in fact engaged against parties that are as yet unknown, and that US Secretary of State John Kerry has talked a number of times to his Russian counterpart expressing extreme concern on the part of the United States government that yet another foreign military party is now engaged in the Syrian civil war. Mr Kerry's comments, in my view, are justified and accurate, in that for any power to take a good look at what the Assad regime has done to its own people since March 2011 and then back it uncritically, as the Putin regime has done, is utterly unconscionable. Yet Mr Kerry's warning could just as equally apply to Australia's government as to the Russian government—that this is not the time for the further escalation of military violence inside Syria; this is the time for demilitarising that benighted country, as locals on the ground are attempting to do. I see Senator Back frowning. I will let you speak for yourself, Senator Back. 


There are indeed the first tentative signs of regional ceasefire zones inside Syria that locals on the ground, secular and otherwise, are attempting to widen into a so-called freeze across certain parts of the country where, for sometimes quite brief but in some instances longer periods of time, fighting ceases, allowing aid agencies or locals to get food and other supplies in to those who have been suffering horrific adversity that most of us in here could not even imagine.


The United States does not have clean hands in this regard either. Analysts have taken the time to look at the state department cables that were released by WikiLeaks, and it is fascinating to look at what the United States administration was doing in 2006. I will quote briefly from Robert Naiman, one of the few analysts who has actually taken the time to go through the WikiLeaks state department cables and analyse what the US government foreign policy was in Syria at the time that President Bush was desperately trying to contain, with a troop surge, the extraordinary sectarian violence that was unleashed across Iraq around 2006. This is what Mr Naiman says: 


This cable suggests that the U.S. goal in December 2006 was to undermine the Syrian government by any available means, and that what mattered was whether U.S. action would help destabilize the government, not what other impacts the action might have. … In public, the U.S. was opposed to ""Islamist extremists"" everywhere, but in private the U.S. saw the ""potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists"" as an ""opportunity"" which the U.S. should take action to try to increase.


There you have it. The consequences of that now unfold. It is not the United States government paying the price; it is the not the Russian authorities paying the price; it is the people of Syria. 


He goes on to say in the WikiLeaks files: 


… in December 2006, the man heading the U.S. Embassy in Syria advocated in a cable to the Secretary of State and the White House that the U.S. government collaborate with Saudi Arabia and Egypt to promote sectarian conflict in Syria between Sunni and Shia as a means of destabilizing the Syrian government.


Further, he says:


U.S. public disgust with the sectarian civil war in Iraq unleashed by the U.S. invasion had just cost Republicans control of Congress in the November 2006 election. The election result immediately produced the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. No one working for the U.S. government on foreign policy at the time could have been unaware of the implications of promoting Sunni-Shia sectarianism.


And now we see that not long afterwards, less than a decade later, Syria itself ripped apart, as Iraq has been, not through an active campaign of bombing and shock and awe and mission accomplished, as we saw unfolding over the skies of Baghdad in 2003, but quietly with weapons, with cash, with support, overt and covert, not just for the moderate democratic forces or the Free Syrian Army, as has been on the record for years, but for quite vicious Islamist subgroups and splinter groups that have now ripped that country apart. 


Australians and others who have watched Syria effectively bleed to death since March 2011, I would propose, bear some foreign policy responsibility, as does the Iranian government, as does the Russian government and as does the Turkish government, who have used this entire horror show as an excuse to simply persecute Kurdish minorities inside and outside of Turkey. Nobody has clean hands, yet it is the people of Syria who have paid the price. 


So are we tilting at windmills to imagine that there is any kind of peaceful solution to what is going on in Syria or, indeed, in Iraq at the moment? My colleague Senator Hanson-Young and some of her colleagues and allies in this parliament, who have put political differences and allegiances aside to argue and advocate in the cause of the asylum seekers and those refugees fleeing—not in their hundreds of thousands but in their millions—from Syria and from Iraq, yesterday heard from the UNHCR's lead in the Middle East and North Africa. One of the things that he told us—as many in this place, staff and journalists who participated in that briefing, will know—is that there is simply no military solution. There is no military endgame in Syria—and recent history surely teaches us that. Rather, we need to be looking towards a peace process. Those were the words that he used. He cannot undertake his mission in protecting those people fleeing from the Syrian civil war, without a peace process. As far as that may seem from the post-apocalyptic scenes that Syrians have experienced and have fled from, as far as that process appears to be from where we are today, it is incumbent upon us in this parliament, whether or not we support the Prime Minister's reckless and counterproductive deployment of the ADF into the skies over Syria, we should surely be doing everything that we can to promote demilitarisation and de-escalation of violence inside Syria. It is something that I believe my colleagues will be drawing out in a little bit more detail, but let us speak for the moment from some of those others who have had long experience in these matters—certainly longer than me. Former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said: 


… trying to drain the Middle East swamps through military action is, we should know by now, more likely than not to be counterproductive.


It is not every day that I quote former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans in here. 


The UN commission of inquiry into the conflict in Syria led by Paulo Pinheiro said:


… a resonant cry for peace and accountability rings out.


…   …   …




… t
he war is 
increasing
ly 
being 
driven by international and regional powers
,
 primarily in accordance with their respective geostrategic interests. 



…   …   …



The competition among regional powers for influence has resulted 
… 
in 
an 
alarming exacerbation of the sectarian dimension
,
 instigated by the intervention of foreign fighters and extremists clerics.



This is what Australia is now implicated in. We could have played a profoundly positive role in the de-escalation of the conflict inside Syria, but instead we send F18s. 


It is my firm view that this action does not make Australians any safer at all, and I think my colleagues will probably take up that thread in their contributions. While the focus, however briefly, of the global community is on the safety of the Syrian people, I think it is worth continuing along these lines of argument: how do we deescalate the conflict? How can everybody in a non-partisan way in this place do our bit diplomatically, globally, with those powers that we do have engagement with—allies like the United States government, allies like Turkey and allies like Saudi Arabia?—as distasteful as many us might find that concept. How do we de-escalate this conflict? 


Many groups and commentators are now turning to de-escalation through local ceasefires as possible measures to address the conflict. These are not theoretical, as I was outlining before. These exist in a small way already on the ground. Most famously advocated by the current UN mediator, Staffan de Mistura, the idea is to spread local and often quite organic grassroots ceasefires until there is a 'freeze' in the conflict across the country and eventually political reconciliation. One brief example: Turkey and Iran have been involved in negotiating a brief, 48-hour ceasefire in Zabadani, a rebel-held town near the Lebanese border that was besieged by Hezbollah for many weeks. It adds to recent signs of new efforts in the region to end the diplomatic deadlock. I think it is quite powerful and important that it is local people on the ground inside Syria who are driving the demilitarisation. Because so many regional powers, including Australia, now have a part in this conflict, diplomatic engagement amongst regional powers is required to make the ceasefire stick.


Steven Simon, the United States National Security Council's senior director for the Middle East and North Africa between May 2011 to January 2013, and Jonathan Stevenson, the NSC's director for political military affairs between November 2011 and May 2013, put it this way:


The most realistic short-term policy goal in Syria is to find ways to limit the areas of the country in direct conflict, with the aim of both containing extremist violence and significantly reducing the number of non-combatant deaths. This goal is not as far-fetched as it sounds, and there is already a basis for pursuing it: through a series of local cease-fires that could, if properly implemented and enforced, provide a path toward stability in several regions of the country, even as conflict continues elsewhere. In particular, clusters of cease-fires around Hama, Horns, and Damascus, and possibly Aleppo, could help end the conflict in a larger region along Syria's principal north-south axis, bringing a degree of normality to daily life in a vital sector of the country.


That is how the UNHCR is able to do its job. That is how it is able to then bring aid back into the country with partners. Australia could play an immensely powerful role in doing that and then deliver aid to the people who need it most. It is aid that we should be dropping into that country, not more munitions.


I look forward to hearing the contributions of other senators in this debate, but I would have thought the proper time for this debate would have been before the deployment, not after. I think it is extraordinary that the Australian Labor Party will say one thing in the House of Representatives and in various interviews on television—'We're pro bombing. We're just going to let the government go ahead with a blank cheque and report to parliament at its leisure and let us know how it's all going.' That was effectively the essence of what Mr Shorten told the country. Then Ms Plibersek in the media last night, quite correctly, expressed in the extreme similar kinds of concerns to what I have expressed this afternoon—that we are inflaming an already volatile situation. Where are the opposition today? Where are they? The proper time for a debate in parliament about the deployment of the ADF into a war zone on the other side of the world was before that deployment, not after it was already underway.


We do not know where this is going. The Abbott government has provided us with no rationale, no exit strategy, no endgame and no success criteria. We do not trust the government's motives. Nor do we trust its competence to carry out any kind of productive military intervention into the Syrian civil war. The solutions lie elsewhere. That is what this parliament needs to be engaged with today and in coming months.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:55):  I rise to speak to the motion of Senator Siewert that parliamentary approval should be required before Australian forces are deployed in Syria. I had the opportunity to listen to Senator Ludlam's contribution on this, as was his right to make, but he moved beyond that particular topic. I was very interested to hear his contribution. Nobody would have any argument at all with the motives expressed by Senator Ludlam—and that is that, in the case of Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region that are in the midst of such turmoil, of course we need to be trying to move towards a circumstance initially at least where there would be protection zones where civilians can be protected, can gather and can be the recipients of aid and where those providing them with that aid themselves can be safe, eventually moving towards a longer term peace in that region. But we are not in that situation yet. What we do in the meantime?


I had the opportunity of being at the United Nations from the period of September to December 2013 when Australia was a member of the Security Council. I had the opportunity to participate in both open and closed meetings of the Security Council. At that time President Obama was doing everything he could with his government to achieve a resolution with the Assad regime other than a military one. I vividly recall an interchange between the Russian Ambassador to the UN and the American Ambassador to the UN. The allegation was made at that time that chemical weapons were being used. President Obama said to his Secretary of State that a line in the sand existed and that, if chemical weapons were used, it would cause a change in the policy of the US in that region, having regard for the fact that there was a strong incentive and desire on the part of all parties to try to reach a peaceful resolution. The American ambassador made the comment that the chemical weapons were being used by the Assad regime. The retort by the other side was, No, no, no. It's not the Assad regime that is using the chemical weapons; it is their opponents.' I will never forget the startlingly obvious comment by the US ambassador when she said, 'Yes, that makes a lot of sense! Those opposed to Assad have broken through the lines of the Assad regime. They have broken into the military storage. They have found the chemical weapons. They have loaded them onto delivery systems. They have fired them. Then they have rushed back to wait to be the recipients of these chemical weapons.' Her derision was so prescient.


I have no difficulty at all with the motives—and I concur with them—expressed by Senator Ludlam. It should always be our objective—and it is the objective of all parties—to find a resolution to this conflict. But subsequent even to the time I spoke of in October 2013 we have had ISIS, or Daesh, active in this region—Iraq and Syria. That has added a totally new and different dimension to this conflict.


If you reflect on the fact that, as I understand it, President Assad is a dentist—it is my understanding that he studied and qualified in the United Kingdom; his wife is British—one would have hoped that a person of that background, with the influence around him, may well have been amenable to some sort of persuasion to find a non-military solution.


I do not know how many in this chamber have had the opportunity to meet with, spend time with and live with Syrian people. I have only had a very limited opportunity of some three or four months, when I hosted a group of agricultural scientists from Syria in 2003. I found these people to be thoroughly decent, highly-qualified, conservative and respectful. I remember showing them agriculture in the Eastern Wheatbelt, at Merredin, and telling them somewhat proudly that agriculture had been practised on this farm for some hundred years. Dr Mohamed Tarabein came up to me—a man who looked a bit like a great big basset hound—and said, 'Dr Chris, agriculture in my country of Syria has been practised in the same area for 2,000 years.' He wanted me to know the depth of their civilisation and culture. They are a proud people, they are a professional people and they do not deserve what is happening to them at this time.


Whilst I acknowledge, recognise and agree with the sentiments of the previous speaker, in terms of our demand and need to protect civilians, to find protection zones and to coalesce them into areas of safety for civilians and aid workers, until such time as we get to that stage I believe that we, as one of the world's leading developed countries, have no option other than to play our part in countering and trying to bring to the table, through military means if need be, those whose are opposed to each other.


I come now to Daesh and ISIS. Having mentioned Assad and his background, and achieving little hope or help in that regard, heaven only can reflect on Daesh, an organisation that would take a Jordanian pilot, put him out in the middle of a square in a cage, in full view of the world community, and set fire to him. Set fire to him! What is the sort of thinking of a group of people who can try to eliminate a whole culture? Who can rape; who can force girls and women into sexual slavery and marriage? Who can behead people? In the recent case of the desecration of ancient sites at Palmyra, an 82-year-old archaeologist, who as I understand it had devoted his life to the protection and preservation of those priceless assets, was not just deported, not just killed mercifully or humanely but beheaded! Let's be under no illusion in this place at this time about what we are dealing with.


Australia is not taking a lead role in this process; it is taking a contributory role. I do not propose in my contribution to address necessarily the question of Australians—those resident in Australia and those with Australian citizenship—who have been or who are still keen to leave our shores to go to fight with this horrible group of people. It is not the subject of Senator Siewert's notice of motion moved by Senator Ludlam. I do want to address myself for a moment to the specific words, but before doing so I acknowledge the comments that Senator Ludlam made about the contribution of the Russians. The Russians have been long and strong both as military advisers to the Syrian regime and as providers of military hardware for many, many years. I am not sure what the significance of the current elevation in communication between the Russians, the Syrians and the west is. I have not got my mind around whether that is significant or whether it is just a recognition of an ongoing process. There is no doubt that Russian advisers, Russian weapons and Russian ordnance have long been associated with the Assad regime, but I do not think at this moment that it is only the Assad regime causing the conflict in that country.


I come now to the question as posed by Senator Siewert, that there should be full parliamentary approval before Australian forces are deployed to Syria. I take issue with that conviction. In our parliamentary system it is the role of the executive to make these decisions, harsh and serious as they are. I consulted with a past active service military officer in forming the comments that I want to make. Before doing so, I will defer to the sentiment expressed by Senator Siewert, and that is to say that in this place and in fora such as Senate estimates there are always opportunities for any senator to raise any questions associated with issues of concern in terms of the background of the decision—in this case, the decision to send our personnel over to Syria or into any war zone. Of course, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know and I know well, the benefit in Senate estimates is that we have not only Senate colleagues but indeed the senior military and departmental people available to us.


It is the case that the decision making, in circumstances such as these, can and must be made by an executive, a small team, who have available to them the information out of Joint Operations Command, for example, out here at Bungendore; the advice available to them from the Chief of the Defence Force, and, in turn, the chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force. We know very well that decision making has a time circumstance associated with it. We know that it is a fluid process in a military zone. We know that the information that is available is often highly confidential, coming from alternative sources—information that must be sieved; information that must be examined and processed by the Chief of the Defence Force and those reporting to him and advising the executive. It is not possible, in the heat and the ongoing activity in a war zone, for such matters to be the subject of full parliamentary approval and debate.




Senator Ludlam:
  But congress does.




Senator McKim:
  It happens all over the world.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order!




Senator BACK:
  Thank you. It is the case, under our system here in Australia, long established, that it is the role of the executive.


I want to make this point: a point related to the safety and security of our personnel—our Australian Defence Force and their support personnel—in war zones. Information that becomes available and must be kept confidential may well, if allowed to be more widely canvassed, explored and debated, have the capacity to put our own personnel at risk.




Senator McKim:
  Rubbish!




Senator BACK:
  It's not rubbish! I had occasion only three weeks ago to spend a few days at RAAF Base Amberley and during that time met personnel from both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadron, and, in the case of No. 1 Squadron, those who had recently returned from the theatre of action in Iraq and also those associated of course with the operations and support of our KC30 refuelling aircraft and our Wedgetail communications aircraft overflying that zone. It was interesting to have a conversation with those officers and other personnel, just in terms of: 'What is Australia's role? What information is made available? And what information do they actually provide? What is the level of safety and security for these personnel?' We discussed that in great detail because, as a member of the defence family, one can only have the highest concern for what may well happen to our personnel should they fall into the hands of the other side. I also spoke to them about what our capacity may be should the requirement be there to extend the involvement, as indeed has now been made by the Prime Minister.


Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know, to date, we have six of our FA18 Hornets and the refuelling aircraft and the communications aircraft; we have support personnel on the ground—although not, obviously, in a combat relationship. In association with the New Zealanders, we are operating in a Building Partner Capacity mission in Taji, north-west of Baghdad. And I know of no circumstance in which it is intended that the activities of that particular group will change over time.


I mentioned the importance of our serving personnel. We have obviously come out of theatres in Iraq and subsequently Afghanistan where indeed our personnel were involved in active combat service. I come back to the point that I made a moment ago: that, for the security and the wellbeing of those personnel, decision making back here in Australia has to be done by senior personnel with access to the best information, timely information, and, indeed, in cooperation with other forces with whom we are working.


It is fair to say that the Obama administration, I believe, has tried the non-military route. I spoke earlier about the issue with chemical weapons, and I guess it is really that that caused them to move in the direction that they have.


It was interesting to hear the Attorney-General today responding to questions associated with the collective self-defence argument. He presented four instances and he made the observation, in answer to the question, I think, from Senator Johnston, that indeed Australia does meet each of those four conditions. And if there are those in this chamber or beyond it who want to challenge the assertions of the Attorney-General, then of course they have the obvious opportunity to do so, both in this place and, shortly, in Senate estimates.


It is also, I think, to the credit of this country that the decision has been made to take these 12,000 extra people from Syria, emphasising that these are permanent resettlements. It is not a short-term asylum circumstance where, should that situation change in their home country, they would be able to return home. It is likely—certainly, with my support—that those who will be targeted for location to Australia would be the women and children and families of persecuted minorities who will be unable to return, regardless of if and when peace and stability return to their country, and they will be made welcome.


This is a generous offer by this country. I am delighted to learn that it has support right around this house. It seems to have support within the wider community and I know that each of the states has put their hand up to say they are behind it. At the end of the day, however, it is not the role of parliament to approve the deployment of personnel; it is the role of the executive acting on competent professional military advice.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-09-10,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:15):  Labor will not be supporting Senator Siewert's motion to require parliamentary approval for the deployment of forces to Syria. I have, as have my predecessors, explained our reasons for this on a number of occasions. The reasons I give today will be consistent with the reasons I have spoken about before. 


I would like to begin by expressing my support for the ADF personnel currently involved in operations throughout the world. They are doing great work and, as always, they are undertaking their tasks with great professionalism.


It is the role of parliament to debate issues of concern and to act as a focal point for discussions which take place in the Australian community. That role is particularly important when we are discussing issues like the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel. As I have said, Labor fully supports the role of parliament as a place of debate. This is why, when Labor announced its support yesterday for the extension of Operation Okra into Syrian airspace, we called on the government to outline to parliament their long-term strategy for the defence of Iraq and to allow for appropriate parliamentary discussion.




Senator Di Natale:
  How is that going?




Senator Ludlam:
  They don't have one!




Senator CONROY:
  I am not going to miss out on drawing attention to the fact that that has not happened. The government has previously given commitments that it would keep parliament updated on national security matters. It has been a while since we have had an update, so I do again call on the government to come into the chamber, outline developments, outline the reasoning and allow a debate to take place in the parliament. I said yesterday that the parliament, the community, the people of Australia all want the government to do the right thing—to come in and have the discussion in both chambers of parliament and allow all political points of view to be expressed. It would be a robust debate. There would be many differing points of view. But this country would be better off if those opposite kept their word—the promise given by the former Minister for Defence in this chamber that they would give regular updates. I again urge the government, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to come in and keep their promise.


This requirement should not, however, be confused with requiring parliamentary approval. The role of the parliament in approving military action is fraught with danger. The government must retain maximum flexibility to respond to threats to Australia's national security quickly and efficiently. Requiring a statement from the government prior to deploying ADF personnel and assets could unnecessarily increase the risk to the deployment. Furthermore, the government of the day has access to classified information which this parliament does not and, given the nature of that information, cannot have. Australia's defence and national security agencies provide information to the government which must remain secret for a whole range of reasons, including the safety and security of our ADF personnel. A requirement for parliamentary approval could also create situations where ADF personnel are deployed to a warlike environment without appropriate legal authority or important legal protections.


In 2010 Adam Bandt introduced a bill on this very issue. It was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The committee report highlighted a number of deficiencies with the operation of the bill in practice, deficiencies which—to this day, five years later—have still not been addressed. The Senate committee found that the 2010 bill 'leaves too many critical questions unanswered' and 'may have unforeseen and unfortunate consequences'. Executive government remains the most appropriate body to exercise civilian control of the Australian Defence Force.


The Greens do themselves a great disservice trying to conflate these two issues. It is appropriate for the parliament to debate government decisions that involve the deployment of ADF personnel, but that should be done in a considered way. I recommend to the Greens that they read the Labor views from that Senate committee. If they have not read them, they should. They contain some excellent contributions from some of my current and former colleagues. We will not support this motion and we urge the Senate to reject it.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-09-10,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:20):  Before I begin on the substance of Australia's involvement in Syria, I will refer directly to Senator Siewert's motion, which talks about the need for parliamentary approval before there is any intervention in Syria. The question is whether we should be having a full, frank and open debate in parliament and whether we should require parliamentary approval before there is any intervention.


I reflect on the time I have spent in this place and on some of the debates we have had. I think about the narrow, partisan debates; I think about the 'matter of public importance' debates that are nothing more than an opportunity for one side of politics to attack the other; and I think about question time and the time wasted with dorothy dixers and non-answers. I think about all that enormous waste of time in this parliament—and then I think how now we have an opportunity to discuss something of huge importance, something that involves risking the lives of Australian men and women in the name of an intervention that might make Australia itself a target. In the words of Clive Williams, adjunct professor at Macquarie University:


In the words of Clive Williams, adjunct professor at Macquarie University:


The more we do militarily in the Middle East against IS and announce it publicly, the more likely it is that its acolytes will try to mount attacks in Australia or against Australians in Muslim countries.


So let us be clear about what is at stake here. What is at stake are the lives of Australian service men and women, and there is the potential to increase the likelihood of all of us in Australia being targets, not to mention the countless civilian deaths that may be sacrificed as a result of Australia's involvement, and yet we are denying the Australian people an opportunity to hear debate in this the Australian parliament. It is remarkable that we would prioritise some of those inconsequential issues that take up our time in this parliament and yet deny parliamentarians elected here to represent the people an opportunity to hear about why it is so critical that we put those lives at risk and why we potentially make Australia a target for terrorists. It is utterly remarkable. Making a decision like this is subject to all sorts of influences. It is always difficult to be clear about the motives of people in this place and I do not for a moment intend to contribute specific motives to anyone, but the mere fact that it is possible that a Prime Minister could use a conflict like this in order to further their own political self-interest—just the fact that it is possible—is reason alone for us to ensure that this is a debate of the parliament and are not a captain's call.


So far we have heard that this is a conflict of questionable legal basis. We understand that in fact it may be possible that what we are witnessing here is an illegal intervention. A number of people have indicated that there is no sound legal basis for our involvement. What we may see is that ultimately Australians who are involved in this conflict are forced before the International Criminal Court to justify their actions. Michael Cornish, the Australian academic and former lecturer in peace at the University of Adelaide, says:


Any Australian intervention in Syria would clearly be illegal under international law. The practical benefits of bombing Syria are limited, if any. 


He then goes on to talk about the moral debate. So we have academics and people who have had experience in international law questioning the mere legality of this conflict. When we look at what we do know about what the government has indicated about its strategy, we realise that we know very little. We do not know about the numbers of people involved or the time that will be involved. We have heard conflicting accounts—we hear two or three years on the one hand, from the defence minister, and we hear a commitment that is open-ended from the Prime Minister—as long as it takes. It is scary because we have heard those words before and we know where they have taken us. We have not had any discussion about the costs of this conflict. We have had no discussion about the alternatives and whether alternatives have been considered. We do not know what success looks like. It has been argued that success looks like an end to the genocide, but what does that mean? What is an end to the genocide? The Prime Minister says that success looks like an end to terrorism being exported overseas. What does that mean? How on earth do we judge whether we have had success when we do not know what success really looks like? There is no exit strategy. There is no strategy overall. It does bring back memories of the debate we had on the intervention in the Iraq War, and it feels very much like we are going into another conflict with no plan and no clear exit strategy, potentially making a bad situation much worse. We only have to look at what other parliaments around the world do. In the UK parliament—a democracy not unlike ours—the Canadian parliament and the French parliament there has been frank and open debate before any commitment has been made to sacrifice service men and women in the name of this sort of conflict.


Let us talk about the substance of what we do know, let us talk about the substance of this military intervention, and let us look at what a number of people who have been contributing to the public debate have said. My colleague Senator Ludlam has said already that former foreign minister Gareth Evans has made it very clear that he believes, in a way that only he could frame it, that 'trying to drain the Middle East swamps through military action is, we should know by now, more likely than not to be counterproductive.' 


So what are the alternatives? We do know that there have been a number of commentators and groups who are turning to the notion of de-escalation through local ceasefires, and we have seen some progress in that area. That progress is moving slowly, but what we are seeing now is that as that occurs and as we move towards a potential freeze the potential for political reconciliation has increased. Only last month Turkey and Iran were involved in negotiating a 48-hour ceasefire in Zabadani, which was a rebel-held a town near the Lebanese border. So the most realistic short-term policy goal in Syria is to find ways to limit the areas of that country that are in direct conflict, with the aim of containing extremist violence and ultimately finding a path towards stability in those regions.


It needs to be reinforced by a number of other measures. We need to ensure that there is international economic assistance. That is absolutely critical. And of course we have to redouble our efforts towards a political solution in Syria. The only way, in the words of one commentator, to wind down the conflict, is through an negotiated settlement involving all the regional powers. And let us not kid ourselves: what is going on here right now is a global power play. This is a proxy war for much bigger actors. We have the Assad regime, which is backed by Russia and Iran. We have them against the Gulf dictatorships. And we have Turkey and Western powers, which have backed myriad rebel groups. It is absolutely critical that we negotiate a settlement between those actors before we contemplate military intervention that is doomed to fail. We need to ensure that we strengthen our multilateral institutions. We need to look at a regional arms embargo to prevent weapons from going into the wrong hands. Why is it that there has been so little focus on penalties for purchasing the illicit oil that funds Islamic State? It is ironic, too, that in these conflicts it is harder to get your hands on food than on guns. We absolutely need to focus on those international borders.


We need to strengthen our international law. It would be wonderful if instead of having a coalition of the willing bearing arms we had a coalition of the willing prepared to rebuild international legal and democratic institutions. It is just so critical. We could do that without adding to civilian casualties, which will be a result of this intervention, further destabilising the Middle East. Let us have a United Nations arms embargo. Let us ensure that military supplies and logistical support for both Damascus and opposition forces are restricted. We have to stop the flow of weapons. There is cause for hope. The nuclear deal in Iran came out of the blue, unexpectedly. It shows that the United States, Russia and the Iranians, despite their conflict, despite the tension, can work together to achieve an outcome if they all believe that it is in their own national interest.


We have to work towards a political resolution within Iraq. One of the great mistakes within Iraq was to ensure the exclusion of the Sunnis from the political structures. An inclusive government means ensuring that all groups within that society are represented. The real question about the strategy of Iraq is not about defeating ISIS. That is an important outcome, but to get there we need to build an Iraqi society and politics that is inclusive of all groups, not just the Shiites but also the Sunnis and Kurds. We absolutely need to do that. We need political reform in that nation. And we have to empower the Sunni community to engage with their government rather than push them away into the arms of IS.


The definition of insanity is going the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The Global Terrorism Index 2014 found that despite all of our efforts, despite the focus on counter-terrorism and on military intervention, the level of global terrorist activity has greatly increased in the last decade. We are making things worse. Now is the time to pause, to reflect and to change tack. We have to ensure that we do not simply respond with more indiscriminate violence, which has the tendency to worsen conflict rather than to ameliorate it. Our responses typically neglect those long-term sustainable solutions that involve and respond to the concerns, priorities, and potential of the conflict-affected population.


I mentioned earlier the flow of arms. One concrete thing we can do is focus on the Turkish border. Turkey, which is a NATO member, has to do more to stop jihadists who cross into Syria. The Turkish border is now known as the jihadist highway. It is the only way to smuggle oil, to smuggle weapons and to smuggle foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria. It is absolutely critical that we use our influence and the influence of our major ally, the US, to ensure that we stem the flow of weapons and fighters across the Turkish border. IS supplies are largely being funded by the sale of captured oil. We need to ensure that we focus on that border. In Kuwait the terrorism financing that has occurred because there are very weak financial controls has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being funded to various Syrian rebel groups, including ISIS. We should be focusing on that and ensuring that we do something about Kuwait's banking system and financial system, because its money changers have long been a huge issue and a major conduit for money to extremist groups. That is absolutely critical.


I will finish by talking about our relationship with our major ally, the US. There are serious questions here about whether we invited this intervention—that is, requested of the US that we become involved. We still do not know that. That is why a frank and open debate is so necessary. Why would we invite our participation in a conflict where we know there are alternatives and where we know the costs are so high?


It does bring into question what the role of an ally is. What is it about the relationship that we have with the US that makes Australians safer and that makes the world a safer place? It does not mean following the US blindly into conflict simply because they ask us to, and it does not mean asking them to be involved in a conflict because potentially it provides some political dividend. There are significant political, financial and military costs associated with that relationship. The role of an ally is to ensure that when you think they are making a mistake you let them know. To be an equal partner in a relationship means attempting to use your power and influence in that relationship to stop people from making mistakes, rather than simply following people blindly into conflicts that have the potential to exacerbate what is an already significant unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. And we do need to recognise that it is time that we played a more constructive role in the world through a more independent, non-aligned foreign policy that puts the national interest and the global interest ahead of the interests of one of our major allies.


There are few things more important than committing men and women to a conflict where they risk their lives and the lives of others. There could be no more important thing to be debating in the nation's parliament than that very question, and that is precisely why this nation sits before the parliament. It is to the great shame of both the government and the opposition that they have prevented this motion from taking effect and not ensuring that this is a debate and a decision that is made by the Australian parliament rather than by a captain's call made by a besieged Prime Minister on the back of limited information, with no plan and no strategy.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-09-10,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:39):  I rise to address this issue in two ways. One is around the principle of whether the parliament or the executive should approve the deployment of our forces. I note that the Democrats, then the Greens, and then the Greens again—and now I think the Greens for the third time—have put bills into this place dealing with this issue. In fact, it has been the subject of a Senate inquiry in the past. The second part I will deal with is the topic of Syria itself and Australia's decision to extend our current operations from the Iraq area of operations across the border into eastern Syria.


I have spoken in this place before in response to the Green's contention that the parliament should be the one which authorises forces to serve outside the territorial limits of Australia. The bill they put up previously proposed that the ADF not be permitted to serve outside the territorial limits of Australia except in accordance with a resolution agreed to by each house of the parliament or in accordance with a number of specific circumstances. They went through a number of those circumstances, but also had some provisions for emergency situations where the Governor-General can proclaim that an emergency exists that may require ADF service.


As I said, that concept has been put forward before on a number of occasions. When the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee examined the bill by the Democrats, when Senator Faulkner was the Minister the Defence, they came up with a number of concerns as to the practicality of that occurring. I would encourage people who have an interest in this matter to read that report. It was a comprehensive report. It had issues such as, for example, the decisions that are made by the executive using classified and sensitive intelligence and the disclosure of that intelligence. They said it:


… may well compromise an operation and the safety of Australian forces or those of their allies.


They go on to say:


On the other hand, the committee contends that if such information were necessarily withheld from the Parliament, then those required under the proposed legislation to make critical decisions about the deployment of forces would not be fully informed—an equally concerning situation for the security of the nation and its forces.


These are two very simple and easy-to-understand concerns with this issue.


I say that as someone who is privileged to serve at the moment on the parliament's Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where we do get access to a range of information from the various security agencies. And as we come into the public inquiries and debates in this place, it is often difficult to convey a sense of why, and the importance of, certain actions without being able to speak freely about that information. That is why the parliament does put in place smaller groups which are cleared to have access to that information, so that they can make a decision—an informed decision—on the behalf of the parliament, who are the representatives of the people of Australia.


We have just seen recently that Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security fulfilling that function quite effectively with the citizenship bill so that we achieve a balance in the legislation between the national security requirement to give agencies the powers they need with the things that characterise Australia as being an open and fair society where individual liberties are respected.


We will step up a scale: it is that same principle that is employed by having the National Security Committee of cabinet. So, the executive are the ones who, under our Constitution, provide the advice to the Governor-General around the passage of legislation. But they also make executive decisions around the deployment of Australian forces. It is for the same reason that that group—the National Security Committee of cabinet—can receive detailed, informed briefings on sensitive and classified information which will give them the context and the understanding of the consequences of action and, equally, the consequences of inaction.


They also understand the costs and benefits, in terms of global outcomes, national outcomes and the expenditure of revenue associated with each of those actions, and many of those things cannot be discussed in a public space. That is why that system, which works well, was set up, and why there is no requirement in the Constitution or the defence legislation for parliamentary involvement in most acts of declaring war or deploying troops. As outlined in a Parliamentary Library paper:


… the power to make war, deploy troops and declare peace – are now part of the executive power of the Commonwealth exercised by the Governor-General on the advice of the Federal Executive Council or responsible ministers. Contemporary practice, however, is that decisions to go to war or deploy troops are matters for the Prime Minister and Cabinet and do not involve the Governor-General or the Federal Executive Council.


Since the establishment of the National Security Committee of cabinet in 1996, this body is the primary body that has access to all the classified information and briefs from departments. They then make the decision on behalf of the government. That is the Australian system.


We have heard in the discussion today and in previous debates claims that the parliaments of peer nations provide this function. Let me turn to a few of our key peers—the Canadians, for example. Under Canadian constitutional law:


The Federal Cabinet can, without parliamentary approval or consultation, commit Canadian forces to action abroad, whether in the form of a specific current operation or possible future contingencies resulting from international treaty obligations. Under the Canadian Constitution [Constitution Act, 1867, sections 15 and 19], command of the armed forces … is vested in the Queen and exercised in her name by the federal Cabinet acting under the leadership of the Prime Minister.


So Canada still has the same executive power that is exercised here in Australia. Let me turn to New Zealand:


The formal right to declare war was clearly part of the Royal Prerogative inherited from Great Britain in 1840 and it remains an acknowledged part of New Zealand law. Defence and wartime prerogatives include the right to declare war and peace, and the deployment and armament of defence forces.


The Royal Prerogative is primarily exercised by the Governor-General on the advice of elected ministers or executive by authority of the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand 1983.


Let us look at the UK, a case which has frequently been quoted recently:


The deployment of troops and the issuing of orders to engage in hostilities are matters of Royal Prerogative, exercisable by Ministers. The Government has liberty of action in this field, and Parliament need not give its approval.


…   …   …


Since 2003 there have been calls for aspects of the Royal Prerogative, including the monarch's war powers, to be codified and subject to parliamentary scrutiny.


A draft bill to modify the UK legislation is before the House of Lords, but it is far narrower than the legislation which has been presented on several occasions in this place. It applies only to decisions by the government to authorise the use of force by UK forces if that is both outside the UK and regulated by the laws of armed conflict. At this stage it is still only a draft before the House of Lords. The decision of Prime Minister Cameron to seek in-principle support from the House of Commons in 2013 was a decision he made and accepted. But he used his discretion to do that. The UK government is not bound to do that by their law.


In the United States the constitution, under article I, section 8, clause 11:


… grants to Congress the power to declare war, to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain a navy.


While the President is made the commander-in-chief of the armed forces under article II, section 2, clause 1, the specific power to deploy US armed forces is covered by the War Powers Resolution 1973, also known as the War Powers Act. That resolution imposes on the President the following:


The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances …


Well, like in a lot of areas of politics, these things are not necessarily agreed. 'Every possible instance' and 'consult' are not defined by the resolution and have been interpreted in different ways at different times by different parties. Notably, the term 'consult' does not equate to the approval of Congress, a matter that is being put before the Senate today. Many US presidents have claimed that the war powers resolution is an unconstitutional infringement on their authority as commander-in-chief and have refused to be bound by it. The US courts, likewise, have been reluctant to accept jurisdiction in matters seeking to enforce the resolution, asserting that it is a political rather than a judicial matter. In one case in 2003, a judge of the District Court:


… rejected the contention that the president must have congressional authority to order American forces into combat by saying 'Case law makes clear that the Congress does not have the exclusive right to determine whether or not the United States engages in war'.


It is fairly clear that Australia has a system that is not unlike most of our peers—Canada, the UK, the US and New Zealand—whereby the executive, for very practical reasons, has the authority to make informed and timely decisions.


I come now to the topic of Syria. The discussion that has occurred in the last few days in terms of Australia's commitment to extend our air operations into Syria would almost have you believe that we had decided to redeploy the AIF and invade the Middle East. In practical terms, as the CDF mentioned during the media conference the other day, the difference this extension makes is that the sorties that go into Iraq will either divert about 10 degrees left of track, or go 50 or 100 miles further north of their current area of operation.


If you look at the map, you will see that the eastern part of Syria comes across the northern part of Iraq. The practicalities on the ground are that Daesh know that our rules of engagement are tight because we have a policy of not inflicting civilian casualties. They know that they can avoid the containing airpower of the Allies in two ways. The first way is by embedding their fighters amongst civilians. We have seen that before, in Gaza, and its horrific consequences for civilians. People commit horrific war crimes by doing that.


They also know that, under the current rules of engagement, if they withdraw across the border—and, bear in mind, we are talking about a desert where, in practical terms, the border does not exist—like crossing the chamber here, a certain number of participants in the allied action cannot prosecute action against them. This means that, if you are notified of a target and, by the time you get your asset in place, that target has driven 100 yards further on, you cannot legally attack it. This means that we no longer give people who have been wreaking havoc in Iraq the option of seeking refuge by driving 200 yards across the border. It is not a significant force going to invade Syria. We are talking about a very pragmatic extension of the area of operations to avoid the situation where forces who have been either conducting combat operations or providing logistics support within Iraq can seek refuge by just crossing the border, waiting for the aircraft to leave and coming back and do it all again. I do not see that that can be criticised in any way in that it is a very common sense extension of the rules of engagement of our forces there so that they can effectively reduce, or hopefully destroy, the military capability of Daesh.


The fact that we are doing this is legal—that was covered off today by the Attorney-General—under the principles of collective self-defence and the four requirements that are laid out under international law. All four of those requirements are met in this case. So it is legal, it is practical, in terms of avoiding people seeking refuge, and it does not expose our forces to any greater danger in that kind of operation just into eastern Syria than their current operations do. Obviously, if they were to go deep into Syria where Assad's forces are and where Russian forces are potentially moving in, that would be a different scenario, but that is not what is being proposed. It is important that people realise the limitation that has been placed on the area of operation that is being considered, or has been decided on, in this case.


The last part I want to talk about is principle. Senator Di Natale might be surprised by this, but I agree with him: the long-term solution is not just about Daesh; it is about all the forces that are acting in that region: the Assad forces, the regime, the Sunni majority, the plethora of opposition groups, the external actors who are taking part in that. But no amount of talk here and no amount of goodwill here is necessarily going to bring those parties to the table immediately. Hopefully it will happen one day—probably with the exception of Daesh, who I do not believe are actually inclined to negotiate with anyone—but it does not happen overnight.


The Greens mentioned the treaty with Iran and said it occurred out of the blue. It was hardly out of the blue. A lot of nations worked at that for a long period of time, with many extensions before that finally occurred. The question practically is: if we strive for that goal—and I do not see that we are militarily going to be able to impose a solution to a problem that has been inherent in this part of the world for centuries—it is going to take a period of time. Just as we look back at situations like Rwanda and the genocide that occurred there, there is collective guilt in the United Nations—recognised by Mr Ban when he spoke at the 20th anniversary—that the UN could have and should have done more to prevent that genocide. We cannot wait for a month, a year or five years. How long will it take before those parties to come together if they have had these tensions for centuries? Therefore, just as we look back and say, 'Why didn't we do more in Rwanda?' we are saying here that, as a minimum, we will not give Daesh the freedom to roam at will and form into large groups to conduct major military operations. Clearly, they are still there and they are still active. They embed themselves with the civilian population. But we have managed to degrade their capabilities and, particularly, degrade their ability to form large military-like organisations to use indirect firepower indiscriminately by application of air power. Every time we have seen a recognisable target, we have been able to interdict and destroy that target.


The mission here is about saying, 'What can we do at reasonable risk to degrade Daesh while the very things that Senator Di Natale talked about are occurring? How do we stop the flow of oil and arms across the Turkish border? How do we stop the recruitment of foreign fighters?' The Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security visited the US, the UK and France in dealing with this whole topic. That visit highlighted that one of the key things that attracts Australians, Americans and Europeans of the Muslim faith to go over there to fight is the very existence of the Islamic State. It is seen as fulfilling a destiny.


Ways to degrade Daesh include stopping oil and stopping the flow of arms, but also one must stop the flow of fighters. Clearly, the more we can degrade their military capability and degrade their presence on the ground the more we create an environment where perhaps the other parties can negotiate for peace. But it is important to understand that the context of the motion that has been put forward by the Greens is that, for very good reason, it is the executive and not the parliament—not only here but in the countries of our allies—who make these decisions. The decision to go into Syria is not a huge step from where we have been and it is occurring for very good and practical reasons. Our whole presence there is not just mindlessly lobbing bombs; it is to say, 'What reasonable steps can we take to prevent genocide and the freedom of action of a particularly nasty force which this world will be well served to see the back of?' I will not be supporting this motion.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Syria</title>,MOTIONS,17,1,speech
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-09-10,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:59):  It is a very timely debate that we are having in this house today. I rise to strongly support the motion that, prior to any decision to send Australia into foreign conflict or war, this parliament should be placed in a position to endorse that decision and have veto over any decision. We are having this debate today in the context of an announcement very recently by the Prime Minister that Australia would, through aerial bombing, engage in the Syrian conflict. What was lacking from the Prime Minister's announcement was any strategic objective and any exit strategy. In fact, it is entirely accurate to say that the Prime Minister has no plan and no idea of what he actually intends to achieve through this armed intervention.


In Australia's Westminster system the authority of executive government flows from the parliament, not the other way around. To put that another way, it is the parliament that is sovereign over government in this country. You cannot form a government unless you have the numbers to do so in the House of Representatives. If you acknowledge the simple fact that parliament is sovereign over government, you then have to ask yourself: isn't it reasonable that the biggest and most important decisions that are made in this country are ultimately made by the parliament? It is this parliament which decides who forms government and it is this parliament which should decide whether Australia goes to war.


The current situation in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East is highly complex and has a range of contributing factors. No-one here is denying that. We have a brutal regime in terms of the Assad regime but we also have long-term causal factors including a lengthy drought which displaced many hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern Mediterranean area. As I mentioned in my inaugural speech we also have findings from the US National Academy of Sciences which conclude that long-term climate influences have played a causal role in the Syrian conflict. When you have complex causal factors that have led to civil war, rampant human rights abuses and large-scale civil dislocation there is a strong argument for a robust, comprehensive process to determine whether this country should involve itself in that region militarily.


There have been a number of arguments raised in rebuttal of the Greens' position today. I want to rebut those rebuttals because, frankly, many of them do not take into account the realities of the situation. Firstly, we often hear the argument that decisions to go to war or enter into armed conflict need to be made quickly. The desirability of speed in these contexts is often vastly overrated. In fact, when the decisions are around entering into armed conflict or going into war the Greens would prefer that a correct decision were made rather than a fast decision. We would prioritise a correct decision over a quick one.


It is undoubtedly true that there are doubts over the legalities of this decision by the Prime Minister. The Greens absolutely agree with Paul Barratt, a former secretary of the Department of Defence, who recently said that the parliament should require an opinion from the Solicitor-General to be tabled in this place to reassure members of both houses of this parliament that the action being taken is actually legal.


As our leader, Richard Di Natale, said in his contribution to this debate, the simple fact that a decision to go to war, to commit Australian armed forces to war, can be made in the Prime Minister's political self-interest is enough of an argument to require that that decision come before the parliament. Frankly, it is an outrageous scenario that in this country someone who has the good fortune to be made Prime Minister can in his own political self-interest, or that of his political party, decide to commit Australia to war. It is something that we need to address.


I also want to rebut the accusation we heard from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Abetz, during question time this afternoon that, somehow, a questioning of the decision making mechanism in this context is somehow an attack on the men and women who serve in the Australian Defence Force. That argument is the last refuge of the weak. It is the last refuge of the political scoundrel. It goes to show how absolutely unable Senator Abetz was, this morning, to make a rebuttal to the Greens suggestion. This is in no way a reflection on the capacity of the men and women of the ADF. In fact it is a reflection of the Greens respect for the men and women of the ADF because, when you make a decision to commit Australia to war, you are making a decision to place the men and women of the ADF in an extremely dangerous position. We owe it to them and we owe it to their families to ensure that we have a robust decision-making process before we make a decision to commit them to danger. The Greens have an absolute respect for what the men and women of the ADF do. We just want to make sure that they are not unnecessarily committed to war and conflict that places them in more danger than they otherwise would be.


Senator Conroy, in his contribution, said that he wanted the government to explain to this parliament what its plan is and what its exit strategy is. We agree with Senator Conroy that that should occur. There are two major problems of course with that. Firstly, the government does not have a plan or an exit strategy in relation to Syria but, secondly, what Senator Conroy is calling for is an after-the-fact process not a before-the-fact process. That is where the Greens very strongly differ from the position of the ALP in relation to this matter. We strongly believe that before any decision is made and as part of that decision-making process the parliament needs to have a capacity to determine whether or not Australia should enter armed conflicts or war.


Ultimately a parliamentary debate and decision would enhance, significantly, the legitimacy of any deployments or war that Australia entered into. That is very important. Because we are the representatives of the people in this place I would hope that all members of this chamber would want a majority of the Australian people to back any decision to deploy into conflict or war overseas. Parliamentary approval would give legitimacy to a decision and it would remove the capacity of people to allege that a decision to go into a war or into an armed conflict was made out of political self-interest or political expediency.


There are many matters that come before this parliament. There are matters that many would think of as relatively trivial and there are matters which are of the absolute highest import. The decisions that we are talking about today fall clearly into that latter category. They are amongst the most serious and significant decisions that can be made. They are decisions that can expose, not only members of the ADF, but ultimately in the long term every Australian citizen to more danger. Because these decisions can expose every Australian citizen to more danger they ought to be made in the parliament which ultimately is accountable to the people through the ballot box.


The Greens have said consistently that we have extreme concerns over the decision the Prime Minister has made to commit us in Syria. We believe he has absolutely no plan. We believe he has absolutely no strategic objective. We believe he has absolutely no exit strategy. We basically believe the Prime Minister does not know what he is doing. I have to say that it strikes me that the Prime Minister has made this decision primarily so that he could be seen to be doing something even though he has no plan, no strategic objective and no exit strategy.


Ultimately we need to start talking seriously about peace in that region. We need to start getting people together, sitting down and talking about how we are going to remove or mitigate some of the causal issues that have led to this conflict. As I said at the start of my contribution, this is an extremely complex scenario. There are a range of causal factors here. Ultimately, if you are not sitting down and talking about peace, then you are not going to achieve peace. When people pick up guns and get into planes to drop bombs, that is a step away from the peace that every human has a fundamental right to and that every human hopes for.


It is very easy for us to sit in this place, but we need to put ourselves in the shoes of the men, the women and the children who are, right now, cowering in their houses, who are, right now, afraid to go outside and who are, right now, wondering what their long-term future is. We all need to put ourselves into the shoes of those people and ask ourselves: is an Australian intervention in an armed conflict with no strategic objective, no plan and no exit strategy the right way to go here? When you make these big decisions, you need to ensure you have adequate checks and balances. That is a fundamental principle of any democracy. In the Greens' view, leaving a decision like this in the hands of a Prime Minister does not provide the necessary checks and balances.


A further rebuttal that has been made today is around the confidentiality of sources of information and the difficulty in placing it before parliament. They seem to manage that all right in the congress in the United States. They seem to manage that okay in the United Kingdom, where matters similar to this have in fact been brought before the parliament. I would say that information that supports any argument that Australia should go to war or should enter into an armed conflict absolutely ought to be able to be provided to parliament. Maybe it needs to be de-identified in some way to protect sources or to protect people who are operating on behalf of Australia, but we believe that it can be done and that that argument also has little or no merit.


Ultimately and fundamentally, this is about whether or not you believe that parliament is sovereign over government or the other way around. Clearly, parliament is sovereign in this country. So I am very proud to support the motion before the Senate. It is worth pointing out, in the context of Syria, that we are now being committed by Mr Abbott to enter into a conflict which ultimately risks making the situation worse. It is worth remembering that it certainly will put men and women serving in the ADF at greater danger than they otherwise would have been. For those reasons and the other reasons that the Greens have articulated today, we absolutely need in this country a process such as that exists in the United States and many other countries, where the parliaments get an opportunity to debate and determine whether their countries should enter into war and armed conflict.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (17:17):  I too rise to speak on this motion. Twelve months ago, I rose in this place to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2014, and, 12 months later, I am here to speak on the same issue again. Twelve months after this place first addressed this issue, our Constitution has not changed but Australia is facing an increased and heightened challenge posed by stateless enemies—by Daesh. It is not just the people of Australia who face this grave threat; it is also the millions of Syrians and Iraqis who have been displaced and who now need protection from Daesh.


There is no greater responsibility for any elected national government than to keep the nation safe and secure and in making the decision to utilise military personnel in a wide range of roles, both domestically and overseas. Under our Constitution, the decision to deploy troops is clearly the responsibility of the executive, which is elected by the Australian voters and accountable to them through the parliament. Additionally, our military forces are accountable to the executive and to the Crown, not to the parliament. I believe it is not within the spirit of our Constitution, and it certainly was not the intent of our founding fathers, after many decades of very considered debate, that executive government would ever consider abrogating its responsibility for the serious decision to deploy Australian defence forces in harm's way. Ultimately, in our Constitution and in our country today—in our parliamentary democracy—that is what our executive has been charged with.


Personally, I willingly, and certainly knowingly, have served under both Labor and coalition governments in uniform. Throughout my nearly 30 years in uniform, I always understood and accepted that the government of the day, regardless of its party affiliations, was responsible for making decisions that impacted on not only my service but also the men and women I served with. I knew that would possibly impact on my life itself. While I was never deployed, I always knew that I could be—in fact, I still could be. I had absolutely every confidence, again, regardless of who was in government, that the executive would take the right decision and that it would take into consideration everything that needed to be before it made that decision.


I firmly believe that the Commonwealth Constitution is the birth certificate of our nation. It has operated very successfully for over 100 years and it does provide for the separation of power in Australia between the Commonwealth and the states and between the arms of our government. Chapter I of the Constitution sets out the powers of the Australian parliament and chapter II addresses the executive government. Section 51(vi) of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth the power to make laws with respect to:


… naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth;


In addition, as far as I can see there is no requirement in our Constitution or in any of our defence legislation for parliamentary decisions in most, if not all, aspects of declaring war and the engagement and deployment of our troops. Indeed, former royal prerogatives, including the power to make war, deploy troops and declare peace, are now part of the executive power of the Commonwealth, exercised by the Governor-General on the advice of the Federal Executive Council or the responsible ministers. Contemporary practice is that decisions to go to war or deploy troops are matters for the Prime Minister and for cabinet and do not directly involve in the decision-making process the Governor-General or the Executive Council.


Since the establishment of the National Security Committee of Cabinet in 1996 by John Howard and his government, this body has proven to be the most influential and the most knowledgeable in considering any Australian government decision to commit the Australian Defence Force personnel to the domestic operations or overseas deployments. I see absolutely nothing in the Commonwealth Constitution or, as I said, in defence legislation that requires the executive to engage in a debate or a vote in parliament before committing military force. In fact, parliamentary committees have previously found quite the opposite. For example, in 2010 the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee published a report on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2014. That Senate report highlighted several very significant concerns with potential parliamentary involvement in decisions on the deployment of ADF personnel overseas.


There are three main concerns that greatly troubled me with this proposal and the committee highlighted very genuine concerns about the disclosure of sensitive or classified information. They also raised concerns with the lack of responsiveness and a lack of ability of the parliament to respond quickly, particularly when confronted with the dynamic battle spaces that we have these days and how things need decisions very quickly. They also identified that there was a lack of clarity around when the bill would apply and when these circumstances could be evoked.


That was in 2014 and I do not thing anything has changed since then. In fact, I think the folly of this bill has actually been played out in many, many government decisions now dealing with Daesh and the consequences of their heinous behaviour. In fact, in the current security environment, the need for executive power over the use of military force is, as I said, more necessary than ever and the National Security Committee of Cabinet has proved to be a very effective and very adept organisation of this executive in making these decisions under both governments—this government and the previous government.


Threats can no longer be easily characterised. Even less than 50 years ago, it was still much easier to determine who a likely enemy might be. The armies of states dominated our security environment. But in the early period of the 21st century that we now find ourselves in, this is absolutely not the case. Stateless enemies and terrorists using asymmetric tactics are an ever increasing threat, as we are seeing daily in the Middle East and also now on our own shores. These threats demand the capacity to respond quickly and flexibly and routinely require operational security without the operational knowledge being out there in the general community and available to our enemies. All three of these criteria would be all but impossible to meet if the executive was required to gain the approval of parliament every time it were to commit, change or adapt the utilisation of our military forces.


When you start to unpack and explore the practical implementation of this proposal, there are many credible scenarios relating to why it is not appropriate to require a parliamentary vote to commit our forces overseas. One simple, but very powerful, example of this is to consider the situation of a prorogued parliament. If this legislation were to be in effect, it would be impossible to gain parliamentary approval and for quick and decisive military action to be taken. As one of my colleagues in the other place, Andrew Nikolic, noted recently, this situation has happened and is not hypothetical. In fact, it was August 1914 when Australia went to war. At that time, federal parliament was prorogued. The government of Prime Minister Joseph Cook had been elected with a majority of one and a hostile senate went to a double dissolution election in June 1914. Imagine the circumstance in 1914 if the executive had not been able to meet around that wonderful table, which is now at the National Archives, and quickly made the decisions that needed to be made. Clearly, it was not in the national interest then for this sort of requirement to be in place, just as it is not in the national interest today.


Even when you have a look at the detail and even if parliament was not prorogued, having a look at how the practical circumstances and how the practical application would be, it would be almost impossible to implement. This would require a proclamation to be made. Consider a circumstance where the government does not want it known that forces are serving overseas for their own operational and personal security. Imagine a time when we have got a hostage rescue situation for the Australian forces in Iraq or Syria and we have got to mount a new operation—what do we do? Do we come to parliament? Do we discuss it here? Do we let our enemies know what we are doing? Time is of the essence. We may as well just post everything from the National Security Committee of Cabinet on our website here or set up a bulletin board to let our opponents and Daesh know what we are doing.


There is not only a high possibility but a very high probability that these requirements in practice—particularly in the current environment in the Middle Eastern area of operations that we are currently operating in—would put Australian service men and women in absolute physical danger. For example, the bill that the Greens put forward last year—which we debated at some extent last year—would require just that. Information on deployment would have to be provided to government within two days, even if forces are deploying on the pretences of secret intelligence or on information that cannot be publically shared.


I will just say that again. Just think about the implications for our service men and women of what the Greens proposed last year in that bill to give effect to this motion today: information on deployment would have to be provided to government within two days, even if forces are deploying on the pretence of secret intelligence or on information that cannot be publically shared. As I said, why don't we just put everything up on a bulletin board to say to Daesh and any other enemy in the future, 'Here we are, guys. This is what we're doing. We're coming to rescue our people. We're coming to do these military operations.' That is really not a very safe or a very smart environment.


That is not the only thing in their legislation last year that they wanted in their bill. They also wanted out there in the public: the reasons for the deployment, the geographical extent of the proposed deployment, the expected duration of the deployment and the number of members of the Defence Force proposed to be deployed. I cannot believe that they would actually want to disclose information that would tell our enemies in a conventional war, or in an asymmetrical war such as we are fighting with Daesh at the moment, where we are going, when we are going, how many troops we are going to deploy and how long we are going to be there. What else does the enemy need to know to actually defeat us when we finally hit the ground? It is the most ludicrous proposal. In my mind, it was ludicrous 12 months ago; but looking at the nature of the threat of Daesh today, it is even more fanciful. It is frightening to me that somebody would come into this place and put forward a bill—and now a motion—that says we should telegraph to our enemies what we are going to do, how we are going to do it, where we are going to deploy our troops, how many we are going to deploy and what equipment they are deploying with. That is the strategy for them to defeat us! I still find it unbelievable that anybody in this parliament would suggest such a thing.


This motion falls directly within the remit of findings of the joint standing committee, which identified three key concerns with this approach. It is worthy to note in this place and remind senators of what the parliamentary committee said:


Much of the information under consideration would be classified, for example risks to personnel, Defence or AFP assets, their strength and location, their force readiness, as well as the level of commitment and capabilities of likely allies, and the compatibility and complementarity of their forces. Clearly much of this information could not be disclosed and, if so, would have the potential to compromise the safety and security of any proposed operation or adversely affect diplomatic relations with potential allies.


It was not a coalition senator saying this. It was the parliamentary committee that reviewed the same proposal from the Greens last year. It was absolutely true then, and it was just as ludicrous then as it is today.


The Islamic State, or Daesh, is an enemy unlike anything we have ever faced. There is truly no way anybody can offer to hold hands with them, reason with them and talk messages of peace, because they do not understand that language. They do not respect compassion; they exploit it in the most horrifically gruesome ways—rape, roasting people alive on TV and other horrendous things. I think we heard today that they are not only selling their captives for sex; they are actually selling men and women into slavery. This is an enemy that cannot be treated lightly, and it cannot be treated in the same way that we may have treated our other enemies. We certainly will not win until Daesh is destroyed. We need to protect not only the Australian people but also the 11 million-plus displaced Syrians who will find no peace and no ability to go home until then. Daesh does not respect borders. They are not just in Iraq. They are also in Syria. It is essential for security in the Middle East and also for the Syrian refugees, the millions of displaced Syrians, that we go in and confront this enemy.


The ludicrousness of the Greens' bill last year, now reflected in this motion today, is that we would telegraph personnel details, Defence and other AFP assets—strengths, locations and force readiness—and the level of commitment and capabilities of our likely allies. So we would not only be telegraphing to Daesh, 'Here's who we are, here's where we are and this is how we're going to come and get you,' we would also be telegraphing our allies' information. They would not be our allies for very long, let me tell you. As I said, there is absolutely no other way to characterise the behaviour of these Islamic State and Daesh fighters. We have all seen the horrific photos and images of the pure evil that these people are capable of. They do not understand compassion; they exploit it in the most heinous ways.


The use of military force is never a decision to be taken lightly, but there is no other way to defeat ISIS and Daesh. There will always be risks, but sometimes there are risks in sitting back watching and waiting as the problem gets worse—with more people being killed, raped, beheaded, roasted alive and all of the things that Daesh is now doing quite publicly and wants the whole world to see. There is no other way for many millions of Syrians to be able to go back to their homes until IS, Daesh, has gone. Put in this context, I find it hard to see how Australia has any other choice than to involve itself with our allies. Operations do change and they have moved. The enemy has moved further into Syria. There is no question that, if we want to deal with Daesh, we have to go into Syria with our allies, not just leave them to do the heavy lifting on our behalf.


I fully believe that our intervention is humane and is on the side of the persecuted minorities who have been forced to flee their own homelands—those who have been lucky enough to survive. This is in conjunction with our allies and our partners. It is under the purview of the United Nations. While it may be centred on the Middle East, 10,000 kilometres away, it clearly has an impact on the security of Australians. It is incumbent upon all of us to do what is right to combat evil and to protect those who are at risk of violence and subjugation at the hands of people as evil as Daesh. As human beings it is our obligation not only to protect our own people but to do what we can to protect the people of Syria.


The Greens' opposition to the deployment of the Australian Defence Force in conflict zones is nothing new. We saw that with the bill they proposed last year. In fact, if my recollection is correct, one of my Greens colleagues who is currently in the Senate chamber said:


Terrorist is a word that is very commonly used against us by those same people in Iraq who have been radicalised.


And:


… anything that creates terror is, by definition, terrorism.


And:


Terrorism in the context of national security has a specific meaning. Anything that creates terror is not, by definition, terrorism.


My understanding of Senator Whish-Wilson's words at the time was that, given what we are doing to help the Iraqis and Syrians, our own men and women in uniform could be construed as terrorists. I found that offensive then, and I find it just as offensive today.


The decision to deploy members of the Australian Defence Force has consistently been regarded as a fundamental decision for the executive of the day. It has always been and always should be. (Time expired)

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-09-10,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:37):  It has been really refreshing that the coalition has put up some of its more sensible, rational and measured speakers for this debate today rather than the attack-dog whistle that we have seen in recent days from the likes of Senator Abetz—simply over the Greens daring to ask questions in the Australian parliament about a new deployment of our Defence personnel in a war zone. And I welcome that. That is what this is about. This is about having a debate and considering these things.


Last night at the UNHCR briefing organised by my colleague Senator Hanson-Young I heard a very emotional Tim Costello talk about the shame he personally felt after spending four years in the refugee camps around Syria, in Lebanon and in other places—his shame at not being able to convince the Australian public that this was catastrophic, an enormous crisis waiting to happen. And he was relieved last night that finally the penny had dropped. In fact, I think the words he used were that the bubble has now burst in the public consciousness on what is going on in the Middle East, especially around Syria. I think a lot of Australians like me are sitting at home now, watching TV, having discussions around barbecues, talking about these things and asking themselves the question: how did we get to this situation? It is fine for Senator Reynolds to come in here and misrepresent the views of this bill. If Senator Reynolds had been here she would know that the Greens have made it very clear in previous debates that this bill does not impact operational matters for the military; it is a debate about an initial deployment, under limited conditions—very much like what we have seen overseas.


What we also found out last night from the Reverend Tim Costello was that in a place like Syria, thanks to arms being smuggled in from, in his words, Russia and America, it is actually harder to put a banana in the hands of a Syrian than it is a weapon. His points were very poignant. He said that peace is the first line of defence but if you cannot have peace then aid should be the first line of defence. They are severely lacking in aid, but the world has woken up to the fact that in Syria and around Syria we now have a global crisis, a catastrophe, a human tragedy of proportions that we have not seen since the Second World War. We all acknowledge that, and we congratulated the government for listening to the Australian people and implementing an emergency refugee intake. But on the same day they did that, they could not resist making an announcement that they were extending the scope of Australian military operations in Syria.


Australians at their barbecues or having discussions around the dinner table will be asking: to what point has our military strategy got us up until now? How did it get to the point where four million people have had to flee? When we were speaking to our experts last night they also made it very clear that the reason we are seeing this exodus into places like Europe is that a lot of these refugees have actually given up hope that they can go home. The war has taken that long and has been that disruptive and destructive that they have given up hope, so they are now seeking a new life. This is the point we have to focus on.


At the end of his presentation to us last night, Amin Awad said something. He is the guy on the ground for UNHCR, the key guy in the Middle East who has to deal with this crisis, and I have to say, on R U OK Day, that I was looking at him last night on the TV—at the colour of his eyes, at the colour of his skin, at how tired he looked—and thinking what an incredible strain it would be to have his job. But what he said last night is very important. He said that for all the work UNHCR does, all the aid you can give them and all the refugees you can take, it is to no avail without a peace agreement. I asked him about that. I said that 'peace agreement' are two words that you will not hear in this country from this government. I asked what he meant by 'peace agreement': is there something afoot? Could he elaborate? And he said—and I must say, his answer was very terse, and I would have liked him to have elaborated a lot more—that what we need is global leadership, like we saw in Bosnia, where an impossible situation was resolved through a process that was no doubt long and convoluted. I have no doubt that Senator Fawcett's words tonight were on the money, that these things will not happen straightaway. But Amin Awad said that in Bosnia they had leadership, and eventually, through all sorts of coercions, including military action, a truce to cease fire was achieved.


It was good to hear this morning that at least Julie Bishop—unlike the other attack dogs in this government who love conflict in this parliament and in this society, who have relied on division for their polling numbers—engaged in this frame. And, as I think Senator Fawcett very poignantly pointed out to the parliament this afternoon, any long-term solution is of course going to have to go beyond military means and look at a whole range of different options, including geopolitical considerations, towards a peace agreement. But we have not actually had that conversation in this country, and it was only today, following the UNHCR briefing, that this actually entered our language. Julie Bishop talked this morning about the need, at the right time and the right place, for a peace agreement. At least we have got that far.


What have we achieved in this parliamentary debate today and by raising this in parliament yesterday? Thank you Senator Hanson-Young for organising an amazing forum last night. It had me close to tears when I actually realised the human catastrophe that is unfolding. I sometimes feel that putting a human face to this is the last thing our government wants us to see. Thank you for pointing that out, because like a lot of other Australians I am now awake to this and I am asking questions—where do we go from here?


When I did media this morning, I said that I do not know what a peace agreement would look like or if it is even feasible yet. But we need to start talking about how we can get a diplomatic solution to this crisis so that these people can return home and so their country can be rebuilt. If we start that conversation, no matter how brief and how stilted, at least we will have started it. I think a lot of other Australians are probably asking themselves the same thing, and they are saying that what we are doing now is not working.


Getting to the bill: I have experienced in this parliament a similar debate—or a tussle, a tug-of-war—between the executive and the parliament in the area of trade negotiations. I have learned from my experience that the big parties—Labor and Liberal—do not want to give up executive power, especially around treaties and the special powers the executive has under our Constitution. It is no different for war powers. What we are actually suggesting is eminently sensible for parliament: for each and every one of us to get up here and debate the deployment of our Defence personnel. Let me get it on record: the Greens support our Defence personnel. That is why we ask these questions, because we want to make sure that they are not being used as political tools or toys by any government and that they only go to war as a last resort—when it is absolutely necessary. That is what this is about.


As I said yesterday in this chamber, I believe that Defence personnel will respect the fact that there are people asking questions about this and asking for debate. We are not criticising them. I personally have an incredible amount of respect for all the Defence personnel that I know and have met. I save my contempt for a government that sends them into unnecessary and immoral wars. On that point, why are the Greens putting this motion up and asking this question? And why are Australians discussing this around the dinner table? Because they do not trust the executive to make these decisions. Not only did this government totally politicise national security in the last 12 months, with the help of the Murdoch press—I would dearly love to use a swear word on this next point, but I won't—but also they totally screwed up in 2003 by invading Iraq.


I read David Kilcullen's quarterly essay Blood Year and I recommend that everybody reads it to get the background to what Mr Kilcullen says. He was an expert, an Australian working with Condoleezza Rice in the US during the insurgency in Iraq. He makes it very clear what a total screw up it was, how unnecessary it was and how—and this is what I would like Senator Reynolds to have heard if she had been in the chamber—it led to the rise of Isis or Daesh, not to mention the deaths of hundreds and thousands, if not millions, of people. So excuse me for being sceptical about a government—a Liberal government—that took us to a war in 2003 that we did not need to have on the same proviso, the same messaging, that we are getting in this chamber today about eradicating and killing bad guys.


That sounds intuitive. I think all of us would like to see the end of Isis, but it did not work in 2003 when we got rid of Saddam Hussein—that has backfired. Isis has made it very clear that they want us to go in and drop more bombs and they want us to commit soldiers—the likely escalation of this conflict. They are totally, criminally insane and mad. This is what they want, and this is what we are giving them. This is what they want; it is a brilliant recruiting tool.


I heard Senator Back, who I have a lot of respect for, as I heard Senator Fawcett, talk about the awful atrocities that Isis have perpetuated in the Middle East. I have to say today that I still do not get why those atrocities are so often and so clearly shown by elements of our media in this country and overseas, because that is also what Isis wants—making front page headlines with photographs of people being beheaded. I do not think that is a good thing. Why give these bastards what they want?


We are at a juncture here where it is right for Australians to be sceptical about our military involvement in Iraq. Any reasonable, rational person will be having doubts, and the only way we can deal with those doubts is to have a proper debate—a parliamentary debate—where we, as the elected representatives of the Australian people and in our positions of power, can put this on the record for them, because they are asking these questions.


Although I would love to take up my remaining time, I respect Senator Xenophon enough to know that he only has 10 minutes left before the clock ticks over. So I would say that this is a lot deeper than some of the shallow arguments that we have seen in the last few days about the Greens asking questions. We are asking questions for a very good reason and I am glad that someone is.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:51):  Thank you to Senator Peter Whish-Wilson for graciously giving me an opportunity to speak on this important debate, because it is an important issue. Can I say at the outset that if plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, I will plagiarise from a speech that I gave on 1 September last year in this place in respect of this issue. I set out my position then, but it is worth setting out again and also worth updating the concerns that quite legitimately have been asked by the Australian community.


There are a number of issues that confound the proposition that parliament should be required to approve the deployment of troops prior to their deployment. It is important to distinguish between routine or non-warlike military activities—including peacekeeping, capacity building in other countries, humanitarian assistance and antipiracy actions—and activities involving the rescue or extraction of Australian citizens from threatening situations overseas, covert operations such as those involving special forces and, most importantly, full-scale deployment. These involve varying degrees of emphasis on the role of intelligence and classified materials that are available only to the executive. 


There is also the requirement for Defence to mobilise its forces safely and effectively. All cases are not alike, and parliament's role differs where the specific constraints differ. The Constitution does not say anything about where the power to deploy troops lies. It is assumed that this is part of the executive power under section 61. 


I note that Senator Macdonald is in the chamber. I am happy to truncate my remarks so that Senator Macdonald can have five minutes on this motion before the time for it expires, if that would be helpful to him. I have only just started, but I will try to wind up in the next two or three minutes if that would be helpful to Senator Macdonald. I am very happy to do that. I will be very quick. 


Essentially, there is no constitutional requirement for the executive to seek the blessing of the Australian parliament before troops are committed to war. There is no constitutional need to even debate the decision to deploy troops, because the power to deploy troops overseas lies with the Minister for Defence, under section 50C of the Defence Act 1903. 


In relation to an important issue such as this, I do not think it is practical and I think it could in some circumstances be quite dangerous to require parliamentary approval before troops are deployed because of emergencies that have arisen. But it would be reasonable, after troops have been deployed in a theatre of conflict, for us to have a debate within a reasonable period of, say, three months. A critical situation may arise for the deployment of troops, but we should eventually have a parliamentary debate and, if necessary, seek approval for that. So I take an approach that is not in line with what the Greens are suggesting, but it does say that we ought to have a debate in relation to this. 


The Prime Minister is quite right to say that Daesh, or ISIS, is a death cult, but we need to look at how Daesh came about. I think it is reasonable to say, as sensible commentators have said, that, following the coalition of the willing invading Iraq in 2003 and overthrowing the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein, recklessly dismissing the entire army and dismantling the Ba'ath Party sowed the seeds of what is now ISIS, because it radicalised the Sunnis in Iraq, it ignited a vicious civil war between the Shiites and Sunnis, it increased Iran's influence and, most tragically of all, it led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. We must not forget that. I do have more to say on this, because I am critical of Saudi Arabia and its role in fuelling this conflict. 


In relation to this particular motion, I believe we must be mindful of the dangers of escalation and the dangers of mission creep. But, at the end of the day, I wish our troops well. I am sure they will do us proud. I hope and pray that none our Defence personnel will be harmed in any way in what appears to be an escalation of this terrible conflict.

 (Queensland) (17:55):  I appreciate Senator Xenophon allowing me to go back to my original spot in the queue! But it was generous of Senator Xenophon to curtail his remarks. I am pleased that my absence at the appropriate time allowed him to make a few points as well. At this stage of the debate, my points will be necessarily brief as well.


I have no objection to a couple of the points that Senator Xenophon made, particularly about having a public debate about the deployment of troops after the event. Of course, in a chamber like the Senate, where rarely does the government control the numbers, such debates can be held at any time should the majority of the Senate agree that a debate should be held. Indeed, today is a good indication of not a full debate on the issue but a debate where many of the issues that would be raised in a full debate were raised. Should the majority in this chamber decide that it needs more than that, then the majority of this chamber can always make that decision. 


Most of the speakers who have spoken before me, both from this side and from the Labor Party side, have indicated the stupidity of trying to have a parliamentary debate before any decision has been made to commit troops anywhere, because you can never predict the urgency with which a decision might have to be made. We elect governments to govern for a period of three years and, in a democracy, we give to the leaders of the government the responsibility for making decisions where the national interest is at stake, where national security is at stake. The thought that, before anything was decided, you would have a full-scale parliamentary debate is just ludicrous. I know my colleagues on both this side and the Labor side have explained that in some detail, so I will not even attempt to do so in the couple of minutes available to me.


Can I just congratulate the Prime Minister and indeed the government on the decision to take a greater number of genuine refugees in a one-off, 12,000-person hit, to do our bit. In this I want to emphasise, as I do in many aspects of public international policy, that Australia should play its part but it should not do more than the rest of the world. I raised this issue in relation to climate change. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of global carbon emissions. If you shut Australia down absolutely and completely—if there was no light burning anywhere in the country—it would not make one iota of difference to the world environment. Similarly, in the case of refugees, I know 12,000 is a drop in the bucket, but per capita across the world Australia punches well above its weight in the number of refugees we take in and in our assistance to refugees. 


I add that many countries grandstand and make grandiose promises, whether it is in relation to carbon emissions or support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but very few ever meet those commitments. Certainly, that is the case with carbon emissions and offering money to support the UNHCR. A lot of countries make promises but very few actually pay up. Australia does. Australia always has done. I congratulate Mr Abbott and the government. 



The PRESIDENT:  The time for the debate has now expired.

Senator GALLACHER

 (South Australia) (18:00):  I rise to take note of the Select Committee report on Nauru titles Taking responsibility: conditions and circumstances at Australia's regional processing centre in Nauru. I rise in relation to a number of contributions made by government ministers and government senators in which they made remarks about the alleged witch-hunt and the alleged airing of allegations without substantial evidence. I want to touch on a couple of points that I think are really pertinent to this debate. 


A submission came before the committee from the Hon. Geoffrey M Eames AM QC. Mr Eames submitted to the committee that, in December 2010, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Republic of Nauru by the President, Marcus Stephen. Mr Eames held that position until 13 March 2014. In his submission, Mr Eames states:


My resignation was forced, because the Nauru government of President Baron Waqa MP had revoked my visa, thus making it impossible for me to perform the role of Chief Justice. The actions of the Nauru government constituted a series of flagrant breaches of the Rule of Law. The fact that the government is not committed to the Rule of Law should be a matter of concern to the Australian government.


He goes on to say: 


Resident Magistrate and Registrar of the Supreme Court, Peter Law, was arrested on 19 January 2014, forced on to an aeroplane and deported under police escort. No reasons were given to him by the government for this extraordinary action. The reasons, however, are now very clear – Mr Law had offended the Minister for Justice and Border Control, Mr David Adeang, by making interim orders, as Registrar, restraining the unlawful deportation of two expatriate businessmen, an Australian, Rod Henshaw, and a Fijian, Mohammed Haneef. 


If that was not enough, Mr Richard Britten's appointment as commissioner of the Nauru Police Force was terminated on 19 July 2013. This is the evidence that this committee has taken. It has been publicised. It has not been rebutted. It is not unsubstantiated. It is a simple fact. People were arrested and deported—three people who, I would contend, were assisting the government of Nauru, the Republic of Nauru, in providing an independent police force and an independent judiciary. Any semblance of transparency, justice and accountability which the Australian government could rely on is now no longer there. This is the evidence that came to this committee. 


We have had contributions in this chamber that said we dealt with 'unsubstantiated allegations' that have all been dealt with by other parties. I am sure that Senator Carr is in vehement agreement with me when I say that that is not the case. That is simply not the case. No-one has rebutted the contentions of Mr Law or Mr Eames. The Australian federal policeman has basically remained silent, as he probably needs to do in terms of his contract of employment. 


We do know that there is an absence of ability to prosecute, to forensically evaluate, in the Nauruan police force. We know that because this minister has recognised it. He sent additional officers to Nauru to assist them in building their capacity. It is extraordinary and exceedingly strange that a minister can look one way and row another. He says that all of the Moss review allegations and all of the allegations that have been made before the four recent inquiries are all being capably dealt with by the responsible Republic of Nauru—who threw out the Australian Police Commissioner, threw out the Chief Justice and threw out the Chief Magistrate. They deported them—house arrest and on you go. Now we are expected to take from the minister and the minister representing the minister in the Senate that it is all okay and that these 'untested' allegations will all be handled competently by the government of Nauru. 


We know that other nations have expressed concern about supporting funds that go to justice in Nauru. I think the New Zealand government is on the record as having expressed concern. I think our own foreign minister is actually on the record has having expressed some concern. But, no, people can come into this chamber and say that the evidence before the Nauru select committee was untested and basically not factual. I would like to see the evidence that was put before the committee that rebutted not claims, but facts. Where was the evidence that rebutted these facts?


If we are going to rely on the justice system in Nauru to provide good, humane, legally transparent treatment for people who may settle in Nauru from the RPC or who may be in the RPCs and have a complaint against someone, then the initial recommendation is that this government give back resourcing for the judiciary and the police force to get in place a proper and transparent police and judicial system that includes child protection legislation. Apparently child protection legislation does not exist in Nauru. It should have child protection laws.


We have the awful situation where the allegations have not been rebutted and people have endured awful criminality. The Nauruan police, whether because of a lack of training or a lack of resources, have not acted on those. People under the control and care of Australia are not being treated in the same way as they would be in this great country of ours. That is Australia's shame. We cannot allow this to go on. These people need to have access to a judicial system and the care and help of a police force that is adequately trained and resourced and capable of prosecuting. There is no evidence that that is the case.


One of the firmest recommendations the committee made was that the Australian government, if it wants to rely on the Republic of Nauru in these matters, should make sure Nauru have the wherewithal. It should make sure they have the competent people and the assistance to carry out prosecutions, to collect forensic evidence and to protect children in detention and in the community. There is no evidence that we have stepped to the plate in respect of that. That is the first recommendation that this government should take up.


The minister's responsibility is very, very clear. But he has done exactly the opposite of what he should have. He has labelled this inquiry a witch-hunt. He has labelled it a political stunt. But the awful reality is that the Nauruan police force is deficient in its prosecutorial capacity. It is deficient in its collection of forensic evidence. It is not through any great fault of theirs. There are only 100 people in the Nauruan police force. We cannot expect them to act with the capacity of the Australian Federal Police. But we can make sure they have resources, backup and training. We can provide that and we are not at the moment. We have some Australian police officers trying to do their best in Nauru as we speak. But it needs to be a continuous, reinforced, funded effort.


We really need to get serious about this. We cannot have Australia's reputation at risk because we have underresourced the police force and magisterial areas of the Republic of Nauru. They are making a lot of money out of Australia's efforts there. We need to get on the job here and fix a few things.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:10):  Those in the chamber and those who might be listening to this on broadcast might almost agree with Senator Gallacher, but I will just remind people of the history. Senator Gallacher complains about a police commissioner who was sacked on 19 July 2013. I ask people to remember July 2013. That was the very time that Senator Gallacher, Senator Conroy, Senator Wong and Senator Carr were in a government that was doing a deal with the nation of Nauru. If it was so bad, why did Mr Rudd and Senator Conroy agree to the deal? They did. They sent these boat people to Nauru. The evidence at this and other inquiries has clearly shown that it was all done in such a rush because Mr Rudd, Senator Conroy and others realised the political and voting impact of their failure on border protection and so they grabbed at any straw to try to recover some political momentum. In doing that, they did the deal with Manus. According to Senator Gallacher, they did it at the time that the Nauruan government was actually sacking the police commissioner who Senator Gallacher is so worried about.


Senator Gallacher, if you are worried about it now, why weren't you worried about it then? Why didn't you say to Mr Rudd, 'Hang on. We can't do a deal with this country because they have just sacked the police commissioner and they don't want the judge to remain'? They made the arrangement. Senator Conroy was a senior member of the cabinet that made that deal. Yet those opposite have the hide to come in here now and complain about something that they put in place at the time that, according to them, the Nauruan government was wrongfully, illegally and undemocratically sacking their police commissioner. If it is bad now, it was bad when they did the deal.


The Greens political party are equally complicit because they supported the Labor Party in most of the decisions made at the time—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. That is misleading the chamber. The Australian Greens voted every single time against the establishment of Nauru and Manus Island—



The PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point, Senator Hanson-Young. There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  As I was saying, the Greens political party voted with the government on almost every decision the Rudd and Gillard government made and had enormous influence on that government. They threatened to cross the floor and vote with us and bring the government down. When the government went ahead with the arrangement in Manus, of course they did not cross the floor. The hypocrisy of the Greens political party knows no bounds.


My concern with these reports is that they are always politically motivated. Senator Hanson-Young, with the support of the Australian Labor Party, has suggested and initiated so many inquiries into these things, but they are all politically motivated; they are all set up with committees that have a majority of Labor and Greens and Green Independent senators. They know the outcome before they go there, and it gives Senator Hanson-Young—with all due respect to you, Senator Hanson-Young; I do not want to belittle you—the opportunity to expose her expertise on this. She has looked at Sea Patrol episodes over many months, so she knows all about these things and how they work. The committee would rightly report before it had even had a hearing, and I suggest that that is what has happened now.


I simply cannot understand Senator Gallacher and other members from the Labor Party complaining about something that they set up. I am only going on your advice, Senator Gallacher, that it was on 19 July 2013. That was the very time that Mr Rudd and Senator Conroy were wining and dining these people from that country, making the deal. Why did they not say then, 'We're going to give you enough money, but we're only going to do this if you properly train your police, your judges and your parliamentarians. We'll only give you the money and do the deal with you if you do that.' Did they do that? No, of course they did not.


The Labor Party in government made this deal with a sovereign country. What does Senator Gallacher want us to do now? Perhaps, Senator Gallacher, we should mobilise the army and invade Nauru? We will teach them a lesson or two; we will invade the country and set up a democratic parliament, a proper judicial system and a proper police system! We will have Australian troops surrounding the place so that this little nation learns its lesson. Is that what you want? How else are you going to—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Macdonald. Senator Gallacher, on a point of order?




Senator Gallacher:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I am quite happy to engage in a debate across the chamber if he wants to waive standing orders.




Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:  Order on both sides! Before I call Senator Macdonald back, I did note that in your contribution, Senator Gallacher, you were heard in silence and there were no interjections on my right. Could I indicate to senators that they should listen to senators in silence.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr President. I know you do not mean it in this way, but if they did listen to me in silence they might actually learn something and understand. The honourable senator who spoke before me, Senator Gallacher, wants us to do something about it. There are a lot of countries around the world that I think are deficient in the way they run their parliaments or their police, but what do we do? Do we send in Australia's army to overrun them? We will teach them how to do it properly, Senator Gallacher. We do not like the way they are running their government, but what can we do? Is that what you want us to do—invade the country? 'We'll show them a thing or two. We'll teach them how to run a democracy! We'll teach them how to run a police force.' How ludicrous! This is an independent country. They are carrying out an agreement with another sovereign nation, Australia—an agreement made by the Rudd Labor government, of which Senator Conroy was a senior member. They are discharging the agreement and the promises that were made at that time.


Since then there have been problems, but every person in the know who gave evidence agreed that the reason for the problems was that the deal done by Mr Rudd and Senator Conroy was done in such haste that none of this was looked at. None of the proper resourcing was done. They just had to do something to try to save their own political bacon. And yet now the Labor Party, having had a conversion to purity since the election, want us to go in, invade Nauru and teach them how to do it properly.


What the current government did, as best it could, dealing with the internal affairs of another country, was to set up an independent inquiry with the agreement of that country—not a political witch-hunt in which the Labor, Greens and Green Independents have a majority, but an inquiry by an independent, respected former public servant, Mr Moss, who went in with all the resources that were needed and made a sensible investigation. As well as that there were police investigations, to the best of our ability as a nation looking at what might have happened in another nation but confining ourselves to where we were invited or to offences that might have occurred within Australia's jurisdiction. These brought out recommendations. As I understand it the government's reply, which is later in the documents that we will be debating today, indicates that most of the recommendations of these independent inquiries—I think probably all of, although I cannot be precise on that—have been put into place by the government, so far as the government is able to do in another nation's jurisdiction.


So again I say to the Greens and the Labor Party: you complain loud and long now, but where were you when your government, the Greens-Labor government, put these arrangements into place? Where were you? When you can answer that question I will give this debate a little more credibility than anyone who is listening to it could possibly ever give to it at the present time.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-09-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:21):  I think it is appalling to hear the level of debate we just heard from the previous speaker on an issue that is incredibly serious: the abuse of children and the rape of women inside the Nauru detention camp, done at the hands of guards paid for by the Australian taxpayer, funded by the Australian taxpayer, overseen by the Australian government and managed by the Australian government's contractor, Transfield Services. If this place is not able to discuss the spending of $1.2 billion to run this camp and ensure that children are safe and that women are not being raped—if we are not going to take responsibility for it—who will?


It is precisely why, when the legislation was first drafted to re-establish Nauru and Manus Island, I stood with my Greens colleagues in this place and moved amendment after amendment after amendment to try to put in safeguards. And who voted against every single one of those amendments? Senator Macdonald, and every single member of the coalition—and, I might say, every member of the Labor Party in this place too.


So: the mistakes have now been realised. This camp is horrendous. It is shameful that we are leaving vulnerable people there who have committed no crime but to try to get themselves and their families out of a war zone. And today, of all days, when we are discussing Australia taking more people from the war zones in Syria and Iraq, you have got to wonder: where is the common sense and the debate about other people who have already tried to get here, for safety, and have been shipped off to be dumped and locked up on Nauru, and are being abused, harmed and hurt?


We hear from government members that that is all okay and we should not be asking any questions. No—not good enough; absolutely not good enough.


Thankfully, we have seen, particularly over the last few days but increasingly over the last weeks and months, an opening of heart and a compassion and a desire to welcome people who are in such desperate need of protection and safety. When they flee from war zones, families get torn apart; lives get destroyed. And, for the people who made their way to Australia in the vain hope that they might find protection and safety here, we now need to turn our generosity of heart and our compassion to what we can do for those people here as well, because they have fled the same wars. They are fleeing the same ogres.


My daughter said to me that she described what a refugee was to her class. We were talking about what 'refugees' meant and what they were. And she said, 'Mum, refugees are people who are fleeing ogres and hot lava, and they need help.' If an eight-year-old child can get it, and if the Australian community is starting to desire and call for a proper response from our government, the very least we can have is a bit more civilised debate in this chamber about the people who are being harmed in the places that we have locked them up in.


They will not be forgotten. They should not be forgotten. And I am never going to be in this place and let somebody stand there and laugh off the abuse and rape of children and women that is happening in Australian institutions. It is appalling.


I obviously have a lot more to say in relation to this report, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Since then there have been problems, but every person in the know who gave evidence agreed that the reason for the problems was that the deal done by Mr Rudd and Senator Conroy was done in such haste that none of this was looked at. None of the proper resourcing was done. They just had to do something to try to save their own political bacon. And yet now the Labor Party, having had a conversion to purity since the election, want us to go in, invade Nauru and teach them how to do it properly.


What the current government did, as best it could, dealing with the internal affairs of another country, was to set up an independent inquiry with the agreement of that country—not a political witch-hunt in which the Labor, Greens and Green Independents have a majority, but an inquiry by an independent, respected former public servant, Mr Moss, who went in with all the resources that were needed and made a sensible investigation. As well as that there were police investigations, to the best of our ability as a nation looking at what might have happened in another nation but confining ourselves to where we were invited or to offences that might have occurred within Australia's jurisdiction. These brought out recommendations. As I understand it the government's reply, which is later in the documents that we will be debating today, indicates that most of the recommendations of these independent inquiries—I think probably all of, although I cannot be precise on that—have been put into place by the government, so far as the government is able to do in another nation's jurisdiction.


So again I say to the Greens and the Labor Party: you complain loud and long now, but where were you when your government, the Greens-Labor government, put these arrangements into place? Where were you? When you can answer that question I will give this debate a little more credibility than anyone who is listening to it could possibly ever give to it at the present time.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-09-10,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:21):  I think it is appalling to hear the level of debate we just heard from the previous speaker on an issue that is incredibly serious: the abuse of children and the rape of women inside the Nauru detention camp, done at the hands of guards paid for by the Australian taxpayer, funded by the Australian taxpayer, overseen by the Australian government and managed by the Australian government's contractor, Transfield Services. If this place is not able to discuss the spending of $1.2 billion to run this camp and ensure that children are safe and that women are not being raped—if we are not going to take responsibility for it—who will?


It is precisely why, when the legislation was first drafted to re-establish Nauru and Manus Island, I stood with my Greens colleagues in this place and moved amendment after amendment after amendment to try to put in safeguards. And who voted against every single one of those amendments? Senator Macdonald, and every single member of the coalition—and, I might say, every member of the Labor Party in this place too.


So: the mistakes have now been realised. This camp is horrendous. It is shameful that we are leaving vulnerable people there who have committed no crime but to try to get themselves and their families out of a war zone. And today, of all days, when we are discussing Australia taking more people from the war zones in Syria and Iraq, you have got to wonder: where is the common sense and the debate about other people who have already tried to get here, for safety, and have been shipped off to be dumped and locked up on Nauru, and are being abused, harmed and hurt?


We hear from government members that that is all okay and we should not be asking any questions. No—not good enough; absolutely not good enough.


Thankfully, we have seen, particularly over the last few days but increasingly over the last weeks and months, an opening of heart and a compassion and a desire to welcome people who are in such desperate need of protection and safety. When they flee from war zones, families get torn apart; lives get destroyed. And, for the people who made their way to Australia in the vain hope that they might find protection and safety here, we now need to turn our generosity of heart and our compassion to what we can do for those people here as well, because they have fled the same wars. They are fleeing the same ogres.


My daughter said to me that she described what a refugee was to her class. We were talking about what 'refugees' meant and what they were. And she said, 'Mum, refugees are people who are fleeing ogres and hot lava, and they need help.' If an eight-year-old child can get it, and if the Australian community is starting to desire and call for a proper response from our government, the very least we can have is a bit more civilised debate in this chamber about the people who are being harmed in the places that we have locked them up in.


They will not be forgotten. They should not be forgotten. And I am never going to be in this place and let somebody stand there and laugh off the abuse and rape of children and women that is happening in Australian institutions. It is appalling.


I obviously have a lot more to say in relation to this report, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:48):  I rise to report to the Senate some concerns about the provision of health care in country South Australia. I had the privilege last week of spending two days in regional South Australia with Senator Fiona Nash, the Assistant Minister for Health, who also has responsibility for, among other things, rural health, Indigenous health and palliative care and also has a role on the Ice Taskforce. We canvassed many of those issue with people in regional areas spanning from the south-east to the Riverland to the lower north. The prime purpose of our visit was to talk about training for junior doctors, particularly the provision of intern places in South Australia. We currently have five. We used to have six; it has now gone down to five. According to a rural workforce agency report of a couple of years ago, we need a minimum of about 20. So we are looking to see how we can constructively work with the university sector, with the state government if they will come on board, and with GPs in rural communities to bring about such a program.


The topic I would like to talk on tonight is palliative care services. One of the concerns raised with us in Mount Gambier is the fact that, as of 1 July, palliative nursing staff numbers will be halved, bereavement services for Mount Gambier and Naracoorte will go and a head of palliative care position will also be cut. This comes at a time when in the media we are seeing reports that in Adelaide the state government is choosing to spend some $7 million to relocate palliative care services from Daw House at the repat hospital to the Flinders Medical Centre and will be building a 15-bed facility there. The closure of the repat hospital is a separate issue and I will perhaps discuss that on a separate occasion. Whilst I am thrilled for people in the metropolitan area of Adelaide that there will be a brand-new facility with 15 beds at the Flinders Medical Centre, I do question the relative priorities of the state Labor government that they are spending $7 million to relocate an existing facility—albeit an aged one—but at the same time are completely cutting services in one of South Australia's largest regional towns and the hinterland around that.


A couple of reports have come out just recently in which people in the community who have highlighted the impact that these positive palliative care services have had. In a story that came out on the ABC in June this year, Mr Chris Couch talks about the support that he and his brother Andrew received from the palliative care team at the Mount Gambier hospital for their father. It highlighted the real difference that that made to their ability to care for their father in the community compared to the options that they might have faced if that support had not been there. So it is clearly an issue that the community is concerned about. I would like to raise tonight and highlight that this is an issue that the state government has in its remit to fix if it so chooses.


The response to the media in Mount Gambier and the south-east from Country Health SA is to blame the end of the Commonwealth national partnership program. I have gone back to look at that program to understand exactly what was provided, and I will give you a little bit of context. This was a program that was set up as a top up, if you like, to try to overcome some of the inefficiencies in hospital services. It was set up under the former Labor government, and I give them credit for spending that money. In looking at the program, under schedule E to the partnership agreement, South Australia received some $119.7 million between 2010-11 and 2013-14 for additional subacute beds, and the palliative care area falls under that as well as rehabilitation services. What it also highlights is that, if you go to page 8 and table 1, which is part 5 of the financial arrangements, the investment in the subacute beds finished in the financial year 2013-14 even though the overall agreement stretched out to 2016-17.


Mr Rann, who was then the Premier, signed up to this agreement. So the South Australian health department knew when they signed the agreement that this top-up funding was going to finish at the end of June 2014, or that that would be the last time it would be funded. Under that agreement for the following years there was no funding. So for them, now, to turn around and say that they are pulling these services in country areas in South Australia because this agreement has ended in just inaccurate. If you look at the agreement, that funding stopped anyway under what they signed.


It is also worth pointing out that under the coalition government we have continued to fund and increased funding to South Australian hospitals. In fact under the National Health Reform Agreement, under the activity based funding arrangements, the Commonwealth will pay 45 per cent of efficient growth in public health costs out to 2017-18. This is just part of the health funding. Overall, as I have talked about in this place many times before, funding to the hospital sector in South Australia increases year on year on year, but this particular part in 2014 was $1.124 billion and by 2018 that had gone up to $1.3 billion. So there is a 16 per cent increase across the forward estimates in the area that the South Australian government is making choices as to where it spends its money. If you couple that with the fact that there is some $1.8 billion of additional revenue that the South Australian government is receiving through GST that was not forecast at the time when we came to government, it says that they have no shortage of funds to spend to support the health services of people living in regional South Australia. This comes down, purely, to an issue of the priorities of the Weatherill government and Minister Snelling as to where they think it is worth spending money to provide health services for South Australian residents. Clearly people living in regional communities are not seen as a priority.


Unfortunately for South Australians most country areas are represented by Liberal Party members, so it is very difficult for them to get political leverage to convince the state Labor government to spend this money in regional areas. I would encourage anyone in South Australia listening to this debate, who has family in the city or, indeed, who lives in the city, to take this up as an issue of equity. Governments govern for all regardless of who you vote for, regardless of whether you live in the city or country. Good government is here to govern for all and to make sure that there is an equitable distribution of available funds to provide services that are essential for people.


In this area, where the Commonwealth still provides funding and increases funding,—as I said a 16.3 per cent increase over the forward estimates for the additional GST funding—this is a decision that the South Australian government can and should be making to support people living in regional South Australia. Bear in mind at the moment that much of South Australia's economy is dependent on the agriculture sector, yet those communities who provide this income for the state also need the health services that gives them the confidence, gives young families the confidence, to establish a career in a regional area. Whether they be people working in the ag sector, the health sector or in many other parts of the community, they go there to have a functional and sustainable community.


In terms of palliative care the Australian government is funding some $52 million over three years to develop and deliver national palliative care projects that palliative care groups have identified as critical to improving the quality and service delivery of palliative care. In South Australia Flinders University has three such projects running. This is an important topic for people in South Australia. For those people in the city, I urge you to take this up as a matter of equity. For those people in the country, particularly in the south-east at the moment who are affected, I encourage you to not give up your fight but continue to advocate and call for equity in funding from the state Labor government.
