"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-06-26,"—Last night I was pointing out that the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  in its thrust is similar to the Employment Security Bill 1998  that was debated yesterday on the initiative of Senator Sue Mackay. I say that 
 because in both bills there is an expectation that related companies will take responsibility for the wages that a particular member of that group has to pay to its employees. It would be a good thing if these two bills were to set a trend that had general application, but whether that happens remains to be seen.
May I say that the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill very much reflects the philosophy of the collective responsibility of people which comes from a different philosophy from that which says each company, each person, each individual, should be responsible for his or her or its own actions. The philosophy which says, `Look, market forces, efficiency and competition should rule the day,' is denied by this Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill, as it is with Senator Sue Mackay's Employment Security Bill in so far as it says that actions taken by one particular company should be the responsibility of a whole group.
There are some matters which, if I raise them now, will save time during the committee stage. What I am concerned about are clauses 14 and 15 in part 4 of the miscellaneous section of this bill. Clause 15 provides that an inspector may be appointed in writing by the secretary. That person can be a person employed by the Commonwealth and a person employed by a state or by the Northern Territory. It is a very broad provision. That inspector is given power on the basis of a warrant from a justice of the peace to break into houses to get information that may be relevant to the matters raised by this bill.
It seems to me a very serious business that this bill should provide powers to anybody chosen by the Commonwealth, as long as he is employed by the Commonwealth, to break into people's houses on a warrant issued by a justice of the peace. I have always had great respect for justices of the peace, but I am concerned that lay people, as justices of the peace are, should have the power to give people who are not trained as police are in proper investigative procedures to any employee of the Commonwealth to break into houses to search for documents.
I hope when the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) comes to speak about that he 
 will address that concern. We are seeing our liberties more and more curtailed by provisions such as this. No doubt there will be a suggestion that these sorts of provisions are in other acts. Of course, that is the problem. What happens is that these bills are simply drafted on the basis of precedence and, because the precedent is there, it is said that it is all right.
We have come to the stage where people should be able to walk free and should be able to go about their business without employees of the Commonwealth, with no particular training in this area, breaking into premises to look for documents. They could do it at night, as I look at this. I had not realised that until I went through this provision again. Such a person can use force to come into a person's premises at night to search for documents. It seems to me that that is a matter of great concern.
The other issue I want to address is clause 19 of the  Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  which says:
19 Distribution of Surplus Levy
(1) 	 If the Minister is satisfied that more levy has been received by the Commonwealth than is needed for the purpose for which the levy was imposed, the Minister may determine that the surplus is to be distributed in accordance with a scheme prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.
(2) 	 The Consolidated Revenue Fund is appropriated for the purposes of payments under subsection (1).
That allows the minister, by regulations, to apply money for any purposes at all, whether in accordance with this act or outside it. It seems to me to be an extraordinary provision that would allow a minister, without the sanctioning of parliament, at a primary level at least, to spend money for whatever purpose. It may be for paying legal costs, it may be for using in the same way as a grant may be used by the Minister for Finance and Administration, and so on. I think it is a dangerous trend to have money spent by a minister without the sanctioning of parliament.
If that scheme was prescribed by regulations while parliament was not sitting, for example, the money would be spent and 
 disposed of before we came back to do anything about it. It would be all right looking at and disallowing the regulation once the money was spent, but it is a very dangerous trend that I see in the miscellaneous parts of this bill where money is spent according to a scheme which has not been sanctioned by parliament, where we have untrained investigators going into houses on the say-so of a justice of the peace—justices of the peace not trained in the law. It is a very worrying trend which is brought out by this particular bill.
The other thing concerns collection of the levy. Clause 13 of the bill says that if somebody does not pay the levy then that becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth can collect a levy on the basis of evidence provided by a statement or averment in the complaint. What will happen is that stevedoring companies which in no way have contributed to the awful and horrible events that we have experienced on the wharf, as has so eloquently been pointed out by previous speakers, where men were shut out of their job—companies who have treated their workers as they ought to have been treated and have a very appropriate scheme in place to see that the work force is properly cared for and where there is a mutual exchange of responsibilities between employer and employee—are going to have to pay money for something that was not in any way their responsibility. If they do not pay, they are going to be taken to court and the evidence to be used against them will simply be a written statement.
I know, Madam Deputy President, in your high regard—as I have noted over the years—in here for there to be proper evidence, that people should stick by their word and that there ought to be proof, you would understand the real danger in all this. Again, it will be said that this has been done before. Having been done before is no reason why it should be done now, particularly where a decent company that has acted correctly is going to have to pay for a company that has not acted properly, and the evidence against the company which has acted properly is simply going to be an averment, a statement, on a piece of paper. It would be interesting to see 
 who would make the averment, whether it is somebody who knows in fact that the debt is due.
I think the concept behind this act—that there ought to be mutual help and responsibility between a group of companies or a group of people who pursue the same profession, employment or industry—is a good idea. I think it is proper that we come back to a communal idea of things rather than the individualistic one which is presently operating. If we are going to do that, it is proper that we treat everybody fairly so that the one who is responsible for the problems in the first place is not allowed to simply put all their burdens onto somebody else and that those other companies should be treated in the way that clause 4 of this particular bill treats them, not in the way that clause 13 treats them.
Turning to clause 8(1), it says:
(1) Subject to this section, levy on loading or unloading is payable by the person (the responsible person ) who was responsible for the loading or unloading (otherwise than in the capacity of agent of the owner or charterer of the ship).
That of course puts it onto the stevedoring companies. At clause 8(2) it says:
(2) If the responsible person is a body corporate, then the following persons are instead jointly and severally liable to pay the levy:
If in fact Patrick's, in this case, did not pay the levy, then other people are responsible—that is, the responsible person, Patrick's, and each other body corporate that is a related body corporate at the time of the loading or unloading. A responsible body is defined in section 50 of the Corporations Law as being:
(a)	 a holding company of another body corporate;
(b)	 a subsidiary of another body corporate; or
(c)	 a subsidiary of a holding company of another body corporate; the first-mentioned body and the other body are related to each other.
Of course, that concept goes against the stripping exercise that was performed by Patrick in this case, and that is good to see.
I conclude by simply saying that this bill does a lot of good things, though it has to be put into proper shape. But the tendency of 
 government to oppress people must be stopped. Simply because a person belongs to a company, simply because a person may come from a body that is seen as being powerful in the community or simply because a person is in a powerful position does not justify others treating them in a manner less than their civil rights demand.
This is an outrageous bill in terms of the civil rights it treads upon. Everybody—no matter whether they are the poorest or the richest, and all those in between—is entitled to civil rights. To simply pass the provisions that are set out in clause 4 of this particular bill seems to me to be quite outrageous.",SENATE,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-06-26,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I think it is clear that the opposition is not serious about waterfront reform. We know they had many years in which to make these changes and all we saw were incremental changes at great cost to taxpayers. We have a different approach, and we believe that we have the basis for real reform which can be achieved.
We have an effective statutory regime. Funds will be provided to support the reform and restructuring of stevedoring, not paid for by taxpayers, with all costs recovered by a levy on containers and vehicles. A number of people, particularly Senator Calvert, have argued strenuously and successfully to protect Tasmanian interests, and I note that the opposition now agrees that Tasmania should not be subject to the levy for Bass Strait trade.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, has already announced that there will be an exemption applying to local cargo. It was proposed to introduce an amendment to that effect, but we have been advised of some difficulties with it. Instead, a regulation will be introduced to take effect at the same time as the legislation comes into force. Mr Reith has discussed this approach with the Premier of Tasmania, who accepts it.
The legislation provides considerable incentives to stevedores to drive reform and to meet the government's productivity objec 
 tives. It allows them to reduce the appalling level of overmanning, improve training, reduce the unacceptable level of injury and introduce new technology. It does so in a manner and through a mechanism which ensures high levels of accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. More than two years ago the government committed itself to an active role in bringing desperately needed reform to a waterfront where overmanning and rorts prevailed. With this legislation, we deliver on that promise.
The MUA and the ACTU have now signed up to productivity improvements they have fought and rejected year after year. The legislation will ensure that the government, through the Maritime Industry Finance Co., will be able to pay redundancy benefits to at least 736 Patrick Stevedores employees at absolutely no cost to taxpayers. It will ensure that P&O Ports and indeed other stevedores will be able to implement a similar strategy in the near future. Within a few months, the government, through its unwavering determination, will have achieved dramatic and longlasting reform of the waterfront. The legislation is a key component in bringing that about. I commend the legislation to the chamber.
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-06-26,"—by leave—I seek clarification from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell). Earlier today and last night we were given to understand that it was the government's priority to get the appropriation bills on this afternoon, and undertakings were given on behalf of the opposition that we would facilitate those bills being carried this afternoon. I ask the manager: can he indicate to us now what is the government's priority?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-26,—by leave—The coalition wants to proceed with the program indicated on today's program and to complete consideration of the bill that is before the chamber and then move on to the appropriations and have those passed as quickly as possible.,SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-06-26,"—by leave—Last night it was put to the opposition that if the appropriation bills were not carried today then the employment of public servants would be brought into question next Wednesday. It was put to us that it was important for the chamber to carry those bills, that there would be a requirement for the Department of Finance, for some reason or other, to have time to process those bills. As a consequence, it was absolutely imperative that those bills be carried today.
On that basis, we offered to the government our every cooperation to see that those bills were carried today. Now we are told that the priority for the government is digital TV. This I find an extraordinary proposition, given that there have been other opportunities during the week to consider the appropriation bills.
—When were they?
—There were other opportunities—any time from when the reports of the estimates committees were brought into this chamber. We hear a great deal about the capacity of the opposition, as the government sees it, to frustrate this government's legislative program. It ought be understood that the reason we do not have the appropriations being debated and carried here this afternoon is that the government does not wish to give priority to those bills. We hear a great deal about the way in which the Senate treats the legislative program. I think it is important to get on the public record that so far this parliament 393 bills have been carried by this chamber. So far this year 84 bills have been carried. So far this week 22 bills have been carried.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Carr sought leave to make a short statement in response to mine. Leave was granted—and we do not want to stop him from making a short statement—but he is now going into a general rave about the program. I would ask Senator Carr to indicate how long he intends speaking for.
—It is not a point of order.
—It is a point of order. Leave was granted on the basis that he was going to make a brief statement.
—Order! Senator Carr, you did seek leave to make a short statement. I would ask you to keep it as short as possible in the best interests of the Senate.
—I appreciate your advice, Madam Acting Deputy President. This week we have carried 22 bills. As I say, we have carried 84 bills this year compared with 85 bills throughout the entire year of 1996, which was also an election year. This Senate has been working extraordinarily hard. In fact, the government has sought from the opposition, through discussions with the opposition, an additional 303 hours and 56 minutes of extra government business time in this chamber. If we take into account the normal calculation of the average hours given for 
 government business in any one week, which is about 15—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the Senate granted leave to Senator Carr to make a brief response to my statement. He is not responding to my statement. He is clearly not being brief. If Senator Carr wants to make a short statement he should do so and allow the Senate to get on with the consideration of the next bill. He should bring his remarks to a conclusion and allow the Senate chamber to get on with the next item of business, which we expected to get to at 10.30 this morning. It is now 1.30 in the afternoon.
—Senator Campbell, you are beginning to debate the point of order now.
—I would like Senator Carr to undertake to bring his remarks to a conclusion, as he has committed to all of his colleagues in the Senate when he asked leave from them and as he undertook to you less than a few minutes ago.
—Senator Carr, I have asked you to be brief. I would ask you to conclude your remarks.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I seek clarification of new definition that the Senate appears to have introduced for the word `brief'.
—When the Senate gives leave for a senator to make a brief statement it is in a situation of trust that the person gives a brief statement. Senator Carr gave a brief statement. Senator Campbell gave a brief statement. It is now getting a little long, and I think it is testing the patience of the Senate. Senator Carr, I would ask you to rise and finish your statement as quickly as possible in the best interests of the Senate.
—Thank you very much for your advice. As I have indicated, I have been speaking for about three minutes. I have asked for leave to give a brief statement. I intend to be brief, and the longer you take in terms of spurious points of order—
—Senator Carr, do not speak directly at Senator 
 Campbell across the chamber. Refer your comments through the chair and speak on the topic that you have asked leave to speak on.
—The longer senators take spurious points of order to try to detract from the fact that this government has so badly managed its legislative program—
—Senator Carr, resume your seat. Speak on the issue that you sought leave to speak on or I will ask you to sit down.
—The government has badly managed its legislative program. It has sought our cooperation, which has been granted to the tune of the equivalent of an additional 20 sitting weeks in this parliament for government business. We are happy to discuss the legislative program, as the government determines it. The priorities are set by government. It is no good for the government to argue in the press gallery or in the public arena generally that the legislative program has been frustrated by the opposition and that we do not have the appropriation bills before the parliament because of the actions of the opposition.
—Senator Carr, you are testing my patience.
—It must be clearly understood: the reason we do not have the appropriation bills before this parliament is the government.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-06-26,"—I seek leave to make a very short statement in the way of a question to the Manager of Government Business about the program.
—Is it less than a minute?
—It will take about two minutes at the most.
—A question takes two minutes?
—I would have finished it by now if you had not interjected on me.
—Is leave granted for two minutes?
Leave granted.
—My question is to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate because he was not clear in his comments in response to Senator Carr. Is it clear that the government gives a higher priority today and next Monday to the passage of the digital television bill, as it is commonly called, than the passage of the appropriation bill? Will the digital bill, in all its stages, have to be completed before the appropriation bill is brought back?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-26,"—by leave—I thank my colleagues in the Senate. I thank Senator Schacht for that very sensible question. The reality is that we sought a series of agreements from the Labor Party, which were given with caveats in relation to concluding the stevedoring bill by last night. One of those undertakings involved reducing the speakers list from four to three. It was reduced from four to three, but then all of a sudden it went up to four again. We were told that the bill should be finished by about 10.30 this morning, but we finished it at about 12.50 p.m.
We have always indicated that we would like to have the appropriation bills finished by this afternoon. By 1 o'clock, it became clear that that would be impossible to deliver. We would now like the so-called digital package to be considered and voted on by the Senate this afternoon. On the best advice from the government's advisers and the Attorney-General's office, we understand that if we can have the appropriation bills finished by early on Monday the government's requirements will be met. Our priorities are to conclude the digital package this afternoon and to conclude the appropriation bills on Monday.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-06-26,"—Again, I seek leave to ask a very short question about the same matter.
—This is time wasting.
—It is not.
—Is leave granted for 
 Senator Schacht to ask a very short question that will take no more than one minute?
Leave granted.
—I ask the Manager of Government Business the simple question: will you insist on the whole digital bill being voted on in all its stages through to the third reading before the appropriation bills are brought back on?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-26,"—by leave—The government would like to see the digital package finished before we leave here this afternoon. We cannot insist on anything in this place. We would then like to deal with the appropriation bills on Monday. That is the government's clear intention, and that is what we would like the Senate to do. If the Senate would like to continue dealing with the legislative program and pass more than the three bills it has passed this week other than the non-controversial legislation, the best it can do is respect the taxpayers who fund this place and deal with some legislation. That is what the taxpayers of Australia expect us to do, not to play little games.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-06-26,"—I seek leave to make a short one-minute statement.
Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-06-26,"—Before I get to the merits of the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 , I want to make a comment about the process.
—Take as long as you like. You have 20 minute to rabbit on about the process. If you want to show your policy inadequacies, that's fine.
—Here we go; here is the dopey minister.
—Senator Schacht, that is not appropriate. Withdraw it.
—That he is dopey?
—That is not appropriate.
—I withdraw it. I was seeking leave to ask some questions. Though I am shadow minister and believe that the digital conversion bill is extremely important to the future of broadcasting in Australia, I find it extraordinary that the government would put it ahead of the passage of the appropriation bills, which supply money for all government activities in Australia. The government now says that that is the process. They will not indicate to us whether the full bill has to be carried.
This digital bill cannot be dealt with in all its stages in the just over two hours we have before us in the Senate this afternoon. There are a number of speakers on the second reading debate. I would be surprised if there were not a large number of senators on all sides who would like to express a few views about the future of broadcasting in Australia as it relates not only to the next year or so but to the next decade and a half. There are provisions in this bill that apply well into the end of the next decade. This is not an inconsequential matter.
When the Senate committee was considering the bill, the government dumped on the opposition something like 70 technical amendments without warning. That was fine; we always accept that governments have to refine things. However, they were dumped without warning. The Senate committee tabled its report last Tuesday. Madam Acting Deputy President Patterson, you were the chair of that committee, which made a number of recommendations in a majority report, and the Labor Party made some recommendations in a minority report. But we are still to hear from the minister whether any of these suggested amendments, even those from his government colleagues, will be accepted.
It is very difficult for the opposition to plan a range of amendments when we do not yet know what the government responses to even its own Liberal senators' recommendations are. If the minister believes that without that information we can deal with the committee stage today, let alone the second reading stage, I inform him that it is impossible. I want to know at some stage when the minister will respond to the report tabled on Tuesday 
 this week. He is making a mockery of his own Senate committee chaired by you, Madam Deputy President. We will go ahead with the debate, which I am more than happy to, but I place on the record the opposition's attitude towards the treatment of this bill.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. For Senator Schacht's benefit, I have advice that there is no obligation on the government to respond to a report of a legislation committee before the legislation on which it is reported is debated in the Senate. It is also not a common practice.
—Senator Alston, it is not a point of order to interrupt a speaker. You have an appropriate place to say that.
—I knew that that would be the response of the minister. This is a bill full of technicalities. If the minister really is genuine about trying to get agreement so that the bill gets through the parliament quickly, he would have taken the cooperative approach of informing other parties in the Senate what his view is on the recommendations contained in this report, including those from government members, who have made sensible recommendations which we in the Labor Party support.
I will turn now to the bill itself. The Labor Party has complained strongly and loudly about how this issue was dealt with by the government. In July of last year the Australian Broadcasting Authority issued a discussion paper about the issues related to the introduction of digital television in Australia. It was a very reasonable discussion paper but not a totally comprehensive paper; they never imagined it would be. One of the things they pointed out in their recommendations was that the legislation to establish digital television broadcasting in Australia did not have to be introduced in the parliament until October this year for a start-up date in metropolitan Australia beginning 1 January 2000. That was their recommendation; that was their considered time scale.
But what does the minister's legislation do? It says it has to be dealt with before the end of this parliamentary session—the end of next 
 week—for a start-up date a year later, 1 January 2001, in the metropolitan area. So even the ABA in a discussion paper some 11 months ago gave a quite different timetable for the handling and introduction of digital television. The minister has brought into the parliament a completely different timetable from that of the independent authority.
When that discussion paper came out, there was nothing more done by the government—except, obviously, for internal discussion with the minister, with various media players and with parliamentary colleagues on his side of politics—until a couple of months ago when the legislation was tabled in the parliament. It went through the House of Representatives and was referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. We had no objection to the ERCA committee handling it, and we accept that the government has a majority on the committee.
We pointed out at the time that the issues contained in the bill are so important, so detailed and so technical that a more convenient reporting date would be the beginning of the next session in late August-early September. The various interest groups, of which there are quite a few with very strong views on all aspects of the bill, could then look at the legislation, consider their responses, and there could be decent hearings with no rushed timetable. We could then have the report available and the legislation could be dealt with in the Senate at the beginning of the next session. But that was rejected by the government. They convinced Senator Harradine to vote with them on the basis that there was enough time.
During the hearings we heard plenty of complaints from people who felt they had had to rush submissions in. They complained that they could not handle all the detail and that they had had to put in supplementary comments. I might say that everyone was given every opportunity to put material before the committee. Senator Patterson, the chair of the committee, and all members of the committee were cooperative in giving everyone the opportunity to put in supplementary comments and to respond to other submissions. 
 But I still say it was a very rushed process and that a number of issues we are now dealing with have been affected as a consequence.
I think there is a strong perception now abroad amongst the public that the government was more interested in reaching an internal political agreement with certain free to air television stations for their own political purposes than they were in trying to get a well-established bipartisan approach to the introduction of digital television.
The opposition has never opposed the introduction of digital television. We made it clear from the beginning that we support the introduction of digital television in Australia. We agreed from the beginning with the timetable of the government. We may have changed a date here or there, but there had to be some certainty given.
We support the government's start-up date of 1 January 2001. We support the simulcast period for both analog and digital up to 2008. We support the general definition and comments the government has made, though the devil is in the detail, regarding the descriptions of multi-channelling and that the free to air commercials will not be able to multi-channel and will not be able to provide digital television to get into subscription television or pay TV. As we made clear from the beginning, we support the general thrust of the government's legislation.
As the evidence mounted and the hearings progressed, there was a lot of disagreement about how the technical description will actually work. The way in which the government have drafted this legislation covers the fact that, in their rush to get this through, they have not drafted legislation in enough detail to provide that certainty. On last count they have established, I think, four committees of review that will report to the minister on technical and standards issues, et cetera, and the minister will then either accept or reject their recommendations. In most cases it appears they will introduce the rules for the introduction of digital television by way of disallowable instrument.
During the hearings it became clear that there is significant disagreement between the 
 various interest groups and media about what the government definitions might or might not be, on such things as datacasting, enhancement and multi-channelling. If we get this legislation wrong—by accident, not by deliberate means—because we make a mistake in the technicalities, we could actually give a big economic gift to one side of the media compared with another. I have to say that is one reason alone why the rush with this legislation is unfortunate.
For example, the definition of multi-channelling given by the potential datacasters is that digital datacasting means they would be moving into some form of broadcasting. That is what they think datacasting means. To listen to Mr Branigan's evidence to the committee, his definition of enhancement of the digital signal I thought described multi-channelling, but he believed it was a legitimate description of enhancing that was not multi-channelling. I thought his description described multi-channelling.
These are issues that have not yet been clarified in the government's bill. They say, `Trust us; we will go off and have reviews, and those reviews will make recommendations to me, the minister, and, therefore, in a number of cases we will come back with a disallowable instrument.'
In a number of these areas I do not think it is a satisfactory process to rely on a disallowable instrument because at that stage of the debate the government will say, `You do not support our regulation and you are delaying it; therefore you are creating uncertainty et cetera.' That position will be put upon those in the Senate who disagree. That is not the way to make good public policy and for the parliament to get the outline correct of how digital television should operate in Australia.
We believe, therefore, that the amendments that we will be moving will actually establish the principles upon which the free to airs will know they can move into digital television and start preparing with certainty. We will be moving amendments to take out of the act, and leave for further discussion and review by the minister, certain matters. When he completes those reviews, he comes back to the parliament with further amendments to the 
 legislation. They include definitions of datacasting, multi-channelling and enhancement. He also comes back to the parliament with information about the system: whether we will use the European or the American system for broadcasting the digital signal, and what the industry arrangements are that we will have to encourage as much as possible, with the introduction of the digital system into Australia, the manufacture of both the hardware and the software in Australia to create Australian jobs.
If the digital uptake is successful, billions of dollars will be spent by Australian consumers over the next decade or more as they buy the equipment. If that is all imported, it will be a significant further addition to the current account deficit. Why don't we see how much of this can be done in Australia to create jobs in Australia? Those issues ought to be reported back and ought to be in the legislation so that clear guidelines are given by the parliament about the development of this industry.
In a number of these areas we will move amendments to the government's position on these technical standards and industry development procedures, because too much is left wide open in this bill and accordingly there is too much uncertainty. We do not believe that is the best way in which to proceed with what should be a very exciting development, not only in Australian broadcasting but in Australian communications. If done properly and achieved properly—and I am sure the opposition and the government have a bipartisan view on this—this will be an exciting opportunity for Australia to establish itself as one of the countries in the forefront of the new communication and information distribution systems of the 21st century. That would not only be of major entertainment value but, above all, an economic advantage for our country.
The most controversial issue in this bill before the parliament is the ban on any new commercial television free to air broadcast licences being issued until 2008. The minister has been broadly and roundly condemned by some media interests for providing this ban for such a long period. The opposition's view, which has already been publicly announced, 
 is that we believe a ban is justified to a reasonable extent, because the free to air television stations will be up for a significant investment in new equipment and it will be costly, during that period of simulcast, to run both analog and digital signals. Those are reasonable and genuine issues. We do not deny, and have never denied, that there should be an appropriate period for not only the simulcast but also the ban, and our amendment will be to reduce it from 2008 to 2006.
I notice in editorials in some newspapers we are still being criticised in that this is supposedly too generous to the free to airs; other people say we should have supported the government, but that is a matter for genuine debate. We believe the balance is about right in this area. But one thing we will make clear is that the ban ends in 2006 under our amendment and there will be no review in the legislation, from our point of view, to allow any consideration for further review to extend the ban beyond that date. We believe that is fair warning to all the free to airs: they get the ban out to 2006 and plan accordingly. Before that time the government of the day may wish to have a review of whether it is possible to have further commercial free to air broadcasting licences issued in Australia. As a normal, open, public process we would support that. That is a decision of the government of the day.
In conclusion, we believe the real opportunity in this bill is to provide Australians with a new form of enhanced entertainment: bigger and better screens with high definition; more attractive viewing—particularly in the reproduction quality of what are now normal cinemascope screens—of films, sporting and nature programs et cetera. We believe that will all be welcomed by consumers, but we also see that the digital revolution will enable Australians to have better access to all the new forms of information distribution. The new digital television receivers—whether they are HDTV, high definition television, or standard digital—will also be able to be used to receive all the other ranges of information that the digital system can provide.
This is where we get convergence or crossover between broadcasting and communication. That will be an ongoing debate, not confined just to the time of this bill. Those are issues which will be raised here in the debate on the amendments, but I do not think conclusions will be reached. We want an open system because, from time to time, legislation will have to be revisited as technology changes the regulatory structure, whether we like it or not.
We support the belief that digital television is a major step forward. We also accept that it will be one of the few times in the history of this country at the national level that parliament will carry legislation that will ultimately say, `Your existing television analog set at a certain date will go off air. It will go blank, and you will have to buy a new television set or a device to convert your existing set.' We accept—and we support this happening for the wider national interest—that consumers will be forced to pay money in that regard. Consumers have not yet quite woken up to this because these issues are still years out. We accept that this is a very important consumer issue. The evidence we received from the consumers association dealing with this issue was very thoughtful and well put together.
So this is an important bill. Not only must it handle the introduction of digital television but also it must ensure that it is done in an orderly way and in the broad national interest. Because the government have rushed this legislation for their own political purposes they will not achieve the best outcome and we will move our amendments accordingly.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-06-26,"—The Democrats accept that the shift from an analog terrestrial digital broadcasting environment to a digital one is inevitable. The conversion to digital television broadcasting represents the greatest change in broadcasting technology since the commencement of television, not only in Australia but also throughout the world. Further, the conversion from analog to digital broadcasting provides the government with a unique opportunity to reassess broadcasting and 
 telecommunications policy without obviously proscribed outcomes. The government has prepared this legislation, principally the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 , to set the parameters for discussion and the substantial technical and policy work and economic investment in broadcasting that must inevitably follow.
But the Democrats believe the legislation raises many more questions about digital terrestrial television broadcasting than it answers. By the very nature of the technology it is not unexpected. The debate is complicated because in many ways it is a technical debate. The way the digital images and text are transmitted makes digital technology very special. Digital transmissions can be compressed and manipulated and the possibilities arising in a digital broadcasting environment mean that we should be very circumspect in the way we deal with the policy issues and any accompanying legislation such as this.
This bill has been given quite remarkable priority by the government, with no good explanation why. Theories abound, of course, but it comes down to this: the government should allow the parliament proper time to consider all of the extremely complex issues. I will spell out the main elements of the government's decision. The five free to air networks will be lent seven megahertz of spectrum free of up-front charges. In return they will be required to simulcast analog and digital television for eight years from the commencement of digital broadcasting in 2001. After that period the networks have to return the equivalent of the loaned spectrum back to the Commonwealth. The free to air broadcasters will be required to commence digital broadcasts in 1 January 2001 and in regional areas from 1 January 2004.
Free to airs will be required to broadcast minimum levels of high definition television with these levels increasing over time. If the free to airs do not comply with these requirements, they will forfeit their loaned digital spectrum. They will be permitted to use the part of their loaned spectrum not required for digital broadcasts to provide datacasting services. They will have to pay a fee for these services, which are the subject of the 
 Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998. Available broadcasting spectrum will be auctioned to other datacasting service providers. Datacasting services will also commence in 2001.
Free to airs will not be able to provide multi-channel services or subscription services, although they will be permitted to provide enhanced services, so long as they are directly linked to the program being simulcast on the analog channel. A prohibition on new commercial free to air entrants will apply until December 2008.
Local content requirements will continue to apply. In addition, free to air broadcasters will have to provide closed captioning for all prime time programs as well as for news and current affairs programs broadcast outside prime time. The government is considering allowing the national broadcasters the ABC and SBS—to multi-channel in line with their charter obligations. I agree with that. The government will also undertake several statutory reviews between now and 2005 on technical and policy issues arising from this conversion.
Digital broadcasting systems have been designed to operate using the same channel bandwidth as analog systems to enable integration with the current use of the spectrum. A single digital transmitter provides the capacity to send about 20 million bits per second—20 megabits—of data to the home. This signal is sufficient to provide one high definition television broadcast of a sporting event, or possibly two high definition movie channels. The signal is also capable of providing three or four live sports programs equivalent to current broadcasting quality. It might also be enough to provide up to six `talking heads' programs. The capacity to replace a single analog channel with several other channels is called `multi-channelling'.
The spare capacity created by digital transmission can also be used to provide captioning, news and market information and other data services. These services, no matter what form they are in, are referred to as `datacasting'. So, the possibilities of new forms of broadcasting services that we already 
 know about are vastly different from those we currently receive.
The government should remain mindful of the cost to the consumer of the equipment and the ability of either system to achieve well-constructed spectrum use. It is extremely difficult to estimate the costs of conversion from analog to digital terrestrial television broadcasting. The commercial networks estimate the costs of conversion for the three commercial networks to be somewhere between $500 million and $740 million. They also claim the conversion will add $30 million to $40 million to their annual operating costs. These costs have been taken for granted in the government's policy.
In his personal message, the minister stated:
The government is loaning the free to air networks . . . the spectrum required to provide HDTV during their simulcast period . . . because the networks will effectively have to pay twice their normal transmission costs in addition to the estimated $500 million for new digital transmitters, studios and production facilities.
To receive digital television, consumers will require either a new digital television set or a set top box to convert the digital signal back to analog. The set top box will not improve the picture quality but it will eliminate interference such as ghosting and will provide CD quality sound. To receive HDTV, consumers will have to purchase a wide screen, high definition television set.
At this stage it is impossible to determine the costs of either the set top box or HDTV set. I have heard estimates of about $1,500 for a set top box, and HDTV sets may cost up to $15,000 each. With that kind of cost, can we be guaranteed that the majority of Australians will want to purchase high definition television sets? The government thinks so, because their policy relies on it. The commercial stations argue that they need the spectrum at no cost because it would enable them to broadcast in high definition and that is what consumers will want to view. But will we? Who has asked us? We might prefer to keep our old televisions, purchase a set top box and receive more channels and more services.
The ABC estimates digital conversion will cost under $200 million for them—of course 
 they are metropolitan and regional. The ABC has offered to partially self-fund its conversion by `rationalising property holdings' in line with recommendations in the Mansfield review. However, the minister mistrusted the ABC's estimates and referred their funding submission to Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance for an independent assessment.
It is interesting to note that the minister once accused former Prime Minister Paul Keating of conducting a personal vendetta against the ABC. So who is the ABC supposed to be biased in favour of? Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance found in favour of the ABC's estimates. Despite this, the government has provided the ABC with only $20.8 million over the next five years, and this figure does not include transmission costs. If it is going to cost the commercial broadcasters up to $740 million, and they operate in five major capital cities, and the ABC is national, why would the minister not trust their estimate?
Some estimates suggest that the real cost of digital conversion is likely to be a small proportion of the estimated $1 billion, including regional commercial broadcasters, identified by the networks themselves; possibly even half.	One estimate that appears reasonable is that conversion costs will be in the range of $60 million to $80 million for all three networks on a five capital city basis, and the regionals at approximately $100 million to $130 million, making a total of no more than $210 million maximum. That is one-fifth of their own costings. The purchase of digital equipment is already under way, and has been for some time, under normal studio equipment replacement cycles. Much remains unclear about the real costs to broadcasters of digital conversion. We do not doubt that digital conversion will be expensive, but, if these costings are wrong, or inaccurate in any way, it calls into question the whole basis on which the government has predicated much of its digital policy and this legislation.
An essential element of the digital package is the moratorium on new commercial entrants until 2008. The commercial networks will tell you, as the minister has done, that this is crucial because of the investment required for 
 the maintenance of the quality and diversity of services available to consumers. Is a moratorium on new entrants until 2008 logical? Given the potential for new services to emerge in digital technology, new entrants could add to the diversity of product and services rather than detract from them. Furthermore, it appears likely that new entrants would face the same infrastructure costs as their established counterparts, because they are not granted free spectrum space and they would incur fees, taxes and other liabilities. Surely, too, the advertising industry would welcome a new and different market.
The Democrats question the need to rush this decision on the introduction of digital broadcasting, because there are too many unknowns in this policy—legal, technical and economic unknowns. Regional broadcasters are, of course, quite different from their metropolitan counterparts, and they are worthy of separate consideration. Regional broadcasters are defined in two groups: multistation regional broadcasters and solus station—only station—regional broadcasters. Regional broadcasters have higher transmission costs per viewer than metropolitan broadcasters and require more relay stations and more transmission towers to cover a wider area. This results in higher infrastructure and operating costs. Most do not have the resources to produce their own programs, apart from local news and current affairs, so they purchase their product from Australian networks or from overseas broadcasters. In aggregated markets, licensees have an affiliation agreement with one of the major networks to provide most of their programming. Licence fees are lower for regional broadcasters, reflecting the lower advertising revenues they receive.
Regional commercial broadcasters have requested the same assistance in the transition to digital that they received in the equalisation process of the late 1980s, with special attention afforded to solus markets. While they may have some good arguments, we would like to give this issue further consideration. Naturally, we will remain open to the possibility that the most appropriate and cost-efficient technical way to offer digital televi 
 sion services to regional and remote Australia might not be the same as that for metropolitan Australia.
The committee heard evidence that mandating high definition broadcasting is neither desirable nor sustainable. The Australian Consumers Association predicted that HDTV will fail because the equipment will be too expensive and consumers will opt for increased services rather than enhanced picture quality. This is a distinct possibility. But, rather than being able to debate the merits of the government's model through scrutiny of an exposure draft, consideration of other models, including more flexible licensing and revenue raising mechanisms, cannot be explored because we are going through this right now. The minister will say that this is impossible under the bill because, if the commercials do not broadcast in high definition, they will lose their spectrum allocation. Yes indeed, that is what the legislation says. But I must say I would be surprised if that actually happened. I would be interested to see if anybody actually wanted to do that or if they were prepared to try to amend the legislation.
In terms of provision of service, should broadcasters be treated any differently to telecommunications carriers? Convergence may make the distinction increasingly murky. In fact, I think it will. Both are, as I said earlier, essential services. I would like to quote here the United States regulator, the FCC, as food for thought. They are talking about their own plans. They say:
The FCC's plan was developed . . . promoting high definition television. . . . The idea was that broadcasters would use the new spectrum to transmit just one signal that would be simultaneous and identical to the analogue signal, except for its high resolution, or so called high definition. This high resolution would be so attractive that Americans would naturally elect to purchase the new high definition televisions. Then standard TVs would be abandoned and today's analogue spectrum would be returned to the public and used for other purposes. Therefore, the scheme was labelled a transition, and the new spectrum was called a second channel . . . After the spectrum was awarded in the US, broadcast executives admitted that despite all the talk about high definition, they were not sure that's what they were going to do. 

So the terms constrain our imaginations about what really may be possible in the digital environment. We assume the system will be similar to analog, because that is our experience so far. We would be wise to watch developments overseas to learn from their mistakes, rather than making our own.
The bill applies current local content standards to the digital environment, but the recent High Court decision in the Project Blue Sky case disallows the Australian Broadcasting Authority's right to give preference to Australian programs. The committee heard that the Broadcasting Services Act should be amended in order to preserve the integrity of and the government's commitment to the Australian content standard. The committee noted that the government is awaiting the findings of the ABA's inquiry into the High Court's decision. However, the ABA's powers in relation to its review of content standards are limited. The ABA cannot determine if the legislation should be changed, but must create a standard which complies with the High Court's ruling. One of the most important aspects of this debate is that Australian content standards do not fall. They must not fall. This issue is therefore integral to the bill.
Datacasting is a new service which digital technology makes possible. Datacasting delivers information in the form of data, text, speech, images, or in any other form. While not wanting to limit new technologies or the advent of new services within a digital broadcasting environment, the Democrats do not believe it is appropriate to wait for the review in 2001 to determine the adequacy of the definition of datacasting. The number of unclear areas in the definitions of both datacasting and broadcasting are problematic. This is another section of the bill which requires further investigation.
Commercial free to air networks are not allowed to provide multi-channel services, but they are permitted to provide enhanced services, which must be incidental and directly linked to a program that is simulcast in analog and digital. The explanatory memorandum states that different visual representations of the same event, like viewing the event from different camera angles, will be permit 
 ted. The committee heard that there is a difference of opinion between the department and the commercial networks about this because the department believes that this may amount to multi-channelling. So the definitions may be too broad.
The term `event' also implicitly defines a program type—like live sports—but the actual program may not be live, may not be a sports program or may not even be an event. A lifestyle program, for example, might provide an enhanced service in the form of a shopping guide or other linked video content. Although not intended by this definition, in practical terms, this may be multi-channelling. Further review of this issue is obviously required.
We support the national broadcasters providing multi-channel services so long as those services are within their charter obligations. But since the government has not finalised its decision in this regard, how can the provision be legislated? Such an important broadcasting service should not be subject to ministerial discretion, subject to disallowance under subordinate legislation.
The Democrats have serious concerns regarding the policy environment in which the decisions about digital broadcasting are currently being made. The government's policy framework for the conversion from analog to digital is based on assumptions derived from analog broadcasting. The decision to mandate HDTV and not allow new entrants until 2008 exemplifies this. The ban on the entry of new broadcasters may have the effect of further concentrating media power, limiting the diversity of content and the possibility of the introduction of new and innovative services. This requires further and ongoing investigation.
Despite the vital importance digital broadcasting has for the broadcasting future, there has been very little public debate. It is incumbent upon this government to ensure that all consumers are made aware of the importance of the introduction of digital broadcasting, with the policy objectives clearly stated and open to critique. This process should occur before the introduction of legislation, as we understand will be the case with digital radio.
Because digital technology allows for the compression of data, current single-service providers can become multi-service providers. This in itself is a matter of great public interest, with important consequences for consumers in terms of how these services are offered, accessed and regulated. So while these bills add to a legislative framework covering analog technology, they in no way deal with digital technology and the other possibilities that that creates.
The implementation of digital television requires some crucial safeguards including: clear and unambiguous definitions; an open access regime; application of universal standards and a universal service guarantee; a use it or lose it approach to the spectrum; clear benchmarks for digital conversion, with public reporting by the regulator, subject to parliamentary scrutiny prior to implementation and/or legislative amendment; and new entrants should be given access to the spectrum if the benchmarks are not met.
It is crucial that the parliament pass legislation reflecting its importance and which benefits Australia's consumers. We do not support this legislation in its current form and recommend that the government allow the parliament time to further investigate. We can do this now, report back and probably pass the legislation in the next session. That would mean that the legislation could be passed before Christmas.
I would like conclude by reminding the current minister of a statement he made on 16 September 1992, when the report of the Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services was tabled. He said that the committee report was presented in `an impossibly tight deadline, one that quite clearly was entirely politically motivated. It ought to be apparent that with issues of such complexity it is highly desirable that as much time as possible is allowed to explore these issues. This is yet another graphic illustration of the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of those who are not interested in getting policy right, but simply obsessed with getting politics right'. I think the minister was talking about a 12-week period for the committee to look into the introduc 
 tion of pay TV in Australia. So what is another 16 weeks when legislation as important as this is being debated?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-06-26,"—I rise to speak to these broadcasting and datacasting bills and to indicate that we will be moving a second reading amendment. The issue of high definition television goes far deeper and far further than the issues that are present within the body of these bills. I believe we are dealing with the guidelines and the parameters within which digital content and the means by which it will be delivered to Australian people for at least the next two decades is being determined.
The degree of technological specificity contained within these bills is absolutely ludicrous. I believe that these bills will constrain the opportunities of many new and existing suppliers of digital content. From a social perspective, the means by which Australians receive information into their homes and into their workplaces is absolutely critical and it is a genuine issue for government consideration. This interface between information and the general public is something that warrants far more than a rushed, flawed process of consideration.
The  Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  and the  Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998  television broadcasting services digital convention data charge imposition bill 1998 both represent policy expressing limited scope and no acknowledgment of the convergence of digital content and the convergence of technologies generally. The bills and the mechanisms that they describe in the introduction of high definition TV do more to divert attention from the issues that are at stake than draw attention to what the government needs to do.
The importance of how governments manage television content generally and how it is delivered can probably be best described in the language they know best. Revenues derived from the presentation of that content through advertising and other means lends some weight to understanding the powers that are at play when parliaments are asked to consider such matters. The Organisation for 
 Economic Cooperation and Development's working party on the information economy recently provided a report entitled Content as a new growth industry provides statistical information about the distribution of advertising spending in the OECD across the various media. Television, not surprisingly, significantly leads the pack.
Convergence has been completely ignored in this debate, at a time when there is so much evidence around us about the bringing together of digitised content and technological developments that do not even lend themselves towards a passion for taking up high definition television, but indeed trend towards another direction.
I would like to turn to that other direction now. Currently there is a trend away from broadcast TV, and the Internet and Web TV are eating away at traditional television markets. High definition TV is very much about trying to restore these markets. It is an attempt very much to try to halt this decline in audience.
To highlight this shift we can turn to the USA, where over 400,000 Americans already access Web TV and, because these users do not necessarily require a separate PC to access the World Wide Web, many consumers are showing a preference for Web TV over both traditional broadcast services or traditional PC-based Internet access.
They are dissatisfied with this trend away and, to make my point further, Web TV or the Internet access through a television set—not necessarily Web TV, which is a Microsoft product—is here. I refer to an article from the Australian from earlier this year which says you can purchase a Web TV set top box for some $800 and have access rates that are hugely competitive on current Internet access rates on a PC based system. So we are not talking about technology that is still around the corner; we are talking about technology that is present now.
If this government were to look at convergence in a holistic way, we would not be looking at a bill that deals with high definition television—we would be looking at a bill which addresses converging technologies, which addresses digital content and digital 
 content delivery mechanisms holistically, and that embraces other legislation that currently cover these matters. Instead, in fine and typical form, this government did not look beyond their short-sighted vision, they did not look to where technology was taking us and put in place an outline or provide for a mechanism so we could move towards some sort of broadly convergence based legislation that addresses these issues. They have stuck to a narrow definition.
The free to airs have played a significant role in this and it seems that Minister Alston has once again been very content to dance to the tune of the corporate players who have a stake in the particular sector with which he is working. As a result, there are many unanswered questions about the actual value of the spectrum and the forgone revenue that this government is proposing under this legislation draws into stark contrast how this government intends, first, to provide for the transition to digital TV; second, to utilise what is a public resource in the most effective way possible; and, third, to decide what is fair for a sector that is competing in the new technological environment.
Some of the media players argue that in giving away spectrum new participants and, therefore, greater consumer choice, have not been considered. The point of whether or not this spectrum could be auctioned, and hence deliver perhaps billions of dollars in revenue, is one that must be considered in the context of this bill.
The government proposes to loan the commercial and national free to airs seven megahertz of spectrum without any up-front charges. They also propose to prevent any new free-to-air entrants from operating before December 2008. The trade-off is that the FTAs must simulcast their existing broadcast for eight years. They will be allowed to use parts of these loaned spectrum that are not used for digital terrestrial television broadcasting for datacasting services. But, as you have already heard, there is no definition of these additional services. SBS and the ABC in particular are being allowed multichannelling. I think this is an appropriate means as they are in the best position to provide a better 
 service for all Australians, not just those in the metropolitan or densely populated areas. Regional broadcasters too have a strong argument for financial assistance and they too will need to be provided for.
I would like now to turn back to the issue of convergence. In Australia there are many corporate alliances that point to the folly behind this legislation. They point to issues that, as a parliament, we must be mindful of. A $50 million on-line joint venture between PBL, Microsoft and Telstra is an example of on-line print and television convergence. This arrangement will channel more than 180,000 Internet users through Telstra's big pond Internet product towards 9MSN.
It will give 9MSN a significant competitive advantage while securing for Telstra a vital edge over Internet service providers. Because of this deal, Telstra's big pond subscribers get automatic access to 9MSN's content service. In return, Telstra will conduct all the billing for 9MSN.
There are serious implications for the non-free to air players with respect to this arrangement: 9MSN's Internet data centre, with a combined disk space of 1,819 gigabytes and 8.7 gigabytes of RAM will be able to provide the largest bandwidth capacity in Australia. Therefore, video and audio streaming and the transmission of digital TV will be available not through the spectrum but through Telstra's copper and local loop networks. Looking at the leverage that these arrangements provide, does that mean that 9MSN, the Nine Network and Microsoft will become the main providers of Internet content on television sets?
With respect to web TV, there are already many hundreds of users of the Microsoft product in the US. It is an established product. Not only has the government given the three commercial networks a huge presence at present in the seven megahertz spectrum but also they are allowing them to gain an advantage in the context of convergence and Internet based TV. Other Internet content deliverers—such as the services that Fairfax, OzEmail and others provide—will perhaps have fewer opportunities to purchase spectrum left over after the usage of each seven mega 
 hertz of grouping within the spectrum allocation.
Where do the consumers come in? To highlight the dangers of converging technologies to consumers in the context of these corporate alignments, I turn to a recent announcement by AT&T, the largest telecommunications carrier in the US. They have just announced a deal that sees them taking over a service in the US called TCI, which currently supplies 14 million cable customers in the US. The relationships between the providers of Internet content, Internet service providers, broadcaster service providers and telecommunications carriers have a serious relevance to and implication for this debate.
The resulting product in people's homes is a digital web based blend on their TV sets. At this point in time, with this legislation, Australia can look forward to a Bill Gates entry point to the Internet. I do not believe this is a desirable outcome for digital content and digital services delivery. We know the Microsoft Corporation buys satellites and enters partnerships with telecommunications carriers around the world. They understand there is a direct transfer of technologies for consumers who perhaps do not require the full capabilities of a PC to access the Internet; consumers who want to get onto the World Wide Web as consumers of other products, as seekers of information and as people who like decent, comprehensive, good quality and, more than likely, interactive entertainment.
The convergence of technologies in this way must be considered now. It must be considered in the context of these bills because, if it is not, government will once again be significantly marginalised in the decision making process around these issues. Mind you, it is only important to have the government in any position of usefulness if, in fact, they have shown their competence in addressing the issues.
In concluding my comments today I would like to make a couple of points. This particular piece of legislation cannot be considered in isolation from other events that have both occurred in this place legislatively within the agenda of the government and are occurring with corporate realignments in Australia and 
 throughout the world. The privatisation of Telstra means that the physical infrastructure, our telecommunications network, will become the conduit for much more than just our telephone calls, our faxes and our emails. Potentially, that network will deliver a digital TV service that will be controlled and managed by ninemsn. That is Bill Gates, and that is Kerry Packer.
The arrangements confined within this legislation close off opportunities for digital content to be presented and provided by other content providers. In the context of what has happened to the ABC, who currently lead the world in the provision of digital content, we start to see a very disturbing picture.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-26,"—This package of legislation, the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  and the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998 , is being pushed through the Senate under the guise of urgency. One argument coming from the government and the commercial networks seems to go along the lines that the free to air commercial stations require legislative certainty in order to make their investment. Another argument bandied around is that Australia is behind the rest of the world and consumers deserve to catch up. A final argument is that the three commercial television networks need the carrot of free access to continue to invest in, and broadcast, Australian content to the levels currently required. These arguments do not particularly impress the Greens.
Let us start with the requirement for legislative certainty to make investment. The argument for legislative certainty for such a significant investment goes beyond that basic tenet; the argument goes beyond mere legislative certainty for investment and includes substantive certainty as well. The argument proceeds as follows: without free spectrum and without a ban on competition—those two things would be provided by the legislative certainty—the whole thing could send the free to air operators to the wall.
The argument raises two questions. First of all, is the choice right? If the technology is so expensive that the free to airs just cannot go 
 it alone, perhaps we should question whether it is the right choice. If consumer demand is so uncertain, why is the government hell-bent on ensuring that digital TV becomes a reality as soon as possible?
We are not talking about equity issues. We are not talking about a social good. We are not talking about essential services that make substantive differences to the quality of lives. We are not talking about bread-and-butter issues. We are talking about a situation that gives people who can afford it access to a high definition television set, better quality vision and sound. The issue before us requiring this level of urgency is not one of social justice.
The Greens appreciate the potential of digital terrestrial television broadcasting. We think the opportunities of enhanced programming, datacasting services, advanced information services and direct terrestrial television access to material provided by the Internet are all positive and important things for Australia. That is not what the urgency for this bill is about, though. If these conditions were really held in high esteem, there would not be this push to fast-track. There would be a commitment to ensuring that the legislation gets these important information services right the first time. There would be a commitment to ensuring that there was equal access to these important new information services.
This is such an ironic piece of legislation: we have a government pulling money left, right and centre out of essential services such as welfare, labour market programs, education, legal aid, and so on; yet it is prepared to give up millions in potential revenue gained by charging for the use of high digital TV spectrum so that the TV set quality is increased. Mind you, it is not every TV. It has to be a new high digital TV set or a TV with a set top box.
This government forces mobile phone operators to bid hundreds of millions of dollars in an auction for mobile spectrum. This money goes into the public kitty and could be spent on socially worthwhile programs—programs that could help to lessen the increasing gap in Australia between the haves and have-nots; programs that could provide 
 access to dental care for people with constant oral pain and suffering; programs that could increase the quality of our education system; programs that could accurately target the problems faced by unemployed people of today.
Certainly there is a definite case to be made for at least investigating options here. Perhaps, after proper consultation and scrutiny, there may be significant evidence that providing free to air networks with free access to the spectrum and a closed shop for a decade is the right way to go. This is not a legitimate option until the proper processes have been undertaken.
Where is the detriment? If the commercial networks are hesitant to make the investment without all these guarantees wrapped up in a legislative framework, where is the detriment? What is this huge urgency? Why is the government so desperate for these networks to invest in high definition digital TV—so desperate, of course, that we are not dealing with appropriations now but with television networks—while believing that consumer demand is so uncertain? Why is there not plenty of time for a full review of our digital TV options? Wouldn't it be wiser to make an informed decision where this much money is at risk?
The next argument is that consumers need choice of technology—an interesting argument, considering that some people will have their choices removed. This argument is based on the claim that Australia is behind the rest of the world and consumers deserve to catch up. This claim, we believe, is overstated. Digital TV is only starting to come onto the market overseas. We have no idea of what the competing systems will end up offering and which of those offers will end up being the best deal for consumers.
The US and the UK are now in the process of migrating to digital TV, and a number of other countries are in exactly the same position as Australia of currently developing digital TV strategies. Without proper investigation, this legislative package makes the choice for consumers and locks it in for 10 years. In any case, the arguments are circular. The government says that it is crucial to fast- 
 track the legislation to ensure that Australians can fulfil every desire to keep up with the Joneses but, on the other hand, it argues that it is so uncertain whether Australians even want to keep up with the Joneses—that is, that there is enough consumer demand to make an investment viable—that the government has to fund the FTAs.
On trade and everything else, human rights are abolished in favour of the free market, but when the free market limits the decision, the government steps in. If consumer demand is not there, we must consider where the real detriment is to customers. Does the government think there is such a huge detriment to consumers and to the Australian lifestyle that consumers would prefer the government to sacrifice revenue—our revenue, not the government's—rather than reducing the queues in public hospitals, providing access to banking services, or ensuring access to the Internet and phone services? If you were to ask people, I think you would find that that is not the case.
If this were really a consumer focused initiative, some of the following opportunities for consumers may have been considered: pay TV for people who do not have access or cannot traditionally afford it; lots of Internet news, education and shopping services linked with popular programming; or more companies involved in delivering mainstream digital V services, including newspapers, phone companies, Internet companies and new broadcasters. The government has not been committed to discussing consumer needs in a genuine fashion. Rather, the deal was struck in the absence of thorough consultation, so maybe it is not about the consumer at all.
Moreover, the government's position is incredibly hypocritical. Whatever happened to the fail-safe concept of competition? How does this fit in with the beloved competition policy? What would the National Competition Council say about this arrangement? What will it say once it has had a chance to look at it? The Greens have never been big fans of the ad nauseam approach to competition, as everybody well knows. The Greens believe that each issue should be judged on its merits, 
 and that competition is not an intrinsically good or bad thing in principle.
The Greens approach is that, once all the impacts of competition policy have been assessed, it is possible to judge whether competition policy is appropriate and, if so, how far competition will go to achieving outcomes that are desirable for Australia as whole. A subsidy or other government assistance may be necessary to ensure that a diverse range of networks is available, but this has not been assessed.
Let us look at the domestic content argument. The argument is that the three commercial television networks need the carrot of free access to continue to invest in Australian content and broadcast Australian content to the levels currently required. We believe that this is a fallacious argument because the commercial networks do not invest in domestic content out of love of Australia or a desire to be a good Australian television station. They do not continue to broadcast Australian content to certain levels because they think it would be in the public interest to do so. The reality is that commercial networks invest in domestic content and maintain content requirements because there is a legislative requirement for them to do so. Legislative measures are needed, as commercial TV networks are primarily guided by their bottom line. However, this might be a thing of the past if we sign up to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment—but I digress.
This is why it is crucial to address the ineffective regulation of Australian content. The recent High Court decision in Project Blue Sky v. Australian Broadcasting Authority has explicitly exposed the deficiencies in our regulation of Australian content. The CER trade agreement with New Zealand takes precedence over the Broadcasting Services Act, and that puts the future of Australian content directly under threat.
The government has referred this issue to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, but the ABA has been given the task to reconcile the irreconcilable divide between trade and cultural obligations. I just remind you that cultural obligations are not part of our current 
 negotiating stance on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. The only real solution to maintaining the integrity of Australian content is to provide a clear legislative statement that culture prevails over trade obligations. Wouldn't that be a first!
Let us look at the real reasons for urgency. Now that I have established why the overt arguments for urgency are unconvincing, I shall outline what I think is the more accurate scenario behind the push to rush this legislative safety blanket through the Senate. Firstly, there is the advantage to free to air TV stations. The commercial TV stations want their closed deal sewn up before an election and before there is time for a proper review of the deal. The commercial TV stations are concerned that the deal done behind closed doors, the deal done with exceptionally limited public consultation, would be in jeopardy if a thorough investigation occurred. Such an investigation may reveal that the closed shop arrangements are not the way to go.
An investigation may reveal that Australians can enjoy the fruits of digital TV through another method of introduction. The Packers and the Murdochs want to lock this arrangement in lest it be judged to be less than perfect. We must add to this political cocktail the axing of Channel 10's high rating Sex/Life show. The agenda behind the urgency is becoming more and more transparent. This kind of tactic indicates explicitly what a good deal this is for the free to air networks. What a convenient time to put the sweeteners out. What a convenient time to court the short-term favour needed to gain a massive windfall. What a convenient time to get favourable coverage in the media.
Let us look at the advantages to the government. The government wants to deliver its part of the closed shop deal to the TV stations in time for an election. It would be fortuitous timing if the major TV moguls were feeling generous towards the coalition in the lead-up to the election. Those same free to air TV stations can be exceptionally critical or exceptionally supportive of a political party, depending on the directions from the top. The whole deal absolutely stinks of self-interest. 
 There is no intrinsic justice in the argument for urgency. This is a very expensive `you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' kind of deal.
The effect of this legislation is that the digital television spectrum worth billions of dollars is being handed over to the commercial TV stations for nothing. That is the kind of goings-on that ordinary Australians are rebelling against. Ordinary Australians are sick of the government doing deals with the top end of town without a moment's thought for the citizens of Australia and the public interest as a whole. Ordinary Australians are sick of the government acting without integrity. Ordinary Australians are sick of the government having a blinkered view and seeing everything through `power coloured' glasses.
The Greens have not been persuaded by the argument for urgency. I do not appreciate being asked to rush through legislation without time for proper scrutiny and proper consultation. As I said, we had to stop today, putting off the appropriation bills that we are told are absolutely necessary otherwise people will not get paid, in order to push through the television bills.
The Greens are not happy to put aside proper parliamentary process for narrow, profit-oriented interests of a chosen group of commercial television operators for political gain. I guess this means I will never get any more coverage—if I ever did—on those commercial networks. Indeed, the committee report highlights the mass array of uncertainties to be dealt with. There are too many unknowns in policy, legal, technical and economic areas. We are not persuaded by the fears of delay if an election is called. Operating on the speculation of an election is not a good way to conduct the legislative process. Such speculation should not draw the focus away from considering every bill on its merits.
These privileged TV networks already enjoy tight control over our limited airways. Why has such an important decision been made over a few short months? Even though the Greens accept that the conversion to digital television is inevitable, we will not be sup 
 porting the bills, on the basis that proper and thorough consultation has not occurred. To push them through now would amount to a subversion of the parliamentary process.
I sincerely hope that the ALP share my views in relation to proper process and consultation, and, so far, from the contributions, that appears to be so. I sincerely hope that the ALP are on the side of procedure and transparency and not beholden to the implicit threats of the media—and we know how powerful they can be. The ALP certainly have been making noises along these lines, suggesting that there are issues in relation to digital conversion that need extended consideration. These bills clearly need thorough consideration, and this cannot, and should not, happen in the pressure cooker of a threatened election.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-06-26,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  and the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998 . It has been appropriate, at least since I have been here, to declare sectional interests at the beginning of a speech. I am a `teleoholic'; I have spent quite a bit of my life in front of a television screen.
I look forward to the new digital television because I am sure that I will be able to see the same old programs repeated, only in a much clearer format. The new digital television will greatly enhance the picture quality. From what I understand of what is happening, we have not as yet got all of the precise details tidied down—and I will come back to that in a moment. We do not know yet all of the standards that will apply in this whole new area, but a person capable of picking up a digital signal stream will pick up an almost perfect, if not perfect, replication of what is being transmitted.
This new technology that is coming in will do a number of things. The householder with the new television set, or whatever it is to be called—and, again, I will come to that in a short while—or the old converted television set with the deciphering box, or the decoding box, on top will replay a signal with quality the likes of which you would have to go 
 down to a television station to see now. This is particularly important in a lot of areas where television transmission is subject to ghosting and a range of things like that. As I understand it, a lot of that is to do with the broad spectrum that is required for analog TV and the fact that the signal can distort as it is going through the air. On the other hand, because the amount of band that is currently required for analog will no longer be required, at least four digital channels will be able to replace each analog channel, which makes it possible for television stations to multi-channel or to bring those signals together and broadcast what is to be known as `high definition television'.
There are a lot of issues associated with this. We are only going to be able to deal with a few of these here today. There are some that I am going to be dealing with which will effect my state—and yours, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan—of Western Australia. But, before I do that, I want to say that the opposition is somewhat concerned about some of these issues. There are a number of technical matters which we believe need to be ironed out before we go any further in this particular debate.
A number of senators here this afternoon have talked about an `undue haste' in respect of these bills. From the Labor Party point of view, we need to ascertain a couple of things. Firstly, we support the introduction of digital television. We understand the necessity for the networks that will be operating this system to get up and running as quickly as possible. The start-up date is not that far into the future. The investment required is very substantial indeed.
The main issues before us here today—which I will canvass in my speech—make essential the provision of this sort of legislation as the basic vehicle by which the free to air networks can go out there and invest their money and be prepared for a start-up date in the not so distant future—although there is no doubt that this is being hastily pushed through. Really, we do have a little bit of time to sort out a lot of these issues and to solve a lot of other problems which are quite vexing with respect to digital television, but 
 we understand the necessity for a legislative certainty so that that necessary investment that is going to be made by the digital TV operators in the future can be countenanced. Senator Lundy made reference to an amendment, which I now move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		 ""and that the Senate is of the opinion that:
	 (a)	 the Government has provided insufficient time and opportunity for a wide public consultation process to examine the impact of the introduction of digital broadcasting into Australia;
	 (b)	 the Government introduced this Bill with undue haste which is reflected by the fact that it was necessary to circulate substantial amendments even before the resumption of the second reading debate in the House of Representatives;
	 (c)	 the Australian Broadcasting Authority provided advice that indicated that legislation could be tabled in Parliament in October 1998 providing for a digital broadcasting commencement date of 1 January 2000, and the Government has given no reasons for ignoring this advice;
	 (d)	 given that the Government received the digital broadcasting report of the Australian Broadcasting Authority in July 1997 and then took over eight months to make a public announcement on its proposed framework for digital broadcasting, its claim that the legislation needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency is disingenuous;
	 (e)	 the Government's legislation does not address the enormous potential that is presented for industry development in Australia through the migration into a digital broadcasting environment—opportunities will exist for Australian manufacturing and software development industries and the contribution this can make to Australian employment and export earnings should be recognised and supported in the legislation;
	 (f)	 the Government's legislation does not provide sufficient recognition for the particular infrastructure issues faced throughout regional areas, and just as digital broadcasting provides special opportunities for access to new services in rural and regional Australia, disproportionate expenditure will be required to ensure that the capacity exists for the development of appropriate infrastructure; 

	 (g)	 the Parliament's consideration of this Bill must place paramount importance on the interests of the broader Australian community and consumers, and given the impact that digital broadcasting will have on the delivery and reception of television and other broadband and online services, any attempt to hasten the legislative process without proper parliamentary scrutiny, public debate and discussion, could jeopardise those interests"".
This amendment seeks a longer period in which we can have a discussion about these and other related issues. The opposition is not at all happy with the time frame, from March this year when the government made its announcement to the debate here today, to sort out all of the issues that are necessary to build a firm foundation for digital television transmission in Australia. As a consequence, the opposition will be arguing very strongly for a greater community period of consultation in which some of the problems that we have already unearthed in respect of digital television can be properly addressed and we can deal with a large number of the technical issues which are going to have to be sorted out by the end of this year anyway, as I understand it, particularly for the purchase of much of the broadcast and transmission equipment.
I want to come back to my own state of South Australia and your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, Western Australia. In South Australia there are two what are known as solus broadcasters. As I understand it, there is another one in Western Australia. The one in Western Australia, I understand, covers the Goldfields. It is called Golden West. I have not had any discussions with them, but I have had discussions with the two solus operators in South Australia.
The Spencer Gulf television network broadcasts from Pirie, Whyalla and Port Augusta and has a small penetration—small by metropolitan standards—but a very important television penetration for the people in those areas. The other solus operator in South Australia centres around Channel 8 in Mount Gambier. In fact, that is on relay through the various transmissions into the Riverland, into the whole south-east of South Australia.
They, too, have many concerns about which way this bill is going. I think it would be fair to tell the Senate and the listeners out there that their concerns are pretty well those of the opposition, that we do not want to rush into something that we are going to make a dreadful mistake about. I think the Senate should be under no illusion whatsoever that this will be at least as important as the introduction of television in 1956. As the introduction of television in Australia in that year and then colour television in April 1975 set the tone for a generation, this, I believe, will be at least as important as those events and possibly more so, particularly with those people who are more au fait with the types of technology that will be available to the households in Australia and will be able to use this technology to do all sorts of things that we would never have dreamt of in the days of either the old black and white televisions or the colour televisions post-1975.
The two solus operators in South Australia did not aggregate. For those people listening to the broadcast today, what that means is that in 1988 a number of the country television stations in Australia, including the one here in Canberra, went through a process of aggregation. Those processes of aggregation are such that a person travelling to some of the country networks would not know the difference between a metropolitan area where there are the three commercial free to airs and the ABC network. That is not the case in the two solus regions in South Australia. Indeed, the Spencer Gulf television station and SES Channel 8 in the south-east pick up a feed from all three commercial networks. They broadcast either direct or sometimes by delay certain programs that come from the metropolitan networks.
They broadcast on the one channel. I want to make that point because there are a couple of things that need to be said about it. Firstly, they will convert to digital television. As I understand it, there will be amendments moved to secure a longer time line for them to come on-line with digital television. There is also a necessity, and, as I understand it, the opposition will be moving amendments, to protect not only the investment that these 
 people already have in their television operations but also the investment that will be made.
I want to tell the Senate that it is going to be, in the case of these two particular solus operators, a very extensive investment. It is going to be something of the order of $31 million for the two of them in South Australia. For every household that they hope to reach that represents an investment of something like $364 as opposed to something in the region of $60 for each of the metropolitan networks that will convert to digital television.
So, as a consequence of this, the opposition will be hoping that, through this bill when we finally determine it, which I guess will be some time next week, we can give those solus operators the same protection as the metropolitans are going to have. In other words, the bill seeks to ensure that there will be a period of exclusivity where other licences will not be granted in the metropolitan or aggregated areas.
This approach flies in the face of competition. It has to be understood—certainly it is understood by me—that this period of exclusivity is absolutely essential. We need to not only get digital television up and working in Australia but give a limited period of protection—in the scheme of things, it is only a limited period—to those who will be putting a very large amount of money into this digital conversion. As I understand it, they will put at least half a billion dollars into it, although someone gave me a figure of over $700 million. I want to see—I hope the Senate agrees with me on this—that this protection, which is that there will be no new licences in the metropolitan areas, will be extended to the solus operators so that their very considerable investment will be protected for the same period.
Another issue is multi-channelling. One of the great things for people such as me who are into television is the cable television revolution. Indeed, the cable television revolution has been a welcome development for several hundred thousand households. I can understand the investment that has been made in that area and how it also needs to be 
 protected. I can understand the arguments about multi-channelling. The solus operators have an argument, at least for part of the time, that they need to have a parallel channel that they can broadcast on.
As I understand it, the argument by the pay TV operators is that, if this much band is given during the digital television conversion, it will be possible for the large metropolitan stations to broadcast at least four separate signals containing four channels in each one. It may well be that that technology can be refined so that there will be more in the future. As a consequence, the argument of the pay TV people, which I support, is that their investment is pretty marginal—we know that it is—in a number of areas and that it will be destroyed by the free to air broadcasters having the ability to broadcast multiple channels.
However, there is an argument in communities such as the south-east and in the Spencer Gulf area that at least one additional channel should be given to the particular networks there. I say that because they do not have the same free to air choice that most other Australians have. They do not have the three commercial networks or the aggregated commercial networks that are in other states. They simply have the choice between the national broadcaster and themselves. Being pretty parochial about this, if you have a Port Power match and a Crows match in South Australia, it can be pretty hard to work out exactly which one you ought to send out over the airwaves.
What I am arguing here today—I understand that we will be moving amendments to achieve it—is that we really ought to treat the solus networks much more differently from how we treat the metropolitan networks. It will allow some more competition and a freer choice for households in those areas that do not have the advantages of the metropolitan networks. What we will see in this new world is very exciting. I have not talked about the possibilities of data transmission. As I understand it, the television sets of the future, if they can be called that, will be capable of performing a number of very important tasks. A central one will be dealing with data in the 
 same way that today we connect up to the Internet through computer and modem services.
The exciting thing about all this to me and everyone else in Australia is that we will have in our homes in the not too far distant future a technology which at this stage is still not proven anywhere else. We will be at the cutting edge of it, unlike our adoption of colour TV, where we moved to a Pal system 10 years after many of the European countries. Black and white television transmission occurred 20 years before we got it in Australia. That will not be the case now. In the future, we will be giving people an opportunity to do much more in their households and to be able to receive much more. They will receive a far greater quality of television program and be able to access data services the likes of which we can only now guess. This will particularly assist people like me, who do not necessarily know too much about the way the various digital receivers will go in the period up to the year 2008.
The important thing to say here today is that we had better not mess up this new revolution. We had better get it right. I suspect that dragging the bill on here on a Friday afternoon with only a few days of sittings left is probably not the best way of setting the whole thing in train. I can understand the anxiety of those free to air networks which say that they want to get on with the job and that they do not have an awful lot of time in which to get on with it. Those networks have argued to government and, I guess, the opposition that they need the legislative supports so that they can move forward and set things in train.
In finishing my address here this afternoon, I take this opportunity to say to the free to air networks and the media that, whilst I can understand the haste with which they want to deal with this, our approach on this side of politics is to ensure that we get it right and to do it as quickly as we can. It is overboard to have this bill before us this afternoon and to have to race it through at speed. There is an argument that we need to get this sorted out before the looming federal election, albeit that it may well be a double dissolution election. 
 However, that does not necessarily mean that future governments of whatever persuasion run by minorities will not have all sorts of other interests at stake and will not be able to unpick what is done here in the next few days. The message in this is for them to ensure that they understand that as well as we certainly do. Again, I welcome the digital television revolution. Basically we support the government's bill. We want to see a number of issues sorted out. We also want to make sure that the community is happy with the way we go.
Finally, the argument has been put forward that the free to airs are getting a great hand-out. I do not agree with that assessment because I think, particularly for the size of the market in Australia, there is a great deal of investment, a very large amount of money, that will have to go into this particular conversion. I can understand the argument for exclusivity. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-06-26,"—I rise today to speak on the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  with a degree of frustration—a frustration that has been caused by this government's determination to ram this bill through the parliament and down the throats and phone lines of Australian consumers.
We have a situation where the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee was only allowed one month to look at this bill, one of the single largest issues before this parliament. The government indicated at the beginning of this debate that it would like the Senate to complete the third reading by 3.45 p.m. today, which will allow a maximum of 2½ hours debate on an issue with the ramifications that this has. It is very depressing that the government feels that the public has so little right to know the issues involved in this bill.
The priorities of this government have been exposed today in a way that few on our side of the chamber can believe. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary working Australians are relying on the Senate to debate and pass the appropriation bills. That is right: next week the money to pay Australia's public servants 
 and people who work in associated entities runs out. And the government said they wanted to debate appropriations.
But what have we seen? We have seen the government putting that off till next week. It is saying that the single most important piece of legislation that has to be dealt with by this government deals with digital TV. That is the government's priority—giving billions of dollars to three or four media magnates rather than making sure that ordinary working Australians get paid next week. And this is only one month or maybe six weeks before an election is called. What a coincidence! Is it any wonder that Australians rate politicians just above used car salesmen.
This evidence of the government's priorities will further alienate ordinary Australians, and their cynicism displayed today will drive them further towards One Nation. This is a craven performance by the government. They caved in to Kerry Packer; they caved in to Channel 9, Stokes and 7, and they want to rush it through with no serious scrutiny. The issues involved, for the doormat of a minister over on the other side of the chamber, are serious. There are very serious implications in this bill.
What we are seeing is an attack on regional Australia. One would have thought by now this government had given up beating up on regional Australia. One would have thought the Queensland election had sent them a big enough signal. They have been closing down railway stations, Telecom offices and CESs; they have been encouraging banks through the Wallis reforms to pull out of regional banking; tax offices have closed, Medicare offices have closed, and now we have another attack on regional Australians.
We are seeing a gift to Packer and Stokes and the free to airs that will allow them to unfairly compete against the little regional TV networks, just to add salt to their wounds. The metro stations, the big ones in the cities, only have to duplicate one analog transmitter and translator to reach their existing audiences. The regionals have hundreds of transmitters and translators. The expense for them to replace and upgrade is significantly greater proportionately than it is for the large mag 
 nates. How is this even-handed? Where the majors in the metros compete with the regionals, there will be a huge advantage to the metros over the regionals. Again, there will be costs to be borne in regional areas because of this process.
This comes to the whole question of competition. Competition is something this government is keen on. Graham Samuels, a stooge of the Liberal Party down in Melbourne, is out there saying, `National competition policy is all incredibly important.' But where are we not going to be allowed to have any competition? Where will ordinary Australians not have any choice? We have choice of fund and we have all sorts of hyperbole about choice for consumers in this country, but no competition will be allowed here—none at all.
The media magnates—Packer, Stokes and others—have argued that the cost of moving to digital means that they will need protection. Yet, when all the departments, including I think Treasury, caught wind of the deal that had been cut between the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the doormat over there with the major media magnates, we saw quite extraordinary submissions saying, `You can't possibly be serious. You can't possibly give away up to $2 billion worth of revenue to some of those poorer sections in the community—Kerry and Kerry, the two Kerrys. We will give them this gift. We will charge pensioners 10 per cent for food and 10 per cent for clothing, and we will give $2 billion to the two Kerrys.' It is extraordinary!
That is what this debate is really about. It is a gift by this government to some of the richest people in this country weeks before it launches an advertising blitz talking about secret taxes. And it refuses to go out and collect revenue which it could get, quite simply, through the auction process. Australians would get choice, governments would get revenue and maybe they would only have to charge eight per cent for the GST instead of 10 per cent if they are prepared to look at $2 billion in this field.
Some of the issues are very technical in this debate. I make absolutely no claim to be an expert on the technical issues.
—Or any other.
—I can guarantee you are not, Senator Calvert. This is about datacasting, about what else can be broadcast at the same time as the TV signal. As I have already indicated, I will not be using a great deal of technical jargon, mainly because I do not make any claim to understand of some of the jargon.
You have a give-away of high definition TV with the potential give-away, if the government gets it way, of datacasting—data services. That means that it is not just a gift that has a one-off cost; there is an ongoing greater cost if they get the dataservicing free as well. It is outrageous that this government is prepared to cave in to the vested interests. It has an election coming so it is prepared to just roll over and do their bidding because it does not want to put the major media players offside just before an election.
We have the question of access to the Internet. That is critically involved in this debate. It barely got a mention. We have the question of multi-channelling—which can compete with pay television—and whether or not that is going to be freely given away as well: whether or not pay TV can be done over to protect the two Kerrys, those impoverished two Australians!
—Struggling!
—They are struggling! That is right, Senator Gibbs: the strugglers, the battlers—that's who they are—in this debate. The two Kerrys are battling.
The government's legislation is potentially excluding other Internet providers. We have a convergence of technologies. You have this thing—again, I do not claim any great understanding of this—of Web TV. We have an alliance between Microsoft and Telstra. We have just recently seen a commercial arrangement between ninemsn and Telstra. Ninemsn is already an arrangement between Channel 9 and Microsoft. There is an irony about this debate. Channel 9 is saying, `We can live with banning multi-channelling'—they have given that indication—`we don't have to have multi-channelling.' But that is because this legislation is going to create a de facto mo 
 nopoly on datacasting services through the commercial arrangements that Telstra, Microsoft, ninemsn and Channel 9 have created. That is actually going to be the outcome.
Kerry Packer does not need multi-channelling; that is the irony. He will actually be better off if the legislation goes through in the form that has been suggested. Not enough is understood of how that monopoly is being created. You would see that if you were to ask 99.999 per cent of ordinary Australians, `Do you understand that you are going to have a monopoly for Kerry Packer and Telstra created out of this bill which will give them extraordinary power and influence beyond what they already have in this country?'
This is almost a back door way to get past the cross-media ownership laws. We know the government has tried the front door way, and fortunately the Senate has absolutely no intention of letting the government cave in on cross-media ownership. But this is an insidious back door way to further concentrate the information that will be flowing because—and I do not even have a personal computer—the flow of information is changing from just the ordinary TV and just the ordinary newspaper. What we are seeing today is an insidious attempt to further concentrate future media information services into fewer and fewer hands. It is not as if this country has enough diversity and outlets at the moment, but this bill—and the implications and outcomes that are likely to flow from this bill—will see a further concentration.
How can you tell whether or not some of the things that have been said today on our side of the chamber are right? What happened when the government announced its package? What happened in the marketplace? You saw the price of the TV stations' shares jump. The market understood that this was a gift, that there was an awful lot of money suddenly being handed over to the TV stations, so their prices on the share market jumped.
We have seen recently a buy-out in America with AT&T. It bought a cable TV station for a substantial amount of money. What happened on that announcement? Telstra shares jumped. The market has some under 
 standing of the value of the product that this government wants to give away. But have we heard much about it? We have had an advertising campaign, if I can call it that, run by the free to air TV stations. They had Bruce Gyngell telling all Australians it would be free to air and affordable. It is anything but affordable.
We have seen overseas the prospect of between $US6,000 and $US10,000 to buy one of these new TVs. That is what it is going to cost in the foreseeable future. You may say, `That is a function of the market and there will be mass production and prices will go down.' Yes, there will be some of that.
But look at what happened in the Japanese market. Japanese consumers are some of the best informed on these developments because they have had the debates in Japan for a while. What has been the take-up of purchases in the choice between the traditional analog TV and the digital TV? Almost nobody in the Japanese market has actually bought the digital TVs. They have stuck with the analog because of the cost. And that is what will happen in this country. There is no need to exclude competitors from access to the digital market. There should be an auction of this good. This is a very valuable commodity. We should have an auction.
—They said the same thing about colour TV.
—It took a little while for colour TVs to come—a couple of years. I predict that it will be a couple of years, maybe five years, before there is anything like a reasonable take-up of digital TV. Given the lack of access and penetration in the foreseeable future, you will see a natural  barrier to entry by competitors because no-one has a high density TV. What advertiser is going to suddenly leap on board a new entrant to the market in the short term when it knows that it is only going to be advertising to the tiniest proportion of Australian consumers. There is a natural barrier created by this technology that will take some time. But not content with that, the media magnates have come running to Canberra saying, `We want protection for 10 years. We want to exclude competitors for 
 10 years.' And the doormats over there have rolled over.
We have seen a number of hastily prepared submissions. As other speakers have said, when the Senate set this timetable there was a lack of time for genuine debate. It required a vote on the floor—it was not an agreement. It required the government to come in here and crunch the numbers through to limit the time for debate. It was not something that was agreed to on this side; in fact, it was fought hard. We did not agree with the timing. We did not agree with the process and we objected to it. But, the numbers are the numbers in this chamber and the government had them that day and they forced this process on us.
Amongst those hastily prepared submissions there was one from Mr Milne from OzEmail. He got to the heart of the  subject. He said that the issue at the heart of digital spectrum and datacasting had been missed by much of the discussion so far. He states:
We have to ask ourselves what is the most important for the next generation of Australians—sharper TV images or increased access to data?
Digital TV could improve TV viewing but, in addition, it could bring a whole new stream of datacasters, leveraging the capacity of TV sets to connect to each other.
Datacasting will be responsible for turning TV sets into devices that connect people to the rest of the world.
That is the impact that these decisions here in the next few days are going to skate right past. We are not going to hear about those sorts of things. We will get a glossy little ad on TV that tells us that it is all nice, pretty, sharper TV that is affordable. It will be free to air. There are going to be no great problems.
The Australian Consumers Association also put in a submission and I would like to mention a couple of their points. They were concerned, and said:
The market power of free-to-air broadcasters under the proposed Australian regime has several important dimensions:
.	 Excessive market power results from the free allocation of spectrum which serves to minimise cost to income ratios for the beneficiaries— 

that is a fancy way of saying that Kerry and Kerry are going to get richer quicker—
especially if multi-channel is extended once HDTV fails to take off.
.	 The absence of an open access regime and an open and uniform standard development framework will limit further effective competition.
.	 Free-to-air broadcasters have massive audiences enabling more highly leveraged entry into data and Internet services compared to the other aspiring entrants into converging information markets.
That is the key point I was making earlier. Kerry Packer can live with the outcome of this bill because he has already just about got information services wrapped up. He does not mind. He is getting a bit of cake both ways in this debate. He has already stitched up the alternative and he is closing down access for others. There is an effective monopoly being created in information markets. They continue:
.	 Participants in a multiplexing environment could range from existing broadcasters to telecommunications companies and financial institutions entering the vast on-line payments system environment.
.	 The proposed policy framework entrenches existing broadcasting players for the coming decade . . .

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-06-26,"—While the opposition broadly supports the need for a legislative framework announced by the government, we take the view that this process has been corroded by the government's obsession with seeking favour from the television networks. Attempts are being made to secure favourable reception by those television networks to the government's proposals. The price has been proper process and the Australian public has been short changed by the government's rush to fast track this legislation through the parliament.
The opposition has already indicated its broad endorsement of the legislative framework proposed by the government, and did so as early as March of this year. Our concern, however, is that it is irresponsible for the government to not give adequate consideration to the public debate and to proper public review of its actions, given the significance of 
 these measures and the complex nature of the issues concerned. Our view is that it would have been more appropriate for the government to release and table an exposure draft of proposed legislation to allow public discussion on those matters for a three-month period, for there to be a proper legislative inquiry to ensure effective communication with the public and an opportunity for the public to comment on the provisions of any exposure draft, and for the debate to then proceed in an orderly fashion through the parliamentary processes.
What have we seen? What we have seen from this government is an obsession to appease the powerful media interests in this country, an obsession by this minister to do favours for the media barons of this country in such a manner that one has to raise serious questions about what the government is actually getting out of these arrangements. Quite clearly, it is not getting good policy outcomes for the Australian public. There must be some other interests involved for the government to proceed with such obsessive haste.
What we have heard this afternoon is that the government has put aside its appropriation bills. It has put aside securing the money required to run government to bring on these particular bills. It seeks to have these bills pushed through this chamber this afternoon without effective scrutiny. We were told throughout the week that we would address the appropriation bills in due course. We were told last night that the appropriation bills had to be considered today because, if they were not, public servants were not going to be paid next Wednesday. We were told that the finance department required time to process the bills passed by this parliament. An extraordinary proposition was advanced to us that that time was something in the order of three days. That was clearly the inference that one could draw from any proposition that said that the appropriation bills had to be passed today.
Last night the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business told us that the electoral legislation that we were debating had to be put aside because urgent attention had to be given to the stevedoring legislation. We 
 complied with that. We are a very cooperative group here, as the minister knows only too well. I am only too happy to assist the government with its ill-conceived legislative program. I do not necessarily say we will vote for it, but we do say we will give it proper consideration. Accordingly, we gave proper consideration to the stevedoring legislation, on the basis that we were told that, come 12 o'clock today, we would be dealing with the appropriation bills. After all, public servants were going to be sacked or could not be paid if we did not get the legislation carried!
—You weren't told that at all.
—We were told that the legislation had to be carried today to make sure that the budget was in line for next Wednesday. What happens? The Acting Leader of the Government decides to stand over the Manager of Government Business and say, `Oh no, we must have my bills brought on before consideration of the appropriation bills. Hang the expense. After all, we only talking about the budget and the wages and conditions of ordinary public servants. We are not talking that anything significant.' We were told that, if we do not get the bills, passed the public servants will not be able to be paid.
We now find that there is another agenda being pursued by this minister and these bills must be considered come hell or high water. We have already indicated that we have given an extra 20 weeks across the life of this parliament for additional government business time. Those 20 additional sitting weeks have not been used well by this government, because we find a situation now where we have to rush through these pieces of legislation without proper consideration of their implications. If I recall rightly, we have passed 393 bills in this parliamentary session.
—Run out of things to say about digital, have you?
—I have got a lot to say about digital, and you will know a lot more about it by the time I have finished here today. This week we have carried 22 bills and this year some 84 bills. So it cannot be said that we have been doing nothing in this place. 
 What can be said is that the government has not been able to manage its time effectively, and we now have this rush on to consider these particular measures in a manner which I think is quite inappropriate and irresponsible and totally unseemly.
What the opposition says is that we think there ought to be proper consideration of these matters, given their importance. There ought to be further debate on these matters. There ought to be an opportunity for this parliament to actually consider this issue in a timely manner. We are saying that there needs to be further information provided and further consideration given by this parliament to basic questions such as the implications these measures will have for assistance to regional broadcasters. I know the government does not seem to care too much about the regional parts of Australia. It is quite clear it does not care too much about the impact of these particular measures on regional broadcasters. We are concerned about whether there should be financial assistance provided to regional broadcasters in recognition of the disproportionate costs they will have to face in migrating to the digital environment.
We believe that the government needs to provide a great deal more information about the costings of any proposals to move to digital TV in relation to the impact on regional broadcasters. We are concerned about the implications for additional licences in regional areas and whether regional broadcasters ought to be able to have access to broadcasting licences or whether there should be an absolute ban rather than a cap on the number of licences. We believe that capping the licences at no more than three effectively prevents new licences being issued in the metropolitan and most regional territories, and that in those areas where there have been fewer than three licences new licences could still be issued. The opposition has argued that there is an anomaly and that the legislation should provide for a blanket moratorium on the issuing of new licences irrespective of the number of existing licences in particular markets.
We are also concerned about the impact of these measures will have on national broad 
 casters, particularly the ABC and SBS. We think that the whole question of the digital broadcasting environment needs to be considered in terms of the access to the funds available to those agencies, given their importance in terms of public provision of broadcasting. The ABC and SBS provide unique services to Australians in terms of access to high quality broadcasting and provide a real break on the concentration of media ownership in this country. As a consequence, they ought to be properly supported. They are not supported by this government. In fact, what we have seen from this government is hundreds of millions of dollars being taken away from our public broadcasters, from their capacity to provide a universal high quality service to Australians. It strikes me that this is yet another issue that arises from the government attempting to shackle our public broadcasters and hinder their obligations to meet high community expectations on the quality of services that they are providing.
In terms of various concepts such as multi-channelling, datacasting and enhanced services, the minority report of the Senate's examination of this issue suggests that there needs to be a great deal more consideration given to what these terms actually mean in terms of the effect on the future shape of any broadcasting industry in this country. These terms seem to me to be open to a range of definitions. In terms of the submissions that I understand the Senate committee received, it is quite clear that there is a great deal of confusion within the industry as to the implications for any legislative framework that this government is proposing, particularly this legislative framework that is being considered.
We think it would be irresponsible for the parliament to rush into these matters without due consideration of the implications of such measures. We need to have a clear understanding of the precise scope of the services that are being proposed and will be allowed under this new legislative framework.
There is a whole series of other issues which the minister is only too well aware of, and I think that is in part why he wants to rush this legislation through and wants to 
 ensure that there is not adequate scrutiny of the legislative framework that he is proposing. Questions arise as to the technical standards, the services to underserviced areas, the enhancement of opportunities for viewers with disabilities, industry policy strategies, the implications for support for manufacturing industry in the telecommunications broadcasting area, consumer education and Australian content provisions.
I think it is appropriate that the parliament does satisfy itself that assistance to regional broadcasters, additional licences in regional areas, national broadcasting and definitions of basic concepts such as multi-channelling, datacasting and enhanced services are given adequate attention and that we do not move towards a legislative framework without doing that simple task. It seems to me that the legislation brought before the parliament has been done with extraordinary and undue haste. There has been a grave injustice to proper process because of the manner in which the government has sought to rush this matter before this chamber and has sought to amend even its own proposals in the course of the very limited committee processes that were undertaken by the Senate.
As I understand it, over 70 amendments were introduced by the government during the legislation committee's consideration of these bills. Those 70 amendments were put on the table without explanation and without proper consideration. As a consequence one sees that the government itself is very confused about the likely consequences of any measure.
The opposition believe it is inappropriate to fast-track these measures. It is inappropriate for us to be forced into a position where we must deal with very complicated matters and quite complex issues in terms of convergence without addressing the full context of these measures both in social and economic terms. I think it is inappropriate that we should be required to undertake such a decision making process without fully understanding its implications and, given the importance of these measures, without examining the possible flaws that such measures will involve.
I notice that Senator Brown has just come in, but I have been obliged to jump the queue 
 a bit because I understand he was involved in other matters. The opposition, while generally supportive of the government's proposed time frame for simulcasting as well as the general issues in regards to the start-up dates for digital television and the mandating of high definition content levels, and while generally supportive of the general thrust of the financial assistance packages available, we—and I in particular—are concerned about the paragraph the government have identified in their own report of the legislation committee. I emphasise that that legislation committee examination was in itself grossly inadequate, owing to the very limited time that was available for this matter. The government say in paragraph 1.3:
The Minister's announcement stressed that the provision of HDTV services to Australian consumers would be a major element of the introduction of DTTB in Australia but that a simulcast period of at least 8 years (to 2008) would ensure that `Australians who retain their analog television sets will not be disadvantaged.' A review, before the end of 2005 would determine whether that simulcast period of eight years should be extended.
In one sense this simple measure sums up the government's whole approach. They do not really know what the implications are, but they will have a review just in case there is any complaint about the measures being undertaken. They say, `We do not really appreciate the consequences, but we will have a review later on'—after the damage is done—`to make sure that we have had some process by which to complain.'
They do not tell you that these newfangled high definition TV sets will cost $15,000 a shot. I do not know about Senator Alston, but the sorts of families I mix with do not have $15,000 to buy a new TV. They rely upon the analog TV and they will do so for some time to come. They are unlikely to have $15,000 for a new TV set for some time to come and eight years is not nearly enough. Eight years to me is a bit of a problem. I do not know how many families that live in the great city of Moreland in Melbourne have disposable incomes which allow them to spend $15,000 on a new TV set. The minister's friends might be able to provide advice on those sorts of matters. These new, flash TVs with the wide 
 screens will provide much higher quality reception.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-26,"—I usually do not speak in the adjournment debate, but I have just received a copy of a press release put out by Senator Kim Carr, who has just been on his feet. I think it is important that, for the record, people understand that Senator Carr's press release, which relates to the management of the government's business program in the Senate, contains what can only be described—
—I am awe-struck.
—Senator Kemp is awe-struck. He knows Senator Carr and he knows Senator Carr's record, and he knows his record in relation to telling the truth. Senator Kemp, coming from Victoria, you know what the former Premier of Victoria John Cain said about Kim Carr—
—I had to sue him for defamation.
—Who paid for your legal fees?
—Order! Senator Carr and Senator Alston. This shouting across the chamber is disorderly. You have your opportunity to speak.
—What is Senator Alston doing?
—You are warned for your behaviour, Senator. I spoke to both Senator Carr and Senator Alston. If you had not been shouting, you might have heard.
—I think John Cain, the former Premier of Victoria, had Kim Carr right. He knew what a wrecker he was. I think former Premier Cain knew what incredible problems—
—Madam President, I take a point of order. I realise that you have a very difficult job keeping order in the Senate, but when you have, in the adjournment debate after a very long week, intemperate remarks made by the Manager of Government Business—
—What is your point of order?
—My point of order is that, if you want to keep reasonable order in this place, the Manager of Government Business should be given advice to temper his remarks so that people are not provoked into having to defend themselves against his extraordinary attack. That is why the place is often disorderly.
—So far, the interruptions have been so great that I have not had the faintest idea what the manager is speaking about. I am attempting to listen to find out. If he is behaving not in accordance with the standing orders, I will draw his attention to it, but I need to be able to hear what he is saying.
—Thank you, Madam President. I was saying that the former Premier of Victoria's views about Senator Carr are well known and that the former Premier understood very clearly—as you will see if you read memoirs written by him and by people about him—what trouble Senator Carr had when it came to dealing with the truth. I want to stick to the facts today—
—Madam President, I take a point of order. He cannot cast imputations on fellow senators. I request he be asked to withdraw.
—On the point of order, Madam President: I think one always has to be careful what one says about fellow senators and I would have thought that the person who should be most careful is the senator from Victoria who has just spoken.
—Order! I think we are taking up a lot of time on this. I want to listen carefully to what is being said. There is 
 no point of order at this stage. But, Senator Campbell, you certainly should not cast aspersions.
—I would not. It was actually the former Premier of Victoria who cast the aspersion—and I would not want to repeat it. I just recommend to anyone who wants to understand Senator Kim Carr to talk to John Cain. I know that Senator Kemp, who comes from Victoria and has watched the machinations of the Labor Party in Victoria, knows all about Senator Carr. Even Senator Kemp, I know, is shocked by what lengths Senator Carr has gone to in this press release that he has issued today.
I want to just put some facts down about the Labor Party's organised disruption of the program in the Senate in the past two days. Can I say that one of the aspersions, one of the falsities, if not abject lies, that has been put forward in the document I would seek to table in a minute is that Senator Carr has said that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, personally came into the Senate chamber last night and asked government advisers that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  be shelved to prioritise stevedoring levy bills. Can I say that that is absolutely incorrect, a total distortion and an abject lie.
—Senator, I do not think you should use that last description. The first two are adequate.
—I withdraw that it was a lie and say it was an absolute misrepresentation of the fact. In fact, the Senate should now know what the truth is. Senator Carr, at about 8.30, spoke to me and I said, `Look, this electoral bill is bogging down. Why don't we have a look at putting the stevedoring bill on?' Senator Carr said, `Let's have a look at it at about a quarter to nine.' I said, `Okay, that's a good idea.' At a quarter to nine it looked like the bill was going along quite nicely, but by nine o'clock it had become bogged down again. I got a call from Senator Carr—and I do not usually reveal these sorts of discussions because they are the normal sorts of discussions that take place when one is trying to manage the Senate's program but when Senator Carr 
 wants to go into writing and publish lies to the gallery then I will reveal these conversations.
—Madam President, I take a point of order. I have always been in favour of robust exchanges, but it has been the understanding of the Senate for so long that the word `lie'—and Senator Campbell is clearly saying that Senator Carr lied to the Senate—is out of order.
—I think he said `publish lies to the gallery' but I would ask that that be withdrawn and rephrased.
—I will rephrase it. He published something that is an abject, total, organised, premeditated distortion of the truth.
—Senator, just watch the way you express yourself.
—I will. The truth of the matter is that Peter Reith did not suggest pulling the electoral bill; Senator Kimberley Carr rang me up at about 9 o'clock last night, and said—
—Madam President, my point of order is that Senator Carr has to be addressed in the correct terminology. In using other phrases Senator Ian Campbell may think he is being smart and humorous. But I do not think the standing orders allow a senator to be incorrectly addressed in this place, as Senator Ian Campbell is now doing.
—I do not know whether Senator Carr's name is `Kimberley' or not.
—It is not.
—In that case, you should use his correct name.
—I called him `Comrade Carr' this morning, and he thought that was quite nice.
—Senator, you are fast running out of time. If you just refer to him as Senator Carr we will know who you are taking about.
—Madam President, you are quite right. I want to go out to the airport and jump on a plane to Perth. The fact is that Senator Kim Carr rang me at about 9 p.m. last night and said, `Ian'— 
 Senator Ian Campbell, he probably should have said—`pull the stevedoring bill and we'll see what we can do to get it through by 10.30. Senator Carr said, `You pull the stevedoring bill.'
So it was not Peter Reith who came in here and said it; it was actually the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate who said, `Senator Campbell, can you pull your bill and we'll put stevedoring on.' He then said, `We'll get it through by 10.30.' When it did not look like it was going to get through by 10.30, I said to Senator Kim Carr, `Could you please agree with us to extend the sitting so we can go through to midnight?' He said, `No way. Our guys are tired and we want to go home.' I said, `Just another hour to get it through,' and he said, `No, we want to go home.'
They then said, `We'll get it through in half an hour or an hour in the morning.' I said, `Great. We need the appropriations. We'll bring them on by midday and that should get them out by 3.45 p.m. We'll get the digital debate going in the meantime. We should have an hour and a half in between and we'll fill that in with the digital television package debate so we are using the time of the Senate effectively.' They agreed. They said, `Yes, an hour or so.' Senator Calvert was at the meeting. The agreement was that we would finish stevedoring in an hour, do a little bit of digital and get on to the appropriations by midday so we would have the appropriations bills finished.
Senator Carr seems to be following on from the track record he had when he was a Labor Party operative in Victoria. The former Premier of Victoria, John Cain, has very strong views about how Senator Carr's words should be taken.
Madam President, I say to you that Senator Carr should, at the earliest occasion, put out a release apologising to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Peter Reith, and he should tell the truth about who wanted to pull the electoral bill last night and bring on stevedoring. He should tell the truth about the fact that the Labor Party had agreed that we should be able to get stevedoring finished in an hour this morning. He 
 should tell the truth about the fact that the Labor Party will do anything and say anything to look cooperative but, when it comes to delivering on their agreements, they will not do so.
The Liberal Party and the government in this place reached an informal agreement with the Australian Labor Party that we would recall an estimates committee to allow Senator Peter Cook to ask questions of Treasury officials. Part of the informal agreement—as there can always be—was that we would get an agreement from the Australian Labor Party to assist in speeding up the program with the passage of the electoral bill and the stevedoring bill last night.
The coalition delivered its side of a sensible arrangement in full, on time and for the entire time. We had the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury sitting upstairs in committee room 2S1. Senator Cook wanted to drag Treasury back and subject them and you, Senator Kemp, to probing questions. I went up there to see Senator Cook tearing the Treasury officials and the Assistant Treasurer to bits with his probing questions. I have got to say that a Senate committee room was not the right place to have that estimates hearing. The right thing, Senator Kemp, I would have thought, would be to have Senator Cook, the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury and the Assistant Treasurer sitting around a lounge room with a nice fire going and a couple of glasses of brandy on the side. Senator Cook was trying to overcome his relevance deprivation syndrome in trying to talk to the head of one of the big departments in this government. He wanted to share notes with Ted Evans and Senator Kemp about the state of the world economy and try to play games.
It was a very nice three hours, Senator Kemp, I think. In fact, I think, Madam President, you could suggest to the Joint House Committee that we investigate having fireplaces installed in some committee rooms so that we can ensure that estimates committees proceed in a friendly, pleasant `fireside chat' manner so that Senator Cook, Mr Evans and Senator Kemp can chat about the world economy.  
The point is, of course, that the government delivered on its commitments and the Australian Labor Party, as usual, failed to deliver on their side of the bargain. They said that stevedoring would be half an hour to an hour maximum. That means it would have been finished by 10.30. It finished at about ten to one. Senator Alston, I guess the point is that their promises in relation to the hours it takes to do a piece of legislation are very similar to their promises on delivering balanced budgets. They said, `We'll deliver surpluses,' and they deliver deficits. They say, `We've delivered a surplus,' and their deficit is $12 billion, year on year. You cannot trust them with money. You cannot trust them at all. If you want something from the Labor Party, get it in writing. (Time expired)
