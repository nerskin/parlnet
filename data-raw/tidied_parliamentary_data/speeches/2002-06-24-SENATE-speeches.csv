"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-24,"—It has now been some 10 months since September 11 and the events that led to this legislation, the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bills, being brought before this parliament. Fortunately for democracies like Australia, the intervening period has provided some time for sober reflection on the events of that day. Hopefully that time for reflection will enable us to more rationally handle the issues, which confront legislators worldwide, that have been raised because of the acts of terrorism of September 11 2001.
It is important for those of us deliberating these initiatives to do so soberly, calmly, after balanced consideration and with continuing respect for the democratic values that are held so dearly by Australians. We must do so with the long-term view in mind. We are not passing legislation to handle retrospectively what happened some 10 months ago; we are not passing legislation that has a sunset provision; we are passing legislation which we could expect will endure for decades. In short, we must not be spooked into overreaction one way or another when we are deliberating on the legislation before us. It is momentous legislation; it is legislation which I do not think was necessary—because Australia has been well equipped over the years to handle these sorts of situations—but September 11 did engulf the world in a sense of hysteria, fear and xenophobia. People were genuinely afraid. Fortunately for all of us, the fears that were spawned at the time have not been realised, but we need to ensure that some of the concerns that our agencies have are not realised in the future. 
Having said that, I also place on record my concern that the hysteria, fear and xenophobia have sometimes been fanned by politicians for base political motives, and scaring the public has been part of their agenda. I am concerned at the way national leadership has handled the situation. Arguments have been expressed, particularly by the government in this debate, but we should be mature enough to realise that it is not simply a matter of being pro- or anti-terrorist, as President Bush simplistically put it at the time. It is not a matter of hairy-chestedness on the one hand or of being soft on terrorism on the other. There are some real issues that go to the heart of our democracy, and we in this place should be able to assess and consider them without being spooked into overreaction. 
The fact of the matter is that the world did not change on September 11. We all got a massive shock and there was a tragedy of monumental proportions, but we should all be honest enough to accept and acknowledge that nation states like Australia and the US had been anticipating acts of terrorism on such a scale for quite some time—in fact, for a number of decades. For instance, many of us have acknowledged that, with the collapse of the rigid power blocs of East and West, small nation states with access to a whole host of arms and weapons, together with splinter terrorist movements, would be present and would be harder to control. That is why, when I was immigration minister between 1993 and 1996, I initiated a wholesale upgrading of technology, systems, equipment and networks to ensure that we in Australia and Australians generally were protected from acts of terrorism. However necessary—and it was necessary—we in government were keen to ensure that we had the state-of-the-art systems, equipment and networks to protect this nation. That of course has been upgraded by this government since those days. 
I make this point not to devalue the importance of this debate, not to devalue the extent of the tragedy of September 11, but to make two fundamental points. One, we are not starting with a blank sheet. We have had legislative responses, systems and networks in place for decades. Two, we should not overreact. When we debate measures such as the ones before us today, we need to ensure that we are serving the democratic values that our system has cherished for such a long time. As I said earlier, I fear that much of the legislation before us is in many respects unwarranted. It reflects an unholy alliance between politicians wishing to seize political advantage by seizing the political moment and a bureaucracy which is always keen to seize more power. That is a lethal combination for any democracy. 
You would have hoped that there would be in the system, up to this stage of Senate debate, greater concern for democratic values. You would have hoped that you could rely on the traditional defender of rights in our system, the Attorney-General. But once again we see the ineffectiveness of the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, who has held the position in this government for some five years. One of my colleagues was quoted as saying recently that he did not think that these were not the preferred measures of the Attorney. But the fact of the matter is that he has not been able to stand up for whatever measures he does prefer, and we should take him on the basis of his public record. He has been seen to be totally ineffectual in this debate. He has been a dismal failure when it comes to, for instance, defending the national legal aid system. In fact, on every point of issue in the public debate, this Attorney has been more of a doormat than a defender of the legal system. We should have had some confidence in him to be able to defend rights, but that has not happened.
We should also have been able to have some confidence in some of the more moderate voices in the government, like Senators Hill and Vanstone, who portray themselves as being soft liberals. We should have had more confidence in them to achieve greater balance in this legislation, but we have not had that outcome. We have before us now a situation where the Senate is playing quite a critical role in the defence of rights and making up for the failures of the Attorney and of the moderate voices in cabinet. I find it quite objectionable that this hysteria that was generated post September 11 has been spawned at home, has been fanned at home and has spawned division at home. We had the objectionable behaviour of ministers before the last election claiming that some of those poor, hapless people coming to our shores by boat `could be terrorists'. That was all generated to ensure that people were afraid and would accordingly vote in a conservative way. That campaign at the time had its effect. But, as well as serving the purpose of having the Howard government re-elected, what that campaign has done and continues to do is to divide our community. There is enormous damage to our reputation internationally, but there is also enormous damage to the fabric of our society.
Such vilification continues. Only last week the irrepressible Mayor of Port Lincoln, Peter Davis, made the national headlines claiming that these people—who he says have no right to be here—should be used as shooting targets. This Peter Davis is no different from the Peter Davis from whom, some six or seven years ago, I as immigration minister took away the right to confer citizenship because of his offensive and what I thought to be totally anti-Australian, antidemocratic statements at the time. But, no matter how offensive the comments of Peter Davis last week were and continue to be, Peter Davis actually served a public purpose because he said publicly what many others have been saying privately. He expressed views that, time and time again, have come to me and my office by way of anonymous phone calls. He expressed the views that anonymous callers relay on talkback radio. For the first time they have come from a public figure and for the first time the political system in this country and those with concern for civilised debate in this country had a chance to rebut those arguments. 
What is quite sad and pathetic is that, though we got the rebuttal from civic leaders—in South Australia we got the rebuttal from, amongst others, the President of the Law Society of South Australia, Chris Kourakis, from leading institutions, from the Attorney-General and from the state Premier—we have not heard the rebuttal from the Howard government; a government that always defends the rights of those who want to spread racism but is very slow to attack those sorts of sentiments. As I say, Peter Davis was as offensive as usual, but he got these matters out into the public debate. They should be rebutted and they should be recognised as being spawned by much of the hysteria that was generated in Australia when people brought together the combination of those who flew planes into the World Trade Centre and those hapless people who were trying to get to Australia to seek asylum status. Davis needs to be condemned, but he needs to be condemned from the top; he needs to be condemned by the Prime Minister and leading government ministers.
Also last week we had what I thought was a disturbing domestic development where the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, said in this place:
The United States and others within the civilised world have been seeking to respond to that—
he is referring there to the situation in Iraq—
through diplomatic means ... and in other ways.
This distinction between a so-called civilised world and the rest of the world is something that we should be concerned about. It reflects the mentality of Huntington's `clash of civilisations'. We in Australia ought to recognise that we do live in the Asian region. An arbitrary line between what is a civilised country and what some people think may be uncivilised is one that does not resonate all that well in our region. It is also one that is based on a fiction. When Senator Hill talked about the civilised world, as opposed to the non-civilised world, who was he talking about as being uncivilised? Is he talking, for instance, about Iran or Iraq—countries with great cultural histories and not only literary but also political traditions? We may be going through a bad time now with Iraq, and maybe Iran seems to be going through a bad time now, but it was only six months ago that the Western world was saying that we should open our doors, open channels and engage with Iran. This distinction, which Senator Hill brought into the debate last week, between civilised and non-civilised countries is something that we should check against.
It has not just been a domestic agenda that has been pursued by those who spread this campaign of hysteria. One of the other concerns that I think we should have in this place as we engage in debate such as this, keeping in mind our democratic values, is the need to be very cautious about how foreign affairs are handled from this level and that the hysteria that was generated post September 11 does not infect, influence or override sober considerations in our foreign relationships. I fear that the campaign of `us versus them'—which has been continued by the Bush administration mainly, with leading support from the Howard administration here—is serving another purpose. That purpose is to lead to an invasion of Iraq. I think that would be madness at this particular time in our history. To extend the conflict in the Middle East in current circumstances would be, I think, taking on much too much. The Middle East is at boiling point already. Europe is reluctant to go with George Bush down the road of further engagement with Iraq or an invasion of Iraq. In Australia, once again, the Howard-Hill administration has been very quick to fall into line behind President Bush.
What we should be saying to President Bush is that it is time for sober reflection on how we handle the Iraq situation. I do not say this as someone who is inexperienced in this area; I supported the last Gulf War publicly and privately and I was on the cabinet war committee of the Hawke government at the time. I do not think that Europe, for instance, is as ready to hit the missile buttons in respect of Iraq as it was in the previous engagement and before the previous engagement. Australia's indecent haste in lining up behind the hawks of the Bush administration as opposed to others in the administration does not serve our national interest nor does it serve the interests of world peace. 
So we come back to this legislation—legislation which has generated a period of hysteria but which this Senate has taken a very keen interest in and which has led to much amendment. In respect of the Senate process, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work done by Senator Marise Payne. She stood up when others were not prepared to. She has managed to work with members of the committee such as Senators McKiernan, Ludwig, Cooney and me and to get a unanimous position recommending wholesale amendment to this legislation. She did what her colleagues in cabinet were not prepared to do, she did what the Attorney-General was not prepared to do, and we should acknowledge that. On my side, this issue is not an easy one to handle in a climate of xenophobia and fear. Recognition needs to be given to the shadow ministers involved, Senator Faulkner and Daryl Melham, and to their staff, particularly Antony Sachs and Phil Dorling, for the way that they have applied themselves to get concrete, workable and democratic alternatives to the government's proposals. Recognition also needs to be given to Simon Crean. It is not easy for political leadership to swim against the tide and it is a pity that the press gallery has not woken up to it. But on this particular issue Simon Crean is standing up, and standing up for a more democratic solution to this problem before us, and that courage needs to be acknowledged.
On the one hand, there has been hysteria about this issue; on the other hand, we should not be spooked by the number of emails that we seem to be getting on this particular issue. There seems to be a new elite developing in our society: those who can use emails and PCs. If you have a PC, you have a voice. I do not want to name any of them individually because it probably encourages them to send more emails, but having access to email does not equate, on the assessment of the emails that I have seen, with having any greater intellect. There are probably three categories of email that we are getting. There is one that seeks to blackmail: `We have voted for you forever'—that is something we cannot prove—`Vote against this legislation or else we will never vote for you again.' That sort of immature, undergraduate politics is not something that will hold water with me, nor will it hold water with most mature people in this parliament. Then you have the form critiques, the ones who have obviously picked up their note from someone else and they just forward it. They will not be taken seriously either, because we do spend a lot of time in this place and on committees assessing these issues. A form, ignorant representation is one that will not be taken seriously. Then of course we have the ones that say to us, `You are all hopeless. Both major parties are hopeless. The only ones really worth listening to in this debate are the Greens and the Democrats, and we want you to support their position.' That grates enormously, particularly when you have been through the committee process, when you have actually spent the hours in deliberations and in discussions and someone says to you: `You ought to follow Bob Brown.' I do not know why. He has not been seen on those committees or in those deliberations at all. I will say to them as well: do your homework before you send your emails to us. 
The committee process that we had in this place was quite valuable. Organisations like the Law Council of Australia need to be acknowledged for the enormously high quality of their submission. Comprehensive, detailed, based on experience and knowledge of the law, it is probably one of the most valuable submissions that I have seen in my 21 years in this place. There were other submissions. Common to all submissions was that they seemed to oppose the government's position and the government's legislation. A lot of people did a lot of good work, and when I criticise those simplistic, `flick a switch' email senders I am not criticising those who did an enormous amount of critical assessment of this legislation. 
As I have said, we have concerns about this legislation. They are concerns that have already been mentioned by Senator Faulkner and that will be taken into account by the opposition in its deliberation in the committee stage. We will be moving amendments that go very much to the heart of some of the government's propositions, and I hope those amendments will be carried. If they are not, I hope that this legislation does not proceed any further.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-24,"—Before commencing my comments on the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bills, I would like to take up from where Senator Bolkus left off in relation to emails. I actually have quite a different position: I actively encourage people to use the IT system to get their point of view across to their members and also to their senators. One Nation took the position of sending out the entire package to all of the legal fraternities and to those in positions in higher education in our universities, and we have been most surprised and thankful for the substantive responses that we have received from them.
Before I make some comments on the packages of bills before us, I would like to remind Senate of the origin of the word `terrorism'. The word `terrorism' originated in the French Revolution when the government instituted the Reign of Terror to execute political opponents, seize their properties and terrorise the rest of the population into submission. Terrorism can be considered both in terms of international terrorism, such as the attack on America, and in the original sense of the word: state terror. Public apprehension of impending violence is the terrorists' most valuable weapon. Such apprehension can lead to personal fear, changes in business or other practices which are unnecessary and damaging to economic or social life, and eventual government action which may undermine our democratic institutions. 
I am not suggesting that the current government is about to unleash a reign of terror. What I wish to point out is that the antiterrorism legislation package, if passed in its present form, will remain on the statutes for the next 20 to 50 years or forever. Checks and balances are needed to ensure that civil and political rights cannot be suffocated at some time in the future. There is already a wealth of legislation and administrative measures in place in Australia in the event of a mainland terrorist incident.
Prior to the 2000 Olympic Games, the government conducted a comprehensive review of Australian security arrangements, including the passage of the Defence Legislation (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Act 2000 giving the Prime Minister and other appointed members of the executive the power to call out the troops. The act also gave Australia's defence personnel the authority to shoot to kill Australian citizens. The Attorney-General's statement indicated that there is no known specific threat of terrorism and that Australia has `well practiced and coordinated security arrangements'. Given this statement, one wonders exactly whom this proposed legislative package will benefit.
In its submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, ASIO advised:
None of this is to suggest that there is any reason for assessing that Australia is a prime terrorist target. Clearly, the interests of a number of other countries are at considerably greater risk, such as the United States. At the same time, 11 September does mark a profound shift with real implications for Australian interests themselves and in respect of our responsibilities for foreign interests in Australia.
There are a number of points that I would like to make in relation to all of these bills before us. I will turn first to the time frame for discussion. The two-week time frame allowed for the preparation of submissions and for them to be made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee is a national scandal. This is not a criticism of the committee itself, which did a good job in what could be considered to be onerous circumstances. What I want to emphasise is the fact that some witnesses at the hearing chose to focus their attention on specific legislation—for example, the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002—because they simply did not have time to prepare submissions on the other bills. It is an indictment of the government when members of the public express regret over the fact that they could not comment on some bills due to the short consultation period. Two weeks is an affront to the democratic process, an absolute facade.  
I wish to emphasise a remark made by the Customs Committee of the Law Council of Australia, which stated:
It seems to have become the standard practice of the Federal Government to foreshadow the introduction of legislation for some time then introduce the Legislation and expect that it be passed through both Houses of Parliament as a matter of urgency without ample opportunity being provided for review of the Legislation and community comment.
There is also the issue of the way in which the bills are presented. Again, the Law Council, the peak body for Australian lawyers, pointed out in its submission to the Senate committee on the legislative package:
The legislation is only presented as amendments rather than specifically in the context of existing Legislation. Given the practical difficulties associated with properly reviewing the Legislation, the Customs Committee—
that is, the Customs Committee of the Law Council—
inquires whether it is possible, as part of the package of information made available to the public (together with the proposed Bill and Explanatory Memorandum) for the Federal Government to also issue those parts of the Legislation proposed to be amended which have been marked-up to show the effect of the proposed amendments.
It is commonly accepted practice in many environments (including commercial law) that documents which are changed are issued with marking-up to show appropriate changes. Given the resources available in terms of word processing and Legislative drafting, there appears to be little practical reason why such proposed marked-up Legislation should not be issued together with the amending Bill and Explanatory Memorandum.
This legislative package constitutes the most historic change to Australia's security environment in our nation's history, and yet we as the people's representatives are not allowed to debate each bill individually. Debate is being stifled in order to meet the convenience of the government—the heavy-handed tactics are almost as bad as the authoritarian legislation. It is an indictment upon the government that proper debate on each and every bill individually has not been allowed.
I will now address some specific concerns with each of the bills. The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 amends five acts and gives effect to the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The origins of the bill follow the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. The United Nations Security Council invoked chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which says that the Security Council may determine the existence of any `threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression', and decide on measures to be taken to `maintain or restore international peace and security'. After invoking chapter VII, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1373 on 28 September 2001. In that resolution, the council calls upon states to take action. I think it is important here that the people of Australia understand the United Nations terminology. Where this decision refers to a `state', it is referring to the Commonwealth of Australia, not an individual state within that Commonwealth. 
So in that resolution the council calls upon states to take action, both multilaterally and through national laws and regulations, to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism acts and to implement other wide-ranging counter-terrorism measures. The resolution urges states to:
Become parties as soon as possible to the relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, including the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism on 9 December 1999 ...
It is not usual for the Security Council, acting under chapter VII, to direct such a request to all member states; indeed, it may be one of the few instances where this has occurred. Since then it appears that every country has felt compelled to change their rules so that they can ratify various UN conventions on terrorism, including the Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. I would like to point out that the Law Council of Australia has stated:
It is by no means clear that Australia's international obligations require the creation of separate terrorism offences ... The Law Council considers that the onus is on the Government to justify the creation of new statutory offences and powers as necessary to meet existing and anticipated threats, and to demonstrate that these strike the right balance between the needs of security and the rights and liberties of the individual. Anti-terrorism measures adopted in Australia should not exceed our obligations to the international community. 
The convention on the financing of terrorism was originally adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 9 December 1999 and was opened for signatures on 10 January 2000. As of 2 April 2002, 132 countries have signed the convention and 26 countries have completed the ratification process, becoming state parties. The convention calls for effort to identify, detect and freeze or seize any funds used or allocated for the purpose of committing a terrorist act. It also asks that states consider establishing mechanisms to use such funds to compensate victims and/or their families. It calls upon financial institutions to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and to report to the government any such transactions that they suspect may be connected to criminal activity. The convention obliges state parties to prosecute offenders or to extradite them to the parties that suffer from the illegal acts.
The UN resolution has had a catalytic effect and has contributed to the speed of ratification and the influx of national terrorism legislation across the globe. The swift timing and draconian nature of the antiterrorist legislation that we are debating in this sitting is not unique to Australia. Canada, for example, instituted legislation to comply with this UN convention. Canada's legislation was extremely broad in scope and raised important issues of civil liberties violations, and citizens were given a very compressed time for consideration. Are we, in effect, seeing legislative actions designed to appease the Security Council? The UN has submitted to Australia, and to other member states, a long list of demands to suppress and prevent terrorism. Australia is now adopting whatever measures may be necessary to bring domestic law into harmony with various UN conventions.
The UN Security Council examines reports on how governments are complying with its requests for strengthening national laws against terrorism. To aid in this process, the UN has set up the Counter Terrorism Committee, headed by British ambassador Jeremy Greenstock. The committee's goal, according to the UN Newswire, is:
... upgrading the capacity of each nation's legislation and executive machinery to fight terrorism.
Mr Greenstock has stated:
... every government holds a responsibility for ensuring there is no weak part of the chain.
The UN Counter Terrorism Committee is not a tribunal for judging states and it cannot settle issues of political controversy, but it submits them back to the Security Council. I want to quote what UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said about the committee on counter terrorism:
Through the work of this committee, member states are for once really using this organisation in the way its founders intended—as an instrument through which to forge a global defence against a global threat.
My question is: what other threats are on the horizon where the UN might require the same sort of action? Today we are debating much more than a bill to change Australian legislation; we are debating whether we are going to allow ourselves to conduct our internal affairs according to a UN resolution, which involves some duties that are domestic in character.
To turn now to the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002, I find that, as with other bills, it is necessary to point out that law enforcement agencies have been operating effectively for eight months without this legislation and that there are already state and federal criminal laws which deal very severely with bombings. I wish to briefly note the comments of the federal Office of the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002. A recommendation was made that the bill and its interaction with the Criminal Code and other legislation be administered in light of good privacy practice. If a person explodes a device and does fearful damage, then they will be punished according to the section 72.3. Further along, 72.7 says proceedings for an offence under this division must not be commenced without the Attorney-General's written consent. A person can be arrested, charged, remanded in custody, or at least on bail, in connection with an offence under this division before the necessary consent by the Attorney-General has been given. 
There are two problems here. Firstly, proceedings cannot be brought without the Attorney-General's written consent. A person could bomb a building, but the Attorney-General has to give his permission before proceedings can commence. Secondly, it also gives the Attorney-General power to decide who is to be prosecuted. If any offences were committed by one group, the Attorney-General has the power to proceed against it. If it is committed by another group, the Attorney-General has the power to not proceed. It seems the powers conferred upon the Attorney-General would enable him or her to pick and choose which groups or individuals could be prosecuted. The executive powers are being greatly expanded. 
I might add that the legislation does not specify how long the Attorney-General has before giving permission to prosecute. Would it be that a person could be arrested, charged and remanded for a day, a month, a week? What is the specific time frame? How long could a person be held in limbo? As with other bills, I feel it is necessary to point out that law enforcement agencies have been operating effectively for more than eight or nine months without this legislation and that there are already state and federal criminal laws which deal with these proceedings. 
On the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2], let me make it clear that One Nation opposes any form of proscription of organisations and the consequential criminalisation of membership in and assisting to proscribe organisations. The government's amendments in relation to the proscriptive powers are weak and compromised. One Nation believes that the amendments do not go far enough. An organisation can still be specified although subject to disallowance by both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days of the regulation being tabled. We are also concerned that an organisation can be reviewed and outlawed again immediately when its two years as a specified organisation are up.
The legislation is not necessary and may be abused by governments in the future. It has been dressed up to look like it is going to combat terrorism and increase security but, instead, will allow the government to ban virtually any organisation in Australia. This legislation should be treated with the same contempt as the previous efforts to ban the Communist Party of Australia.
I now turn to the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. In the year 2000-01 a staggering 733,485 disclosures of information or documents by carriers, carriage service providers or number database operators were made under the provisions of part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 and reported to the Australian Telecommunications Authority. In the 2000-01 year, 524,253 disclosures of information or documents were made under section 282(1) and 282(2) of the Telecommunications Act without a warrant or certificate. It should be a reasonable question to ask of the government: why does it need to amend the present legislation? It seems the existing legislation more than adequately gives law enforcement agencies access to private telephone data.
To turn briefly to the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, our concern with this legislation, as with all of the government's antiterrorism bills, is to ensure that any tightening of existing loopholes does not impinge upon the common law principles and the democratic rights and freedoms that Australians enjoy. 
The clear onus and unequivocal judgment is on the government to justify and to prove that we need these new laws in Australia. Until sufficient and precise evidence is received, One Nation will be voting against all of the bills in this legislative package.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-24,"—I commend Senator Harris for much of what he had to say. I, on behalf of the Greens, express at the outset total opposition to this antiterrorist legislation. Our nation has very strong laws in place to deal with criminals, including terrorists, and very strong laws in place to surveil people who might be plotting against the country or against persons, organisations or institutions in the country. The impulse for this legislation has, of course, come from the Bush administration in the United States. I was recently in South Korea, which is a country that has a fledging democracy in the wake of many years of military government— 
—And a great soccer team.
—I will ignore the flippant comments from the member opposite. The South Korean people have demonstrated so strongly against so-called antiterrorist legislation in their country that it has been shelved—but not here in Australia. The outcome of this debate is going to very much depend on the Labor Party. I would ask the Labor Party to consider very carefully the amendments coming from the crossbenches, not least those from the Greens—I will enumerate them in a moment—because if the legislation is to pass then it does need to be amended very strongly to defend our institutions, community rights and democratic rights in this great democracy of Australia.
Let me quote from a recent speech from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, commenting on issues just like those that we are dealing with in the Senate today. She was addressing the World Conference on Human Rights through a report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mary Robinson said:
The issue of terrorism is not new on the human rights agenda. Terrorism is a threat to the most fundamental human rights. Finding common approaches to countering terrorism serves the cause of human rights. Some have suggested that it is not possible to effectively eliminate terrorism while respecting human rights. This suggestion is fundamentally flawed. The only long-term guarantor of security is through ensuring respect for human rights and humanitarian law. The essence of human rights is that human life and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts, whether carried out by State or non-State actors, are never justified no matter what the ends. At the same time human rights and humanitarian law are tailored to address situations faced by States, such as a public emergency, challenges to national security, and periods of violent conflict. This body of law defines the boundaries of permissible measures, even military conduct. It strikes a fair balance between legitimate national security concerns and fundamental freedoms.
These balances are most notably reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). As you know, the ICCPR recognises that States could take measures to derogate from certain rights at a time when the life of a nation is threatened, or to restrict rights in other defined exceptional circumstances. There are conditions however to ensure that transparency, proportionality and necessity of the measures taken. Some rights such as the right to life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom from torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and the principles of precision and nonretroactivity of criminal law, must be safe guarded at all times. The right to fair trial is also explicitly guaranteed under international humanitarian law. The principles of legality and rule of law require that the fundamental requirements of fair trial must be respected even under an emergency.
She goes on to say further in that speech:
I am particularly concerned that counter-terrorism strategies pursued after 11 September have sometimes undermined efforts to enhance respect for human rights. Excessive measures have been taken in several parts of the world that suppress or restrict individual rights including privacy, freedom of thought, presumption of innocence, fair trial, the right to seek asylum, political participation, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. On 10 December 2001, on the occasion of Human Rights Day, 17 special rapporteurs and independent experts of the Commission on Human Rights expressed their concern over reported human rights violations and measures that have targeted particular groups such as human rights defenders, migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees, religious and ethnic minorities, political activists and the media. Ensuring that innocent people do not become the victims of counter-terrorism measures should always be an important component of any anti-terrorism strategy.
It is that last comment by Mary Robinson that must focus our attention in this debate. Let me read it again:
Ensuring that innocent people do not become the victims of counter-terrorism measures should always be an important component of any anti-terrorism strategy. 
I submit that the legislation before us does not ensure that. In fact, it is open in many ways to abuse down the line by authority to ensnare people who are expressing their point of view in a way which is not acceptable to the government of the day.
Before I get on to the amendments to the government's legislation, I want to point out a backdoor method of proscription which has already passed into effective law in Australia. Last October, the government passed regulations that allow it to effectively ban organisations by freezing their assets and banning their fundraising without any reference to the parliament. These regulations allow for organisations to be banned and already included here is the PKK, the Kurdish freedom organisation, and the Sikh Youth Federation. In the future the government could ban separatist Papuan or Tibetan organisations under these provisions. In the past they could have banned Fretilin and the African National Congress. We will be moving amendments to close this loophole so that any such banning will have to come before parliament through regulation, and I particularly commend that to the Labor opposition and my colleagues on the crossbench.
It is very important, with loaded legislation such as this counter-terrorism legislation, that parliament be the vetting authority: the safeguard of human rights and organisational rights. The judgment of the executive should not simply be sufficient. Already that regulation allowing backdoor proscription through effectively financially obliterating organisations ought to come before the parliament and the parliament should be given the opportunity to disallow it if needs be. The new proscription provisions in this legislation effectively remove from parliamentary overview the power of the Attorney-General to ban any organisation in the future which falls foul of the definitions in this legislation. I note that there are amendments by the Labor opposition which would still allow the Attorney-General to ban organisations listed by the United Nations. I will be moving to ensure that that does not happen without the vetting of the parliament.
As Senator Harris mentioned, in 1954—and remember this was in the wake of the Korean War—the people of Australia voted at a referendum against proscription of the Communist Party, which at that time was being vilified as un-Australian and as supporting a violent approach to the takeover of the rest of the world. The country had been at war effectively against the communists in Korea with a great loss of life. Nevertheless, the people voted not to proscribe under those circumstances. Here we are now not in a state of war but with legislation before the parliament to allow the Attorney-General to proscribe just such organisations in the future. They will not have redress. This will be a considered decision by the Attorney-General, no doubt with reference to his cabinet colleagues, and I submit that that power should not be there. That is one of the reasons we will be voting against the bill. But, if it is going to remain, I urge in the strongest terms that the Labor Party without exception require any proscription to come before this Senate and the House of Representatives. This is too serious a matter to leave to the executive. 
One of the arguments used back in 1954—and it is as good an argument now as it was then—was that, if you proscribe organisations that you think are terrorist organisations, you simply send them underground. They are more difficult to follow and track down, and so it is much better to have those organisations functioning. When individuals go past what is permissible, they get netted under our surveillance laws and charged under the criminal laws that have worked in this country for so many decades.
I will also be moving amendments which will obviate the government's intention that protesters who threaten the health and safety of the public can be charged with terrorism. I do not believe that the ALP amendments will effectively get around the difficulties entailed in opening up that avenue. I have said publicly in the last couple of days that this could, for example, ensnare nurses who are picketing, because they are obviously not attending to public health and welfare while doing so—or at least ministers could argue that. Also, people protesting in the trees against the logging of forests in Australia have frequently been claimed to be endangering life and limb by the logging corporations—who, by the way, have a pretty horrendous record on endangering life and limb through their invidious activities which is second to almost none in the country. However, that is not the matter at hand. 
We have here a prescription for a government in the future to move in on such protests, brand the people involved as engaged in terrorism and close them and their organisations down. Whatever one might think about the issue, that is unthinkable in a democracy which values protest—and vigorous protest—even if it is not within the ambit of the written law at the time. Let those people have their day before the courts if they are arrested, but let them not be arraigned under this legislation which would label them terrorists and put them into a category where they never have belonged and never should belong in the future.
Such legislation, which would potentially pick up unionists who are picketing or conservationists who are protesting, would flow on to people who supplied those people with goods, businesses that supplied them with goods, people who supported them and people who knew about their activities—family, friends and the like. We do not accept that there is a need to create such new offences relating to terrorism; that is, the threat to health and safety. The existing criminal law, with offences such as murder, criminal damage, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting, can and should be used to prosecute and penalise anything that can sensibly be described as terrorism. However, given ALP support for the government's legislation in the widest sense, we want to ensure, as far as possible, that protest, dissent and union action cannot be labelled and prosecuted as terrorism. We also want to ensure that anyone who is prosecuted will have to be proven to be knowingly involved in terrorist acts.
As many members in the Labor Party will know, the recent ALP state conference recognised and expressed great concern about this legislation—and, in fact, opposed it. The conference called on federal ALP members of parliament to oppose the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002—which we are not dealing with today, but which is coming down the line, and which is an outrageous undermining of basic human rights recognised not just in this country but right around the world. It provides, amongst other things, for people to be taken off the street, interrogated without their own lawyers, held incommunicado and charged with criminal offences with the potential of up to five years in jail simply for not answering questions. We will deal with that another time.
We Greens will also be moving to protect Australians and their families caught up in overseas conflicts. This is a very difficult matter. But the legislation, as it stands, would mean that any Australian caught up in an overseas conflict in which the Australian Defence Force was directly or indirectly engaged could be charged with treason. Any friend or family member who did not tell the Australian authorities about that person would also be charged. Where is the dividing line here? Does this mean that, if America had this on the books, Jane Fonda would have been charged during the Vietnam War? It is wide open to it. What about the small band of Australians who went and stood on the border between Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf War to try and prevent war? They were effectively in the wrong place at the wrong time, according to this legislation, and could have been charged with terrorism. We are concerned about that.
I express again my concern about the two Australians currently at Guantanamo Bay without any rights whatever. That is an outrageous breach of basic human rights by the United States administration, aided and abetted by the Howard government. The government's complicity through silence on this occasion is simply untenable for people who value human rights and believe that people should be brought to trial if they are charged with an act as serious as terrorism or treason—and tried in the Australian courts, if we are to follow the logic of the current government's thinking. 
Finally, the Greens will move a sunset clause. It is a very generous one. It says that we should review this legislation in five years time. There is enormous concern about the ramifications of the legislation. We believe it breaches not only Australian ethos but also a number of international covenants to which we are signatories—and it is unnecessary. But if, as it appears, Labor is going to shepherd some form of this legislation through the parliament, it is very important that it be under review. A sunset clause in five years time will ensure that that review takes place.
The Greens oppose this legislation. We have major amendments. We will be seeking information from the government in the committee stage. We commend our opposition and our amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-06-24,"—I rise to add to the comments that have already been made by the Democrats' attorney-general and justice spokesperson, Senator Brian Greig, who outlined the Democrats' stance on this bill in general and who specifically has talked, and in the committee stage will talk, about the amendments that the Australian Democrats have proposed. Since the introduction of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bills, the Australian Democrats have campaigned very strongly to have these bills withdrawn. We did not do so lightly. We are aware of the security implications of the tragic events of September 11 last year. We are mindful of the obligation of this parliament to ensure that our laws are adequate to deter and to be able to pursue terrorists. The Australian Democrats, like all parties and all members in this place, abhor terrorism and would enthusiastically support legislation that was balanced to address any demonstrated deficiencies in Australian law in relation to terrorism. But the bills that have been introduced are not balanced and they do not address demonstrated deficiencies in Australian law. These bills, when introduced to the House of Representatives, were fundamentally flawed and they represented a poorly targeted response to terrorist activities in the United States. 
The Democrats' campaign against this legislation was prompted by the attack that these bills represent on the rights of Australian citizens. Our campaign was spurred on by the many faxes, phone calls and emails that we received in Democrat offices. We had people all over Australia campaigning Democrats and Democrat senators because of their concern about what this government was proposing and about the impact it would have on their rights as citizens and on democracy in our country, because these bills proposed an extraordinary set of measures that were utterly inconsistent with core civil rights and the rule of law. Community concern about possible terrorist threats should not be used as an excuse to enact unwarranted, unnecessary and undemocratic legislation. The legislation represented an ambit claim for arbitrary executive power and deserved to be rejected by this chamber. We would do well to heed the words of Justice Michael Kirby, speaking of that failed referendum relating to the Communist Party Dissolution Act—and I know it has been referred to by the most recent speakers before me—when His Honour said:
Given the chance to vote on the proposal to change the Constitution, the people of Australia, fifty years ago, refused. When the issues were explained, they rejected the enlargement of federal power. History accepts the wisdom of our response in Australia and the error of the over-reaction of the United States. Keeping proportion. Adhering to the ways of democracies. Upholding constitutionalism and the rule of law. Defending, even under assault, the legal rights of suspects. These are the ways to maintain the love and confidence of the people over the long haul. We should never forget these lessons ... Every erosion of liberty must be thoroughly justified. Sometimes it is wise to pause. Always it is wise to keep our sense of proportion and to remember our civic traditions as the High Court Justices did in the Communist Party Case of 1951. 
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recently concluded its inquiry into this legislation. The committee was inundated with many hundreds of submissions calling for the bills to be scrapped. I congratulate all the members of the committee on a quality report. That assisted us and the parliament as a whole in exposing the many flaws of this legislation. In particular, I congratulate and applaud the many individuals and organisations who took the time to provide submissions to the inquiry, standing up for the rights of all Australians. It is ironic that this legislation should come at a time when the government is yet again criticising the role of the Senate. The government does not seem to accept the fundamental right of the parliament to have a house of review. However, it was actually a Senate committee—the house of review's committee—that provided the mechanism for public consultation on this legislation and ultimately produced a report exposing the fundamental flaws in the bills. It is the Senate, once again, that has stood in the way of the passage of some of the most draconian legislation ever introduced in this place. 
I will reflect briefly on the processes that have led up to today's debate. We all know that the government rushed these bills through the House of Representatives with no real scrutiny. If there is any doubt about that, I think the Senate committee process revealed that that was the case. The Leader of the Opposition in the other place said at the time:
The bills in question before the House amount to over 100 pages of legislation and over 100 pages of explanatory memoranda. To give some indication, this was introduced into the parliament at 8 o'clock last night and we are expected to consider those 200 pages and form a position about them to debate in this chamber at 12 o'clock the next day. That is not how you run modern government. 
I support the Leader of the Opposition's comments on this matter. I have already alluded to the Senate inquiry. Many organisations and individuals who made submissions to the committee complained about the lack of time for the proper scrutiny of those bills and the preparation of their submissions. Liberty Victoria said in their submission:
The time frames in which to respond to these bills, along with other related bills including 13 proposed international treaties, is extremely short. As a result, we have been unable to examine all the terrorist related bills. We draw the committee's attention to the fact that short time frames are essentially undemocratic and they severely curtail public participation and consultation. Liberty hopes that the situation will be remedied in the future to allow proper scrutiny of bills.
In a similar vein, Amnesty International said:
Amnesty International considers this exceedingly short period for public consultation to be completely inadequate. The lack of time for public consultation and debate is of particular concern, given the seriousness of the proposed legislation.
So a number of submissions raised this issue. I make it clear that I do not raise it in order to reflect unfavourably on the committee; as I have already said, the committee produced a quality report. However, it is important to consider whether the process leading up to today's debate has been satisfactory from the community's perspective.
The next step in the process was the government's response to the committee report. The Attorney-General issued a press release on 4 June. It stated that the government had finalised its amendments to the counter-terrorism package of legislation following the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I—among many others, but on behalf of the Democrats—was extremely surprised that while the government had produced these finalised amendments it was refusing to release them for public scrutiny. My office, along with Senator Brian Greig, contacted the Attorney-General and sought to obtain a copy of these amendments but we were told that they would be made available to the Australian Labor Party but not to us. I wrote to the Attorney-General the following day indicating the need for a transparent process for the redrafting of the legislation. I indicated that, as the government was keen to debate the bills in the June sitting, it was a matter of great urgency that the amendments be released to us to allow proper scrutiny. It has been weeks. Those amendments were not made available to us until 7.30 last Wednesday night, less than 24 hours before the commencement of debate on this legislation in the Senate.
These amendments propose a significant rewrite of the package of five bills. This has not been a satisfactory process. Time should have been allowed for proper scrutiny of the reviewed and revised legislation. Given that there are fundamental rights at stake in this debate, we believe the government should be treading very carefully. With so much at stake it is ill conceived to rush through this legislation at such a pace. That is clearly what happened in the House of Representatives: the legislation that passed through the House of Representatives was appalling. I was concerned to hear the comments by the Attorney-General last Friday. Referring to the need to maintain a balance between protecting civil liberties and bolstering Australia's ability to combat terrorism, the Attorney-General said: 
I stand by the view that the Government's original package struck a fair balance between these imperatives. But I respect the committee process and I respect the concerns that were put forward.
That is an incredibly disturbing perspective and is one that I doubt the Senate committee, for obvious reasons, would agree with. I doubt that a majority of Australians would agree with that disturbing perspective. Given the number of flaws that have been identified in the legislation since it was introduced to the House of Representatives, I have no idea how the Attorney-General can maintain such a stance and expect us to believe that he thought that that balance was being struck. The government has been pressured by its own backbench and by the Senate into amending these bills. The fact is that it is still inappropriate to show disrespect and disregard for basic civil liberties.
One of the most striking problems with the legislation as introduced—and Senator Greig has made reference to this—was the proposed definitions of terrorism and treason. We were very concerned about the excessively broad definition of terrorism and the very narrow scope of the exceptions for industrial action and lawful advocacy, protest and dissent. There is a range of situations where the definition of terrorism could be met, where the conduct in question would fall well short of accepted notions of terrorism, and I know groups have already been mentioned in this debate that could possibly fall within that broad definition. It is clear that the legislation could have been used to prosecute those involved in public demonstrations designed to further political, religious or ideological causes. It is an outrage that that definition was so broad that it would scoop up in the net those kinds of groups. Certain forms of industrial action, such as picketing, could have been open to prosecution under that broad definition.
The offence of terrorism is one of the cornerstones of this legislation. It was a major flaw and a cause for grave concern that it would have included all sorts of protests and activism that anyone would consider to be part of a healthy, robust democracy. The political nature of the offence gave it the clear potential to be used to stifle opposition and dissent. It is vital to establish a sound definition of terrorism that does not extend to political activity unconnected with terrorism. Also concerning was the proposed definition of treason. It raised the possibility that people providing humanitarian aid during armed conflict could be convicted of treason. That is clearly unacceptable.
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this legislation, though, is the proposed proscription power of the Attorney-General. This allows the Attorney-General to ban organisations and criminalise membership of those organisations. It is inappropriate in the extreme that the power to proscribe organisations should rest solely in the hands of one member of the executive. It is an arbitrary power with very significant potential for abuse. There are clear parallels—again, some of which have been mentioned—between the legislation and the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950. The Law Council of Australia rightly characterised the power as:
A serious departure from the principle of proportionality, unnecessary in a democratic society, subject to arbitrary application, and contrary to a raft of international human rights standards including the right to personal liberty, the right to a fair trial, protection against arbitrary interference with privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association and rights of participation.
These bills also sought to create a number of strict and absolute liability offences. Such offences are at odds with the presumption of innocence. They require the conviction of individuals in circumstances where the tribunal of fact is left with a reasonable doubt as to the person's guilt. Strict and absolute liability sometimes applies in relation to offences of a regulatory nature. Such liability, however, has no role in serious criminal offences that carry life imprisonment. 
The Australian Democrats were one of the first groups to highlight the proposed changes to SMS and email interception powers, and we have been campaigning strongly to have those powers withdrawn. Thankfully, the government have withdrawn those powers for now but have indicated that they would like to proceed with them at some point in the future. We welcome the withdrawal of that element of the legislation. When it returns for separate consideration, we hope that it will be very carefully scrutinised by the Senate and ultimately opposed.
These bills in their original form undoubtedly represented an attack on the fundamental democratic principles of this country. The proposed definition of terrorism was incredibly broad and could have caught in it a range of political activities that did not have anything to do with terrorism; the exceptions for advocacy, protest, dissent and industrial action were totally inadequate. It is dangerous to assume that no future government would use these excessively broad powers to suppress opposition and dissent, because that is a possible consequence of having these laws on the books. The very broad proposed power of the Attorney-General to ban organisations was entirely inappropriate and is reminiscent, as I have said, of the failed Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950. It has no place in a democratic nation.
These bills also took the unprecedented—and, I believe, unjustified—step of imposing absolute liability in relation to offences carrying life imprisonment. The proposed changes to the privacy of email, text messages and other forms of digital communication were completely wrong. Many of these issues will be addressed during the committee stage discussions on these bills and through amendments that have emanated from a number of parties, including the government. It is important to remember that, if the Senate were the rubber stamp that the House of Representatives is, these extraordinary bills would have passed unamended—and that is a frightening thought for many in this place and, indeed, for many Australian citizens—but, as it happens, a number of the defects in this legislation will be remedied. The Democrats believe that, even if all the government and opposition amendments are successful, there will still be areas of outstanding concern. We will attempt to address some of those areas of concern, inasmuch as they can be addressed.
We remain particularly concerned about the banning of organisations and, more specifically, about the criminalisation of membership of an organisation. Punishment because of mere membership of an organisation is determining guilt by association and should be opposed. Not all members of an organisation share the intentions or support the activities of other members. It is disappointing that, we have heard, the Australian Labor Party will be supporting this provision. We are also clear on the need for a sunset clause to take effect following a comprehensive inquiry and an independent review of this legislation. Senator Brian Greig, the law and justice spokesperson for the Democrats, will be exploring these and other issues that the Democrats have indicated are of concern. We will be moving a number of important amendments in an attempt to significantly improve this legislation.
In closing, I wish to touch briefly on the theme of excessive executive power. It is an unfortunate reality that all people are fallible and some people are corrupt. History teaches that, when authorities are given excessive and unchecked powers, those powers tend to be wrongly exercised or wilfully abused. Concentrations of executive power must be checked; arbitrary executive power should be eliminated. The rights and liberties of our citizens are the lifeblood of a democracy, and any attack upon those rights and liberties presents a clear danger to our way of life. The Australian Democrats believe it is vital that, in defending democracy, we do not compromise the very ideals we are seeking to preserve.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-06-24,"—The Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2] and related bills are very vital and very important. We have to get this right. The legislation as it is drafted and as it is before us is not adequate. The attacks upon New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11 last year have had a profound effect and have been the catalyst for the drafting of these bills. In reviewing the bills, the Senate—with its powers embedded in the constitution—has an extremely important role to preserve the rights of individuals, especially when they come under attack. 
I understand that it was not the intention of the government to subject those rights to an attack, but that effect has found its way into the legislation. I am certainly mindful of the fact that the government has been acting in cooperation with the US and the UK, for example, and with the United Nations to put in place more stringent measures to deal with terrorism—which threatens to become global in its impact. I acknowledge that terrorism is a global problem requiring global solutions. Whilst the rapid development in modern communications in the last decade—such as the development of the World Wide Web, the use of email and mobile phones and the growth in electronic commerce—has brought many benefits, modern communications can be and are used by those seeking to spread terrorism more widely. I acknowledge that Australia cannot be ignorant of those facts. Australians have always valued their freedom; many of our citizens have sacrificed their lives in war to defend our way of life. As the government would know, it has the responsibility to protect the lives, liberties and properties of citizens when threatened without invading their privacy by spying on them or detaining them without warrants.
However, there is no point in defending freedom against threats by threatening freedom itself, and it did seem to me that this package of legislation tended to do that. Whenever questions of national security arise, the importance of the individual and the dignity of each and every human being must remain paramount. Throughout human history there are many examples of totalitarian regimes where the interests of the state are deemed to be more important than individual rights and freedoms. As we all know, the state exists—or should exist—to serve the individual and, if the individual becomes subservient to the state, human rights, human dignity and the respect for human life itself are lost. We all know that, and we all acknowledge it. Not only does the state exist for the individual: it also exists for those fundamental institutions such as the family, in which individuals can flourish.
Thankfully, Australia, up until now, has been able to maintain a reasonable balance between national security and civil liberties. The bills that we have before us, unless they are amended—and proposals have been put forward by the government themselves, the opposition and others—have got the potential to threaten the delicate balance and the very freedoms which we have enjoyed and defended. The right to privacy, the right to freedom of association and the right to protest—these are rights that are basic to a healthy society. The role of the Senate, in protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals by scrutinising these bills and making changes, is of paramount importance.
My views have been longstanding on these matters. I remember arguing certain cases 20-odd years ago. I was also interested to read and appreciate what the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report said, and I consider that it was a job quite well done. I do appreciate, as an individual senator, the work that is done by these committees. Although I was not on that particular committee at its hearings, I have the advantage of being a participating member on all legislation committees and, of course, I am a member of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee.
I want to acknowledge the government, the minister, Senator Ellison and others for their work. There has been a considerable amount of work done since that time, and amendments have been proposed. I also wish to acknowledge that the opposition have been involved in discussions. There has been much debate internally and with the government. Those discussions have been on some of the major sticking points such as the definition of terrorism, the power to proscribe an organisation, and the reversal of the onus of proof. I look forward to the committee stage debate when these particular matters will be thoroughly canvassed and when there will be an opportunity for the minister at the table to respond to questions. I have always found the minister, Senator Ellison, to be very forthcoming in respect of questions that are asked in this chamber and elsewhere. That, to me, is a far better approach than some of the approaches that we get from one or two other ministers. I would like to go for another minute and a half, but I understand that we will have closure of the debate by the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in due course—presumably after questions to take note of answers.

Does the minister recall that recently, when asked at Senate estimates, `What happens to behaviour as a result of those PBS price increases?' Mr Charles Maskell-Knight, the First Assistant Secretary, Health Access and Financing Division, said, `I think it is fair to say that the impact does not last very long'?

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-06-24,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister recall saying in the Senate, on 18 October 1990, when speaking against the imposition of PBS copayments, `There is growing evidence to suggest that this change will not necessarily help stop the blow-out in the pharmaceutical budget'? That was in the Senate Hansard of 18 October 1990, page 3421. When and why did the minister change her mind on this issue?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-06-24,"—Senator West knows only too well, as do all the people on the other side, that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has increased from $1 billion in 1990 to over $4 billion—almost $5 billion—this year. Earlier this year we had some research undertaken, and we found that most Australians do not understand how much their medications are subsidised. The most commonly prescribed medication—I have said this a number of times—costs $80 per person per script. For people on a concession card who pay $3.60 for their prescription, we were proposing that they pay $4.60 up to 52 scripts and then they get their medication for free. When we did the research, they indicated that they thought $20 was an expensive medication. People who did not have a concession card—and 85 per cent of scripts are written for people who are on a health care card—thought that they paid the full price of their medication. Very few people are aware that some medications, for diseases like diabetes and multiple sclerosis, cost from $1,000 to $1,100 per script. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not sustainable in its current form. 
You would believe, from the other side, that we had no other measures in the budget to rein in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We are not taking money out of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What we are proposing is that we spend the same amount of money on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme this year as we did last year, and more into the out years. Ms Macklin has joined in the debate—we might imagine she would join in the debate—and has refused to rule out increasing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments if Labor were to win government. She said that when Labor brought in the copayment they gave pensioners a benefit. She forgets to mention that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme goes up by the CPI, and we introduced the fact that pensions go up by male average weekly earnings. The Labor Party's approach is: tell only half the story; do not tell the whole story. 
The sickest and the poorest in this country will be affected if we are unable to sustain new medications coming onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, if we are unable to look at some of the medications that are lining up that will cost thousands of dollars per person. I have said before that the community has to make a decision about whether we spend more on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a government. We are not taking money out of the PBS, and in the out years we are spending more. Will we need to spend more as a nation, and will we as individuals need to spend more of our household budgets? I know it is not easy, I know it is difficult, but we have all got a difficult decision to make. If we want access to very expensive medications, we all have to make some sort of contribution to them. The sickest and the poorest—and we have crocodile tears on the other side—will be the ones who will be affected. Senator West said that one of the bureaucrats said that it will not change behaviour. What it does is to bring people's attention to the fact that medications are very expensive and that we have to use them wisely.  
We have got not just the instrument increasing the copayment; we have brought in measures to address the very few pharmacists who are engaged in fraud and measures to improve the prescribing of medications by doctors so that they more clearly understand the guidelines, with information that will be provided by us and information that will be provided by the pharmaceutical companies. We are looking at a raft of measures, including, as I have said before, better management and better use of medication.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-06-24,"—The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was $1 billion then. It is now almost $5 billion. The other thing is that we have talked about a raft of measures, not just increasing the cost of the copayment. We have a raft of measures, including the National Prescribing Service—$45 million over four years—that Labor never had, to improve the use of medications. We also have the Home Medicine Review Program, with over 1,500 accredited pharmacists and another 500 or 600 in the pipeline, so that pharmacists can go into people's homes, in conjunction with the person's doctor, and go through their medication to ensure that they are taking the right medication. We have a whole program for the better use of medicines; it is not just the instrument increasing the copayment.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
The government has tried to defend its 30 per cent hike in the cost of pharmaceuticals to Australian families and pensioners by arguing that this is the way to stop the blow-out in the costs of pharmaceuticals in this country. We know from historical experience and from the evidence of Department of Health and Ageing officials in the Senate estimates process that this move will have no impact on the long-term trend of increased costs of the PBS. What we know is that there will be a spike, that demand for drugs will fall in the short term and then growth in demand will continue to rise in the longer term. The reason there will be a short-term drop-off in demand is that poorer people—people on low incomes, pensions and disability support—will decide that they cannot afford pharmaceuticals, that they cannot afford to get all their scripts filled and that they will make decisions about their health care based not on their doctor's advice or on their medical need but on what they can afford. The 30 per cent increase driven by government policy, if adopted, would have that impact on their costs, but it would have no impact on the long-term trend in the PBS.
The government is failing to tackle some of the real issues that exist in this area. I do give credit to the government in the sense that there were some initiatives in the budget which will help. There were some budget policy decisions which will go towards making the PBS more efficient and towards attacking unjustifiable increases in costs and some of the practices that have become associated with drug manufacturing, production and marketing in this country, but they fail to tackle a whole range of the key issues. 
The debate today around some of the questions asked of the minister related to the drug Celebrex. This is a classic example of where a drug was brought onto the market, the government estimated in the first year a cost of $40 million and the real cost was in the order of $160 million: a massive blow-out in the cost of the drug and in the cost to the PBS. Yet somehow the argument today is that the cost blow-out caused in Celebrex and other drugs such as Zyban is going to be addressed by slugging pensioners and families. Slugging them for that extra cost is somehow going to address those problems. These problems come back to the government's management of the introduction of those drugs, such as its failure to take the necessary precautions on price and volume controls. Now pensioners and families have been asked to bear the cost of this mismanagement—and, quite frankly, with the former Minister Wooldridge it was more than mismanagement. We all remember the very political interference in the membership of the PBAC. We saw a large number of members of that organisation resign because of the minister's interference and his attitudes to their work and, while there was a defence by the current minister of the good role that they play, we all remember the interference that occurred and the appointment of a pharmaceutical industry representative to that body, which caused a great deal of disquiet about maintaining the independence of the PBAC and the effect on its ability to do its work effectively.
We know that, with drugs like Celebrex, the government did not introduce the price and volume controls that would have protected the budget from the blow-outs that have occurred. We now have a massive blow-out in the costs because those drugs have been inappropriately prescribed for people who could have done with other drugs that were cheaper or more appropriate to their needs. The government comes back and says that because of that mismanagement, because of that failure, the pensioners of Australia have to suffer. They have to have a 30 per cent hike in the price they pay for the drugs, because the government did not tackle that issue properly. What we know is that there will be other drugs where we will have the same problems. 
The questions at stake are questions of proper public policy, proper management of the PBAC, proper price and volume controls and proper use of authorities with drugs. Zyban is the other one where authority was required, but the counselling services et cetera that were supposed to go with the authorisation for these drugs did not occur. There was a huge blow-out in the use and the cost of Zyban and, consequently, the taxpayers had to pay much more for that drug than was anticipated because of the failure to put in place the proper public policy. We are saying to the government that slugging pensioners and families with a 30 per cent increase in their costs is not the answer to these issues; it lies in proper public policy solutions.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-06-24,"—Anyone would think that we have just pressed the replay button from a debate last week on this particular subject. We have heard the Labor Party today repeat the same falsities as last week, that it is somehow the government's fault that Celebrex, Zyban, Vioxx and all of those drugs have been prescribed. I repeat what I said last week: governments do not prescribe; doctors do. I might add that Labor senators do not prescribe. The Labor senators think that they are above all of that and that they are better equipped to know what a patient requires. What worries me, worried me last week and has worried me ever since the announcement of the PBS copayment came in is that the Labor Party are going to take Celebrex, Vioxx and Zyban—and probably a whole lot of other drugs important to diabetes and asthma—off the PBS. That is what they are driving at. They have refused point-blank to deny it, and they continue to say that Celebrex, Vioxx and Zyban should not be on the PBS.
They say that people will not be able to afford these drugs. What a lot of nonsense. We heard today Senator Evans and some of the carping canaries over there talking about the cost of these drugs. What they do not understand is that there are many drugs for which the PBS level does not even cut in, because they are of lower value than the PBS payment. The Labor Party cannot get it through their thick scones that many drugs do not get to the PBS, so people who are non health care cardholders might have to pay $28.60 for a drug that costs $1,200, $600, $300 or $400. That does not matter to the Labor Party. They just keep saying, `Let's just run the bill up. It is not our worry.' If they were in government that is exactly what they would do. As Senator Patterson said at question time today, they would just go overseas and borrow more money to pay for this; they would not care less. That is what they did when they were in government for 13 years. Any time they wanted to do something, they would either jack taxes up or go overseas and borrow more money. 
For non health care cardholders in this situation we are talking about a maximum of about 31 scripts per year—and all of those scripts would have to be written for drugs that are on the PBS and not below, before they actually got to the safety net. That does not worry the Labor Party; that is not news. `We will go out and tell fibs about it'—that is what they have done today, what they did last week and what they have done every day since the budget announcement. It is about time people understood what the Labor Party are coming at. No wonder they are in opposition. No wonder Premier Carr and Barry Jones think you have nothing to offer the people of Australia: you cannot even get a policy like this right. You cannot go out and tell the truth: that people who are on health care cards simply have at maximum one script per week before they hit the safety net. The average number of scripts written for health cardholders is 19 per year, so most cardholders will only be paying $19 a week more—
—A year.
—Thank you, Senator Crowley, that was a useful interjection for a change. Nineteen dollars a year is the maximum that most of them will be paying on average, yet listening to the Labor Party it sounds as though they are going to be paying hundreds of dollars instead of $19. Even if they are high script users—and some people are on a combination or a cocktail—the maximum they are going to pay is $52 a year. Listening to the Labor Party you would think it was $520 a year. It is about time some honesty came back into this debate from the opposition parties, and time they realised that if they did have the responsibility of government—they should take appropriate action.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I was fascinated to hear Senator Knowles abusing the Labor Party because we say that governments do have a role in how pharmaceuticals and the costs are managed. You are right, Senator Knowles, senators do not actually prescribe—with stunning exceptions, and I could be one—
—But you don't prescribe any more.
—Senator, you should not rabbit on when you don't know what you're talking about. Despite what you say, it is the government's responsibility to help manage prescribing practices. That is one of the things that the Labor government set out to do, and they did it very successfully, first of all encouraging the use of generic brands—much cheaper drugs than the full tot, nongeneric, private brands with all their labelling and so on. The Labor Party started that. To give it its due, the Liberal Party has continued it, but it is silly for Senator Knowles to insist that the government has no role in it. It certainly does. As we pointed out today, if the recommendation for Celebrex to be a drug prescribed on authority had gone through then the number of those prescriptions would have been significantly less. At least, that was the evidence when the Labor Party introduced authority requirements for the prescription of many other drugs in times past. The doctors complained very extensively about it, so the Labor Party when in government took off the requirement for authority. It watched the number of prescriptions go through the roof so it put the requirement back in again. Yes, governments can make a huge difference on the cost of prescriptions and also the prescribing practices. Properly, the Labor Party in government started that process and the Liberal Party continues it. But it is ridiculous to insist that we did nothing and they are all pure. 
I would hope that the Labor government would never introduce what is in this budget, which is so unfair and is so skewed toward making the biggest hit on the poorest and the sickest in this community. It is well and good for Senator Knowles to say that the pharmaceutical safety net will only go up by $1 a week for people on health care cards; for people on health care cards there is no margin, there is no disposable income. To increase the general safety net for the poorest in this country from $187.20 to $239.20 is an increase of $52 a year once people get onto the number of prescriptions that allow them to have that safety net. That $52 a year is not small for people living on a pension. `Just a dollar a week': if you say it like that it does not sound much—to people who have some disposable income. But to people on health care cards $52 a year is a significant amount of money.
Why would you want to take money from the poorest people in our community when you could certainly do much better by, for example, requiring authority on the prescriptions for Celebrex? That would save a considerable amount of money on pharmaceuticals overall. The government's response to all of this is, `We've got to save money, we won't be able to afford the cost of pharmaceuticals in time.' That is why the Labor government in the past introduced steps to modify the prescribing practices of doctors. That is the most efficient and best way to restrict the cost of pharmaceuticals: getting the doctors to think about what they are prescribing. The first big battle was to get them to prescribe the cheaper generic brands.
Finally, Minister Patterson today, in trying to explain why she put out a bit of paper explaining all of these changes, said she did that to explain the proposals. But nobody reading it would think they were proposals when it reads, for example, `from 1 August the prices will rise by ...'. That is not the statement of proposals; that is a statement of what will happen. The minister went on to say that she really put out this bit of paper not to explain proposals—and, indeed, facts—but because she believed that nobody in this Senate would defeat it. That is a quite contrary series of arguments and, I must say, a very disappointing one. The government jumped the gun on this and they have been caught, because this Senate—this Labor opposition—is not going to allow the poorest and the sickest to bear the burden of the pharmaceutical costs and the mismanagement of the budget under Mr Howard and Mr Costello. If they want to restrict the cost of prescriptions, they should bring in a policy that spreads those costs amongst the richest people, the people who can afford it, and not amongst the sickest.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-06-24,"—Australia has one of the finest pharmaceutical benefit schemes in the world. People in this country have the great benefit of being able to get medications very cheaply through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is very unusual in the world, because in most countries medications are very expensive and in many cases people simply have to go without because they cannot afford them. The government, with these measures, is ensuring that Australia's fine record of providing pharmaceutical medications to the population of this country who need them at a cheap rate is maintained. I find it very hard to understand why the ALP—which likes to promote itself as the party of the poor and underprivileged and as the party which cares about people who need to be assisted in many ways, including in the provision of purchasing medications—is opposing the measures the government is introducing when the purpose of them is to ensure that the most needy people in Australia are still able to get medications at very cheap rates by world standards.
As an example of how different from other countries the cost of medications is in this country, one of our colleagues had a prescription filled last year for an antibiotic called Rulide, and it cost him around $16 at a pharmacy in Manuka. He went to Thailand, I believe, and to get a second prescription filled for the same drug it cost him $A132. That is an example of the enormous difference in the costs of medication between this country and other countries. 
Because science is improving, more and more new drugs are being found and the cost of medications is increasing. Because the cost is increasing, the forward projections of the expenditure required to maintain the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are increasing as well. Over the last 10 years, the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has increased by an average of something like 14 per cent per annum. Over the last two years, the expenditure has increased by between 20 to 26 per cent per annum. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is the fastest growing component of Commonwealth health expenditure. For example, there are drugs for common conditions now being developed which are very effective compared to those available in the past and which cost a great deal of money. It seems to me quite obvious and logical that, if we are to maintain the level of expenditure on the health scheme, we have to control that expenditure to some degree by increasing the patient component paid for medication.
Something like 85 per cent of the prescriptions written in Australia are for people on concession cards. Those people, it is proposed, will pay $4.60 a prescription, which is an increase of $1 from $3.60 a prescription. A single prescription for diabetes, for Humulin insulin, may cost the federal government $391 but the patient will only pay $4.60; the prescriptions of people who have asthma commonly cost the government $52 or $85. To ask people to pay just $1 extra to meet those increased costs I do not think is a very great ask. What Australia has done in terms of pharmaceutical benefits, as I have said, is the envy of the rest of the world. The federal government is managing the projected increased costs in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in a very prudent way by proposing to slightly increase the patient component of these costs. That is a very responsible and sensible process to adopt so that Australians continue to have excellent service.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I would like to take note of the answers from Senator Patterson today to questions put to her by the Labor Party on the issues of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and, in particular, go to the issues of Celebrex and advertising. We know that the PBAC, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, goes through a process of assessing a drug in terms of its cost-effectiveness and whether or not it is an appropriate drug to list as a publicly funded drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The PBAC, as we know, recommended to the minister some years ago that Celebrex should be listed. The minister then asked the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority to negotiate with the company. What the minister did not tell the Senate here today, when given the opportunity through the questions, was that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended to the minister that Celebrex be listed but with conditions: acceptable cost-effectiveness at a price not significantly greater than $1 per day; and that the arrangement should be subject to a price volume agreement based on the estimated proportion of current NSAID use by patients with the approved indication who are 60 years of age and above. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended to the minister that that drug be listed with conditions. The minister today said to us that the PBAC did not recommend that it have an on authority condition—that is correct—but why would the authority recommend to the minister that an on authority condition be attached when in fact it had recommended an alternative control arrangement—the price volume agreement?
History tells us that the price volume agreement was not adopted by the government. The minister did not take the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the minister did not put in place any controls. He put no controls in place to control the prescribing of Celebrex. As we know, as a direct result of the minister's actions, the expected estimate of the market was $40 million for the first year, but $170 million was, in fact, spent through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on Celebrex. The minister did not get a recommendation about an on authority condition—he got a very clear message about a price volume agreement and he did not take it. If we had had a price volume agreement the manufacturers of Celebrex—the company Pharmacia—would have got two different levels of payment. For their first $40 million they would have been paid at a higher figure and for the second amount of money they would have been paid at a lower rate.  
That price volume agreement arrangement sends a message to the manufacturers and the marketers of pharmaceutical drugs that it is not worthwhile for you to spend a lot of time and effort marketing your pharmaceutical product to both consumers and doctors. That does not happen in the United States and the blow-out and the enormous expense that pharmaceutical companies go to to advertise their products to both consumers and doctors is larger than any other vote—any other amount of money—spent by any other industry in America. At least we have some control but it is not absolute and the pharmaceutical companies do spend a lot of money advertising to the community. This government took no notice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on the issue of Celebrex. So it is wrong for Senator Knowles to say that they are completely blameless. She says that it is not the Senate but doctors who prescribe drugs. That is true but it is governments who manage pharmaceutical benefits schemes and it is this government that has mismanaged this Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-24,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
This Bill is designed to expand the definition of “excised offshore place” in the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to include the Coral Sea Islands Territory and certain islands of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
The Bill will also specify an “excision time” for the places that are added to the definition of “excised offshore place”. 
Reasons for Urgency
On 7 June 2002, the Governor-General made regulations that expanded the definition of “excised offshore place” for the purposes of the Act to include the Coral Sea Islands Territory and certain islands of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 
The expansion of the definition of “excised offshore place” is necessary to build on the effective border control measures to combat people smuggling operations which have been put in place over the past three years.
The need for this to be undertaken as a matter of urgency is because the Government has credible intelligence information that people smugglers are moving to target areas closer to the Australian mainland.
Therefore, the purpose of this Bill is to make ensure that this important amendment to the Act is implemented in the current parliamentary sittings.

·	the Status of Forces agreement (SOFA) with the Krygyz Republic will protect Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel deployed there to support coalition forces' operations in Afghanistan;
·	amending the existing agreement with New Zealand on joint food standards will update the joint Australia New Zealand Food Standards System and give effect to food regulatory reforms which will have health benefits for Australians;
·	amending the Convention with the United States of America on double taxation will benefit Australian companies by significantly reducing US-witholding taxes;
·	the agreement on customs law with the Netherlands will facilitate the exchange of intelligence and information to help Australian customs services to combat terrorism and transnational crime;
·	the agreement with France on the employment of dependents of mission officials will address what has been a significant disincentive for people interested in applying for overseas postings, and thus enable the Australian Government to have the best possible representation overseas;
·	the social security agreement with the USA and amendments to the existing social security agreement with New Zealand will enable Australian residents to move between these countries, confident in the knowledge that their entitlements to benefits will be recognised in each country, and that each country will contribute fairly to support for which they are eligible;
·	the promotion and protection of investments agreements with Uruguay and Egypt will benefit Australian investors by providing them with a range of guarantees relating to non-commercial risk;
·	the Child Protection Convention will help resolve a number of problems encountered by Australian authorities and parents embroiled in international child custody cases;
·	the Lisbon Convention will facilitate the recognition of Australian academic qualifications overseas, and help Australians wishing to work in countries that are parties to the Convention; and
·	the Convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings will enhance the security of our citizens by placing an obligation on Australia to aid investigations and prosecutions of Convention offences by other states and, where appropriate, to investigate, prosecute and punish alleged offenders within our jurisdiction.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2002-06-24,"—by leave—I present the report of the parliamentary delegation to the 107th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Marrakech, Morocco from 17 to 23 March 2002 and a bilateral visit to Kuwait from 25 to 28 March 2002. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report I have just tabled sets out in detail the work of the Australian delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Marrakech, Morocco and a bilateral visit to Kuwait. I had the honour of leading this delegation and I commend my colleagues—Senator Ferris, Senator Gibbs, Senator McKiernan and Mr Con Sciacca, the member for Bowman—for the contribution they made to this very successful delegation. As leader of the delegation I addressed the plenary session of the IPU during its debate on the political, social and economic situation in the world and took the opportunity to put on the record Australia's response to the events of 11 September—particularly its response to, and active participation in, the war against terrorism. 
I informed what is often called the world parliament of parliaments that Australia has made a substantive military commitment to the war against terrorism, including the deployment of a special forces detachment on the ground in Afghanistan. However, I reminded the IPU that not only will the war against terrorism be fought through military action but also governments must continue to work nationally, regionally and globally. My speech concluded on an optimistic note by stating:
It seems to me that the terrorism crisis the world faces today has given many countries a willingness to do things differently—to cooperate with previously unlikely partners, to be open to new strategies, and to be resolute in action. I therefore see cause for some optimism about the prospects for states dealing with this, and the other security challenges that confront them. In doing so, they can then contribute not only to the security of their own region, but also, as recent tragic events have highlighted, to the security and prosperity of an ever more connected globe. 
Senator McKiernan—who I see in the chamber—was included in the delegation specifically to relay the views and concerns of the executive and the Australian IPU group as a whole about the reform of the IPU, particularly in relation to its financial and budget situation. I notice Senator McGauran's support for my comments there. I know that, in past Inter-Parliamentary Union delegations, Senator McGauran has been active on this issue. I know Senator McKiernan will be participating in this debate in a few moments and I will leave him to address this issue in detail. Suffice to say that for a body with a budget approaching some SwF10 million—of which the bureaucracy in Geneva gobbles up more than SwF7 million and the cost of two conferences each year in host countries is over SwF2 million—to propose that financial reform could be achieved by substituting a shorter meeting in Geneva each year for one of those conferences without proposing any reduction in the bureaucracy beggars belief.
Senator McKiernan, over the last three years, has made a significant contribution to the work of the IPU and the Australian delegation was particularly proud at the inaugural ceremony of the conference, in the presence of the King of Morocco, when the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Ruud Lubbers, paid tribute to his contribution to the development of the publication Refugee protection: a guide to international refugee law. It should also be recognised that Mr Sciacca participated in the committee debate on the agenda item on `Terrorism—a threat to democracy, human rights and civil society: the contribution of parliaments to combating international terrorism and addressing its causes in order to maintain international peace and security'; Senator Ferris contributed to the debate on the agenda item on `Ten years after Rio: Global degradation of the environment and parliamentary support for the Kyoto Protocol'; and Senator Gibbs contributed to the debate on the agenda item on `The role of parliaments in developing public policy in an era of globalisation, multilateral institutions and international trade agreements'. Delegates also networked with colleagues from other parliaments and attended geopolitical meetings of the 12-plus and Asia-Pacific groups. Senators Ferris and Gibbs attended meetings and participated in discussion groups of women parliamentarians.
The bilateral visit to Kuwait was a short one—only four days—but I believe it was very successful. The delegation met with the Speaker of the National Assembly of Kuwait, several ministers, members of the Australia-Kuwait Parliamentary Friendship Group, the Chief Executive Officer of the Kuwait Petroleum Co. as well as visiting local industries—in particular a dairy industry that has relevance to Australia—and research institutes. The delegation also had the moving experience of meeting with members of the National Committee on Prisoners of War and Detainees, who told us that over 600 persons were taken by withdrawing Iraqi forces following the Gulf War in 1991 and that, to this day, their fate is unknown. Dr Sultan Al-Khalaf, the chair of the national committee, expressed his optimism that one day the detainees will be released. He also emphasised the importance of raising in all possible forums the need for Iraq to address this issue. The delegation also appreciated Dr Al-Khalaf's comment during this meeting that `It is well known to everyone in Kuwait that Australia did everything to help in the liberation of Kuwait'. 
The delegation was left in no doubt that relations between Kuwait and Australia are very strong and should be developed further. In almost every meeting the issue of Australia's lack of residential diplomatic representation in Kuwait was raised with the delegation. Indeed, when I was interviewed by Ms Nadine Sidani on the Good Morning Kuwait television program, which is telecast throughout the Gulf region, this issue was one of the first raised with me. This is not surprising when it is recognised that over 30,000 Kuwaitis visit Australia each year as it is seen as a safe and family oriented tourist destination. In order to obtain a visa to visit Australia, Kuwaitis must apply to local Kuwaiti travel agents contracted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The travel agent then sends the applications to the Australian Embassy in Beirut where the visa applications are eventually processed. This process is subject to delays.
Australia has significant and increasing trading interests with Kuwait, amounting to some $A485 million in exports. Kuwait is now ranked 31st on Australia's list of top export destinations. Australia has significant strategic and military relations with Kuwait, responding decisively to Kuwait's plight in 1990 by condemning Iraq's invasion, committing military forces to the Gulf War and continuing support for the UN-mandated multinational interception force enforcing the UN Security Council sanctions upon Iraq. Australia has residential diplomatic representation in several countries whose trading, tourist and strategic relations seem not as strong, either in real or potential terms, as those with Kuwait. Furthermore, the Canberra based Kuwait Liaison Office was upgraded to an embassy in January 2002. The delegation therefore recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs consider establishing residential diplomatic representation in Kuwait, based on the important and increasing trade, tourism and strategic relations.
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I record our thanks to the Speaker of the National Assembly of Kuwait for an excellent program, a very warm welcome and generous hospitality.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 107th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Marrakech, Morocco and a Bilateral Visit to Kuwait</title>",Delegation Reports,10,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I thank my colleague Senator Chapman, the leader of the delegation, for the kind words that he said about me. I also recognise that all the members of the delegation—Senator Chapman, my colleague from the other place Mr Con Sciacca, Senator Jeannie Ferris and Senator Brenda Gibbs—made up a formidable team at the IPU conference and while we were there we got along with each other very well. Very importantly, we also worked extremely hard on behalf of the parliament of Australia. Our work would have been in vain had it not been for the assistance given to the delegation by Mr Neil Bessell, who was secretary of the delegation; Mr Peter Keele, a former secretary of the IPU delegation, who attended the conference with us as an adviser on IPU reform; and Mr Phillip Allars, an adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who attended only the IPU conference. I will just make a brief mention of Mr Peter Keele, who was a senior clerk in the Senate. Since the attendance of the delegation in Marrakech, Morocco, in March this year, Mr Keele has retired from this place and has moved on to do other things. Peter has provided the committee and this chamber with exceptional service over the years. On behalf of the delegation, I wish Peter and his spouse all the very best for the future and I trust that they will enjoy his retirement.
As Senator Chapman said, I attended the conference as an additional representative of the delegation, with the four permanent members of the Australian delegation to the IPU. I am grateful to Madam President and Mr Speaker for selecting me for that role, even though it did mean an additional workload which I probably could have done without. The reason for my selection was that I had participated at earlier IPU conferences on the matter of IPU reform. The reforms proposed some years ago did cause Australia very grave concern, because it seemed to us that what was being proposed was irresponsible, to say the least. It was irresponsible in the sense that none of the proposals being brought forward were costed in any shape or form. The Australian delegation at previous conferences asked questions about the costing of the proposed reforms and we were also extremely concerned to find out that there is no budget process in place within the IPU itself. That of course caused us great concern. 
Following the report of the previous conference of the IPU, I had cause to report that the IPU had adopted a proposition from the then Australian delegation that the IPU institute a system of accrual accounting, to give member parliaments of the IPU the opportunity to fully understand where the finances were and to better measure how the reserve funds of the organisation were being spent. That was one measure of reform that we can claim on behalf of Australia. I attended the conference and put forward the argument and, at the beginning of this particular conference, it seemed to be a pretty lonely argument not only at the council meeting but also in the geopolitical groups where Australia plays a part—that is, 12 Plus, which is essentially a European orientated organisation, and the Asia-Pacific grouping. I am very pleased to say—and the delegation has noted this in the report—that at the conclusion of the conference the concerns that we had expressed at previous conferences and at Marrakech were being taken up by other delegations, who were looking with even greater scrutiny than perhaps they had been before at the propositions being put forward by the IPU.
In the report itself, which is tabled, we outline on page 35, at points 6.17, 6.18 and 6.19, our specific concerns about where things are going within the IPU. This was a somewhat disappointing conference because the conference at Marrakech was supposed to be the decision making conference. In many respects we are grateful that the decisions on reform were not actually made at this conference because they may not have been the correct decisions. But in the traditional way of bureaucracy when it is in trouble, the decision making processes are deferred to another day, and indeed the decisions on IPU reform have been deferred until the Geneva conference in September. I will not be attending that conference but I do urge Mr Speaker, Madam President and the IPU executive—the delegation itself—to give really serious concern to formulating proposals on the IPU position that can be circulated to other parliaments and other IPU delegations well prior to that council meeting in September in Geneva.
One area we expressed our concern about—and have previously expressed our concerns about—was the relationship between the IPU and the United Nations organisation. We detail at paragraph 6.29 some of our concerns. We pressed this matter again at the geopolitical groups meetings, which meet before the council meeting itself starts, and we gave notice during the council, and indeed at the conference itself, that we would be raising our concerns. We had heard through the grapevine that the instructions that had been given to the negotiators—the people appearing on behalf of the IPU at the United Nations at the end of last year—had not been followed. It was of great concern not only to the Australian delegation but also, I would say without fear of contradiction, to the whole of the council members assembled. They were aghast when they found out that what we had heard was in fact true: the Indian ambassador in the United Nations had acted outside of the instructions given by the last council meeting of the IPU. We understand that he was acting on the instructions of the IPU President, Mrs Heptullah, but she did not have the authority to issue those instructions. So our concerns resonated throughout the floor of the IPU council meeting. 
I would have liked to say, at the time of Mrs Heptullah's retirement from the position of President of the IPU, that she had served the organisation well. Regrettably, I cannot say that. In fact, I think that it was a very poor choice of leader for the IPU itself, and her position as President of the IPU has taken the organisation backwards rather than moved it forwards, and that is regrettable. Decisions will need to be made at the next council meeting on who will be the next president of the organisation, and I wish the Australian delegation and all delegations good counsel in making that decision. 
The leader, Senator Chapman, made mention of the fact that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees did mention me in the opening statement of the conference. I was obviously very humbled that I should be singled out in that manner. The mention was made because of my role—the role that I played over a good long period of time—in developing a handbook for parliaments on international humanitarian law for refugees. I have tabled that handbook on a previous occasion and, regrettably, the elections in Australia last year did not allow us to have a launch of that particular handbook in this country. It was relaunched by the UN High Commissioner at a forum on the Sunday at the women's meeting.
I have also participated over a period of time in working on a handbook on eliminating the worst forms of child labour. That was launched at this recent conference, and I seek leave to table a copy of that handbook for the consideration of all honourable senators. I commend the handbook to them. I thank the parliament for giving me these opportunities over the years. I have attended seven IPU conferences and I am also grateful to the IPU for giving me those opportunities. I think I have delivered on the task that was set me when I attended those conferences.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I am not going to speak very long—probably because my voice will not survive—but I did want to say a few words, because this is my third and last IPU conference. Our leader, Senator Chapman, has given an excellent report and so has Senator McKiernan. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues for the company that they provided on this trip. We did work very hard, as usual. The IPU is a fascinating place and one does work hard, but one also has a chance to have a look at the places that we go to. Marrakech was extremely interesting. Senator Chapman was our leader, and Senator McKiernan, Mr Con Sciacca, Senator Ferris and I were accompanied by Mrs Sally Chapman and Jackie McKiernan, who were always good company and excellent to be around. Sally is a wonderful hostess. We were once again looked after very well by the staff of the Senate. Peter Keele was there to advise on the IPU and Neil Bessell, who was the secretary of the delegation, looked after us extremely well, as he always does—he is like a mother hen. Once again, we just could not get by without Mr Phillip Allars from the foreign affairs department.
When you go to these countries which are French speaking and you cannot speak a word of French, to have somebody like Phillip there is wonderful; it is a great help. Both Phillip and Neil could never do enough for us—they were always there. I do not know when they ever slept because they were constantly looking after us, the whole time. I will not really say much more about the IPU except it was a wonderful experience. I am sorry I will not be going on any more.
I would like to touch on the Kuwait bilateral visit. After Marrekech we visited Kuwait, and I had never visited that part of the world before. I must say that the Kuwaitis were absolutely charming people. They were so friendly and they could not do enough for us. As Senator Chapman has said, there are strong ties between Australia and Kuwait and, in all the meetings we had with the different ministers, they wanted not only to maintain that friendship and those ties but also to increase them. During the trip we were very honoured to be invited to the home of Mr Ali al-Qabandi for what they call the ahmadi diwaniah. Diwanias are family based discussion groups, and this particular one was held on a Monday night. The idea is that they can take the parliament to the people. They have the discussion groups and then that is taken back to people within the parliament. It is a sort of grassroots meeting to actually find out what the constituents or what the people are talking about.
While we were there we were shown a memorial wall of the ahmadidiwaniah, which consists of three separate displays. The first contains the names of all Kuwaiti nationals who lost their lives as a direct result of the Iraqi invasion and occupation. The second display lists all known allied service personnel who gave their lives to contain Iraqi aggression and liberate Kuwait. The third display lists the family names of more than 600 individuals unaccounted for by the Iraqi regime in the wake of the conflict. None of these have been seen since their disappearance. During our visit we received several poignant instances of the continuing grief of the people for the prisoners of war in Iraq. This was very distressing to us and, of course, very distressing for the Kuwaiti people because they have not seen their families, they do not know if they are dead or if they are still alive. It is quite terrible. To see this was very moving. 
As you would imagine, the diwaniah meeting itself is male. Senator Ferris and I, as women, were invited because we were part of the delegation. Towards the end of the night, Senator Ferris and I were absolutely delighted because we went upstairs into the home and we spoke to the wives of the men who were at the meeting. It was absolutely fascinating. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would well know that in Kuwait the women do not yet have the vote, but the women we spoke to were highly educated, highly intelligent and professional women. They said that it will come soon, there is only a couple of what they call `the long beards', not in a disrespectful way, who are stopping it. They are quite confident that they will be receiving the vote. I said: `Well, why don't you get your husbands on to this? This is a male dominated society—get your husbands into gear.' They said: `Oh, we don't have a problem with our husbands, they want us to have the vote. It is just a few people and it is just changing a few ideas.' But we all know that; we have all gone through that process over the years. So that was excellent for us, and the things we talked about were absolutely fantastic. We inquired about family life and it was very enlightening. I will not go into a lot of that because a lot of it was women's discussions, so it is best not to put it on record, but we did have a great time. 
When we spoke to Kuwait's minister for education, he said that, unlike Australia, where we have an ageing population, in Kuwait they have a young population because they have a lot of children whereas we do not seem to do that anymore. They do have a good education system and this, of course, is funded totally by the government, but they are looking at arrangements for private colleges in Australia so they can send their students here. I think that is something we could look at: taking students from Kuwait into the colleges and universities of Australia. 
My time is running out, but I must say Kuwait was a really wonderful experience. Once again, the people were absolutely delightful and could not do enough for us. They spoke so highly of Australia and we were made to feel so very welcome. Before I conclude, I must thank Mr Ridwaan Jadwat. Ridwaan was absolutely excellent. He met us when we first went to Kuwait and he accompanied the delegation everywhere and assisted us in whatever we wanted. He stayed with us the whole time and provided us with information. We really would like to thank him. That is basically all I have to say. It was an excellent IPU, as the previous speakers have said, and the bilateral in Kuwait was really something not to be missed.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the 107th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Marrakech, Morocco and a Bilateral Visit to Kuwait</title>",Delegation Reports,10,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-06-24,"—I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the deputy president of the IPU delegation over the last few years, Senator McKiernan. I have sat next to Senator McKiernan for many years now. He is a man of immense charm and grace, and intelligence, may I say. He is not formally trained in the law but he has been on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee with me and has done outstanding service. I have got some consolation in the fact that Senator Ludwig has come upon us, and I think he is going to be outstanding in this area, but I just want to concentrate at this stage on Senator McKiernan.
I think you have travelled overseas with him, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, and you would agree he and his wife, Jackie, who accompanied him on this trip, are people of the utmost charm. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that he has done in this Senate. I have sat next to him; I have flatted with him at times. I do not think his rent has ever got to the point where you would call it rack rent—and to even suggest that, given his Irish background, is perhaps a slander, so I immediately withdraw it. But I do want to use this opportunity to express my utmost regard for Senator Jim McKiernan and his wife, Jackie. He has done great work in the Inter-Parliamentary Union area—but not only there; he has had a most distinguished career in this place. I would like to take this opportunity to pay that tribute to him. 
 (Senator Ferguson)—Thank you, Senator Cooney. I guess we could count that as an early valedictory.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-24,"—Firstly, I thank those senators who contributed to the debate on what is very important legislation. The events in the United States on 11 September last year marked a fundamental shift in the global security environment. Those events demonstrated the enormous loss of life and devastation to communities that terrorist acts can cause and highlighted the need for measures to be taken to prevent further attacks. Australia cannot afford to be complacent about the threat that terrorism poses to our community. The government has a clear responsibility to cooperate with global counter-terrorism measures and to provide our security and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to combat terrorism.
The Howard government is committed to the war against terrorism and to ensuring that we have the best possible tools to fight that war. The Howard government is committed to delivering strong legislation to protect the community against terrorism. It is in this package of proposed legislation that we have the response by this government to meet these threats. This package contains, firstly, the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]; secondly, the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002; thirdly, the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002; fourthly, the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002; and, last in the package but not least, the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002.  
The government has developed a strong and effective package of legislation that will ensure the identification, investigation and prosecution of persons involved in terrorist activities. This package and other measures taken by the government are designed to bolster our armoury in the war against terrorism and to deliver on our commitment to enhance our ability to meet the challenges of the new terrorist environment. In developing this legislation, the government has been conscious of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly or unnecessarily encroaching on the rights of individuals and the liberties of individuals that are fundamental to our democratic system. We believe that we have got that balance right. The government has given very careful consideration to the formulation of the legislation and the legislation contains significant safeguards. We recognise, of course, that it is unusual legislation. It must be remembered, however, that we are not dealing with ordinary criminal activity. What we are dealing with here is an extraordinary set of events that may be repeated. The government cannot just sit on its hands. It has the responsibility to protect the people of Australia and we take that responsibility very seriously.
This package of counter-terrorism legislation fulfils the government's commitment to preventing and deterring terrorism while safeguarding rights and liberties. In preparing the amendments, the government has given consideration to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the views of the parliament and the community. No country has ever been immune to the threat of terrorism. We must ensure that we are prepared to deal with the new international security environment. The Howard government takes very seriously the responsibility to protect Australia against terrorism and this package of counter-terrorism legislation delivers on that commitment to ensure that we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. 
That summarises the government's approach to this legislation and, of course, the amendments that we are proposing which will be dealt with shortly. However, a number of points were raised in the debate, and I shall turn to those now. Senator Forshaw argued that the government was slow to introduce the counter-terrorism bills into parliament and that we should have recalled parliament earlier last year. This is complex legislation that has required careful consideration. There would have been no logic in recalling parliament earlier last year and the government's approach of course has allowed for full consideration by the parliament and the community of what is very important legislation. The suggestion that we should have dealt with this earlier is at odds with the suggestion from other opposition members that the legislation has been rushed and that there has been inadequate time for community consultation.
Senators Stott Despoja, McKiernan and Ray stated that there has been insufficient time for public scrutiny of the legislation and the proposed government amendments. The government's package of antiterrorism legislation is vitally important. The government has spent significant time considering the formulation of the legislation and the proposed amendments to the legislation. It is now more than six months since the government outlined key features of the proposed legislation and more than three months since the bills were introduced into parliament. There has been extensive public discussion about these bills, including in the parliamentary committees that examined them.
There can be no credible suggestion that this legislation has not already been the subject of significant parliamentary and public scrutiny. The parliament and the public have had a significant opportunity to scrutinise and debate the contents of these bills. The government has always indicated that it supports this process, which is why we referred the bills to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for consideration. In his press release of 4 June this year, the Attorney-General announced the government's proposed policy response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee's report. In accordance with Senate practice, we circulated the government's proposed amendments as soon as they were finalised. A written briefing was also provided at that time. 
Another point was made by several senators, including Senator Greig, who suggested that a minor protest could be caught within the definition of `terrorist act'. The government rejects any suggestion that the proposed legislation, if introduced, would catch minor protests within the definition of `terrorist act'. The bill expressly excludes legitimate protest from the definition. However, the government is moving amendments to the definition of `terrorist act' to address other concerns that have been raised.
Opposition senators, including Senator Faulkner, suggested that the government intended to cover industrial action within the definition of `terrorist act' and that the amendment to exclude industrial action is the result of pressure from the opposition. Opposition members should look at the amendments that have been circulated. This amendment is being moved by the government in response to concerns raised about this matter during the Senate committee hearings. To put the matter beyond doubt, I want to stress that the amendment was a result of those Senate committee hearings, not a result of opposition action. It was never the government's intention that such actions be caught, and that is why the government has listened to concerns raised about this issue and is moving amendments to put this issue beyond doubt.
Senator Greig stated that these laws will not stop terrorism. The government is of the view that antiterrorism legislation can and should prevent the commission of terrorist acts wherever possible. The government's `terrorist organisations offences' are designed to deter, disband and shut down terrorist organisations so that they can no longer foster and engage in acts of terrorism. The proposed offences relating the financing of terrorism will ensure that terrorists are deprived of the resources they require to carry out these attacks. The offences relating to terrorist training and preparation will ensure that terrorists can be prosecuted for actions undertaken in planning and preparing for the commission of terrorist acts. If the worst happens, the government's legislation will ensure that those responsible are prosecuted and punished.
Senator Lundy argued that humanitarian organisations like the Red Cross would be caught by the legislation. It was never the government's intention that legitimate humanitarian activity be caught by this legislation. The government's proposed amendment puts this issue beyond doubt. It is irresponsible to cause fear in the hearts of those who engage in humanitarian activity by suggesting that they could in some way be imperilled by this legislation as amended. They cannot be, and the express purpose of the amendment is to put this beyond doubt. Senator Lundy's comments are unnecessary and reflect the reactionary way in which this debate was approached by some. I am sure that the rest of Senator Lundy's party would not share her comments.
Senator Bolkus and Senator Stott Despoja stated that the counter-terrorism legislation is unnecessary and unwarranted. I have covered much in relation to the reason for this legislation, but I will say it again: the events of September 11 last year demonstrated that no nation can be complacent about the threat posed by terrorism. It is imperative that we act to ensure that our law enforcement and security agencies have the necessary tools to combat terrorism and cooperate with international counter-terrorism measures. The government's antiterrorism legislation is designed to deter, prevent and punish those who engage in acts of terrorism. This legislation is prompted not by hysteria—as has been suggested by Senator Bolkus—but by a careful and considered review of Australia's security needs. The resulting legislation strikes a balance between those security needs and the rights and liberties of all Australians.
Senator Brown argued that the asset freezing provisions could be used to ban separatist organisations such as Fretilin. The Greens suggestion that the asset freezing provisions are a backdoor form of proscribing or banning organisations is both untenable and ridiculous. The asset freezing provisions implement United Nations Security Council resolution 1373, which requires states to: 
Freeze without delay funds and other financial assets  of persons who commit  or facilitate  terrorist acts  and associated  entities
The mechanism which enables the government to implement the Security Council resolution has existed since 1945. Enabling specific asset freezing listings to be disallowed by parliament could have serious consequences. Disallowance would have the effect of alerting terrorist organisations to the government's intention to freeze their assets and would give those organisations an opportunity to remove their assets from Australia before a new listing could be made.
Disallowance in these circumstances could also place Australia in breach of its international obligations. The asset freezing provisions have no effect other than to implement our international obligations to freeze the assets of terrorists. They do not ban or outlaw listed organisations in some more general sense. These targeted measures to inhibit the flow of funds to terrorist organisations are a vital part of our international cooperation to combat terrorism— something that Senator Brown should recognise and support.
Senator Brown also argued that the counter-terrorism legislation is open to abuse and that the proscription power could be used against a range of organisations engaged in protest. I think he referred to such protests as those against logging. The terrorist organisations offences will apply only where there is compelling evidence that an organisation has engaged in or prepared for terrorist activities. The provisions have no application whatsoever to the protest groups mentioned by Senator Brown, and it is irresponsible of Senator Brown to suggest that the legislation could be used in this way. I would strongly suggest to Senator Brown that he have a closer look at this legislation. The listing of organisations will be subject to strong safeguards, including disallowance, judicial review and a two-year sunset clause.
Apart from those points made by various senators, can I say in general that the opposition has circulated an amendment to the offence relating to knowingly being a member of a terrorist organisation. The opposition's amendment limits the application of the membership offence to the United Nations listing provision, as opposed to a court determined process. The opposition's approach suggests that a person should not be found guilty of being a member of a terrorist organisation when a court determines that an organisation has engaged in acts of terrorism and the person had knowledge of this fact—a process which is subject to the strict standards of our criminal system. This suggests that our courts are not equipped to do their job and makes a mockery of our judicial system. 
It is impossible to understand why the opposition thinks that a person should escape guilt where before an Australian court it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the person was a member of an organisation knowing that it was in fact connected to terrorism, with that connection also having been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is ridiculous to suggest that relying exclusively on a UN list is a better safeguard than having all of the evidence directly considered by an Australian court according to the strict standards of evidence and proof. In the government's view, a person who is a member of an organisation that he or she knows is engaged in terrorist activities should be subject to criminal liability. The government does not accept that the best means of determining guilt is to link the offence to a United Nations list as opposed to a court determined process.
The opposition has also circulated an amendment to remove the Attorney-General's power to list a terrorist organisation in regulations on the basis of evidence that the organisation has engaged in acts of terrorism. This is despite the fact that any regulation would be a disallowable instrument and subject to the scrutiny of this parliament. We remain of the view that the ability of Australia to identify terrorist organisations by way of regulation made by the minister on reasonable grounds is essential. In particular, without the power to list organisations, the deterrent effect of the legislation is severely limited. Listing of organisations sends a clear and unequivocal message to those persons to stop their activities or risk the full weight of the law. It also allows Australia to list terrorist organisations without having to rely on the United Nations. It is important we have the flexibility to list terrorist organisations that may not have come to the attention of the United Nations Security Council: for example, if an organisation was active in our region but did not pose a sufficient international threat to be listed by the Security Council. Unlike the opposition, we do not consider this an unlikely scenario. On the contrary, we consider that experience bears out the need for a power to respond to domestic and regional developments swiftly and without dependence on United Nations Security Council action. 
The opposition also proposes an additional review of the legislation to be conducted by a committee established for that purpose. The government considers that this additional review will be ineffective and unnecessary. We have proposed a review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. This committee has the power to hear and consider the full range of evidence that will be relevant to a review of this important legislation, including security information. The PJC has the appropriate resources and established procedures and it is fully equipped to conduct such a review. The committee proposed by the opposition would not be able to hear and access the full range of evidence. It would not be able to hear the security evidence that is essential for proper consideration of this legislation. A review of the legislation by such a committee would be at best inadequate. We do not accept that such a review by the PJC does not provide an open and accountable consideration of the issues. To suggest otherwise detracts from the value of our parliamentary committee system. A further review by a separate committee would be a waste of resources.
This package of bills is an essential package for Australia's security and welfare. These bills are, as I said, a response to those events which occurred on 11 September last year and they are measures which this government is totally committed to introducing for the protection of all Australians. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-06-24,"—I rise tonight to pay tribute to the lives of two of my former National Party colleagues. I refer to Colin Carige, a former member for the Queensland seat of Capricornia, and my colleague in the upper house in the New South Wales parliament, National Party stalwart the Hon. Doug Moppett MLC. 
I knew Colin Carige very well and I heard only last week of his passing. He was a good personal friend of mine and he knew the issues of regional and rural Queensland well. He served in this parliament as the member for Capricornia for one term only, from 1975 to 1977. Capricornia has only ever been represented three times by the conservative side of politics, and Colin Carige was one of those very few people who had the tenacity and the political stamina to win that seat. He had a very marginal seat, and the pendulum of politics swings, and he was able to represent that seat for only one term.
I was deeply sorry to hear of his death on 14 May. He was dedicated to the country way of life and his press releases after his preselection to Capricornia demonstrated well the type of interest he had in that seat. He became a political representative of the National Country Party, then under the leadership of Doug Anthony, from a background of business and primary industry. At the time of his election he sold himself to his constituents as a correspondence-educated Biloela grazier, a clearing contractor and a bulldozer driver. You do not see too many bulldozer drivers in parliament today; in fact, you do not see too many self-educated people coming into this place. Perhaps we should think about the greater representation that is required in this place. 
Col was born in Mount Morgan. He was correspondence schooled, and he shared with me a strong interest in small business and the improvement of the regional and rural sectors. He wanted to improve communications services and opportunities for people in businesses based in rural and regional Queensland who wished to stay there and be based there. He also brought with him to the House of Representatives a great advocacy for the Australian mining industry. I suppose this grew from his childhood in Mount Morgan and his significant business knowledge. He had been involved in rural businesses with Dalgety's and he ran a restaurant in Sydney as well as his own cattle grazing property at Biloela. He was a great source of information. He was a great friend of mine. I know that he really knew that it was an honour to be able to represent Queensland in the marginal seat of Capricornia in the federal parliament. 
He will be sorely missed by a number of people around Rockhampton and Gladstone, where he had a building business, in Queensland by conservative politics and, of course, most of all by his family. I extend the sincere condolences of the National Party of Australia to his wife, Gloria, to his children and to all those who knew him. His passing will be a sad loss.
This brings me to my other now departed colleague, the Hon. Doug Moppett. Doug Moppett was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and he died just last week, on 18 June, at the age of 62 after a brave battle with cancer. Through his family and through various roles he held within the National Party, Doug Moppett remained dedicated to correcting the inequities faced by country people. He was a compassionate and tireless member of parliament and was held in high regard by both sides of politics. We all recognise the enormous contribution he made to the New South Wales upper house and as part of the parliamentary committee system. 
His varied and distinguished roles included Vice Chairman of the New South Wales branch of the National Party between 1971 and 1986 and state chairman between 1986 and 1991. These were very difficult times faced by the National Party and the `Joh for Canberra' campaign. Doug stood his ground and for what he believed in and took the right course of action. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council for 13 years, from 1976 to 1978 and from 1991 to 2002. Both his parliamentary terms included many years of service on parliamentary committees. He was awarded a life membership of the National Party for his contribution to the party and its grassroots members.
His lifetime of commitment to country New South Wales, the National Party and his family has not gone unappreciated by all who had the pleasure of being associated with him. Doug truly has been a great inspiration to many people. On behalf of the National Party family, his colleagues and friends, I also extend our deepest sympathy to Doug's family, his wife, Helen, and their two children. I know that they take great comfort from the legacy of courage and strength that Doug has left behind.
—Thank you, Senator Boswell. I would also like to associate myself with those words on Doug Moppett. I knew him well and he certainly was respected a great deal by both sides of parliament.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Carige, Mr Colin</title>",Adjournment,19,1,speech

AAA—Farm Help
AAA-Farm Help is demand driven, therefore funding for each financial year is dependent upon uptake of the program. Expenditure in Queensland on AAA-Farm Help during 2000-01 was $8.3 million and $3.6 million for 2001-02 to 31 March 2002.
AAA-Farm Help is available to all eligible farmers on a national basis. Information on Farm Help is not available on an electorate basis. Farm Help funds are not allocated on a regional or State basis.Funds are approved for assistance regardless of their location.
AAA-Farm Help provides income support, professional advice and re-establishment assistance for farmers in severe financial difficulties. 
Whilst levels of funding are not available by electorate, during 2000-01, 7 re-establishment grants were paid to farmers within the Kennedy electorate and there were no farmers receiving Farm Help income support at 30 June 2001. At 31 March 2002, 103 farmers were current Farm Help income support recipients and 2 re-establishment grants have been paid during 2001-02.

Dairy Industry Adjustment Package (DIAP)Funding became available under the Commonwealth Dairy Industry Adjustment Package (DIAP) in 2000-2001. Programs within the adjustment package for which the Department has responsibility for include:





Dairy Structural Adjustment Package (DSAP)The $1.63 billion Dairy Structural Adjustment Pro-gram provides quarterly structural adjustment payments over eight years to dairy farmers to assist adjustment to industry deregulation. The structure of the entitlements database and the confidential nature of these payments makes it difficult to accurately provide electorate level breakdowns. However, there has been approximately $220 million in DSAP entitlements paid to eligible dairy farmers in Queensland. Of this, it is estimated that north Queensland farmers have received $30 million in entitlements.(The final element of DSAP, the Dairy Regional Assistance Program is administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. 11 Projects approved in Far North Queensland valued at approximately $1.5 million).
There is no project based funding for DSAP as these payments are entitlement based.

Supplementary dairy assistance measures (SDA)In June 2001 an additional $159 million was provided to dairy farmers through supplementary dairy assistance measures (SDA): $119 million in basic market milk payments, and additional market milk payments, to dairy farmers who were heavily dependent on market milk production; $20 million to people who, because of extraordinary circumstances were excluded, or their entitlements were significantly lower than normal, under the DSAP; and a $20 million expansion of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program (Dairy RAP). It is estimated that $36.6 million in additional market milk entitlements have gone to Queensland farmers and $246,000 in discretionary payments.
There is no project based funding for SDA as these payments are entitlement based.

Dairy Exit Program (DEP)The $30 million Dairy Exit Program provides a lump sum payment of up to $45,000 tax-free to those dairy farmers wishing to leave agriculture. This payment may be taken as an alternative to a DSAP entitlement. As at 1 March 2002, Queensland farmers have been granted a dairy exit payment at a total cost of $403,578.
