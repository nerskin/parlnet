The SPEAKER
 (09:30):  I have an update for the House, out of courtesy. As you well know, we've had an ICT network outage. A circular has gone out from the department. The Department of Parliamentary Services has worked through the night and continues to work to restore systems. Just in the last 10 or 15 minutes, emails and some other systems have started to come back online, but it will take a few more hours yet for all systems to be restored. I want to thank members for their patience. In terms of the House itself, our systems here are unaffected in terms of bells, broadcasting and everything else. I just want to make that clear at the start. I do have a handwritten speakers list, which is nice!

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—The Treasurer) (09:33):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 


reforms GST payments to the states and territories (states) by providing a fairer and more sustainable way of distributing GST.


It is a plan that leaves all States and Territories better off.


The Commonwealth makes significant payments to the states and territories. The GST comprises half or well over half of these payments for most states and territories.


The good news for states and territories, is that since 1998 when then Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello introduced the GST the revenue pool has more than doubled. It is expected to grow anther 65 per cent over the next decade.


However, the system has not been working for everyone. The integrity of the GST was being threatened with Western Australia's share falling to 30c in the dollar. This compares to Victoria and New South Wales getting more than 90c in the dollar and the smaller states higher rates again.


The situation was so ridiculous that Tasmania and the Northern Territory both received more GST revenue than Western Australia, despite having populations that were one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of the size of Western Australia's population.


The current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation was effective when the Australian economy and states' and territories' economies were relatively stable.


It is a plan that leaves all states and territories better off, and it's a credit to the hard work and advocacy of my colleagues in this place.


The Commonwealth makes significant payments to the states and territories. The GST comprises half, or well over half, of these payments for most states and territories.


The good news for states and territories is that since 2000, when the Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello introduced the GST, the revenue pool has more than doubled. It is expected to grow another 65 per cent over the next decade.


However, the system has not been working for everyone. The integrity of the GST was being threatened, with Western Australia's share falling to 30c in the dollar. This compares to Victoria and New South Wales getting more than 90c in the dollar, and the smaller states higher rates again.


The situation was so ridiculous that Tasmania and the Northern Territory both received more GST revenue than Western Australia, despite having populations that were one-fifth and one-tenth respectively of Western Australia's population.


The current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation was effective when the Australian economy and the state and territory economies were relatively stable. It meant that the GST was distributed so that all states and territories had their fiscal capacities equalised to be the same as the broad-based stable economies of either NSW or Victoria.


However, the current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation was not designed to deal with significant economic shocks. The mining boom was an unprecedented shock to the Australian economy. It exposed weaknesses in the system that could not have been foreseen when the GST was introduced. So, after the economic shocks of the past decade, it is time to make improvements to the system.


The way that GST is distributed in Australia has not been updated since it was introduced in 2000.


The coalition government—and I pay great credit to now Prime Minister Scott Morrison—asked the Productivity Commission to reassess how the GST is distributed. The Productivity Commission found that, although the current GST distribution system functions well and achieves high levels of fiscal equity, it can deliver perverse outcomes when there is a significant shock to the economy, such as a mining boom.


The government's interim response, released on 5 July 2018, proposed reforms to the way the GST is distributed that will leave all states better off and protect the integrity of the system.


GST will continue to be distributed using the 'fair go' principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE).


In essence, states should have sufficient resources (fiscal capacity) so that all Australians can have access to vital government services, no matter where they live across the country.


The government's plan will:


First, create a new equalisation benchmark, the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria (whichever is higher). All states will transition to this new equalisation standard over six years from 2021-22 to 2026-27.


Second, introduce a permanent in-system relativity floor of 0.7 from 2022-23, increasing to 0.75 from 2024-25.


Third, permanently boost the GST pool of funds available for distribution to the states and territories, providing direct Commonwealth cash injections each year from 2021-22 onwards. These are in addition to GST collections.


The bill will enable an initial boost of $600 million in 2021-22 and a further $250 million boost in 2024-25, indexed each year to grow in line with the GST.


Fourth, during the transition period from 2021-22 to 2026-27, states and territories will be guaranteed the better of the old system or the new system. This means that, at the end of the transition period, each state and territory will have received the better of the cumulative total over the entire period of either the old system or the updated system. Payments will be verified annually by the Commonwealth Grants Commission over the transition period and any adjustments made accordingly.


Fifth, to be completed by 26 December, the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry to assess whether the updated system is working efficiently, effectively and operating as intended.


Sixth, we will separately provide short-term top-ups to Western Australia and the Northern Territory to keep their relativities above 0.7 and 4.66 respectively from 2019-20 to 2021-22.


At the end of this period in 2026-27, Australia will have a horizontal fiscal equalisation system that protects against economic shocks and provides a more stable source of revenue for all states and territories.


The horizontal fiscal equalisation 'fair go' principle has been an important part of our federal financial relations system since Federation. The government's horizontal fiscal equalisation reforms—implemented in this bill—continue to uphold this principle so that all Australians can have access to vital government services no matter where they live across this diverse country. All states will be better off, with the Commonwealth injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29.


The GST pool from 2026-27 will grow by more than a billion dollars each and every year, compared to what would have occurred without these reforms. Importantly, the additional funding from the Commonwealth will not come at the expense of existing payments to the states and will be provided in perpetuity.


The Commonwealth's projections use the Productivity Commission's estimates, which uses the numbers the states provided them. This additional funding is on top of another $6½ billion in GST receipts states will receive over the next four years as a result of decisions the government has taken since the 2015-16 budget. These include measures such as applying the GST to online purchases and other compliance measures. All that extra assistance is untied funding the states and territories can use to fund hospitals, schools and other essential services.


The government has consulted extensively with all states on its proposal since the release of its interim response. But, unlike changes to the rate and the base of the GST, changes to the distribution of GST revenue do not require the approval of the states and territories. It is the Commonwealth's job to govern for all Australians.


Former Prime Minister John Howard put this best when he said, 'I'm an Australian and, as far as I'm concerned, all Australians should be treated equally no matter where they live.' We have sought the bipartisan support from the opposition and we have made a sensible compromise.


To provide certainty, the Commonwealth is now seeking to legislate these reforms by amending the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. In the end, the GST provides an important source of revenue to the states and territories; however, the viability of the system is only as good as the formula that underpins it and the economy in which it operates.


Australia is seeing strong economic growth, record jobs creation and a federal budget that is on track for a return to surplus. This is not good luck but good management and a product of the policies the coalition has put in place. This positive momentum cannot be put at risk by the opposition's high-taxing and high-spending approach which threatens the reforms that we have underway. This is why the Morrison government and our GST reforms should be supported, because they will deliver real benefits to all Australians. We have provided a national solution to a national challenge. That is what leadership is about.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum, and I commend this bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (10:00):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report, incorporating additional comments, which I will remark upon in a moment, entitled Report 472:Commonwealth procurement—second report.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HILL:
  by leave—I will keep my remarks fairly succinct because there is a lot to say on this report. It covers a huge range of turf—we have been working on it since February. It will be referred to the Federation Chamber for further statements. To precis and signal some of the issues, because members may wish to add their names to the speaking list for further consideration: this is the committee's second report on Commonwealth procurement. It sets out the findings of the committee's inquiry, which is based on three individual ANAO audit reports.


Chapter 2 of the report discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 12 of 2017-18, concerning contract management of the telephone universal service obligation by the Department of Communications and the Arts. The Audit Office raised a range of concerns, including value-for-money principles, and concluded that the department had not actively managed the contract towards achieving value for money. The committee was unanimous in that section of the report.


I would note that there is a strong tradition of bipartisanship in this committee. Over the 100 years or so that it's existed there have been very few dissenting reports. It's the mechanism through which the parliament holds the Public Service to account for the expenditure of public money and public administration. However, for the first time in some years now, whilst the committee signed off on the substantive report, we did reach a point after some months of consideration where some members of the committee felt the need to make additional comments which were not agreed to by all members of the committee. They are in relation to the second two ANAO reports that we considered. In just touching on those, I would note the statement by the chair of the committee, Senator Smith, and thank him for his acknowledgement that he regards this as the committee working as it should. We did sign off on the substance of the report.


Chapter 3 of the report discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 9 of 2017-18, concerning management of the preconstruction phase of the Inland Rail program by the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The report reveals through the inquiry some serious concerns regarding the financing and delivery of the $10 billion Inland Rail project. As is well known, it still fails to connect trains to the Port of Brisbane and, curiously, it is being financed by the government off budget, rather than by a grant using an equity injection of some billions of dollars to the ARTC. Just to record two quotes, this should mean—I quote the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance in the inquiry:


The government needs to get a real rate of return on the project over the life of the project.


Yet, astoundingly, through the inquiry we heard the former CEO of the ARTC, John Fullerton, admit clearly to the committee under questioning in a public hearing that the project is never likely to repay its capital cost and provide a return to the government. He stated:


… no, the revenues that flow to us wouldn't cover the full capital cost and provide a return.


Despite questioning, the committee was not able to be assured of or given access to information, even in confidence, that provides an understanding of the expected rate of return of such a significant, multibillion-dollar investment. The point that is made in the additional comments is that, if such investments in rail projects outside the general government sector of the budget were used in this way on a wider scale, this would seriously risk decreasing the profitability of government entities and dividends to government, repayment of their capital and net value.


So there's a range of concerns raised in the additional comments about the lack of transparency by the ARTC, which point blank refused to address a range of questions that the committee had and hid behind what I consider a spurious defence of legal professional privilege. It's well known in the practice of the Senate and the House that legal professional privilege is not to be used as an excuse to not provide information to the parliament, but we were not able to pursue that further. So, more can be said in the Federation Chamber on that.


The final part of the report is chapter 4, which discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 61 2016-17, concerning the procurement of the rather controversial National Cancer Screening Register by the Department of Health. Overall, I consider this a scathing report. It was a unanimous report by a government-controlled committee, which, in my words, slammed the government's failure to deliver the lifesaving National Cancer Screening Register for cervical and bowel cancer. In a recommendation—quite astounding—the committee recommended that the government consider terminating this bungled $222 million contract with Telstra Health. It has been disastrously handled over the last few years. It's cost taxpayers millions, as the committee was told, and risked the lives of Australian women due to delays with the new Cervical Cancer Screening Program, which is replacing the former Pap smear test. The failings are so serious that the unanimous report recommended:


whether, in the circumstances of such serious underperformance by Telstra Health, it may be in the Commonwealth's interests to terminate the contract and pursue other options …


Of course, this contract was rushed into just days before the 2016 election, with a questionable contract signed after a dodgy tender process in which senior health department staff who owned Telstra shares did not declare them when voting on the tender panel. The tender evaluation process was so flawed that the department could not rule out the possibility that, if they'd followed their own procedures in the tender evaluation plan, Telstra Health may not even have been awarded the contract.


Despite the urgency to privatise this register before the 2016 election, we also note that the bowel cancer screening component is nowhere to be found, lost in a dark place, no movement, and the old paper-based system continues. Telstra Health and the Department of Health cannot even guess when the new Bowel Cancer Screening Program might commence, which has left the committee to order six-monthly report-backs on progress until they find out what's going on and can tell us.


We also noted concerns during the inquiry—the subject of much questioning—regarding the impact of the lengthy delay on mortality rates of Australian women. It was a rather Fawlty Towers-Yes Minister kind of episode, because, very clearly, the new register and the HPV tests were intended to 'prevent an additional 140 cervical cancers each year and decrease mortality and morbidity rates by at least test 15 per cent'. That's from the government's explanatory memorandum. Then there were the press releases from the member for Farrer, when she was the minister, telling us how urgent it was that we privatise this register and pass the legislation. Mysteriously, nothing's happened since they signed this dodgy contract with Telstra Health, and yet they're trying to claim that no women would have died and no new cancers would have been created. So, I think there's more to be said in the Federation Chamber on this. I commend the report to the House and I move: 


That the House take note of the report.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:18):  This bill, the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, seeks to clarify legal questions concerning the nature of marine orders made by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Its practical effect would be to ensure that marine orders have the same legal status as regulations, including that they include penalties for noncompliance. The changes make sense, and they have my support.


Where there is confusion or doubt on whether the legislation accurately reflects the intentions of the parliament, we must make whatever changes are necessary to clarify the collective will of this parliament. Indeed, we should always ensure that parliament provides the community with certainty in the law.


However, while we're considering this important issue, we should also reflect on our responsibility to provide certainty over the existence of an Australian shipping industry and certainty as to the jobs that Australians rely upon. For the past five years, this government has undermined Australian shipping, seeking to expose it to unfair competition in coastal trade from foreign-flagged vessels paying their crews third-world wages. This has created five years of uncertainty for the Australian shipping industry and Australian seafarers.


Labor will always support changes that enhance Australian shipping, create jobs or, as is the case today, amend legislation to clarify legal ambiguities. But what we won't do is undermine Australian industry and undermine Australian jobs. Put simply, those opposite want to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian ships with the white flag of surrender when it comes to Australian jobs. That is the wrong approach. We should be nurturing the Australian shipping industry. We should be promoting job creation and job security. That's the principle behind the amendment that I will now move. I move:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: 


(1)notes that:


(a) despite the Government’s repeated claims, its proposed changes to coastal shipping legislation are all about eliminating Australian jobs, and ultimately the entire domestic industry; and


(b) during this Government’s period in office, 12 previously Australian-flagged vessels have been reflagged to foreign States; and


(2)reaffirms that:


(a) it is in the national interest to ensure a level playing field between foreign and domestic shipping operators; and


(b) Australia’s vital economic, environmental and national security interests are best served when there is a viable, competitive and growing local shipping industry"".


Can I outline the context of this legislation that's before the House today? The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 and the Navigation Act 2012 give AMSA the ability to make what are known as marine orders. Marine orders are designed to be legislative instruments allowing AMSA, as the regulator, to keep pace with developments in a rapidly changing industry. Essentially, the idea is that these regulations can be changed at periods of time in order to ensure that the appropriate regulatory regime is kept up-to-date and that there is certainty and consistency. Indeed, when the Navigation Act 2012 was introduced, it replaced the Navigation Act 1912—for 100 years we'd sat on that legislation. It took a Labor government to modernise the legislation that covered Australian shipping.


Marine orders are generally practical in their nature. For example, marine order 15 relates to fire protection for ships. Marine order 17 concerns regulations for carrying dangerous liquids. The original intention of marine orders, as defined in the Navigation Act 2012, was that they would be legally enforceable and, particularly, would include a provision for penalties for noncompliance. However, the government has lately faced some legal questions concerning the enforcement of marine orders. This legislation clarifies the situation by giving marine orders the status of regulations, as was the original intention. The amendment to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 inserts a definition for 'regulations' that includes marine orders, with relevant exceptions. The amendment to the Navigation Act 2012 makes the same change. Labor supports these changes. There's no room for legal ambiguity over issues such as the ones that I raise: fire protection and the carriage of dangerous liquids. These are not issues of partisan disagreement; they are issues of common sense. As the national regulator, AMSA does a very good job in this regard.


The parliament should also provide clarity over the security of the Australian coastal shipping industry, because the existence of this sector is fundamental to our national interest, given that we are an island continent. Yet, from the moment the coalition took office, and indeed before that, they have sought to undermine the industry. They want to cut costs, without any regard to whether that cost cutting is actually real. It is so dedicated to undermining the people who work in the Australian industry who happen to be members of trade unions that their solution to eliminating members of the maritime sector who are trade unionists is to eliminate the jobs that exist. That's their plan. No maritime sector? No Maritime Union of Australia. This is the logical conclusion of anyone who actually looks at the legislation that's been put forward by the government opposite. Tragically, it has been the National Party that has been in charge of this—the National Party, the party whose name implies standing up for the national interest, the party which historically arose out of an approach, in part, to protectionism and regulation of Australian industry.


Now, we don't say that there should be a protectionist model in the Australian shipping industry. We don't go the way that many countries have gone—for example, the United States with the Jones Act, where, if you want to take goods from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you have to have a US flagged ship built in the US and with US seafarers on it. It is a completely closed system for their coastal shipping. Indeed, Australia has one of the most open systems in the world. But what we don't support is the idea that an Australian flagged ship should have to compete with a foreign flagged ship with fewer regulations, less maintenance and less wages, because we know that that isn't a level playing field. That's why the 2012 reforms sought to genuinely have a level playing field through a range of measures, including taxation measures, so that the cost differential between a ship that was flagged in a Third World country or a country like Singapore that has a zero rate of taxation would not be at an advantage over an Australian ship.


The fact is that the changes that were sought in 2015 were about eliminating the Australian shipping industry. It actually said it in the regulatory impact statement, where it said that 93 per cent of the savings that were estimated to result from that legislation were a direct result of the difference between Australian wages and foreign wages. It also said that it anticipated that the Australian flag would be removed from ships and be replaced by foreign flags. We saw that in really practical and specific terms as the debate went on.


Perth businessman Bill Milby of North Star Cruises came to a seminar. In all of the seminars and launches of this policy the big hint was where the National Party ministers launched the policy. They launched it at events hosted by the foreign shippers. It was a bit of a hint. It's a bit like when Pauline Hanson moves a resolution on race: you kind of know where that's going. So you launch a policy that you say is about the Australian shipping industry and you launch it at an event hosted by foreign shippers—and, of course, foreign shippers are called Shipping Australia. That's what the foreign shipping organisation is called, because they know that it's untenable not to be seen to be supporting Australian shipping, because most Australians would think it's just a bit of common sense to have an Australian shipping industry as we are an island continent.


Bill Milby, a quite successful businessman and owner of North Star Cruises, goes along to this forum. He's listening to what these reforms are and he's a smart fellow. This business has been operating up around the Kimberley very successfully. It has been employing Australians and bringing dollars into the Australian economy from international visitors who, as Mr Milby says, actually want to hear an Australian accent while they're travelling around the pristine areas of the Kimberley and northern Australia. He has provided employment for crew, for cooks and for all the people who work for his company.


He goes up to the deputy secretary of the department and says: 'I can't see how, if these changes come in, I can compete. How can I possibly compete?' and he is told, 'Well, this is how you compete: you replace the Australian flag on the back of your vessels with a foreign flag and you replace your Australian staff with staff from the Philippines or some other nation. That's how you compete.' That's what he was told. He gave this evidence at the Senate committee into the legislation. He has said this outside of parliament as well. We know it's true because the legislation said it was in the regulatory impact statement. Quite extraordinary. Here we had an Australian government proposing legislation and providing advice to businesses that was specifically designed to put Australians out of work. In more than two decades in this place, I've never seen such a flagrant betrayal of the national interest by representatives in this chamber.


But the fact is that crossbench senators wouldn't have a bar of it. They put the national interest first. Former Senator Nick Xenophon, when I went to see him about the legislation, said, 'Well, I always vote for second readings.' In general, the crossbench has had a view that you vote for the second reading—not the amendments; the second reading—because it allows for further debate. It may well be that there are amendments that make legislation acceptable. But what happened with this legislation is it didn't even get a second reading. That's how bad it was. That doesn't happen too often in the Senate. I've dealt with a range of legislation in my portfolio, and it's the only time I can remember that they just said, 'No, go away; this is absurd.'


Just last month there was another tranche of legislation debated here in the House of Representatives. They came back. We had Minister Truss introduce the first legislation. Then we had Minister Chester introduce the second bit of legislation. We had Minister Joyce sit on the legislation. Then we had Minister McCormack. It's a revolving door. This mob speak about the parliament. I'd like to be able to say to the House that I, as shadow minister, am the best shadow minister there's ever been because I knock over a minister every few months. But I can't, in all honesty, say that this isn't self-inflicted as much as anything else. The fact is that last month we had debate on the latest tranche of legislation, maritime legislation from 2016. It took from 2016 to 2018 to get a second reading debate in this place. They'll go through another four ministers before it gets to the Senate. It's just extraordinary. The fact is, in spite of the government saying that they'll consult with Labor about shipping legislation, they essentially haven't sought to get any bipartisanship—you have one meeting, then the next time there's a new minister. Maritime Industry Australia Limited, MIAL, the peak industry body, a bunch of businessmen involved in an industry, regard the government as having treated them with contempt, because the consultation for the new legislation was all with the foreign shippers rather than with them as well.


Why do we need a shipping industry? Firstly, of course, it's clearly in our national economic interest. We are a maritime nation. Most of our exports and imports, close to 99 per cent of them, come and leave via our coast on ships. We rely on the maritime sector to train the people who become harbour masters and run our ports. It is essential for our national economy that those skills be maintained.


Secondly, there is the issue of our environment. We know that every time a major incident has occurred—Shen Neng;Pacific Adventurer—they have something in common: there's a foreign flag on the back of the ship. People aren't as familiar with our coastlines, with the pristine nature of our reefs. The accidents that have occurred have caused great damage, but the potential is there for a catastrophic event that would have enormous impact on our national economy.


The third reason is national security. There's a direct link between the defence industry and our merchant fleet. That's why, when we established an organisation to look at the maritime workforce development, we had the Navy represented on it. It was chaired by a former Public Service Commissioner. We had the Navy, we had the Australian shipping industry, we had the Maritime Union of Australia, we had the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers and we had the Australian Maritime College down at Launceston. They all came up with a plan for workforce development, a common interest. They had funding of just $5 million from the government to make this plan work. What did this government do when they came to office? They scrapped it. They took the $5 million and scrapped the plan. The fact is that there is a direct link, and, in times of conflict, the merchant fleet has suffered great losses—during World War II, for example.


When this government speak about national security, when they speak about us stopping boats, we didn't think that meant stopping ships with an Australian flag on the back, but that's precisely what they've done. They've done it through abuse of the existing regulations. Take, for example, the Portland.The Portland operated from Portland in Victoria, where the refinery is, picking up the natural resources from over in Western Australia and essentially going to and fro with the natural resources, down to Portland and back again. There was nothing temporary about it. It was a permanent, two-destination voyage that had operated for many years. Yet this government allowed it to be replaced with a foreign-flagged vessel with a foreign crew. The government said that the journey and those regional jobs based in regional Victoria could be replaced by jobs offshore in the Philippines and other destinations. Somehow that was temporary. It's just a complete abuse of the legislation; it's an outrageous indictment of the government's failure to implement what is the law. Yet the government, of course, were completely determined to do that, because they don't seem to understand the synergy which is there between our naval and our merchant fleets.


Our Australian seafarers undergo very stringent background checks. They have to have an MSIC. Foreign seafarers don't have MSICs, but they operate in our ports and in our harbours. The government should think about where ships are, what they have on board and the potential issue for national security that this represents if the proper checks aren't made. I say to the government: don't say that you didn't know about it if there is an incident. Don't say it, because this is called Hansard, and I'm saying in it that there are national security interests in Australia having an Australian fleet operating around our coasts. And don't say that you don't understand the economic reasons for why we need an Australian shipping industry. Don't say that you're not aware of the Pasha Bulker, the Shandong Hai Wang, the Pacific Adventurer and, in New Zealand, the Rena, which I flew over with the New Zealand transport minister. Essentially, that incident had an enormously damaging impact on the environment and also on the economy of the region around Auckland and the north coast of the North Island of New Zealand.


The fact is that Labor does understand the importance of the shipping sector and the need to provide Australian seafarers with secure work. In government we created the Australian International Shipping Register, allowing operators of Australian-flagged vessels to employ mixed Australian and foreign crews on internationally agreed rates and conditions. We enacted the first major rewrite of the nation's maritime laws. That was consistent with the other work that we did on the National Ports Strategy. We made sure that the oil companies pay for any and all damage their ships may cause. We had to fix legislation to fix that. We replaced the myriad laws that operated separately from state to state with just one national regulator administering one set of modern nationwide laws.


By contrast, the coalition have completely undermined the Australian shipping industry. As I said at the outset, I'm all for certainty in legislation, but I'm also an advocate for job certainty for Australian seafarers and investment certainty for the Australian shipping industry. It is in Australia's economic, environmental and national security interests to maintain a vibrant Australian shipping industry. It is also the case—to give a comparison that I think is appropriate—that, if you want to take freight from Sydney to Melbourne down the highway, you use a truck that's registered in Australia; you have a truck driver with an Australian licence; and you are obligated to pay Australian wages. If you take those same goods down the blue highway, which is free from Sydney to Melbourne, you can have a foreign-flagged ship with foreign wages and foreign conditions, regardless.


What that does as well, as the Australian rail industry has pointed out, is to distort the market across transport modes towards foreign ships. That's over Australian jobs in the rail sector, in particular, but also in the roads sector. That's a distortion that, again, undermines Australian conditions and wages.


If we're going to compete in the Asian century, we can't compete on the basis of how low we can drive our wages. We need to compete on the basis of how smart we are, how innovative we are, how creative we are as a nation—creating the jobs of the future. This government doesn't seem to understand that. In spite of the Reserve Bank saying that wages being reduced in real terms is a problem for the national economy, in areas like this what we see is that they have contempt for Australian industrial conditions. There should be no difference between the blue highway and the Hume Highway. It's a very simple principle of operation.


The fact is that those opposite do want to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian ships employing Australian seafarers with the white flag of surrender when it comes to Australian jobs, and it is much to their shame that they remain determined to pursue this course after five years of destructive attitudes towards Australian shipping.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  Is the amendment seconded?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (10:46):  I second the amendment. It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak to this bill and particularly to the amendment moved by the shadow minister. I will always get to my feet whenever I can to speak on coastal trading and the maritime fleet in Australia. What's happened under this government and, indeed, under the previous Howard government with respect to our maritime fleet and our maritime workers has been a disgrace in terms of jobs and, particularly, national security and fuel security, which I'll come to a little bit later.


Australia is an island continent, surrounded by water in every direction—north, south, east, west. My own state is an island state of our island country, and we recognise our geographical peculiarity in our national anthem, noting 'Our home is girt by sea'. Unless you fly, the only way to get here is by sea. You cannot drive or walk to Australia from any other country in the world, and in this we are unique. Every other country in the world you can get to by land; this is the only country inhabiting an entire continent and it requires either a plane or a ship to get to it.


You would think that, as an island connected to other nations only by water and air, Australia would have a maritime flee the envy of the world, developed over 200 years of colonial, intercolonial, interstate and international trade. You would think that Australia would be producing the world's best maritime engineers, world-class shipbuilders, the best civilian sailors and officers, the best technicians, the best navigators not only for an Australian fleet but to send out to the world to give the world the best-trained maritime fleet officers and staff. But no. Our maritime fleet in Australia is all but in mothballs, sacrificed on the altar of neoliberalism. Our maritime self-reliance has lost out to greedy corporations and multinationals and to foolish coalition governments more interested in saving a few dollars in sailors' wages than in protecting our national security. We have a government that has absolutely destroyed our domestic shipping industry and annihilated our domestic maritime fleet. For some reason, the coalition—those opposite—has never seen the benefit that these industries offer to Australia and to our economy.


I was at a function at the parliament this week with the Maritime Industry Australia Limited representatives the shadow minister talked about earlier in his speech. At that occasion, the Minister for Defence turned up and extolled the virtues of what he was doing with the Defence program, the shipbuilding, the subs and all that. People were looking on thinking, 'What on earth is this guy talking about?' These were representatives of commercial shipbuilders, and he was going on about a naval shipbuilding program. They could only look on in wonder and think, 'We're missing out on this.' Why can't the minister and this government see that our Defence capabilities are just as important as our merchant capabilities? They just don't see it. They are blind to the implications.


Similarly, they turn a blind eye to the absolute rorting of the temporary licences for foreign vessels in Australian waters. Australia's coastal shipping industry, under various Liberal governments since Howard, has eroded and virtually disappeared. The shadow minister made reference to the Portland, a vessel that travelled the same route between Western Australia and Victoria for 27 years. It was crewed by Australians and flagged as an Australian vessel, but, under this government—under those opposite—it's been allowed to be deflagged and recrewed by foreign crews under foreign conditions, despite plying a domestic route.


If the sea route that it took was just a few kilometres inland, it wouldn't be allowed. It would be illegal to have foreign workers on foreign conditions on a foreign registered vessel adhering to foreign maintenance standards using Australian land based conditions and roads. It would be disallowed. We require that vehicles on Australian roads and Australian highways adhere to Australian conditions and Australian law, but, somehow, even though it's still in Australia but on the water, all those rules are out the window. And why? It's because you save a few dollars in wages. It's an absolute disgrace.


My own state was the sorry last resting place of the Alexander Spirit, the very last Australian crewed fuel tanker, where a crew was basically forcibly removed and told: 'That's it. We're replacing you with foreign crews.' Australia no longer has fuel delivered to Australia by Australians. What does that do to our fuel security? It means we are entirely reliant on foreign nationals and foreign crews in foreign vessels.


Labor supports this bill. As the shadow minister has said, marine orders are critical to the successful operations of ships that come to Australia, and, as such, those marine orders need to be enforceable. There need to be penalties for noncompliance and there needs to be clarity. They are critical components of the successful and safe operation of ships. As regulations made under Commonwealth legislation, marine orders are a flexible instrument that allow our laws to keep pace with the often fast-paced technical and technological change in marine safety and implement Australia's international maritime obligations.


Australia currently has two series of marine orders. One is marine order 198, which generally fulfils our international obligations and expectations and applies to Australian and foreign vessels, as well as some domestic commercial ships. We also have marine orders 500 to 507, which apply solely to domestic commercial vessels. Marine orders dictate behaviour and activity on a range of issues, including fire and emergency safety, garbage and waste disposal, working and living conditions, skill and health requirements for crew, and safe navigation and traffic processes.


All industries are governed by regulations. Whether they be specific to safety requirements or environmental management, they are important components of industry operations. Marine orders, in particular, provide flexible and responsive measures that can fill gaps not filled explicitly by legislation. Marine orders are created by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, who delegates their enforcement to a range of AMSA staff. This bill offers sensible and necessary reform. There can be no question, and there must be no question, of the legal authority or enforceability of marine orders.


I come back to the second reading amendment. This government has overseen the demise of our fleet and our capability as a merchant marine nation. I just can't believe what it's done. The shadow minister is similarly aghast at how those opposite almost take perverse pride in what they've achieved with their coastal shipping legislation.




Mr Ramsey:
  It was Albo's legislation.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  No, no. Don't mislead the House. Your coastal trading legislation is decimating Australia's maritime capability. What we on this side of the House did in 2012 was introduce legislation that allowed for temporary licences—temporary licences—which those opposite, in government, have absolutely rorted. As the shadow minister alluded to, we had a system which was a commonsense system whereby foreign vessels importing goods into this country could, upon bringing their goods in, move from one port to another port with the same crew—without having to replace the entire crew with Australians. They were from another country, they'd dropped off their cargo, and they could make another trip on a domestic route. That was a sensible allowance under the temporary licence. What those opposite have allowed is for foreign vessels to come in and then do business, almost exclusively, around the coastal trading routes. That's a big difference, and it's killed the maritime fleet in Australia.


I want to come briefly to an exceptional speech given at the Australian Naval Institute by Lieutenant Commander Desmond Woods. He gave this speech at the Australian merchant navy day of remembrance on 8 April this year. He spoke at some length about the contribution of the merchant fleet in wartime. It's often forgotten and neglected when we come to remember those who've sacrificed everything for the nation. We often forget the contribution of the merchant fleet, and the men and women of the fleet. Lieutenant Commander Woods said:


The Merchant Navy of the whole British Empire, which included the Australian Merchant Fleet, suffered proportionately the highest casualties of any of the allied services in the Second World War. Thirty thousand two hundred and forty eight British Empire merchant seamen who served at sea under the red ensign lost their lives doing so. The Australian Department of Veterans Affairs nominal roll records 3,500 Australian merchant seamen serving in World War II in Australian registered ships. The Australian War Memorial has placed the names of 845 of them, who are known to have died on war service during World War II, on the commemorative roll.


These are men, and perhaps some women, who didn't take up arms. They were serving in the merchant fleet during wartime and they died during their service. They were absolutely some of the bravest men and women this country has ever seen. We'll never know the true number of Australians who died, because there were many who served in British and international fleets and they're not included among those 845.


The contribution of the merchant fleet is often forgotten when, on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, we come to teach schoolchildren about the contribution of our armed services. We often forget the merchant seamen. I'm pleased to say that the War Memorial and the official records don't forget them; they are appropriately recognised in official records. But, in the national consciousness, we often forget the contribution of our merchant seamen. They have made an incredible contribution to this country, and it must never be forgotten.


The lieutenant commander goes on to say:


This omission from the national recollection is most profoundly true of the period of the campaign in New Guinea in 1942. Those brutal battles on the Kokoda track were finally won because the Japanese army was cut off from re-supply and was starved into retreating. First Australian and later also American troops in the jungle and on the northern beaches at Gona and Buna were supplied with bread and bombs, bacon and bullets and fuel in vast quantities from the sea and were therefore able to take the fight back to the Japanese. New Guinea was won back from the enemy by the combination of the matchless courage and endurance of young soldiers and airman ashore and by the merchant seamen afloat who supplied them and the RAN who escorted those ships.


A combined national effort won that iconic battle that turned the tide in that great struggle. It wouldn't have happened without the contribution of the merchant fleet. But where is that merchant fleet today? If we were to have a conflict of that magnitude on our doorstep today, would we be able to resupply our troops from an Australian maritime merchant fleet? No, we would not.


That's why I support the shadow minister's second reading amendment. We must do all we can to rebuild our merchant fleet and support the men and women of Australia's maritime industry.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-10-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals) (11:02):  The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 makes important machinery changes to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 and the Navigation Act 2012. These acts establish key parts of Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. Primarily, the bill will insert a definition of the term 'regulations' into each act, to clarify that this term includes legislative instruments known as marine orders. This clarification is necessary to ensure the regulatory framework operates as intended. Provisions of each act rely on vessel owners and individual seafarers operating or working on vessels complying with requirements of regulations, such as requirements to hold valid safety or pollution certificates. The bill provides important legal clarity and certainty that existing obligations and requirements for individual seafarers and vessel owners include requirements set out in marine orders.


In practical terms, the machinery changes made by the bill will have no impact on maritime industries operating under these acts. Individual seafarers and vessel owners will continue to comply with the same requirements set out under the existing acts, regulations and marine orders in the same manner as today and continue to be subject to the existing compliance framework. Use of marine orders is a longstanding practice to deal with detailed technical and operational requirements and processes and to give effect to international obligations and standards. Australia's maritime industries are familiar with this practice. Marine orders are used to set out potentially complex standards and requirements in the clearest and simplest manner possible, to help the maritime industry to understand and comply with their obligations.


Use of marine orders also ensures these requirements are set out in a consistent and familiar way which is easily and freely accessible in one place on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's website. They are also registered and freely available on the Federal Register of Legislation. Marine orders are legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislation Act 2003, which means that they are subject to crucial parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. Importantly, the explanatory memoranda for the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and Navigation Bill 2012 make clear that policymakers intended marine orders, rather than the acts or regulations, to continue to be used to set out these operational and technical matters and requirements, in line with longstanding regulatory practice. This bill gives effect to that intent.


The amendments made by this bill will ensure Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment continues to function as intended—efficiently, effectively and consistent with international law. This framework is vital to ensure the safe operation of vessels in Australia's waters and to ensure seafarers and passengers aboard these vessels return home safely.


This framework is also vital for protecting Australia's pristine coastal and marine environments, including our internationally recognised areas of outstanding national significance, such as the Great Barrier Reef. I would like to thank honourable members for their constructive contributions to this debate. I commend the bill to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:18):  This bill, the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, seeks to clarify legal questions concerning the nature of marine orders made by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Its practical effect would be to ensure that marine orders have the same legal status as regulations, including that they include penalties for noncompliance. The changes make sense, and they have my support.


Where there is confusion or doubt on whether the legislation accurately reflects the intentions of the parliament, we must make whatever changes are necessary to clarify the collective will of this parliament. Indeed, we should always ensure that parliament provides the community with certainty in the law.


However, while we're considering this important issue, we should also reflect on our responsibility to provide certainty over the existence of an Australian shipping industry and certainty as to the jobs that Australians rely upon. For the past five years, this government has undermined Australian shipping, seeking to expose it to unfair competition in coastal trade from foreign-flagged vessels paying their crews third-world wages. This has created five years of uncertainty for the Australian shipping industry and Australian seafarers.


Labor will always support changes that enhance Australian shipping, create jobs or, as is the case today, amend legislation to clarify legal ambiguities. But what we won't do is undermine Australian industry and undermine Australian jobs. Put simply, those opposite want to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian ships with the white flag of surrender when it comes to Australian jobs. That is the wrong approach. We should be nurturing the Australian shipping industry. We should be promoting job creation and job security. That's the principle behind the amendment that I will now move. I move:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: 


(1)notes that:


(a) despite the Government’s repeated claims, its proposed changes to coastal shipping legislation are all about eliminating Australian jobs, and ultimately the entire domestic industry; and


(b) during this Government’s period in office, 12 previously Australian-flagged vessels have been reflagged to foreign States; and


(2)reaffirms that:


(a) it is in the national interest to ensure a level playing field between foreign and domestic shipping operators; and


(b) Australia’s vital economic, environmental and national security interests are best served when there is a viable, competitive and growing local shipping industry"".


Can I outline the context of this legislation that's before the House today? The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 and the Navigation Act 2012 give AMSA the ability to make what are known as marine orders. Marine orders are designed to be legislative instruments allowing AMSA, as the regulator, to keep pace with developments in a rapidly changing industry. Essentially, the idea is that these regulations can be changed at periods of time in order to ensure that the appropriate regulatory regime is kept up-to-date and that there is certainty and consistency. Indeed, when the Navigation Act 2012 was introduced, it replaced the Navigation Act 1912—for 100 years we'd sat on that legislation. It took a Labor government to modernise the legislation that covered Australian shipping.


Marine orders are generally practical in their nature. For example, marine order 15 relates to fire protection for ships. Marine order 17 concerns regulations for carrying dangerous liquids. The original intention of marine orders, as defined in the Navigation Act 2012, was that they would be legally enforceable and, particularly, would include a provision for penalties for noncompliance. However, the government has lately faced some legal questions concerning the enforcement of marine orders. This legislation clarifies the situation by giving marine orders the status of regulations, as was the original intention. The amendment to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 inserts a definition for 'regulations' that includes marine orders, with relevant exceptions. The amendment to the Navigation Act 2012 makes the same change. Labor supports these changes. There's no room for legal ambiguity over issues such as the ones that I raise: fire protection and the carriage of dangerous liquids. These are not issues of partisan disagreement; they are issues of common sense. As the national regulator, AMSA does a very good job in this regard.


The parliament should also provide clarity over the security of the Australian coastal shipping industry, because the existence of this sector is fundamental to our national interest, given that we are an island continent. Yet, from the moment the coalition took office, and indeed before that, they have sought to undermine the industry. They want to cut costs, without any regard to whether that cost cutting is actually real. It is so dedicated to undermining the people who work in the Australian industry who happen to be members of trade unions that their solution to eliminating members of the maritime sector who are trade unionists is to eliminate the jobs that exist. That's their plan. No maritime sector? No Maritime Union of Australia. This is the logical conclusion of anyone who actually looks at the legislation that's been put forward by the government opposite. Tragically, it has been the National Party that has been in charge of this—the National Party, the party whose name implies standing up for the national interest, the party which historically arose out of an approach, in part, to protectionism and regulation of Australian industry.


Now, we don't say that there should be a protectionist model in the Australian shipping industry. We don't go the way that many countries have gone—for example, the United States with the Jones Act, where, if you want to take goods from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you have to have a US flagged ship built in the US and with US seafarers on it. It is a completely closed system for their coastal shipping. Indeed, Australia has one of the most open systems in the world. But what we don't support is the idea that an Australian flagged ship should have to compete with a foreign flagged ship with fewer regulations, less maintenance and less wages, because we know that that isn't a level playing field. That's why the 2012 reforms sought to genuinely have a level playing field through a range of measures, including taxation measures, so that the cost differential between a ship that was flagged in a Third World country or a country like Singapore that has a zero rate of taxation would not be at an advantage over an Australian ship.


The fact is that the changes that were sought in 2015 were about eliminating the Australian shipping industry. It actually said it in the regulatory impact statement, where it said that 93 per cent of the savings that were estimated to result from that legislation were a direct result of the difference between Australian wages and foreign wages. It also said that it anticipated that the Australian flag would be removed from ships and be replaced by foreign flags. We saw that in really practical and specific terms as the debate went on.


Perth businessman Bill Milby of North Star Cruises came to a seminar. In all of the seminars and launches of this policy the big hint was where the National Party ministers launched the policy. They launched it at events hosted by the foreign shippers. It was a bit of a hint. It's a bit like when Pauline Hanson moves a resolution on race: you kind of know where that's going. So you launch a policy that you say is about the Australian shipping industry and you launch it at an event hosted by foreign shippers—and, of course, foreign shippers are called Shipping Australia. That's what the foreign shipping organisation is called, because they know that it's untenable not to be seen to be supporting Australian shipping, because most Australians would think it's just a bit of common sense to have an Australian shipping industry as we are an island continent.


Bill Milby, a quite successful businessman and owner of North Star Cruises, goes along to this forum. He's listening to what these reforms are and he's a smart fellow. This business has been operating up around the Kimberley very successfully. It has been employing Australians and bringing dollars into the Australian economy from international visitors who, as Mr Milby says, actually want to hear an Australian accent while they're travelling around the pristine areas of the Kimberley and northern Australia. He has provided employment for crew, for cooks and for all the people who work for his company.


He goes up to the deputy secretary of the department and says: 'I can't see how, if these changes come in, I can compete. How can I possibly compete?' and he is told, 'Well, this is how you compete: you replace the Australian flag on the back of your vessels with a foreign flag and you replace your Australian staff with staff from the Philippines or some other nation. That's how you compete.' That's what he was told. He gave this evidence at the Senate committee into the legislation. He has said this outside of parliament as well. We know it's true because the legislation said it was in the regulatory impact statement. Quite extraordinary. Here we had an Australian government proposing legislation and providing advice to businesses that was specifically designed to put Australians out of work. In more than two decades in this place, I've never seen such a flagrant betrayal of the national interest by representatives in this chamber.


But the fact is that crossbench senators wouldn't have a bar of it. They put the national interest first. Former Senator Nick Xenophon, when I went to see him about the legislation, said, 'Well, I always vote for second readings.' In general, the crossbench has had a view that you vote for the second reading—not the amendments; the second reading—because it allows for further debate. It may well be that there are amendments that make legislation acceptable. But what happened with this legislation is it didn't even get a second reading. That's how bad it was. That doesn't happen too often in the Senate. I've dealt with a range of legislation in my portfolio, and it's the only time I can remember that they just said, 'No, go away; this is absurd.'


Just last month there was another tranche of legislation debated here in the House of Representatives. They came back. We had Minister Truss introduce the first legislation. Then we had Minister Chester introduce the second bit of legislation. We had Minister Joyce sit on the legislation. Then we had Minister McCormack. It's a revolving door. This mob speak about the parliament. I'd like to be able to say to the House that I, as shadow minister, am the best shadow minister there's ever been because I knock over a minister every few months. But I can't, in all honesty, say that this isn't self-inflicted as much as anything else. The fact is that last month we had debate on the latest tranche of legislation, maritime legislation from 2016. It took from 2016 to 2018 to get a second reading debate in this place. They'll go through another four ministers before it gets to the Senate. It's just extraordinary. The fact is, in spite of the government saying that they'll consult with Labor about shipping legislation, they essentially haven't sought to get any bipartisanship—you have one meeting, then the next time there's a new minister. Maritime Industry Australia Limited, MIAL, the peak industry body, a bunch of businessmen involved in an industry, regard the government as having treated them with contempt, because the consultation for the new legislation was all with the foreign shippers rather than with them as well.


Why do we need a shipping industry? Firstly, of course, it's clearly in our national economic interest. We are a maritime nation. Most of our exports and imports, close to 99 per cent of them, come and leave via our coast on ships. We rely on the maritime sector to train the people who become harbour masters and run our ports. It is essential for our national economy that those skills be maintained.


Secondly, there is the issue of our environment. We know that every time a major incident has occurred—Shen Neng;Pacific Adventurer—they have something in common: there's a foreign flag on the back of the ship. People aren't as familiar with our coastlines, with the pristine nature of our reefs. The accidents that have occurred have caused great damage, but the potential is there for a catastrophic event that would have enormous impact on our national economy.


The third reason is national security. There's a direct link between the defence industry and our merchant fleet. That's why, when we established an organisation to look at the maritime workforce development, we had the Navy represented on it. It was chaired by a former Public Service Commissioner. We had the Navy, we had the Australian shipping industry, we had the Maritime Union of Australia, we had the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers and we had the Australian Maritime College down at Launceston. They all came up with a plan for workforce development, a common interest. They had funding of just $5 million from the government to make this plan work. What did this government do when they came to office? They scrapped it. They took the $5 million and scrapped the plan. The fact is that there is a direct link, and, in times of conflict, the merchant fleet has suffered great losses—during World War II, for example.


When this government speak about national security, when they speak about us stopping boats, we didn't think that meant stopping ships with an Australian flag on the back, but that's precisely what they've done. They've done it through abuse of the existing regulations. Take, for example, the Portland.The Portland operated from Portland in Victoria, where the refinery is, picking up the natural resources from over in Western Australia and essentially going to and fro with the natural resources, down to Portland and back again. There was nothing temporary about it. It was a permanent, two-destination voyage that had operated for many years. Yet this government allowed it to be replaced with a foreign-flagged vessel with a foreign crew. The government said that the journey and those regional jobs based in regional Victoria could be replaced by jobs offshore in the Philippines and other destinations. Somehow that was temporary. It's just a complete abuse of the legislation; it's an outrageous indictment of the government's failure to implement what is the law. Yet the government, of course, were completely determined to do that, because they don't seem to understand the synergy which is there between our naval and our merchant fleets.


Our Australian seafarers undergo very stringent background checks. They have to have an MSIC. Foreign seafarers don't have MSICs, but they operate in our ports and in our harbours. The government should think about where ships are, what they have on board and the potential issue for national security that this represents if the proper checks aren't made. I say to the government: don't say that you didn't know about it if there is an incident. Don't say it, because this is called Hansard, and I'm saying in it that there are national security interests in Australia having an Australian fleet operating around our coasts. And don't say that you don't understand the economic reasons for why we need an Australian shipping industry. Don't say that you're not aware of the Pasha Bulker, the Shandong Hai Wang, the Pacific Adventurer and, in New Zealand, the Rena, which I flew over with the New Zealand transport minister. Essentially, that incident had an enormously damaging impact on the environment and also on the economy of the region around Auckland and the north coast of the North Island of New Zealand.


The fact is that Labor does understand the importance of the shipping sector and the need to provide Australian seafarers with secure work. In government we created the Australian International Shipping Register, allowing operators of Australian-flagged vessels to employ mixed Australian and foreign crews on internationally agreed rates and conditions. We enacted the first major rewrite of the nation's maritime laws. That was consistent with the other work that we did on the National Ports Strategy. We made sure that the oil companies pay for any and all damage their ships may cause. We had to fix legislation to fix that. We replaced the myriad laws that operated separately from state to state with just one national regulator administering one set of modern nationwide laws.


By contrast, the coalition have completely undermined the Australian shipping industry. As I said at the outset, I'm all for certainty in legislation, but I'm also an advocate for job certainty for Australian seafarers and investment certainty for the Australian shipping industry. It is in Australia's economic, environmental and national security interests to maintain a vibrant Australian shipping industry. It is also the case—to give a comparison that I think is appropriate—that, if you want to take freight from Sydney to Melbourne down the highway, you use a truck that's registered in Australia; you have a truck driver with an Australian licence; and you are obligated to pay Australian wages. If you take those same goods down the blue highway, which is free from Sydney to Melbourne, you can have a foreign-flagged ship with foreign wages and foreign conditions, regardless.


What that does as well, as the Australian rail industry has pointed out, is to distort the market across transport modes towards foreign ships. That's over Australian jobs in the rail sector, in particular, but also in the roads sector. That's a distortion that, again, undermines Australian conditions and wages.


If we're going to compete in the Asian century, we can't compete on the basis of how low we can drive our wages. We need to compete on the basis of how smart we are, how innovative we are, how creative we are as a nation—creating the jobs of the future. This government doesn't seem to understand that. In spite of the Reserve Bank saying that wages being reduced in real terms is a problem for the national economy, in areas like this what we see is that they have contempt for Australian industrial conditions. There should be no difference between the blue highway and the Hume Highway. It's a very simple principle of operation.


The fact is that those opposite do want to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian ships employing Australian seafarers with the white flag of surrender when it comes to Australian jobs, and it is much to their shame that they remain determined to pursue this course after five years of destructive attitudes towards Australian shipping.

):  Is the amendment seconded?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2,speech
"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (10:46):  I second the amendment. It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak to this bill and particularly to the amendment moved by the shadow minister. I will always get to my feet whenever I can to speak on coastal trading and the maritime fleet in Australia. What's happened under this government and, indeed, under the previous Howard government with respect to our maritime fleet and our maritime workers has been a disgrace in terms of jobs and, particularly, national security and fuel security, which I'll come to a little bit later.


Australia is an island continent, surrounded by water in every direction—north, south, east, west. My own state is an island state of our island country, and we recognise our geographical peculiarity in our national anthem, noting 'Our home is girt by sea'. Unless you fly, the only way to get here is by sea. You cannot drive or walk to Australia from any other country in the world, and in this we are unique. Every other country in the world you can get to by land; this is the only country inhabiting an entire continent and it requires either a plane or a ship to get to it.


You would think that, as an island connected to other nations only by water and air, Australia would have a maritime flee the envy of the world, developed over 200 years of colonial, intercolonial, interstate and international trade. You would think that Australia would be producing the world's best maritime engineers, world-class shipbuilders, the best civilian sailors and officers, the best technicians, the best navigators not only for an Australian fleet but to send out to the world to give the world the best-trained maritime fleet officers and staff. But no. Our maritime fleet in Australia is all but in mothballs, sacrificed on the altar of neoliberalism. Our maritime self-reliance has lost out to greedy corporations and multinationals and to foolish coalition governments more interested in saving a few dollars in sailors' wages than in protecting our national security. We have a government that has absolutely destroyed our domestic shipping industry and annihilated our domestic maritime fleet. For some reason, the coalition—those opposite—has never seen the benefit that these industries offer to Australia and to our economy.


I was at a function at the parliament this week with the Maritime Industry Australia Limited representatives the shadow minister talked about earlier in his speech. At that occasion, the Minister for Defence turned up and extolled the virtues of what he was doing with the Defence program, the shipbuilding, the subs and all that. People were looking on thinking, 'What on earth is this guy talking about?' These were representatives of commercial shipbuilders, and he was going on about a naval shipbuilding program. They could only look on in wonder and think, 'We're missing out on this.' Why can't the minister and this government see that our Defence capabilities are just as important as our merchant capabilities? They just don't see it. They are blind to the implications.


Similarly, they turn a blind eye to the absolute rorting of the temporary licences for foreign vessels in Australian waters. Australia's coastal shipping industry, under various Liberal governments since Howard, has eroded and virtually disappeared. The shadow minister made reference to the Portland, a vessel that travelled the same route between Western Australia and Victoria for 27 years. It was crewed by Australians and flagged as an Australian vessel, but, under this government—under those opposite—it's been allowed to be deflagged and recrewed by foreign crews under foreign conditions, despite plying a domestic route.


If the sea route that it took was just a few kilometres inland, it wouldn't be allowed. It would be illegal to have foreign workers on foreign conditions on a foreign registered vessel adhering to foreign maintenance standards using Australian land based conditions and roads. It would be disallowed. We require that vehicles on Australian roads and Australian highways adhere to Australian conditions and Australian law, but, somehow, even though it's still in Australia but on the water, all those rules are out the window. And why? It's because you save a few dollars in wages. It's an absolute disgrace.


My own state was the sorry last resting place of the Alexander Spirit, the very last Australian crewed fuel tanker, where a crew was basically forcibly removed and told: 'That's it. We're replacing you with foreign crews.' Australia no longer has fuel delivered to Australia by Australians. What does that do to our fuel security? It means we are entirely reliant on foreign nationals and foreign crews in foreign vessels.


Labor supports this bill. As the shadow minister has said, marine orders are critical to the successful operations of ships that come to Australia, and, as such, those marine orders need to be enforceable. There need to be penalties for noncompliance and there needs to be clarity. They are critical components of the successful and safe operation of ships. As regulations made under Commonwealth legislation, marine orders are a flexible instrument that allow our laws to keep pace with the often fast-paced technical and technological change in marine safety and implement Australia's international maritime obligations.


Australia currently has two series of marine orders. One is marine order 198, which generally fulfils our international obligations and expectations and applies to Australian and foreign vessels, as well as some domestic commercial ships. We also have marine orders 500 to 507, which apply solely to domestic commercial vessels. Marine orders dictate behaviour and activity on a range of issues, including fire and emergency safety, garbage and waste disposal, working and living conditions, skill and health requirements for crew, and safe navigation and traffic processes.


All industries are governed by regulations. Whether they be specific to safety requirements or environmental management, they are important components of industry operations. Marine orders, in particular, provide flexible and responsive measures that can fill gaps not filled explicitly by legislation. Marine orders are created by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, who delegates their enforcement to a range of AMSA staff. This bill offers sensible and necessary reform. There can be no question, and there must be no question, of the legal authority or enforceability of marine orders.


I come back to the second reading amendment. This government has overseen the demise of our fleet and our capability as a merchant marine nation. I just can't believe what it's done. The shadow minister is similarly aghast at how those opposite almost take perverse pride in what they've achieved with their coastal shipping legislation.




Mr Ramsey:
  It was Albo's legislation.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  No, no. Don't mislead the House. Your coastal trading legislation is decimating Australia's maritime capability. What we on this side of the House did in 2012 was introduce legislation that allowed for temporary licences—temporary licences—which those opposite, in government, have absolutely rorted. As the shadow minister alluded to, we had a system which was a commonsense system whereby foreign vessels importing goods into this country could, upon bringing their goods in, move from one port to another port with the same crew—without having to replace the entire crew with Australians. They were from another country, they'd dropped off their cargo, and they could make another trip on a domestic route. That was a sensible allowance under the temporary licence. What those opposite have allowed is for foreign vessels to come in and then do business, almost exclusively, around the coastal trading routes. That's a big difference, and it's killed the maritime fleet in Australia.


I want to come briefly to an exceptional speech given at the Australian Naval Institute by Lieutenant Commander Desmond Woods. He gave this speech at the Australian merchant navy day of remembrance on 8 April this year. He spoke at some length about the contribution of the merchant fleet in wartime. It's often forgotten and neglected when we come to remember those who've sacrificed everything for the nation. We often forget the contribution of the merchant fleet, and the men and women of the fleet. Lieutenant Commander Woods said:


The Merchant Navy of the whole British Empire, which included the Australian Merchant Fleet, suffered proportionately the highest casualties of any of the allied services in the Second World War. Thirty thousand two hundred and forty eight British Empire merchant seamen who served at sea under the red ensign lost their lives doing so. The Australian Department of Veterans Affairs nominal roll records 3,500 Australian merchant seamen serving in World War II in Australian registered ships. The Australian War Memorial has placed the names of 845 of them, who are known to have died on war service during World War II, on the commemorative roll.


These are men, and perhaps some women, who didn't take up arms. They were serving in the merchant fleet during wartime and they died during their service. They were absolutely some of the bravest men and women this country has ever seen. We'll never know the true number of Australians who died, because there were many who served in British and international fleets and they're not included among those 845.


The contribution of the merchant fleet is often forgotten when, on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, we come to teach schoolchildren about the contribution of our armed services. We often forget the merchant seamen. I'm pleased to say that the War Memorial and the official records don't forget them; they are appropriately recognised in official records. But, in the national consciousness, we often forget the contribution of our merchant seamen. They have made an incredible contribution to this country, and it must never be forgotten.


The lieutenant commander goes on to say:


This omission from the national recollection is most profoundly true of the period of the campaign in New Guinea in 1942. Those brutal battles on the Kokoda track were finally won because the Japanese army was cut off from re-supply and was starved into retreating. First Australian and later also American troops in the jungle and on the northern beaches at Gona and Buna were supplied with bread and bombs, bacon and bullets and fuel in vast quantities from the sea and were therefore able to take the fight back to the Japanese. New Guinea was won back from the enemy by the combination of the matchless courage and endurance of young soldiers and airman ashore and by the merchant seamen afloat who supplied them and the RAN who escorted those ships.


A combined national effort won that iconic battle that turned the tide in that great struggle. It wouldn't have happened without the contribution of the merchant fleet. But where is that merchant fleet today? If we were to have a conflict of that magnitude on our doorstep today, would we be able to resupply our troops from an Australian maritime merchant fleet? No, we would not.


That's why I support the shadow minister's second reading amendment. We must do all we can to rebuild our merchant fleet and support the men and women of Australia's maritime industry.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2018-10-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals) (11:02):  The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 makes important machinery changes to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012 and the Navigation Act 2012. These acts establish key parts of Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. Primarily, the bill will insert a definition of the term 'regulations' into each act, to clarify that this term includes legislative instruments known as marine orders. This clarification is necessary to ensure the regulatory framework operates as intended. Provisions of each act rely on vessel owners and individual seafarers operating or working on vessels complying with requirements of regulations, such as requirements to hold valid safety or pollution certificates. The bill provides important legal clarity and certainty that existing obligations and requirements for individual seafarers and vessel owners include requirements set out in marine orders.


In practical terms, the machinery changes made by the bill will have no impact on maritime industries operating under these acts. Individual seafarers and vessel owners will continue to comply with the same requirements set out under the existing acts, regulations and marine orders in the same manner as today and continue to be subject to the existing compliance framework. Use of marine orders is a longstanding practice to deal with detailed technical and operational requirements and processes and to give effect to international obligations and standards. Australia's maritime industries are familiar with this practice. Marine orders are used to set out potentially complex standards and requirements in the clearest and simplest manner possible, to help the maritime industry to understand and comply with their obligations.


Use of marine orders also ensures these requirements are set out in a consistent and familiar way which is easily and freely accessible in one place on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's website. They are also registered and freely available on the Federal Register of Legislation. Marine orders are legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislation Act 2003, which means that they are subject to crucial parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. Importantly, the explanatory memoranda for the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and Navigation Bill 2012 make clear that policymakers intended marine orders, rather than the acts or regulations, to continue to be used to set out these operational and technical matters and requirements, in line with longstanding regulatory practice. This bill gives effect to that intent.


The amendments made by this bill will ensure Australia's regulatory framework for maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment continues to function as intended—efficiently, effectively and consistent with international law. This framework is vital to ensure the safe operation of vessels in Australia's waters and to ensure seafarers and passengers aboard these vessels return home safely.


This framework is also vital for protecting Australia's pristine coastal and marine environments, including our internationally recognised areas of outstanding national significance, such as the Great Barrier Reef. I would like to thank honourable members for their constructive contributions to this debate. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:29):  The Australian Values Study, released this week, found that one-third of Australians think it is good to 'have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections'. Extraordinarily, over half of 30- to 34-year-olds also think this is a good thing. Now, on one level, I can sympathise. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has been terrible. Not only is it a running joke—eating raw onions, knighting princes, denying the law of mathematics and gratuitously insulting countries, seemingly at random, on a day-to-day basis—but it's also failed the big tests, the things that really matter over the long term: responding to the existential threat of climate change, properly funding our schools and hospitals and building a fairer economy in which all Australian workers can get a long-overdue pay rise.


But the great part of Australian democracy is that I can say all of these things about those opposite, in this place, without being scared of being tortured or having my family disappeared. Australian voters can say things like this without the fear of that too, and together we can try to fix it—to change a government and to elect MPs who will do a better job. Over decades, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their countries of birth, choosing to make Australia their new home, because they understand firsthand just how precious Australian democracy is. I say to all Australians, particularly young Australians: be angry—there's lots to be angry about—but don't give up on democracy. Speak out, organise, enrol, vote and fight to make our democracy live up to its promise.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Prime Minister) (14:00):  on indulgence—I do wish to inform the House about a wonderful anniversary that is taking place tomorrow—and it is a very unique one. It doesn't happen often in this country. 103-year-old Ron Collings and 102-year-old Esther Collings from Goolwa, South Australia are celebrating their 80th wedding anniversary tomorrow. Let that sink in—80 years. This doesn't happen very often. Those who organised the congratulatory messages, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, say there have only been a handful of such anniversaries in the history of the country. So it is, I think, a very special moment for Australia. When Mr and Mrs Collings got married, Joe Lyons was the Prime Minister and John Curtin was the opposition leader. So they've seen a few since then.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  And they saw a few on your side too, I can tell you! They saw quite a few on your side too! They've been watching this for a long time, so nothing's new to them. There's nothing new under the sun.


But, to the serious nature of what I'm talking about today: Ron and Esther met each other at the Ozone Enfield picture theatre when Ron was selling sweets. There must have been something wonderful in the water at Goolwa, because Ron kept his driver's licence until he was 100 years of age. Esther says the secret to a successful marriage is giving each other space to pursue your own interests, and it's about compromise as well. When asked what the anniversary means, Ron said, 'It means we've been married a very long time.'


I've been married for 28 years. We celebrate birthdays every year just by living another year, but to celebrate an anniversary you've got to work at it. You've got to work at it to make marriages work. And we're all very grateful to our partners and our wives and husbands outside of this place who enable us to do this. But in Mr and Mrs Collings we have an inspiration to every married couple in this country.


And so, on behalf of the government and the country, I want them to have a very happy anniversary tomorrow. I know the member for Mayo is attending the celebration. I am sure she will convey the joy of this parliament. May God bless you both and may you have many more years of good health, love and happiness.

It is pleasant, actually, to take a moment to congratulate Ron and Esther Collings, two of Australia's more than 4,200 centenarians, as they celebrate the rare and remarkable feat of achieving their 80th wedding anniversary tomorrow. It means that they're now about two years or so away from the current Australian record.


As honourable members would know, traditionally anniversary gifts begin with paper for one year. They work their way up: silver for 25, ruby for 40, gold for 50, and so on. Apparently the traditional gift for the 80th anniversary is oak. Now, looking online, a lot of places recommend an oak photo frame, symbolising endurance and longevity. But, fair warning: nothing stands still. There is a new movement out there to change the 80th anniversary gift to 'a combination of diamonds and pearls'. Ron, if you're listening to this or watching this, I'm confident that Esther will be perfectly happy with a nice frame!


In your long lives together, I'm sure you've had thousands of sparkling diamonds of happiness and countless pearls of joy and laughter. Congratulations from all of us. Enjoy your afternoon tea tomorrow. Best wishes to you and all your family for the time ahead.

Like every member here, I have the great pleasure in writing congratulatory letters for 50th and 60th wedding anniversaries, and last year couple Jack and Fay Miller from Victor Harbor celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. However, an 80th wedding anniversary is extremely special, and I'm looking forward to visiting Ron and Esther Collings from Goolwa tomorrow. Prime Minister, I very much look forward to taking with me the best wishes of the parliament for that special milestone.


After meeting at the picture theatre, they married in 1938 at just 23 and 22 years of age respectively. The Depression was still being felt by many Australian communities. Esther was a dressmaker, and Ron a travelling salesman. Now Mr and Mrs Collings are Australia's oldest living married couple, and may I add that they are happily married. They've been blessed with three children, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.


What always strikes me when I talk to couples who have been together for decades and weathered the storms of life together is: what is your secret to making such a successful relationship? I'm told it's compromise and communication. Mr Collings loves his footy—regrettably, he loves the Sydney Swans and not the Adelaide Crows—while Mrs Collings prefers yoga. Both have given each other the space and time to support each other's own pursuits. I think they're a good example for all of us here in the parliament, and I know all of Mayo is very proud of them. So I congratulate Ron and Esther Collings on reaching their 80th wedding anniversary, and I look forward to sharing in their wonderful celebration tomorrow.

 (Denison) (14:29):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, you and the Minister for Home Affairs misled parliament yesterday when it was claimed there are about 65 medical personnel on Nauru and that children are evacuated on their advice. The truth is there's only half that number at any time and medical advice is routinely overturned by Border Force. In fact, virtually all the children that have been evacuated were because of Federal Court orders or the threat of legal action. Prime Minister, will you correct the record, or will you continue to peddle lies about the abuse of the children suffering in Nauru? After all, the community expects politicians to lie but not to lie about children's lives.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House on a predictable point of order.




Mr Pyne:
  The member for Denison has been here long enough to know that if he wants to accuse any member of the House of misleading the parliament then he has to do so by a substantive motion, and he also can't accuse people of telling lies in the parliament, particularly not in a question.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (14:41):  I want to thank the member for Brisbane, who, before coming to this place, was a strong advocate for a strong economy through his work with small businesses and, since coming to this place, has built on that work with being a strong advocate for the listing of new medicines such as Orkambi, in which he took a deep, strong, personal interest. One of the things that he knows is that it is critical that we have a strong economy in order to list these new medicines because, if we don't, as we saw earlier, if fiscal circumstances did not permit, as was the case under a previous government, new medicines would be deferred. We've dealt with that risk at length this week.


But I particularly want to focus on why the strong economy allows us to list these new medicines. In particular, today, we see an unemployment rate of five per cent and 1.1 million new jobs. That allows us to ensure that all of the new medicines that the medical experts recommend should be listed are listed.


There's one in particular that I want to focus on because this brings us all to the point of why we are in this House—the very things that we seek to achieve. One of the topics that the Prime Minister helped bring to the parliament was spinal muscular atrophy. It's a cause that's been deep and close to him, and it's something about which he has been passionate. A new medicine that we were able to list earlier in the year was Spinraza. Spinraza, which is also known as nusinersen, is for spinal muscular atrophy.


I've received a letter which was conveyed to the member for Corangamite from a family in her electorate, the family of Stephanie Nave. I met with the parents, Amanda and Mark. They talked about what this medicine, which would have cost $370,000, has meant, since it was listed, for their beautiful little daughter Stephanie. As Amanda says: 'It has now been four months since she'—this is Stephanie—'and the first batch of SMA kids to be treated have started, and, for Stephanie at least, the results have been nothing short of amazing. At her physio visit seven days after the first treatment, she was not only able to sit in a preloved manual wheelchair that friends had given us, but she could push it, on carpet. Each and every day we see new things, and she is continuing to get stronger. She has more energy. She's become very chatty, and, because her lungs are stronger, with increased respiratory muscle strength, she's spending a lot of time singing. It is wonderful to finally have some optimism and return to a time when you are able to celebrate milestones and not simply watch skills vanish.'


This is the story of listing new medicines. This is the reason we have a strong economy. This is why we deliver the new medicines, because, at the end of the day, whether it's Stephanie or other children, if we can save and protect their lives, then this parliament is doing its job.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Education) (14:50):  I thank the member for her question. Following on from that spirit of bipartisanship, I know she would like—as I'm sure all members in this House would—to wish those who are doing their leaving exams, right across the nation, all the very best over the coming weeks, because it will be a very trying time for them.


Our government has an economic plan. It's seen more than one million jobs created. It's seen an unemployment rate of five per cent. It's seen economic growth at 3.4 per cent through the year, faster economic growth than any G7 country. It's seen the smallest budget deficit in a decade. We are on track to come back to balance a year earlier, in 2019-20, with a AAA credit rating from the three leading agencies. What does this have to do with education? Everything, because it means that Australians can rely on our government to deliver the essential services we all rely on, the essential services that mean that we can fund the education our kids need. What are we delivering? Record funding for state schools, record funding for Catholic schools and record funding for independent schools. Our government is providing a record $309.6 billion in recurrent funding to all Australian schools from 2018 to 2029, including $88.9 billion over the next four years, delivering for state schools, independent schools and Catholic schools.


But we're not just focused on investment; we're focused on outcomes and, in particular, student outcomes. That's why we're working with the states and territories to deliver the National School Reform Agreement. This includes creating a unique student identifier that will give our kids, parents and teachers the ability to view lifelong progression in education so we can identify problems and opportunities and improve results. In addition, learning progressions will provide support for teachers to teach the curriculum in a way that best suits individual students. This means every child will get a year's worth of learning for every year in education.


Our government believes that you can improve student outcomes without putting up taxes. Those opposite believe you have to do everything by putting up taxes—$200 billion worth of taxes. Australians know that, if you can manage the budget, you can deliver the essential services Australians rely on. This is what our government is doing.

The SPEAKER
 (15:15):  Before I call on the matter of public importance, I've got a statement to update members on an aspect of the security works, just for a minute or so. It's particularly to do with the security upgrade, which is the electronic access system. I'll provide the House with a more comprehensive update on the other aspects of security works next week.


As most members would be aware, in September 2014 a review of Australian Parliament House security arrangements was commissioned in response to the increased national terrorism-threat level in Australia. The review recommended a series of internal and external security enhancements at Australian Parliament House, of which many of the recommendations are progressively being implemented, and a number have been completed under the direction of the presiding officers.


One of the recommendations from the 2014 review was for the parliament to implement an electronic access system. As members would have seen, the system has been progressively installed throughout members' suites over several months but not switched on. A trial of the system has been conducted in several offices, including my office and the offices of the Deputy Speaker, the Second Deputy Speaker, the Clerk, the Serjeant-at-Arms, the Chief Government Whip, the Opposition Whip and several members of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. I've only had positive feedback during this time.


In preparation of a wider rollout of the system throughout the House, I've briefed both the House Standing Committee on Appropriations and Administration and the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. Both committees have endorsed the rollout of the system in the House of Representatives. The privileges committee has stipulated several conditions in relation to the rollout, which I've agreed to and I'm happy to talk to members about in due course.


With the endorsement of both the relevant House committees, the electronic access system to members' suites will now be switched on progressively over the next month or so. Parliament House passes for members and their staff will now become keys to the offices. Offices will be switched on corridor by corridor, but, of course, the Serjeant-at-Arms' office and the Department of Parliamentary Services will contact every office prior to this occurring to provide all of the relevant details and operating procedures. These staff will assist any members who do not yet have a Parliament House pass in obtaining one.


Finally, can I inform members that this electronic access system has been installed, switched on and operating in the ministerial wing for some months now. I thank the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:19):  I would like to begin by giving up a bit of my time to express support for the former defence minister for the initiative put forward by the Leader of the Opposition on the Invictus Games. I associate myself with the words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in support of those contesting the games. I wish them the very, very best.


Today we gave the member for New England an opportunity to show his leadership right here in question time. Of course he grabbed the opportunity with both hands, unsurprisingly. But what people in the towns, large and small, in rural and regional Australia are asking themselves is: why doesn't the government give a toss about them? Why are the National Party, in particular, so focused on and so intensely debating their own political internals, while there are so many challenges to be dealt with in rural and regional Australia?


I've said here many times before that, every time a government take the budget knife to funding in schools and education, hospitals and higher education, the pain is disproportionately felt in rural and regional Australia. When they cut funding to schools, rural schools feel it most. In fact, many of them become unviable. When they cut university funding, it hits regional universities hardest. When they cut hospital funding, regional hospitals feel it most. When they freeze the Medicare rebate, it's residents in rural and regional Australia who are affected most. When they cut vocational education and training, it's the rural TAFE facilities that come under threat the most. And, when you make a mess of the NBN, it's the people in rural and regional Australia who feel it most.


Possibly the greatest betrayal by this government with respect to rural and regional residents in the last five years is its total inability and unwillingness to further progress drought policy reform. We are in the middle of one of the most severe, most protracted and hottest droughts probably now in our history, and this government has been caught asleep at the wheel. What will we get next Friday—tomorrow week? We're going to have a national drought summit, five years into the term of this hopeless government.


And now, five minutes or more to an election campaign, the National Party—that's not their real name; they're actually called The Nationals, but they have a bit of an identity crisis and universally call themselves the National Party—want to bring their chief wrecker back to the leadership of the party. They want to bring the member for New England back. This is the same bloke who has a one-dimensional approach to public policy. The word for that is 'chaos'—chaos and dysfunction. When the member for New England left the agricultural portfolio, I said in this place, 'Today the member for New England moves on, and today we start cleaning up the mess.' It will take a long, long time—in fact, it won't be entirely cleaned up until we have elected a Shorten Labor government.


At a time when the country was crying out for leadership and unity, the member for New England gave them populism and division, pork barrels and false hope. The most recent thought bubble is a royal commission into the retailing sector. It's not really about the retailing sector; it's about the aspirations of the member for New England. This is from the party which voted against a banking royal commission on no less than 23 occasions. I say: shame on them. Of course the National Party represent the majority of the country's poorest electorates. That's the way they like to keep them—poor—because that's what works best for them electorally. There is a political model: divide the community and back a side. The National Party aren't about unity and community. They are about dividing, pushing the issues and taking a side—and then, of course, from time to time feeding them a few crumbs to keep them voting for the National Party.


One small example is the Regional Investment Corporation. Now, think about it: the National Party thinks that you create jobs by moving them from one place to another. Well, of course, that doesn't work. The interesting thing about the Regional Investment Corporation is they don't mention it anymore. I was fascinated when, yesterday, the member for Calare asked the Deputy Prime Minister a question about drought. The Regional Investment Corporation is supposed to be about drought. That's what they tell us. Wouldn't you think the Deputy Prime Minister, answering a question from the member who represents Orange, where they put the Regional Investment Corporation, would have mentioned that organisation? I didn't hear the words pass his lips. You've got to wonder why. Maybe it's because it was stillborn—still no CEO, still no staff, still no office, and still no work to do. It's $28 million of taxpayers' money for a boondoggle, a pork-barrelling exercise that will eventually achieve nothing.


Let us just pretend for a moment that, maybe, the Regional Investment Corporation was a good idea for a local community in that it was going to create jobs and economic activity. Then, if you were going to utilise it, dispatch it to do that, you'd pick a town like Mackay, with eight per cent unemployment; Rockhampton, with eight per cent unemployment; or maybe Shepparton, with six per cent unemployment. No, it's going to Orange, with 3.8 per cent unemployment. We know why it's going to Orange. It's because that's where the Nationals lost a state seat for the first time in about 69 years or so. That's why it's going to Orange. 


No-one will forget the pork barrels and the boondoggles, but all of them were signed off by cabinet, the Prime Minister of the day and the Treasurer of the day. And there's one constant in all of that—it's the now Prime Minister of this country. You can nearly forgive Barnaby Joyce for his antics; that's just him. But why would the now Prime Minister sign off on all this waste and mismanagement? Why would the Prime Minister allow the member for New England to move the pesticides authority from Canberra to Armidale? Why would he do that, knowing the damage it would cause the authority, the farmers, the veterinarians and the companion animal owners who rely on the authority for the safe medicines and other products they receive? 


We all know what it was about. It was all about managing the member for New England. Today, he is a bigger management issue than ever before. And why? Because this Prime Minister decided he'd manage him by giving him a promotion. Let's make him the drought envoy, and that'll keep him quiet. We'll give him extra staff and resources. He'll be able to fly around the country and he'll be happy. Well, that worked well! I wonder what the member for Parkes is thinking about this and will pass comment on in his contribution today.


I've been doing the numbers myself—I know this area just a little—and I reckon the 22 members of the Nationals party room are split three ways: seven, seven, seven, plus one—Barnaby Joyce. There are those sticking with the Deputy Prime Minister, there are those pushing for the member for New England and there are those in the middle who are just in despair. I suspect the member for Parkes is in that corner. The member for Calare must surely be in the corner of the member for New England, because he got the Regional Investment Corporation, although it hasn't manifested into anything yet. 


One minister today got it right, I think, when he said, as reported in TheSydney Morning Herald, 'They have lost their minds'. But Bernard Keane, in Crikey, might have trumped him when his headline read, 'The return of Joyce is the final insult to an angry electorate'. There's only one way to get us all talking positively about the opportunities in rural and regional Australia. There's only one way to restore services in rural and regional Australia, and that, of course, is to elect a Shorten Labor government. I say bring the election on—and bring it on now. (Time expired)

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (15:29):  From time to time, as I go around my regional electorate, I come across a bit of criticism as a local member. People might express some frustration and talk about things that maybe they're not completely happy about, but there are a couple of things I say that brings their attention and makes them focus. The first thing I say is, 'Shorten Labor government,' and then a bit of a grey pallor appears. Then I say, 'Joel Fitzgibbon, agriculture minister,' and that completely spooks them. We've just had 10—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  They know who I am!




Mr COULTON:
  They remember the member for Hunter because he was the defence minister who got sacked. Of course they remember the member for Hunter! They remember the member for Hunter because he represents iconic towns like Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley and Cessnock, which have a great heritage of mining but have a member who doesn't give a toss about miners. Of course they know who the member for Hunter is. We sit here and we've just had 10 minutes of the member for Hunter pontificating about a scenario that is so far from the truth it's ludicrous, and talking about leadership and representation of regional Australia.


Most of my career I've sat up that way, but I was on that side of the chamber in 2008. I sat in the chamber on one particular day when the vote was lost to retain the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. That money was set aside by the good management of the Howard government for the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. Where did it go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into $900 cash handouts to dead people and people living on the Greek islands. That's where it went. For six—



Mr Stephen Jones interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  The member for Whitlam might like to zip it because I didn't say a word while the member for Hunter was speaking. For six years there was nothing in telecommunications for the bush. In the last five years, 600 phone towers have been commissioned. I've seen them. On another day in 2008 or 2009, I remember the member for Watson saying, 'We will no longer use the word 'drought'. 'Drought' has been replaced by 'dryness'. We won't use that word; we will now just talk about dryness. We'll give a few crackers, a few dollars, to an area somewhere over in Western Australia, and we'll do a trial to prove that this is a permanent situation. We no longer have droughts; we now have permanent dryness.' That was the Labor government's attempt at any sort of drought policy.


I might remind the member for Hunter that we've spent $1.8 billion on this drought, and one of the reasons—if he had any understanding of agriculture at all he would know this—our farmers are doing so well is that they managed to get into this drought with better water systems. They were able to get the tax advantages and they managed to use the water infrastructure fund to improve the water supply. They had grain storages put up because of the tax incentives to do so, and they were able to manage their larger properties because of the GABSI program where the drains were replaced with piping and capping, enabling management of their pasture for a much longer time.


People in regional Australia have understood, over the last five years, what it's like to have a government and members that understand their needs. That's why they're seeing the rollout of the Inland Rail. That's why we're seeing, as we speak, contracts that have been let and rail lying along the side of the corridor between Parkes and Narromine, ready to be laid. There will be a corridor of commerce that will go all the way from Melbourne to Brisbane. It will not only improve the efficiency of road transport but also enable exporters from regional Australia to have better access to ports at a cheaper rate of freight. Within a year or two, in 2020, we'll see the Pacific Highway completed, largely because of a deal that was done by Warren Truss to fund 80 per cent of that from the Commonwealth. We've just seen the announcement of the funding of the Coffs Harbour bypass and, Mr Deputy Speaker, the magnificent infrastructure in your electorate—that magnificent bridge over the Clarence River at Yamba. Funding from the Commonwealth government enabled that to happen.


The members opposite don't really understand what makes regional Australia. I can tell you: it's the people. We don't believe in just patronising people and throwing them on welfare. That's their method. Our method is to actually encourage our young people. Through the Clontarf Foundation we've now got excellent attendance at school. Last year, the graduation of Aboriginal students at Dubbo Senior College was 58, the largest number in any school anywhere in Australia. I went to that graduation. Those young men and women were going into employment; they were going into further education; they were going into training; some of them were going into the Army—because they were encouraged to stay at school through a program that does not patronise those people but gives them encouragement.


Unemployment in my electorate had the third-biggest drop anywhere in Australia. Half of New South Wales—3.8 per cent. The unemployment in Dubbo was 2.2 per cent. The member for Calare was here, and the member for Hunter gave him a bouquet, talking about how wonderful the unemployment rate was in his electorate in Orange.


This government has opened up trade agreements where the Labor Party feared to tread. We've seen FTAs with Japan, China and Korea, which have opened up great trade possibilities for exporters right across the nation, particularly in regional Australia. Just yesterday, through this place, there was the TPP-11, the gold-standard trade agreement across the Pacific region, 11 nations competing on a level playing field of trade which will give enormous opportunities for our exporters. The Labor Party believed it wasn't possible. They thought it was a ridiculous notion to pursue that. We're also seeing an FTA about to be ratified with Peru. I've recently been in Singapore undertaking negotiations on behalf of this country for the RCEP trading group. We are commencing our negotiations with the EU. We understand that.


We've funded the Building Better Regions Fund. In Bourke, in my electorate, we've got an abattoir now that will employ up to 300 local people and harvest the feral goat population that is ever-present in western New South Wales, creating permanent jobs in that western part of New South Wales and export income for Australia through targeted, sensible investment in regional towns.


Those opposite like to take the high moral ground with renewable energy and climate change. I defy any of those people to have a greater example than the Parkes electorate. There are the large-scale solar farms at Nyngan, Broken Hill and Moree; a wind farm at Silverton and another one going up at Coolah; and the highest uptake of individual solar by households right across my electorate, including Dubbo. Farmers are investing in water infrastructure that's generated by solar electricity. Just recently I saw an irrigation pump that was powered by a hectare of solar panels. That farmer got some assistance from the state government, but with the new legislation that went through a month ago he'll be able to write that off his tax in one year. Changes we've made, which came through this House in the last sitting period, allow instant write-off for grain storages, hay, fencing and water.


We're seeing a massive amount of investment because on this side we understand regional Australia. We don't go out with platitudes; we don't buy the RMs and the big hat and go out and speak slowly so the poor folks in the country can understand us, as I've seen in the past. We understand the people we represent. We understand that working Australians are the heart of this nation and we support them, unlike those opposite, who have been captured by the latte-sipping set from the leafy suburbs of the capital cities. They come in here and have the hide to bring up a matter of public importance as puerile as this one. You'd think the member for Hunter might come up with something more original. It seems we have a bit of deja vu all over again, every couple of weeks. (Time expired)

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (15:39):  There are 12 sitting days for this parliament between now and Christmas, and, instead of coming up with a plan to deal with the issues that are confronting people in regional Australia, the best thing that this proud National Party can do is go to war with themselves. You know that they're in strife when the most productive thing they've got to say is about us. They've been given all this time to talk about their plans for regional Australia and the best thing they can do is to attack us. No wonder they are in such strife!


There is a reason why they don't have a plan for regional Australia: they've had three Prime Ministers, three Treasurers, three Deputy Prime Ministers and, I kid you not, since the last election to today they have had four ministers for regional development. Is it any wonder that they haven't got a clue when it comes to the issues facing people in regional Australia? Is it any wonder that they can spend 18 months trumpeting a decentralisation plan? Eighteen months ago they heralded, with great fanfare, that they had a plan to decentralise government work from Canberra, to send it out to the regions. Well, we waited with bated breath. We were told there was a hard deadline in December last year. We thought there were going to be some big announcements coming, along with Santa Claus, but there were no announcements and no decentralisation.


Then, with great fanfare, on budget night we saw the Deputy Prime Minister issue his famous press release saying, 'Decentralisation in our time'. But if you looked at the numbers, there were 100 jobs decentralised. And, if you looked at the fine print, 80 of those 100 jobs involved moving workers from one capital city to another capital city! Our favourite was the 34 jobs that moved from Sydney to far west Parramatta! This was their decentralisation plan. Is it any wonder that these guys are starting to ask questions of themselves?


I was pleased to see the member for Capricornia starting to ask some questions of her side today as well. This is the one who is welcoming Barnaby back with great hope. While she's doing the numbers on their own backbench, she might start looking at doing some numbers on decentralisation in her own electorate. While she's been here in Canberra and in other places around the country, talking about their great initiative in decentralisation, under her watch—under her government—we've seen 50 Public Service jobs ripped out of her electorate. That's what National Party-style decentralisation gives to you.


If it were just decentralisation and if that were the level of hypocrisy and carnage, you'd say, 'Fair go, these guys are dealing with a drought.' And the drought is having devastating effects throughout eastern Australia, there is no doubt about that. But it's the ideas drought on their side of the chamber that is having the most impact. I was pleased to hear the minister talk about telecommunications. These guys have had 18 plans in 13 years and still could not deliver a broadband plan for regional Australia. I've got to say that it takes a lot of genius to say, 'We'll only spend $36 billion on the NBN'—their fibre-to-the-node second-rate NBN—and then have to fess up and say, 'We've actually spent $50 billion,' only to deliver a service which is no better than that which they replaced. Is it any wonder that NBN complaints have gone through the roof under this mob here, with a 53 per cent increase?



Mr Coulton interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I hear the minister complaining. They bagged it, they voted against it—year after year after year—and now they're putting press releases out saying, 'Thanks to us you've got the NBN!' These guys are the champions with the jam tin on a string. If we were to leave it to them, that would be the broadband connection that people in country Australia would get. Under their watch, complaints in the telecommunications sector are at four times the level that they are in the financial services sector, and we got a royal commission in the banking and financial sector. These guys reckon that business as usual is okay and that they're going very, very well. (Time expired)

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-10-18,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (15:44):  Labor does have a plan. It's the same plan they had last time. It's a plan to tax more. It's a plan to spend less in the regions. It's a plan to make life harder for regional Australia. I know this plan. I know this plan because the people I represent remember this plan. They used this plan last time. Come on, member for Hunter, I'd hoped you'd come up with something original.


Let's reflect on the plan last time Labor were in power. There was massive uncertainty under water. Remember those public meetings? Thousands of people turned up. They pulled out water infrastructure. When Senator Penny Wong was water minister, she said that not only is there no future in this block, you have to pull up the water infrastructure from that block and shut it down for five years. Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? Those blocks that were shut down by Penny Wong for having no future are now getting replanted in my patch. That was their plan. Wait, there was another plan they had: shut down live exports. That was by former Prime Minister Gillard, which offended our markets. The one thing about markets is you have to give guarantee of supply, and we shut those down. They locked up infrastructure. There was no delivery on water by the member for Watson. I remember walking around this place as president of the Victorian Farmers Federation, trying to get them to commit to the Sunraysia Modernisation Project. They wouldn't do it. You know what, it's built. It was committed to by us and built by us. We remember your plan, Labor, and your plan isn't so original, I've got to say. Your plan is the same old plan: tax more, spend less in the regions and make life harder for regional Australia.


I just want to touch on our plan. Our plan has been one of delivery. We have free trade agreements with China, Japan, Korea, Peru, Indonesia, and Trans-Pacific Partnership 11. We're opening up markets everywhere. If you opposite got in power, we know what you'd do: you'd shut those down. We're investing in rail and investing in airports. There's the $20,000 instant tax write-off, which actually helps small business and actually helps to stimulate the retailers. Six hundred mobile phone towers were turned on. That is our plan.


Labor still has the same plan in Victoria. I'm pleased to be given the opportunity now to compare what's going on in Victoria in the lead-up to the election. Did you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in a number of days the Victorian Labor government will go into caretaker mode. You would think that they would be having a bit of a dip if they wanted to deliver for regional Victoria. I happen to represent 36 per cent of the state—the best part of the state. The National Party, in that 36 per cent, in the lead-up to this election, have committed $10 million for sporting facilities in Mildura, renewal of passenger rail to Mildura and Horsham, a 32-bed extension of the Mildura hospital, a $44 million new hospital in Swan Hill, a $7 million drug rehab centre and an $80 million rail upgrade. You would think at least one of those would get a 'Me too!' from the Victorian Labor government if they wanted to get re-elected. Not one is—no sports stadium, no passenger rail for regional areas, no 32-bed extension for the Mildura hospital, no $44 million new hospital in Swan Hill, no $7 million drug rehab centre and no $80 million rail upgrade.


I want to tell you something else about a plan. I came to this place five years ago and I said, 'I want to see a radiation treatment bunker for Mildura.' A few days ago it was committed to. The federal government has backed this. What we need to see from the Victorian government is the ability to allow public patients to use that, to come on board. They go into caretaker mode in less than a week, but have they come on board? No. No plan for regional Australia.


I see they have gone all quiet on that side. That's because when you put it all down on paper and lay it all out, there are millions and millions of dollars in regional Australia that have been delivered by the National Party, but not even an attempt by the state Labor government to match it, and not even an attempt to match it by the Labor Party in this place. The shadow minister for agriculture wants to be the man, but he isn't muscling up to the task. He's had all that time in opposition, and all he's got to present to this parliament is the same Labor plan, which is a plan to tax more, a plan to spend less in regional Australia and a plan to make life very difficult for the people who live in regional Australia.

 (Braddon) (15:49):  I'll just remind the chamber that the member for Mallee last year was the only government MP not to put his name to a dissenting report rejecting a parliamentary paper criticising the NBN. He said he believes some of the complaints about this rollout have some merits. I think that goes to show that, while the previous government speaker was going on about how wonderful the NBN has been under this government, the member for Mallee seems not to completely agree with this statement.


I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI. As a member who lives in a regional and rural part of this country, in Tasmania—the majority of Tasmania is actually regional—I don't see why those opposite can say we don't care about ourselves, really.


You have to look at what's going on opposite. We've had three Prime Ministers and two Deputy Prime Ministers with maybe another one coming back again. Chaos and dysfunction are the hallmarks of this government. Today the chaos and dysfunction continues, and, if it weren't so funny, it would be quite sad. Actually, I do feel quite saddened by what is going on. The muppet show is now performing in New England and Wagga Wagga, Statler and Waldorf going toe to toe—or is Grover from Maranoa getting ready to make his move? While this muppet show goes on, as people jockey for position, it's the people of regional Australia who are getting left behind, and this is why I'm feeling very sad about what is happening to the state of affairs in this government.


In my state and my electorate there has been nothing but a litany of failure: cuts to our local university campus; cuts to our schools, our hospitals, our TAFE; axing of visiting medical specialist services; and a failure to deliver the mobile phone blackspot program where it is actually needed. The rolling out of a second-rate NBN to our two biggest cities, Burnie and Devonport, has put our region at a competitive disadvantage. Thank you very, very much! This government wanted to put the west coast of Tasmania, which is mineral rich—you used to have to send files on discs to Mineral Resources Tasmania—on satellite. Those mining companies couldn't even operate on satellite. It took the community to stand up and push back, and they finally have the 'wonderful' fibre to the node, which is not what they were after but is what they got. The government was bizarrely replacing old copper with new copper in a place like the west coast, which has some of the highest rainfall in the country.


That's right: the only funding this government has delivered is what the former Labor government had in its forward estimates for mobile phone towers.



Government members interjecting—




Ms KEAY:
  Oh, is that laughter over there? Yes, it is quite ridiculous, isn't it? Even today the government have not allocated one extra cent for the next tranche of Tasmanian irrigation projects. There has been inaction since the dairy crisis of 2016, when I did ask the then agriculture minister to come to Tasmania and speak to my dairy farmers and he refused. They have failed to secure export protocols for our blueberries into China, overseeing an agriculture labour shortage, with the only solution being a thought bubble developed with no consultation.


I just want to go to this labour shortage and their thought bubble about getting people who are on benefits into the agriculture sector. If you ever needed evidence that the government have lost the plot, look no further than this thought bubble, which is full of hot air. It's like a brain fart, really. It's their very simplistic solution to a complex problem. In my state, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association does not support this thought bubble. Neither does the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and neither does the Tasmanian Council of Social Service. It's unique when you can't even get the farmers to agree with a solution with that side of the House, who say they're all about regional Australia and farmers. Who did they actually consult on this idea? I think it was—I don't know; was it their own backsides? I'm not sure. But no-one actually supports this thought bubble.


Who's going to pay for the accommodation of these workers, who have to go to rural parts of the country? Where are they going to stay? How are they going to get there? Some of these people don't have cars, and many of these people are in my electorate. The farms are in my electorate, and did they even bother to speak to the farmers there? No. But I have. They know that that is not the solution to this issue at all. This is another policy failure from a government that have lost touch with the regions. The muppet show rolls on, but our regions need people who will stand up for them, and that is the Labor Party.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (15:54):  I do wonder what the member for Braddon was consuming before she came into the chamber, because some of the things she said were quite outrageous, particularly about the NBN. I know you haven't been around that long, Member for Braddon, but if you read your history you will find that the Howard government actually put $2 billion into a telecommunications fund for the future of the rural telecommunications industry. It was the very first thing that Kevin Rudd hoovered up to build his NBN, which he said he would build for $4.5 billion. I might point out that for the mining communities on the western side of Tasmania your side of politics proposed that it be delivered by satellite. We have done exactly the same on that front.


The coalition believes in regional Australia and that's why we provide good policy. Since the change of government in 2013, I can tell you that I have noticed a difference of the first order in my electorate—whether it be the significant steps taken very quickly by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to make sure that the steel industry survived in Whyalla. It is a very important industry. We have a new owner and we are going to knock the spots off that place, and the government stands ready to help Sandhu Gupta with his vision in Whyalla. Or whether it be the duplication of the Joy Baluch AM Bridge in Port Augusta, something I'm sure you know about, Deputy Speaker Hogan, because that's exactly where you come from. The $200 billion that will fix up this bottleneck and safety valve for Port Augusta comes from this government. The dual lanes straight through the middle of Port Wakefield and the overpass on the northern side show that this government has an absolute vision for those who live in the country. The Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, the $20 million that went into the Upper Spencer Gulf as a depressed region—we are backing businesses to employ more people and grow their businesses. There is the BBRF, the Building Better Regions Fund, which has contributed more than $40 million into my electorate and there is the Mobile Black Spot Program. The mobile black spots were raised by the other side of the chamber—they said it was their money that built it. Good grief, give me a break! Not one mobile phone tower was delivered by that side of the chamber when they were in government for six years. We have put $120 million into that project and we'll deliver over 800 new towers.


I'm very proud to say that I was a farmer before I came into this place. It is in agriculture, the underlying industry that finances regional Australia, that I think the government has done some of its finest work. We had the ag white paper and we have doubled the FMDs. Incidentally, the Farm Management Deposits were instigated by the Howard government. We've doubled the limits. We have brought the banks on board to allow offset against farm loans. We've accelerated the deductibility on water, fodder and new fencing. Let me tell you a story about fodder. We're pretty short of fodder at the moment and I know some farmers who invested in a big way to store a lot of hay. They have sold a lot of the hay and made a lot of money and the farmer said to me the other day, 'Do you know what we're going to do? Next time we get a good season we're going to use the money we made out of that lot to build more sheds and store more hay for the next drought.' That's what good policy delivers: good decisions on the ground. We've had the $20,000 instant tax write-off and the FTAs with China, South Korea and Japan. It's cleaned up the wine backlog—the wine glut. We've cleaned out those stocks, and the wine industry is once again soaring high. That's a very good thing for South Australia.


We've moved well on drought. We have farm household support and the then Prime Minister announced that we would have $12,000 per farming couple as a cash bonus over the next 12 months. We've delivered extra money to allow people to apply for farm household support. We've got the drought concessional loans. We've got the farm finance concessional loans. We've put extra money into support for mental health for farmers who are under pressure at the moment. Because the members of parliament on this side of the chamber represent the vast bulk of regional Australia, we understand regional Australia. That's why we deliver good policy for regional Australia. That's why we have delivered great outcomes. I have really noticed what the last five years have been like compared with the six years before that. There has been a vast improvement.

"Swanson, Meryl, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (15:59):  At a time when people in the bush are looking for stability, the member for New England follows in the footsteps of his friend and colleague the member for Warringah, providing only doubt and destabilisation. We all heard his recent comments in the media almost daring his fellow National Party members to offer him his old job back—'Come on, I'm up for it; I'd be good.' I looked at him today when he was standing in the chamber to answer the question posed by the member for Hunter. You could see it was almost like a job interview—a role-play for: 'If you had me back, this is how great I can be. Look at what you're missing. Come on, give me a second chance.' Will they give him a second chance? That is the big question. To be frank with you, what a joke. Their constituencies deserve better. Some of the poorest areas in our country are so sadly represented by people who are, quite frankly, just prepared to accept any sort of crumb of leadership.


Let's talk about the many failings of the Liberal-National coalition when it comes to rural and regional Australia. There are the cuts to school funding. They might talk about 'record money being spent'—well, of course the population goes up and the funding goes up, but that just goes up by way of people being born. The higher the population, the more kids there are going to school. It's not actually about real increases to funding for education. And, as was mentioned before, every cut to schools impacts regional and rural schools far more than their city cousins.


Cuts to hospital funding and freezes to the Medicare rebate hurt people in the regional and rural areas far more than people in the cities. We already know there are people with a major health condition, such as cancer, for example. We all know plenty of people who are trying to battle that insidious disease. Well, those living in regional and rural areas have poorer survival rates than those living in the major cities. The further patients living with cancer are from the major cities, the more likely they are to die within five years of contracting cancer. That's totally unacceptable. How can this government continue to navel-gaze when the people of the bush, quite truthfully, are dying from a preventable disease? It's far more serious than the charades put forward in this place.


Of course, the other big white elephant in the room is the NBN. We hear them joking about, 'When you had it, there were no complaints.' We thought of it, we rolled it out, and we would have administered it at a far higher standard than anyone in this joke of a government has ever done. It is the greatest infrastructure project this nation has seen in many decades.


While we're talking about infrastructure: I was privileged to be the deputy chair of a joint select committee put up to look at decentralisation and regional development. I can tell you that we travelled the country, and people from the regions were begging for decent infrastructure. Local government organisations were coming, looking not only for cash but also for creative ideas from a good government to really put some energy and some employment back in the region. Sadly, they are begging for that. Quite interestingly, I can't help but note that, in my tenure as deputy chair, I saw three chairs come through that committee. They were being promoted, demoted and moved all about this unstable government at a rapid rate. One of the most interesting points I did note from that was—if you remember back to April 2017—a dictum put forth from the then minister for regional Australia, Fiona Nash. She said that she was writing to every department to ask why they shouldn't decentralise and that they were going to have to respond by August. Well, 12 months has gone by since that—




Ms O'Toole:
  Which August?




Ms SWANSON:
  Yes, which August? I take that creative interjection from my friend and colleague the member for Herbert. I daresay August will come and go into the future, and that letter will never be responded to.


I'll tell you what: it is a great travesty to treat our regions with such disrespect. People from the bush and people from the regions are some of the hardest working, most decent, most generous and most caring people. They're looking for good representation. They want to see our country go forward. They want to see their kids do well. They want to see them go to well-funded schools. They want to be able to go to a hospital and not sit in emergency for five hours plus. In fact, someone said to me last week: 'Meryl, my father-in-law went to hospital. He'd had a stroke. There was one doctor for 800 people, and now the thing that has happened to him has irrevocably changed his life.' That's because, as we all know, with stroke victims, you need to have very, very prompt attention. Well, that wasn't coming. That was in a big hospital. The government are a joke. They are not delivering the leadership that we need and deserve in our regions.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2018-10-18,"



Mrs MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (16:04):  I think I'm the only dairy farmer from a rural and regional area in this chamber. I'm very, very proud to represent my part of the world, and I'm very proud of being an actual, active dairy farmer. For those opposite: to understand rural and regional Australia, how about you walk a mile in my shoes as a dairy farmer for a start, before you start making comments about what leadership really is?


I want to talk about how proud I am of what we've done as a government in this space. But first I will take you back to look at the simple things that matter most and to look at something that the previous government did. One of the first things that the then Minister for Education, Julia Gillard, did as part of the Labor government was to make significant changes to youth allowance. Any genuine rural and regional member in this place understands how important access to youth allowance and support is for young people who have no choice but to leave their small rural and regional community to go away to study. But the Labor government at the time made significant changes to youth allowance, which meant that young people in my part of the world could not get youth allowance at all. Labor deemed them to be in an 'inner regional' area, and, if you were in an 'inner regional' area, you weren't allowed to go to university—you weren't allowed to get independent youth allowance; you weren't allowed to go and have the same opportunities as someone in a city environment.


The then Labor government made changes to youth allowance to the point where young people were desperate. There were hundreds of young people and their families who came to me. I moved a private member's motion on it and took a consistent approach, a persistent approach, to what Labor did. Frequently, in the supermarket, a mum and a dad or a family would come up to me to say, 'Do you understand just what this is doing to our children and the future of children in rural and regional Australia?'


When you talk about leadership, why not talk about the leaders of the future and their education? But Labor made a major change to youth allowance which actually stopped young people from my part of the world going on to university. I had a mum who said to me, 'I've actually got five kids, and they are great kids; the five of them want to be GPs, but I can only afford to send one to university under these new rules.' How do you think she felt about that? But Labor didn't care about that at all. Labor did not care about the opportunities for rural and regional students.


The members sitting opposite were not here at that time and did not see what it did to rural and regional students. It was absolutely horrendous, and you should hang your heads in shame over that, because it took a private member's motion in here to start to bring the then Labor government to its senses. It was okay to say that young people in rural and regional areas weren't able to access youth allowance! Obviously, you in rural and regional areas don't understand how critical this is.


We've made significant changes that have allowed increased numbers of young people to actually pursue their dreams and go on to university and then to come back to rural and regional areas in time. And I'm very proud of that.


But the damage was done. There were young people who actually changed plans, who said to me: 'I'm not even saying to my mum or dad—or my teachers—that I actually want to go on to university, because I know they can't afford it. So I'm taking another pathway and going into work.' They were the decisions that they made—life-changing decisions. That is what leadership is actually about in here: it's about making good decisions about young people, especially about their education.


I also want to talk briefly about our investment in mobile blackspot towers. When an anaesthetist who lives in Ferguson Valley had to park his car on a hill to be able to get calls, when he was on call, from the local hospital, you know there's a problem. But of course Labor didn't invest one dollar in mobile blackspots. And we have. When I look at the difference that that has made, right around my electorate, to that anaesthetist and then to the health care that's being provided to people in my electorate, I am very, very proud of this program. But I have no doubt that this was not a program that was supported by Labor then, and, if you're talking about regional leadership, this is a core part of it.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (16:09):  I thank the member for Hunter for bringing forward this very important MPI, because it gives me an opportunity to read off a litany of evidence that shows very clearly that this government hasn't got a clue about regional Queensland, especially Townsville. Townsville's unemployment rate has almost doubled under the LNP, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. When Labor left federal government in 2013, our unemployment rate was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double the national average. Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in manufacturing. But under the Abbott and Turnbull governments manufacturing nosedived, with job losses of 3,000. 


In Herbert the number of apprentices and trainees has almost halved, 46 per cent in fact, since the LNP took office. That's 1,557 fewer apprentices and trainees because of the LNP's $3 billion cut to TAFE. And now Townsville is experiencing massive shortages of skilled tradespeople. The LNP's changes to early learning will mean that 2,484 families in Townsville will be worse off to the tune of more than $2,000.


The LNP's Medicare freeze has hurt Townsville badly. The LNP's freeze is forcing out-of-pocket medical expenses to rise and therefore forcing fewer people to see GPs. The high cost of medical services has stopped seven per cent of North Queenslanders accessing health care when needed in the past year. Six point five per cent of people in the north over the age of 15 have reported delaying or not going to a specialist, GP, imaging or pathology service between 2016 and 2017 due to cost. The northern Queensland region had the 10th highest rate of people delaying medical care due to the cost in that 12-month period. The median out-of-pocket cost in the year was $142 per patient. This is not the fault of GPs. It is the LNP government's fault. The researchers named the LNP policy causing the detrimental effects, finding the variation in the amounts patients spend out of pocket on health services was influenced by factors such as availability of bulk-billed services and non-hospital primary and specialist services subsidised by Medicare. The Medicare freeze has negatively impacted Queenslanders more than overall patients in metropolitan areas, who are less likely to have out-of-pocket costs than their relatives in regional areas.


What has the freeze led to? More people being admitted to hospital. Recent reports show that in the Townsville hospital the emergency department is treating an average of 55 people per day for minor ailments that they should be having seen to at the GP clinic. Twenty-six per cent of patients—that's 6,475 people over the last six months—are presenting at the Townsville hospital with minor ailments like coughs and colds, all because this out-of-touch LNP government would rather give tax handouts to big business and the big banks, as opposed to funding our hospitals. That is a disgraceful list of priorities. The cuts to health don't stop there. The architect of the health cuts has also cut $9 million from the Townsville hospital. That's on top of the Medicare freeze. What does that mean for our regional hospitals? It means a loss of four beds, 12 fewer doctors and 25 fewer nurses.


But the LNP's demolition of regional Queensland doesn't stop at health. There are cuts to our universities. The architect of the cuts, former Treasurer now Prime Minister Scott Morrison, signed off on $38 million of cuts to Central Queensland University. He signed off on $36 million of cuts to James Cook University. These cuts have seen Townsville's 14 JCU staff lose their jobs and the loss of an arts degree.


Then there are the LNP cuts to the National Partnership on Remote Housing. This has seen seven jobs lost on Palm Island and some of those apprenticeships. In fact, they have entirely cut this program from Queensland because the LNP doesn't understand remote Queensland at all. The LNP Morrison government does not work for regional Queenslanders. They work for their banking and big business mates in Sydney.


Only Labor will fund hospitals. Only Labor will fund our schools. Only Labor will fund TAFE and universities. It will only ever be Labor that will get Townsville back on track, delivering jobs and apprenticeships and providing the infrastructure that we need to kick off our economy.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer—Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories) (16:14):  It's awful to be in this place and listen to that long, miserable diatribe from the opposition. If anyone tuned in to get a sense of what's really going on in regional Australia, all they would hear is this long, tedious, miserable series of negative statements. Member for Hunter, you've got to gee them up. You've got to generate some enthusiasm among your troops for what it's like to live, work and raise a family in rural and regional Australia, because the government members who actually do those things—and I've got many in the House with me today—celebrate the good. You will understand that very well, Deputy Speaker Hogan, given your location on the northern New South Wales coast. The member for Capricornia is sitting at the table. Frequently I meet with people in her shires, and what they paint for me is a picture of growing optimism, growing infrastructure and growing confidence. I don't think that would exist if those opposite were sitting here on the treasury bench.


On the weekend, typically for me, I travelled to celebrate a million-dollar investment in Yarrawonga Manufactured Housing. Under a massive cover in a small town on the Murray, we are building cabin-style accommodation, temporary affordable housing, that can be transported all around the country: to remote communities, to Indigenous communities, to lifestyle villages. It's all happening there. We're seeing investment in trades and in training, and the young people coming to town talk to me about the confidence they have in this government. It's the reason they feel they can move their families there—cue our decentralisation agenda!


Then I went through some outback country, towards Hay, to talk to farmers, and of course we talked about the drought. But they are there for the long term and they love where they live. I then went to a salami festival in a place called Euston, quite close to Mildura, where we celebrated the diversity of the Italian culture that's made that region so special. There were lots of different salamis there! But there were also lots of markets. There were people selling beer and gin. In fact, there was somebody who has one of those boutique gin distilleries in Mildura, in the member for Mallee's electorate. He was in a Hawaiian shirt, with a bowler hat, riding around on a trike and handing out some very nice gin. That's small business. He has the confidence to do what he's doing and know that this government will back him.


The government deliver for every single rural and regional Australian through our rural and regional members. We are rolling out a $75 billion 10-year program of investment, and one of the biggest infrastructure investments is the $8 billion Inland Rail. If you're someone who lives on the eastern seaboard, you might not see the relevance of this, important though your local commute to work is. But if you live in my electorate—and much of eastern Australia—you know the government has its eye on the future, because we will have an effective rail corridor running between Melbourne and Brisbane, through our regions, with good branch rail networks so we can deliver our produce to that network to go to the port of Brisbane, the port of Melbourne and in between.


As I said: small business. We've put in place the lowest tax rate in 78 years. Millions of small and medium-sized businesses across Australia, 20,000 in my electorate alone, will pay less tax five years sooner with new laws fast-tracking tax relief for the sector passing the parliament today. We've extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Over 4,000 businesses in the electorate of Farrer are taking advantage of this, and my region is no exception.


Communications? Yes, we can do more. I'd love to see more. I'm at the front line demanding more, as are all my rural and regional colleagues. But we remember the six years when Labor was in power. We didn't have a single mobile phone station anywhere for a whole six years. We've got a lot of catching up to do. We're getting there.


If you want to represent the regions, you have to live in the regions. I'm not saying I take a single vote for granted in my electorate of Farrer, and I know my colleagues don't in their electorates. If you don't know your rural and regional member of parliament—who they are, their face, their reputation—and don't have a sense of what they do then that member of parliament probably isn't doing a good job. You know you can't get away with it in regional Australia. That's why we work so hard: because we love what we do; we love the people we represent. We don't need the negativity that comes piling on with the pure political opportunism that we've heard in the debate on this motion. It's late on a Thursday afternoon and it's all about how awful it is in regional Australia. That would be the take-home message from anyone listening this afternoon. It's not our message.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:30):  I rise today to talk about JDRF being at the forefront of investigating type 1 diabetes research. They have been a great advocate in finding a cure and promoting prevention and treatment for those with type 1 diabetes. In my electorate of Lindsay, 1,129 people live with type 1 diabetes, and JDRF does great work advocating on behalf of those people and 120,000 other type 1 diabetics across Australia each and every day. This number, sadly, keeps growing, and that's why it's vital to find a cure for this autoimmune disease.


I'm very proud to see the progress made under the Australian Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network, developed from an initial $5 million investment by the then Labor government in 2010. The funding for the CRN will be fully expended by June 2019. The CRN is an incredible tool for Australian scientists to lead the way on medical research for type 1 diabetes. Its continued impact is vital to paving a way for a cure. That's why the JDRF is advocating for phase 3 of the network, which will ensure enduring change for type 1 diabetics in Lindsay and also across the country.


In my electorate, this was brought to my attention by the wonderful Emma Hogan. I met Emma and her mum, Judy, for the first time in 2014. She's a young, proud JDRF advocate, and her dedication has inspired me to be a firm supporter of finding a cure and improving the lives of all type 1 diabetics and their families. Emma was diagnosed with diabetes in 2009, when she was just seven years old. She's now 16 and learning how to drive and do those other things teenagers like to terrorise us with. She can never, though, be carefree or laid back like my 16-year-old daughter, because her mind is always racing, asking the questions: 'What are my sugar levels at?' 'Have I calculated enough insulin to eat my lunch?' Twenty thousand finger pricks over her lifetime, and Emma is still no closer to being able to let go and relax like most teenagers should be able to.


Life is, though, getting easier for type 1 diabetics, and it's only through the work of advocates like Emma and her peers that that can happen. We now have insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring—or CGMs, as they like to call them—and better day-to-day technology that has made and will continue to make their lives easier. But there is no rest until we find a cure for this lifelong disease.


JDRF needs $50 million to fund the next phase of the clinical research network to expand its research, start more clinical trials and ultimately find a cure that all of us are so desperate to have. Without the funding, the CRN will be unable to keep up their incredible work across the 65 institutions and 250 researchers that are trying to progress this research to the next vital stage, which will unlock a cure and new treatments for type 1 diabetics. A new funding commitment is needed now because in-depth and comprehensive research, as we know, holds the key to most things.


But JDRF is more than just funding for research. It fosters a sense of community for the type 1 diabetic sufferers and their families through the programs such as the JDRF Peer Support Program, an incredible service run by volunteers that connects those affected by type 1 diabetes. It gives support, guidance and hope to those affected that they are not alone in the day-to-day struggles of understanding and managing their conditions.


Most important, though, are the friendships and the hopes shared at incredible events like the JDRF One Walk. I was pleased to be at the one that was hosted last year. I didn't get to participate in the walk, because I took my kids and one of them ended up passing out and was quite unwell. But it was great to be there, and the wave of support was incredible. But this year I don't have to travel far and go into Homebush for the walk, because Emma Hogan and her mum, Judy, are hosting the first-ever JDRF One Walk in Penrith this Sunday. I'll be very proud to support Emma and the amazing work she has done, and to be in attendance at Jamison Park with hundreds of others from around our electorate to see the incredible work they've put into bringing the type 1 community together and making the rest of our community more aware of their journeys.


I just want to say thank you to Emma and Judy for their long-term dedication and commitment to turning type 1 into type none. The JDRF One Walk will bring together the core of JDRF's message: funding for medical research and fostering community.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (10:00):  Recently, I hosted a Fowler Labor for Aid forum, with the aim of promoting productive discussion on Australia's current foreign aid contribution. Notable speakers for the night were: Sabrin Farooqui, a Western Sydney Labor for Aid representative; Wayne Gum and Joy Kyriacou, from Oxfam; as well as Kate Lee from APHEDA. It was extremely encouraging to see so many people from my electorate turn up to this function and express their concerns about Australia's current contributions to assisting developing countries as well as the strategies employed by the current government. They all believe that we can be doing more. My electorate in Fowler, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, is one of the most diverse and multicultural in the whole of Australia. Therefore, it's only fair, I think, that electorates like mine are concerned about the significant drop in our foreign aid contribution. 


In an ordinarily difficult field of work, organisations such as Oxfam and APHEDA must cooperate with foreign governments and organisations, overseas unions et cetera to ensure that the money allocated to foreign aid is being spent properly and productively. This has been made more difficult as a result of the current Liberal government's lack of generosity to underdeveloped countries. Australia has committed to ending extreme poverty by 2030, a commitment that was made together with the international community to help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the current Liberal government has shown that it does not take this commitment seriously, as it has slashed $11.3 billion from our overseas international development assistance budget.


At the forum, it was highlighted by both Wayne and Kate that Australia's current aid contribution amounts to 0.22 per cent of our gross national income—a figure that is far too low in comparison with our global commitment to reach the UN spending target of 0.7 per cent. As a generous and caring nation, with our provision of international development assistance, it is crucial that our foreign policy remains consistent with Australia's values and our national interest. The discussion that took place at the Labor For Aid forum made one thing clear: when it comes to helping those in need across the globe, we can and must do better.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:00):  I rise to pay tribute to a great Australian, Mr Ian Kiernan AO. Mr Kiernan was born in Sydney on Friday, 4 October 1940. He was educated at the Scots College in Sydney, The Armidale School in northern New South Wales and the Sydney Technical College. Ian went on to join the construction industry. He specialised in historic restorations. Throughout his life, Ian was a passionate yachtsman, sailing competitively for more than four decades. In 1986-87, Ian represented Australia in the BOC Challenge, a solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished sixth out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 different nations. He set during that journey an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world. His yacht was named Spirit of Sydney.


It was during this race that Ian Kiernan saw the amount of rubbish which was choking the world's oceans. After he returned to Sydney, he organised a community event which began with just the support of a few friends: Clean Up Sydney Harbour on Sunday, 8 January 1989. When I say 'just a few of his friends', 40,000 volunteers showed up. Ian was a guy who, when you met him, was charismatic. He was warm, he was engaging and he was a leader of men and women. He was a leader of his community. That day, they collected 5,000 tonnes of rubbish. Based on the success of this event, Clean Up Australia Day took place the following year. It has since then taken place on the first Sunday of March every year, with more than 300,000 Australians volunteering their time to make a difference to their local environment. In my electorate of Grayndler, every year, the big clean-up day usually focuses on Cooks River. Now, with the expansion of my electorate to the north, Sydney Harbour is also a focus—around Balmain, White Bay and the foreshores of the harbour.


In 1991, Ian decided that, since Clean Up Sydney Harbour had moved to Clean Up Australia, he wanted to start Clean Up the World. In its first year, more than 30 million people—more than the population of Australia—from 80 countries participated. It has since grown to involve over 40 million people from 120 countries. Ian was the chair of Clean Up Australia, a national non-profit organisation that coordinates not just Clean Up Australia but also Clean Up the World. Clean Up Australia also runs Clean Up Australia projects, which are long-term community based environmental programs that address the need for ongoing care and restoration of environmental assets.


Ian was named Australian of the Year in 1994 and received numerous Australian and international awards—but he didn't ask for any of them. He was a very humble man. I was privileged to have contact with him on a number of occasions. He was someone who was very passionate about making a difference. Ian Kiernan's life shows that an individual can make a very, very big difference to their local community, the city in which they live, the nation and indeed the world. He and his wife, Judy, had two daughters, Sally and Pip, and a son, Jack. I pay my respects to all of the family members and to all those who will miss Ian Kiernan dearly.

Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (11:05):  I too want to speak today in memory of one of Australia's finest, Ian Kiernan. I think that all Australians were saddened yesterday to learn of his death from cancer at the age of 78.


Ian Kiernan is appropriately revered by Australians from all walks of life in every part of our continent, but it's fair to say that he had a special place in the hearts of residents in my own electorate of North Sydney. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, Ian was a longstanding resident of Kirribilli, in the North Sydney electorate, and was well known as one of our great local identities. But, just as importantly, Ian's great passion, which started that movement which was to become the focus of his life, began in his love and respect for Sydney Harbour and its natural environment.


As we've heard, Ian started his life as a builder. His other great passion was as a yachtsman. That passion took him around the world, particularly as a solo sailor, but it also took him on six occasions to Hobart as part of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. The experience of being a yachtsman sailing the world's great oceans and seas helped reinforce Ian's passion for our incredible marine environment, but it also helped reinforce his passion for doing something to protect that environment. During those sailing races he discovered that great scourge, even back then, which has only become worse in the period since, that is the impact of pollution and waste on our marine environment. When he returned to Sydney after one of those races, he was determined not simply to sit by and wonder idly whether something could be done. He determined that something would be done, and he would help lead the movement to do that. In 1989 he started that process with what was meant to be a small event about protecting and improving the beaches around his own then suburb of Mosman, so he planned a 'clean-up Mosman' day. But such was the enthusiasm of Sydneysiders for this initiative that it quickly became apparent that there wasn't enough waste even in Mosman that the 40,000 volunteers he'd amassed would be needed for. So, overnight, Clean Up Mosman became Clean Up Sydney Harbour.


Sydneysiders and all Australians were captivated by the motivation that he provided, and just a year later Clean Up Australia was born, with 40,000 volunteers. As part of that, Clean Up Australia and Ian created one of those advertising jingles that stick in the mind, like many of the greats, and 'yucky, yucky, poo' became part of the Australian lexicon. I'll spare the Federation Chamber my attempt at a rendition of it today, but needless to say it is one of those jingles that have stuck in the mind of so many Australians ever since. From 40,000 to 300,000 and then, a couple of years later, to the 30 million people who joined in Clean Up the World, which was his so-successful attempt to take his campaign global. Ian's contribution was recognised very quickly, and in 1994 he became Australian of the Year. What a fitting tribute to his work that was.


Ian's contribution was really one that changed the mindset of a generation about our individual capacity to act to protect our own environment. It's fair to say that when Ian started his crusade to reduce the impact of waste and pollution, the marine environment around Sydney in particular was different to what it is today. All of us remember vividly the campaigns to try and eliminate the discharge of raw sewage into the ocean just off our magnificent world famous beaches, and it's fair to say that litter and waste affected beaches and waterways around Sydney. In fact, it was a brave person who dived into the waters off most Sydney Harbour beaches back in those days. 


He did teach us that we could act as individuals, and he really led a people power movement to improve our environment. What Clean Up Australia—and Clean Up the World—did was remind us that our own actions, which seem small and inconsequential in isolation, when combined together can create problems but we can be part of solving those problems, as mighty as they might have seemed to Australians at the time. Ian really motivated a generation. We have seen millions of Australians join together to try and improve our environment. 


Of course, as I alluded to, the problems he identified exist today and, frankly, despite all of his efforts, have grown worse. I hope that the legacy of Ian's life is that we all renew our resolve to act both within our own borders and, more importantly, globally to try and reduce the impact of pollution, particularly plastics, on our marine environment. We know that this is a growing problem, and we know it's particularly a problem in our own region, because so much of the plastic pollution entering our oceans is doing so from nations and river systems in South-East Asia. We've seen the consequences of that on the incredible marine ecology of the oceans that border Australia—the Indian and, particularly, the Pacific. There are now estimates that by 2050 the weight of plastic pollution will exceed that of all marine life, and we know that we have an enormous task ahead of us. I hope, as we reflect on Ian's incredible life, that we do renew our commitment as Australians, and as world citizens, to make sure his goal that we tread lightly on this incredible planet of ours is one that comes to fruition.


I pay tribute to Ian Kiernan, and I particularly want to extend my condolences to his family: Judy, Sally and Pip. I know that they will have some consolation from the recognition Ian's work has been receiving over the last two days, although obviously nothing will take away from the extraordinary personal loss they are feeling this week.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:12):  This week, sadly, Australia lost an amazing human icon. We lost someone who, in the face of adversity, saw an opportunity to make a huge difference in our world. We lost a man who valued our environment. From his single-mindedness he had a huge impact on our nation and globally in terms of protecting our environment. It would be hard to imagine that there would be an Australian who hasn't participated in Clean Up Australia. If you ask anyone under the age of 28, they probably remember picking up rubbish in the schoolyard every year for Clean Up Australia Day. Certainly my children and my grandchildren are very aware of what Clean Up Australia Day means to our local community in Townsville. They have all participated in school related activities, which means they are very aware of looking after our environment. They have, as we all have, learned of the importance of valuing and looking after our local communities. Two of my grandchildren are of Norwegian descent, and they are particularly aware of getting rid of rubbish properly, and they have grown up within a recycling regime. Mr Kiernan's environmental work didn't just get thousands of schoolkids trawling the playground for plastic wrap and empty juice poppers every day; it has also had a lasting impact on how Australians view rubbish and how we care for our environment.


Ian Kiernan was born on 4 October 1940. He grew up around Sydney's harbours and beaches, where he learnt to swim, fish and sail. Educated at The Scots College and The Armidale School in northern New South Wales, he went on to work in the construction industry, specialising in historic restorations. But it was his love of sailing that led to his remarkable career as a global environmentalist, founder of Clean Up Australia and Clean Up the World campaigns.


In 1986, the then 44-year-old represented Australia in the BOC solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished sixth out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 nations, but set an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world. During his nine months at sea, Kiernan was appalled by the amount of rubbish he saw choking the world's oceans. On his return he set out to do something about it, and, with the support of his friends, organised the community event Clean Up Sydney Harbour on Sunday, 8 January 1989. It was a huge success, with more than 40,000 volunteers lending a hand. The next year, the first Clean Up Australia Day took place, with more than 300,000 Australians volunteering their time to pick up rubbish and help make a difference to the health of their local environments. In 1991, Kiernan started Clean Up the World. In its first year more than 30 million people from 80 countries participated. It has since grown to involve over 40 million people from 120 countries.


In 1994 Kiernan rushed to protect Prince Charles after a man with a starting pistol stormed the stage at an Australia Day event at Sydney's Darling Harbour. After the royal assassin was taken away the Prince continued with his role in the event and Kiernan was awarded Australian of the Year. Mr Kiernan received numerous awards recognising his dedication to end pollution and promote environmentalism. Mr Kiernan received the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1991, the United Nations Global 500 award for the environment in 1993, the Officer of the Order of Australia in 1995, the World Citizenship Award 1999 and the Centenary Medal in 2001. And although these awards are noble, the greatest award is the change that Mr Kiernan has made for the environment and in the attitudes and minds of many Australians in protecting and looking after our precious environment. The legacy he has left should be a reminder to those in this place. It is especially timely given the LNP government's rejection of the IPCC report. Although Mr Kiernan's legacy was huge, his advice was always simple:


Simple, easy actions can protect the health of our water resources and help save drinking water supplies. There is not one individual who cannot help to make a difference to the health of the environment.


I thank Mr Kiernan for his years of dedication. My thoughts are with his family: his wife, Judy, and his two daughters, Sally and Pip.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:17):  Two weeks ago I attended an event in Byron Bay in support of Asren Pugh, the Labor candidate for Ballina. There I met a remarkable man, Neville Kelly. He's a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He'd been a member for more than 50 years. I spent some time talking to Ned, as he is known. He told me a story about his involvement in politics and how he came to be engaged, particularly in areas of country New South Wales.


In 1961, Ned moved to Moree. As a member of the local health board, he was appointed by the then minister, Billy Sheehan, to the district hospital board as a director. He went around the hospital to get familiar with it and, as he thought he had seen everything in the hospital, he asked what this shed was a few hundred metres down from the hospital. He'd seen food going to and from that area. He was told that was where the Aboriginals were. The Aboriginal patients were kept in a separate area with inferior food and inferior conditions in 1961.


Ned is a very sprightly gentleman. He told me the story about how he fixed it. He got Billy Sheehan to come up as a minister to open a section of the new hospital. He told Billy Sheehan what the circumstances were in Moree, and Billy Sheehan the day before, of course, said that he would come on the condition that everyone was treated equally. From that day of the minister's visit, segregation ended. But it didn't end in other parts of the Moree area, and this wasn't unfamiliar in other parts of Australia as well.


The Moree Plains Shire Council had carried a resolution in 1955, and that resolution said:


That no person being a full blooded or half cast aboriginal of Australia, or being person apparently having a mixture of aboriginal blood, shall use, occupy or be present in or upon, or be allowed or be permitted or invited to use, occupy or be present upon the premises of the council … known as the Moree Baths …


Which was the local swimming pool. What we saw in the 1960s was the freedom riders that changed that. I seek leave to table, and I thank those opposite for allowing it, an article from the Daily Mirror on 21 February 1965, 'Violence explodes in racist town'. It begins:


White women jeered and spat at girl freedom riders today as racial violence broke out for the first time at Moree.


The work that Jim Spigelman and Charlie Perkins did on those freedom rides is very well-known, but it was people in rural areas who made such a big difference. They had a public meeting at the town hall. Ned went along to that public meeting and moved a resolution that council open up all facilities—the town hall, the swimming pool and, of course, the famous spa there at Moree—which weren't allowed to be used by Aboriginals in that town. What he did then, as the elections were coming up, was he stood and got elected. He came first in being elected to Moree council, showing that beneath the surface the population actually knew it was wrong and were prepared to vote for change. At his first council meeting, he moved just that change.


Ned is an example of a true believer in the Australian Labor Party—a bloke who has never run for any office other than local council, who's given up more than five decades of his life and who's made a real impact. I'm sure there are many people across the political spectrum who do that, and I pay tribute to Ned today and all those who don't get to be members of parliament but who make a difference to their local communities and to their nation.
