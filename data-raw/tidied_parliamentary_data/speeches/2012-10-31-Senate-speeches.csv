Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (09:31):  It is up to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Commissioner to determine the size of an entity for a financial year. There are also some concerns in the industry as to how the commission will use the prescribed enforcement tools. Don't we just love that? When you read about enforcement tools you know you have something to worry about. How the commission will actually operate on a day-to-day basis is yet to be clearly established. How typical of this government—the devil is always in the detail. I note that that is quite an apt phrase to use today of all days—the devil is in the detail. We are waiting for the detail on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We are waiting for the detail on the Charities and Not-for-profits Commission so we can understand how this will work in practice. This government is constantly lacking.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012, which are before us today, will provide the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission with the authority to, amongst other things, issue warning notices, issue directions and enter into enforceable undertakings. These powers will make the commission amongst the most powerful of all of our government agencies—not a power to look at the areas of concern in our community but a power over those committed to caring for our community.


There is dispute about the role of the advisory board and its advice being provided on request. How much advising will the advisory board really get to do? The Smith Family outlined its concern in its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. It stated:


While understanding the advisory nature of such a Board, the inclusion of the phrase ‘at the request of the Commissioner’ in relation to the provision of advice … is, in The Smith Family’s view, unnecessary and undesirable, as it could result in the Board not offering advice in a proactive way.


Policy direction is still decided by the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO determines charitable status and the eligibility of the not-for-profits to access tax exemptions and other concessions, but the ATO's aims may not always be the same and it therefore may not be independent enough, as it is responsible for revenue raising and deciding if a not-for-profit should be given charitable status. As I have said, the states have made their desires known around the relinquishment of their powers to the commissioner, yet large not-for-profits will have to submit the same information to a number of different agencies and so the cost of compliance obviously will be high. The Productivity Commission says a variation in legislation reporting will also add another layer of complexity. I think we can justly ask why there is a need for an increase in power. As Mahatma Gandhi said:


I look upon an increase in the power of the State with the greatest fear because, although while apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality which lies at the heart of all progress…


Across civil society; that is my little added extra there. I think we need to be wary of those things. We have got an entity being established with unheard of power over people and organisations. The coalition have a better idea, one that is going to focus on innovation, advocacy and education. Above all, it will introduce measures that would make it easier to meet the reporting and contractual requirements of charities and the not-for-profit sector. I will not be supporting these bills.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:35):  I indicate that I will be supporting the second reading stage of this bill, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012, and I am generally supportive of the intent of these bills subject to concerns in ensuring that the bills are effective and that they will be fair on issues in terms of compliance. I think this is a significant move forward and rather than, as some members of the coalition have said, stifling the not-for-profit sector, I see this as having great potential to nurture the not-for-profit sector, and I think that it is reform that is long overdue.


I also think that these reforms will enhance the role of charities and the not-for-profit sector in this country. We have seen multiple past inquiries held by various organisations from parliamentary committees to the Productivity Commission and the Henry tax review, and they have recommended the establishment of a body to oversee the charity and not-for-profit sector. I am grateful for the briefing from the minister's office and his advisers in relation to this because that has been a very useful part of the exercise.


This is an issue that I came to largely by accident, in the sense that I became aware of difficulties with one part of the not-for-profit sector, if you like, or a religious organisation, the Church of Scientology, several years ago as a result of speaking out about the whole issue of tax concessions for the Church of Scientology. After speaking out about that particular organisation, my office was flooded with many, many letters of concern from individuals that described horrendous and quite terrifying experiences with the Church of Scientology, an organisation that receives, effectively, a subsidy from every taxpayer in the country by virtue of its tax-free status. 


That prompted me to introduce legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (Public Benefit Test) Bill 2010. It was the subject of an extensive inquiry by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, an inquiry in the very best traditions of a Senate committee process in the sense of the cooperation between both coalition and government members and the way we all worked cooperatively to get the best outcome in terms of establishing the best way forward to deal with a public benefit test for not-for-profits for organisations that receive tax-free status. I would like to place on record my gratitude to the brave people who came forward who were involved in the Church of Scientology and gave evidence and made submissions that articulated their concerns very well. I am sure that that did have an impact, a considerable and beneficial impact on the deliberations of the committee.


Let us look at what the Economics Legislation Committee in a unanimous report said back in September 2010, just over two years ago. The report said, basically, that my bill should not be accepted. I obviously dissented from that, but coalition and government senators took the view that my bill in relation to setting up the specific public benefit test in our tax laws was not the way to go. But the committee unanimously, through every ALP and coalition senator on the committee, made a number of recommendations. They recommended that there ought to be the establishment of a commission which applies a public benefit test. In other words, what the government is doing now, effectively—the same sort of approach. The committee recommended that there be a working group to consider the functions and role of an Australian commission, and that they should include, but not be limited to, the following: promote public trust and confidence in the charitable sector; encourage and promote the effective use of charitable resources; develop and maintain a register of all not-for-profit organisations in Australia using a unique identifying number as the identifier; develop and maintain an accessible, searchable public interface and so on; allow for monitoring and promoting compliance legislation; and stimulate and promote research into any matter relating to charities.


In essence, the committee recommended—and I quote from this unanimous report—that incoming government:


… should follow the emerging international best practice and work with the Council of Australian Governments to amend legislation governing not-for-profit entities to include a definition and test of 'public benefit'.


The reason why we need a public benefit test is that if an organisation is going to receive a tax-free status, it is important that there be a benchmark. The public benefit test, as it has been applied in the United Kingdom and as it has been applied in other jurisdictions—but particularly in the United Kingdom, where the law and practice are best developed—is not an onerous test.


It is a test that effectively sets a benchmark of fairness. The organisation receiving the tax-free status has to show that on balance it does more good than harm. It does not mean that the organisation has to be perfect and it does not mean that the organisation does not make mistakes, but it means that overall the community, or a section of the community, benefits from the work of that organisation. And I want to pay tribute, at this stage, to the enormous good work that the not-for-profit sector does in this country in the many tens of billions of dollars that it provides in net terms as a result of the work of its volunteers and the work of these organisations each year.


The consequence of us not having a strong, viable, robust not-for-profit sector is that it would create a huge chasm that I do not believe any government, even with incredibly deep pockets, could fill. The work they do cannot just be measured in terms of its dollar value or the billions and billions of dollars of good work that is done; it is in terms of the impact that has on the social fabric of our community. The work of those volunteering organisations is something that is tremendous. I know that from his background in Western Australia with not-for-profit organisations and his tremendous contribution, Senator Back paid tribute to that, as he should have. My concern is that the recommendations of a committee of both coalition and government senators made it very clear that we do need not-for-profit commission and that we do need an organisation that is robust and transparent, and one that would actually enhance and benefit the not-for-profit sector.


I think it is important to look at the Charity Commission for England and Wales and to explain their approach, which is at page 19 of the Senate committee report. The charity commission sets out that it is really a question of how the organisation self manages those sorts of issues. It talks about how an organisation functions and the organisation's ability to demonstrate that it satisfies the public benefit requirement. There is, if you like, developed case law or precedents in the United Kingdom which set out how this test has been set out.


I think it is important to set out the reasons why we need a public benefit test, which is not in this legislation. That concerns me, because we simply do not know the extent of the benefits that are provided. I think that the Productivity Commission has estimated it at between $1 billion and $8 billion in tax benefits in this sector. I do not quibble with that, even if it is at the higher end, but I think that it is not unreasonable for there to be a measure of accountability and a measure of robustness; a measure that is not onerous on the sector but a measure that actually increases public confidence in the sector. It is important to make reference to Mr David Gonski, who has been quoted by a number of my colleagues in opposing the bill. Apparently Mr Gonski was concerned—or he is reported as saying—that the liabilities of directors of not-for-profit organisations are actually more onerous than those for for-profit companies—in other words, for public companies. That, to me, bears some examination


It is fair to say that there were some concerns expressed in the earlier drafts of this bill, but the amendments that I have seen from the government indicate that those issues have been dealt with and that the regulatory regime here is tailored to the size of the organisation. If it is a major charity such as World Vision, with a huge budget and huge work that it does here and around the world, there are obviously greater levels of control or scrutiny. I note that World Vision is one of the major charities in this country that is very much on board with this legislation. It welcomes this legislation. But in terms of the smaller not-for-profit organisations—the small community organisations with tiny budgets—the level of compliance is much lower. It just provides a benchmark and a framework. I see it as a support mechanism for those organisations to flourish.


It is interesting to note that there was concern expressed as recently as the end of July 2012. The Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Martin Laverty, expressed concerns in the context of this bill about the regulatory framework. That was at an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics into the exposure draft of the legislation. A lot has happened since then and I think that the government has listened to a substantial degree to some of these concerns. I note that a report in the Financial Standard online of 5 September, just under two months ago, said Mr Gonski:


… welcomed the government's response to revise the bill, saying they have listened to industry feedback and that there are now strong grounds for optimism that the ACNC—


the body that this bill sets up—


will not just regulate but also nurture giving in Australia.


I see this bill as having the ability and the potential to nurture giving in Australia rather than stifling it, and to encourage these organisations to do well and to effectively be able to contribute even further to the wellbeing of our society. 


At this stage I move the second reading amendment standing in my name in which the Senate calls on the government to introduce legislation relating to definitions of public benefit within 12 months of the bill passing. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate calls on the Government to introduce legislation detailing the definition of 'charities' and 'charitable purposes' and including a public benefit test, within 12 months of the passage of these bills


My concern is that the legislative framework in its current form is somewhat too vague. 


If you look at the work that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has done on this in a bipartisan sense, in the best spirit of the way Senate committees work, it made very clear recommendations of the need to include a public benefit test in any not-for-profit or charity organisation's commission framework. That would allow an extra level of scrutiny. It would ensure that the tiny minority of organisations that are not doing the right thing or acting for the public benefit, on balance, are subject to appropriate scrutiny.


I note that the government will not be supporting the secondary amendment. I am fairly confident that the opposition will not be supporting it either. But I think it is important to put on the record that without these new definitions the commission will not have a strong foundation on which to act. It is important that there be some clarity as to what public benefit means in the context of how this commission works. These two issues are inextricably linked. There is no point in establishing a commission without a strong enough definition of charity to work from. I believe a delay in introducing a new definition will mean the commission is not working as effectively as it could. The government has dedicated $53.6 million over four years to establish the commission, and it has committed to introduce the new definitions, so there is a clear intent that this should succeed. So it is difficult to understand why the government feels it cannot support my amendment. I think it is also vital that the government expand the commission's powers to cover the not-for-profit sector as soon as possible. I acknowledge the government's reasons for this delay, and I think it is important that there be an appropriate transitional approach to ensure the smoothness with which this legislation operates.


I think also that it is worth mentioning that the economics committee's second recommendation from the inquiry into my bill two years ago was that the Attorney-General's Department provide a report on the operation of overseas agencies tasked with monitoring and controlling the activities of cult-like organisations, making specific reference to the MIVILUDES agency in France. I was lucky enough to meet the then head of the MIVILUDES agency here in Canberra at a conference on cults that Senator Sue Boyce, coalition senator for Queensland, played a key role in. We co-sponsored and assisted the organisers of that conference here at Parliament House last year.


I think it is important that we put that in context, because that is at the sharp end of when things go wrong when an organisation receives tax-free status. Clearly there needs to be a level of scrutiny such as there is in France for these cult-like organisations. Again, that is at the very fringes, but I think it is important in the context of any regulation of this sector that there be that level of scrutiny. The government rejected this recommendation, saying that the establishment of an agency like MIVILUDES would restrict religious freedom in Australia, which I find incomprehensible. I subscribe to the view, which I hope is held by everyone in this chamber, that religious freedom is absolutely fundamental in our society, but I see this as being not about beliefs but about behaviour, and that is what MIVILUDES in France deals with. That agency looks at the behaviour of organisations on the fringes which could be described as 'cult-like organisations' and which abuse their positions of trust. I think that it is important that we look at what the French have done in relation to this.


I look forward to the committee stages of this bill. I hope that it does go into the committee stages. I believe that these measures in this bill will lead to greater transparency and confidence in the sector, because the public will know that there will be a 'nurturing organisation', to use the words of Mr Gonski, to deal with the not-for-profit sector. Again, I think it is reasonable to ask the government what the level of regulation will be for those smaller not-for-profit organisations, but my clear understanding from the amendments and from the briefings I have had from the government is that it is a graded level of regulation depending on the size of the organisation and that this bill does actually provide a framework of support and nurturing for the not-for-profit sector. Therefore I support this bill, but I believe it needs to be clearer in definitions and we need, sooner rather than later, to have a public benefit test in any legislative framework, as has existed in the United Kingdom for many years and as has existed in other jurisdictions in a way that ensures accountability and ensures nurturing of the sector but also provides increased public confidence in the sector.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:53):  My objection to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 is in relation to both its specific detail in various areas and, more broadly, its general philosophy. I think Kevin Rudd summed it up pretty well when he spoke about the Labor Party's approach to power and governance:


Politics is about power. It is about the power of the state. It is about the power of the state as applied to individuals, the society in which they live and the economy in which they work.


That is why I am proudly a member of the Liberal Party, or the Liberal-National Party in Queensland, and could never become a member of the Labor Party: because of its underlying philosophy that they, being the government or the people that run the government, seem to know better how individuals should run their lives than individuals do. We see that so often in legislation that comes before this parliament. Members of the Labor Party—people sitting opposite us, people who are probably mainly nice, honourable and honest but whose experience in life is very limited—have these ideas. I do not know where they come from. Perhaps it is their education or perhaps an unfortunate view of the world, but they have these ideas that there are wrongs in the world that only they and their group of friends can address.


Labor politicians have this broad approach of saying to people: 'You are not good enough to look after yourself. You are incapable of looking after yourself. We know better than you what is better for you and, therefore, we will attain power and we will, for your best interests, impose upon you what we know is best for you.' That of course has always been my great aversion to the way that the Labor Party deals with Indigenous people and always has done. The Labor Party says to Indigenous people: 'Hey, guys, you're incompetent. Because you're Indigenous you're not capable of doing the things that we whiteys can do, so we'll do it for you. We'll tell you what it's all about and we'll make some rules that you'll abide by which we know are better for you.' That is a view that the Labor Party, generally speaking, has about society and which is, as I say, encapsulated by Mr Rudd's famous maiden speech, when he said that politics was about power of the state.


This bill is telling not-for-profit organisations that the Labor Party knows more about how to run them honestly and properly than they do. I venture to say, and again this is a generalisation, that there are not too many people in the Labor Party who have ever been involved in not-for-profit organisations. I know a lot of them have been involved in for-profit organisations called unions but, when it comes to the Apex Club, which I was proudly involved in for many years, or to the local basketball club, which again I was involved in, and people volunteering their time to help others, the Labor Party seems to be either unaware or sadly remiss in understanding the basic philosophies of these not-for-profit community groups.


One would hope that the Labor Party would start with these sorts of regulatory arrangements in the union movement. We have seen with the HSU what an appalling mess the union movement in Australia is in. Nobody can tell me that that is confined to the HSU. The HSU, through the efforts of some courageous members, actually blew wide open the graft and corruption that exists in that particular union. But, as I say, it defies belief that this is not happening in other unions where there is no accountability and where a small coterie at the top seems to rule the roost and use members' money as if it were their own personal plaything. If the Labor Party were interested in regulating something, it should be more regulation of the union movement rather than regulation of not-for-profit community groups. As I read this bill and as I read the evidence that has been given by various parties to the Senate committee on this, I almost get the feeling that this is a move by the Labor Party to better control some of the church groups in our country. Whilst none of the church groups actually gave that evidence, they did give a lot of evidence which indicated that the good works they do would be curtailed by the extra regulation that would be imposed upon them and none of them could really work out—and neither can I, I might say—what ills this bill is supposedly intending to cure. It seems to me, and to my colleagues who were involved in the committee who have gone into this at some length both in their dissenting report and in speeches given here, that this bill will only bring more regulation on the not-for-profit sector for no particular value. 


That is why I am delighted that the coalition, and Mr Andrews in his lead speech on this, have indicated that we will be opposing this bill for the reasons that I have mentioned, but as well for the reason that the sector itself sees the bill as heavy-handed and an unwarranted interference in the activities of civil society in Australia. We in the coalition believe—and were we fortunate enough to become government at some time in the future we would act in this way—that there should be a small body in this area that could act as an educative and training body to help lift standards without the quite overbearing regulatory enforcement powers that are being proposed in this bill. That is, we would pursue the opposition's general approach to life and governance, as opposed to that enunciated by Mr Rudd in his speech, on empowering people. 


We want to empower people. We want to bring the best out in people. We want to help them to achieve their highest goals. We do not want to exercise power over them. We think that human beings, no matter their education or their background, have an ability to do good, to work things through, to work out what is best for their families and for their society. We do not believe that government should always be there regulating the way people work. 


In my life, particularly before parliament, I was involved in many community organisations. People do not always do things correctly. Perhaps at times they cut the corners, but they are striving for the right purposes. They are there for the betterment of their society. To have the government come in now with this sort of regulation will just dampen any enthusiasm people might have had for selflessly giving up their time to help others. 


I see Senator Williams in the chamber. Senator Williams is also an Apexian, as I understand, and he would recall the hundreds of hours young men volunteered to help those in society less fortunate than themselves and less able to get things done. People in the days of Senator Williams and I were happy to do that. But here is the government coming in now and saying: 'We want to regulate you. We want to tell you how to work. We want to tell you what you have got to do. We want to tell you that you have got to put in all these forms and do all this red tape and raise a bit more money so you can pay a professional accountant and a professional solicitor to double-check these forms that you have got to fill in.' One of the witnesses to the Senate inquiry—I think it was the Australian Institute of Company Directors—said, 'For every hour we pay for compliance we lose about 1½ hours of one-to-one support for our ageing residents'. No, I am sorry, they were quoting the CEO of an aged care company that was part of the membership of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.


So someone in an aged-care home said, 'We can do two things: we can spend an hour filling in additional government forms and regulations or we can spend an hour and a half actually helping the aged-care people that we are here to help'. This legislation effectively says to that organisation: 'Forget the aged people who need your care and attention; for the hour and a half that you would have given to that person—sorry—you will fill in some forms now. You will complete these forms'.


I recently had the following experience that, again, demonstrates what I am talking about. I have not paid as much attention as I should have, I might say, to ABSTUDY matters, but it has become a bit of an issue in the north at the moment because a school that was doing fabulous work for Indigenous kids is in the hands of the receiver. It was likely to close, although I understand that events in the last day or two have led to some arrangement with the liquidators. But the reason this school was in difficulty was that claims for ABSTUDY had not been met by Centrelink.


Centrelink act by the rules given to them by their government, and Centrelink would just say, 'Claim rejected'. I was told that they would not explain why it was rejected—what was wrong with the application; they would just say, 'Claim rejected'. Consequently, the school continued to educate, travel, accommodate and feed the students for whom the ABSTUDY claim had been made but they were not getting the money back to do it. Clearly, they fell into some difficult financial operations. I said to them, 'Why haven't these claims being met?' They then showed me the form—it is 40 pages of questions to be answered by Indigenous people or their parents, many of whom are illiterate, and which I, I might say, as a former lawyer, found difficult in comprehending myself. Very often, the explanatory little note under each question on these 40 pages of questions had 'Refer to some website address for a further explanation'. Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would know, there are many parts of Australia where Indigenous parents do not quite have the access to the website or a computer to actually see what they are supposed to be doing.


This is regulation gone mad: 40 pages to be filled in by either the students or, in many cases, their semi-literate parents. In many cases the school will try to help the parents complete the forms, but in many cases the parents cannot give the information that the school needs to actually complete the form. So the forms go in uncompleted and Centrelink says, 'Claim rejected'. It will not tell them why. Consequently, whilst the school continues to fly the kids down from country Northern Territory or country Queensland and continues to feed them, to clothe them and to educate them they are not getting the ABSTUDY money in because the students—silly kids!—could not fill in this 40-page form that I could not fill in. Or their parents did not have all the information about where the birth certificate was or where other certified information was that had to be attached to the form. This is typical of the philosophy of the Labor Party: overregulation. Again, that exemplifies my opposition and, I am pleased to say, the opposition of the coalition to this bill. I draw the Senate's attention to the evidence given by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. They said this in evidence to the committee:


It is likely that we will need to employ someone on a full-time basis to deal with the compliance issues that this legislation is likely to raise for the Diocese of Sydney—and I am sure we will not be alone in this regard.


That is what they said in their evidence. What is it in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney that the government is trying to regulate that requires them to employ someone on a full-time basis to look at the compliance? I would have thought that the Anglican Church has been going since the days of Henry VIII! I often say to my Catholic friends that the one true church was started by Henry VIII back in the 16th century. But they have managed to get through to where we are today without the need for the assistance of this legislation before the chamber. The Anglican Church—and I am an Anglican—does good pastoral work but also good missionary work where it helps people. That is what its whole philosophy has been for many years. But now, instead of employing someone to go out and help others, they will have to employ someone on a full-time basis to deal with the compliance issues of this legislation.


I ask a government speaker, if there are any government speakers on this, to indicate what it is that they think the Anglican Church needs to do that it has not been doing and that this legislation is going to address? What is the Australian Council of Social Service—which also had very severe concerns that it expressed to the committee—not doing that requires this draconian legislation to overregulate it, to divert its scarce resources into filling in forms to satisfy government red tape?


My colleagues and Senator Xenophon before me have been specific on particular parts of the legislation that need to be addressed. I have not gone there and I will not go there. I simply raise the objection yet again on why it is that the Labor Party thinks it knows better how to control civil society—how it has to better control volunteers doing community work? How is it that members of the Labor Party know better than these community groups on what is good for community groups? I do not want to be offensive or insulting, but you ask me who I would rather have looking after my life and my family's life: members of community groups and volunteers working in the community, or members of the Labor Party government whose basic experience has been the trade union movement? There is really little contest in what the answer would be.


I hope that all parties in the chamber will ultimately see that this bill does not do anything. It overregulates, does not achieve anything and just makes it less welcoming in our civil society for individuals to play their part in our communities and our society.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2012-10-31,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:13):  Today we are debating the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission Bill 2012. This bill covers a range of Australian charities, including non-government organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation. These and other environmental activist NGOs have taken advantage of the significant privilege of charity status to spend large amounts of money campaigning in ways that are hurting both Australian primary producers and consumers. This bill allows the opportunity to take a look at the activities of these tax-exempt NGOs and, in particular, how they are using their money and influence to restrict what products can be sold by Australian producers and bought by Australian consumers. These activities include certification schemes being run and promoted by NGOs, like WWF and Greenpeace in particular, under which they want to be the people with the final say on certifying what is and what is not sustainable in primary production and, in turn, what can and cannot be sold to consumers. We find NGOs such as these more and more trying to establish certifying bodies. All they want to do is tell primary producers how to run their operations, tell you what you can and cannot do to be certified as 'sustainable', and extort money for the privilege.


In the timber industry, we have seen the Forest Stewardship Council—a body supported by several green NGOs, including the World Wildlife Fund, or WWF—certifying products. We have seen it in the seafood industry through a body known as the Marine Stewardship Council, founded by the WWF, and we are also seeing the beginnings of a similar move in the beef industry through what is called the Roundtable for Sustainable Beef Australia, or RSBA, where again WWF is prominent. The ultimate intent of these moves by WWF and other environmental activists involved in certification is to ensure that only goods certified under their schemes are sold through Australian retail outlets such as supermarkets, furniture retailers et cetera. Of course, to have their products certified in the first place, and then have that certification renewed on a regular basis so those products can continue to be sold to the Australian public, costs producers a substantial amount of money. This is a very serious issue for Australian primary producers and Australian consumers.


I am calling on the Treasurer to refer these schemes to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, for investigation on the basis they could represent a secondary boycott. I am also calling on the Treasurer to take action to amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to remove any doubt that the green NGOs who are threatening to instigate boycotts of Australian primary products—especially Tasmanian forest products following the collapse of talks between industry and the green NGOs—can be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission under sections 45D and 45E, relating to secondary boycotts. According to the ACCC definition, secondary boycotts occur when two persons together engage in conduct that hinders or prevents a third person from supplying to, or acquiring goods or services from, a fourth person. They are prohibited if their purpose is to cause substantial loss or damage to a business or a substantial lessening of competition in a market. Isn't that what is happening when the environmental activist organisations collude with others to set up a body or scheme as the arbiter of what is 'sustainable' and what timber wholesalers, retailers and consumers should be allowed to buy or sell or what fish or, down the track, what beef people should be allowed to put on their plates? Everyone involved in this whole process of certification, roundtables and the like should consider their position very carefully. Certainly the ACCC should examine the practices related to product certification—and especially refusal to trade in products available from producers who do not agree to pay for such certification. Regardless of the findings of any ACCC investigation, all primary producers in Australia should refuse to have anything to do with these certification schemes orchestrated by environmental activists.


For example, in the case of the Forest Stewardship Council I referred to earlier, its members in Australia include WWF, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society. All primary producers should look at the membership of that certifying body. What primary producer would want such a collection of radical environmentalists controlling what they are allowed to produce from their properties? No producers that I know. But this is not some far-fetched fantasy from the future. We are seeing constant pressure on timber producers and their major customers to use Forest Stewardship Council products.


While this example has nothing to do with the WWF, there is a lesson to be learned from what has happened to the Triabunna woodchip mill in Tasmania. It processed natural forest wood products from sawmill residue and forest residues from southern Tasmania. It was closed—it may be there to honour some contracts, but it was basically closed—by Gunns Limited in April last year and then purchased in July, well over a year ago, by two millionaire environmentalists. It has not fully operated since then. When or even if it will reopen is not known. The storage of thousands of tonnes of waste and wood that normally would have gone to the Triabunna facility has become a real issue for southern Tasmanian sawmills in recent months. With many storage areas full and incomes down by a third since the closure, there are concerns that some sawmills will have to close, and that is what the Greens want. Does anyone believe years of harassment by the green groups did not play a part in the demise of Gunns Limited, putting so many important Tasmanian jobs at risk? The headlines seen after the collapse of the Tasmanian forest talks last week were completely predictable. There was this one, for example, from the Australian newspaper on 27 October: 'Green groups to resume campaign against sawmills after talks collapse'. The Australian reported that green groups would resume their 'war' against the Tasmanian timber industry, with the Wilderness Society, for example, saying it would campaign to cripple the activities of large Tasmanian sawmillers. A spokesperson said the technique it would use was to target the customers of major sawmillers. That is an all-too-familiar campaign.


So in the timber industry we see green groups once again going to war against producers, launching public campaigns against sawmillers and targeting customers—and using their tax-free income to do it. It would be completely naive to think that these green groups will not follow the same pattern in other primary industries. Of course, in the beef industry right now, with the World Wildlife Fund steering the Australian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, or ARSB—including McDonald's, JBS, Cargill, the Cattle Council of Australia and others—it is completely predictable that the WWF is going to try to push beef producers towards sustainability criteria and an expensive certification scheme. I warn all primary producers that, just because the WWF or one of these other green NGOs is not knocking on your door right now, do not think it will not happen—it will. No primary producer should expect to be spared the threat of environmentalists trying to dictate how you can work your own property. Primary industry sectors will be picked off one by one by green groups like the WWF and Greenpeace—pushing expensive sustainability criteria schemes—unless producers stand together and tackle this issue right across primary industry.


In the case of the Australian timber industry, those industry groups and businesses that choose to go for a certification scheme for their products at least have a choice, apart from the green-NGO-dominated Forest Stewardship Council. They have the option of the Australian Forest Certification Scheme, or AFCS. AFCS Limited, the company that manages the scheme, says that the majority of certified forests in Australia—more than 10 million hectares—are certified under Australian Standard 4708, the Australian Standard for Sustainable Forest Management. AFCS in turn is endorsed internationally by a body called the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or PEFC. The PEFC is an umbrella organisation. It claims to be the world's largest forest certification system, with more than 30 endorsed national certification systems and over 240 million hectares of certified forests. Of course, groups like Greenpeace in particular are critics of the PEFC. No doubt one of the aims of Greenpeace is to try to remove a commercial competitor for the Forest Stewardship Council organisation it is associated with and leave the Forest Stewardship Council as the only option for the industry, a monopoly organisation able to impose its own standards at its own prices, without fear of competition. That is a nightmare scenario. And make no mistake: these certification schemes, especially those originated by the green NGOs, are expensive for producers. There are costs associated with assessments and audits and use of logos, and on and on it goes, costing thousands and thousands of dollars.


In Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee discussions about the legislation in December a figure of $100,000 was mentioned as to certification. I am not sure that figure is right and I do not claim it. I do not know if that figure is correct, but what you can be sure of is that it will result in a constant stream of income for the NGOs and their friends in associated businesses, like those in assessment and auditing. It is a very popular new business model for the green NGOs, and one they are intent on applying to more and more primary industry sectors. It is a good little earner. What happens with green NGOs working together is seen in the forestry model, where they support one certification body and criticise their commercial competitors. It goes beyond that, well beyond that, and our primary producers can expect to be exposed down the track to what is called NGO 'greenmail'; that is, blackmail with a radical environmental agenda. Former leading member of Greenpeace, Dr Patrick Moore, who has since become disenchanted with the organisation he helped to establish and left its ranks, wrote earlier this year about Greenpeace:


Greenpeace is threatening name-brand retailers and manufacturers who do not agree to a Greenpeace-backed wood fibre and paper policy that gives preference to one particular forest certifier—the Forest Stewardship Council, FSC—over all other forest certification bodies.


We have already seen green activists using exactly those sorts of tactics here. Last year, activists launched coordinated protests and stunts against retailer Harvey Norman. They climbed onto store rooftops and dangled from the Sydney Opera House with banners. Why? Because Harvey Norman sells furniture made from timber legally obtained from sustainable Australian forests. Then there was the Greenpeace Facebook campaign against the Bakers Delight chain, suggesting that it might soon be using genetically-modified ingredients in its bread products, generating customer confusion and concern. Greenpeace demanded Bakers Delight agree not to use GM products. Bakers Delight agreed. What Greenpeace never told any of those 'concerned consumers' was that there is no genetically-modified Australian wheat, and so Bakers Delight never considered using it in the first place. This was just another step in a broader Greenpeace campaign against GM products. Any damage done to the reputation or business of Bakers Delight clearly did not matter to Greenpeace.


Earlier this year, Dr David Pollard, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Forest Products Association, said his organisation was 'deeply concerned' by misinformation being spread by extreme green groups to damage manufacturing and cause job losses in Australia. He referred to a group called Markets for Change, who have been telling customers for Australian wood products in Japan that PEFC certification is inadequate. In Dr Pollard's words:


This blatant attempt at commercial sabotage has two clear objectives: firstly, to close down a natural and sustainable industry in Australia and, secondly, to destroy the brand value of PEFC, the world's largest forest certification organisation, which currently certifies over 240 million hectares worldwide. Some environmental groups ... are on a quest to close down any industry that they take a dislike to—paying no regard to the facts (or) the science ...


If anyone thinks Greenpeace will not attack the beef industry in the same way it has the timber industry, they should think again. Queensland Country Life reported earlier this year that action by Greenpeace led directly to cancellation of orders for JBS Brazilian meat and leather across Europe. A Greenpeace report claimed JBS in Brazil was buying cattle raised on deforested regions in the Amazon, a claim JBS denied. Despite that denial by JBS, the British grocery chain Tesco cancelled its meat contract with JBS. Greenpeace also claimed four other JBS supermarket customers in the UK would not renew current contracts, along with the Dutch based Sligro Food Group and the Swedish based IKEA furniture chain, which was buying leather from JBS.


That is the way Greenpeace works, in cahoots with their mates in the WWF. The WWF cannot be trusted. One executive from the Cattle Council of Australia, sitting at WWF's Australian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, has used the glib expression that 'if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu'. The WWF still wants to carve up Australian primary producers, and they made that blatantly obvious again just recently by once again attacking the beef and sugar industries in the Great Barrier Reef catchment.


On 2 October, the Australian Institute of Marine Science released a report saying that the Great Barrier Reef has lost some of its coral since studies commenced 27 years ago. One of the report's main authors, Dr Peter Doherty, stated:


In the northern Great Barrier Reef coral cover has remained relatively stable, whereas, in the southern regions, we see the most dramatic loss of coral, particularly over the last decade when storms have devastated many reefs.


Queensland senators in particular will remember the devastation caused in February 2011 by the massive Cyclone Yasi and the extensive damage from another category 5 cyclone, Cyclone Hamish, as it tracked south down the reef in March 2009. In fact, the AIMS report blamed the majority of the coral loss on cyclone damage, coral bleaching and, I think, the crown-of-thorns starfish. Well, what did WWF do? WWF blamed farmers for the loss of coral. In a media release on the same day, 2 October, a WWF spokesman said:


Revelations that chemical fertiliser pollution is driving the significant and ongoing loss of coral on the Great Barrier Reef highlights the urgent need for intervention by the Australian and Queensland Governments.


The WWF concludes its Great Barrier Reef media release by demanding that the Queensland government take tougher action on laws to cut farm run-off. This is the very same WWF some cattle producers sit down around the table with. WWF cannot be trusted, and primary producers should have nothing to do with them.


Just a week after WWF attacked Queensland farmers for single-handedly destroying the Great Barrier Reef, Australian fishermen found out what WWF really thinks about commercial fishing—especially trawling. The International President of WWF, Ms Yolanda Kakabadse, told the Australian media that trawling should be banned here. She was completely unequivocal in what she said:


Australia should show leadership and ban trawling altogether—


ban trawling altogether were her words—


to promote sustainable fishing in the region.


Of course, there are at least three Australian trawling fleets that are paying WWF big money to have their trawling operations given sustainability certification by WWF's Marine Stewardship Council, so the international president's ban trawling statement sent local WWF staff scrambling to put some backspin on her media comments. But Ms Kakabadse is no novice. She is a former federal Minister of Environment in Ecuador, and I am sure she meant what she said, 'Australia should ban trawling altogether'. So, now we know the endgame for WWF International, no matter what local WWF staffers might be telling us and the Australian fishing industry.


I again warn all primary producers to address this issue now. Just because it may not be happening to your sector right now, do not think it will not happen. It will happen. The question is not 'if' but simply 'when'. In the same way that our primary producers stand together to fight fires, floods and other threats, it is time to stand together to fight the scourge of 'greenmail' and the extortion attempts behind these extensive, expensive, unnecessary NGO-driven sustainability certification schemes. And they will be using their tax-exempt income to fund it!

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:32):  I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the debate. The establishment of the ACNC is positive and future-focused reform. It is evidence-based structural reform which review after review has recommended. It is reform which the NFP sector strongly supports.


The NFP sector is large and diverse, forming a key part of Australia's community and providing many important services to the disadvantaged and to those in need. As the NFP sector grows it is important to support the sector by smarter and better regulation. The NFP sector has made it clear that it wants an independent regulator with a greater focus on the needs of the sector. The ACNC will be that independent and dedicated regulator. The ACNC will drive a reduction in the regulatory burden on the NFP sector.


With the establishment of the ACNC we will have a platform for a national approach to NFP regulation. As the NFP sector grows it will be vital to support this growth by enabling the sector to consolidate its standing in the community through improved transparency and accountability.




Senator Cormann:
  More red tape!




Senator CONROY:
  I note that a senator on the opposite side did interject there. A senator who sits there and votes against the deregulation of the wheat market should not really say anything about regulation. You really should not open up a debate about regulation when you are voting for more regulation in the wheat sector.




Senator Cormann:
  No, I'm not.




Senator CONROY:
  Yes you are. We are voting to deregulate the wheat sector and you are saying no.




Senator Cormann:
  Let's see what you're doing!




Senator CONROY:
  You are saying no. So do not interject and distract in this debate; your credibility on this issue is zero, Senator Cormann, as you are going to continue to interject.


This government is undertaking forward-thinking and evidence-based reform now to avoid a knee-jerk regulatory response to any issues that may arise as the sector grows.


In conclusion, the Senate will vote shortly on legislation to establish the ACNC. It has taken many years to get to this position, but after numerous reviews and reports, extensive consultation and stakeholder engagement and three parliamentary inquiries into the ACNC bills, the time has come for this important reform. The government wants to support and sustain a vibrant, independent and innovative NFP sector. Those supporting these bills in the Senate today share this aim. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:44):  I might just indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will not be opposing those amendments, but note that this is yet another series of amendments to a bill which is fundamentally flawed. The government have been making it up as they go along. Just before, as the minister was concluding the second reading debate, he was essentially telling the Senate that what we desperately need is more red tape now so we can have some cuts to red tape sometime down the track. But of course we know that that time 'sometime down the track' would actually require some agreement from the states to effectively hand over a whole series of powers to the Commonwealth which, on present indications, is highly unlikely. These amendments, while they improve a bad bill, do not fix the fundamental core problem. What we would get with this bill is a massive new bureaucracy which would make life harder for our charitable and not-for-profit sector, impose significant additional red tape, and come on top of existing state regulatory arrangements. 


Of course what the government is trying to put to the Senate is, 'Trust us, there might be this massive increase in red tape now but at some unidentified time in the future this additional red tape will help us to reduce the red tape down the track.' Based on the government's track record, we do not trust the government's assurances in relation to this. We do not trust that this massive increase in red tape will ever lead to genuine reductions in red tape. We think that, when all is said and done, this new federal bureaucracy here in Canberra, which will have its fingers in every voluntary organisation across Australia, will be there to stay, and it will come on top of all the other processes already in place at state level. In fact this is a pretty far-reaching new federal bureaucracy which will get them involved in every aspect of the charitable not-for-profit sector. So with those few remarks, I say that we will not be opposing those amendments because we do recognise that they make some slight improvements to what overall is a very bad bill. But it does not actually improve this bill sufficiently for us to be able to support the bill as a whole.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:47):  I have a series of questions that I would like some information around that pertain to the amendments that have been moved. The amendments that have been moved are largely in response to the additional comments report that the Greens submitted during the Community Affairs Committee process.


I am pleased to see these amendments. In fact, as I indicated in my second reading speech, the Greens would not be supporting this legislation unless these amendments, or significant improvements, were made. These amendments aim to improve the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 to the point where we can support it, but we need some answers to some questions first.


I would also like to just correct a few of the misconceptions that anyone listening to the second reading debate would have taken away from that, particularly if listening to some of the coalition senators' contributions. One of these misconceptions was that this legislation is not supported by the not-for-profit sector. While the not-for-profit sector had a number of concerns, a lot of the concerns that were canvassed through the debate were in fact about the exposure draft and the first version of the bill. Subsequently there have been quite a few amendments in response to the community input.


I would like to point out here that one of the reasons we have a committee process is so that the Senate and the House of Representatives, when they look at bills, can look at the flaws in a bill and make amendments. Otherwise why do we bother with the committee process? We have a committee process to do due diligence to look at legislation. That is exactly what happened to this legislation. Lo and behold, the government actually listened to a committee and made the amendments. So I for one think that that is a really good process and I am really glad to see our democracy operating in that way.


I had a contribution from UnitingCare—and I do hope my voice holds out for the rest of this debate. UnitingCare contributed substantively, as did a number of other community and charity not-for-profits, to the three committee inquiries that were held into this suite of legislation. Their name was taken in vain a bit, they felt, during the debate on Monday night. They said that UnitingCare had raised some points of concern. In fact, they did through the initial process. But I would like to read an email that I have permission to read in response to some of the taking of UnitingCare's name in vain. This is from Lin Hatfield Dodds, the CEO of UnitingCare Australia. She said: 


These quotes—


these are the quotes that were used during the debate—


are in relation to the draft Bill which appeared before the Standing Economics committee. Since that time there have been two other committees, a series of amendments made to the Bills and associated legislation, and two key commitments from the Government to anti-gag clauses and red tape reduction that have secured our support for this Bill as it stands before the Senate


This legislation is about more than simply the establishment of a new national regulator for the sector—it is recognition that our sector has come of age. A sector which is not an arm of government nor a subset of the business sector but one which has its own identity defined by its altruistic mission and characterised by its diversity and independence.


The introduction of this Bill together with the introduction of an Anti-gag clause legislation and amendments to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines … are important in securing a robust and independent sector. It is important that Government legislate it's anti gag clause arrangements and implement its proposed changes to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines to address some of the outstanding red tape issues and enshrine the capacity of community service organisations to do advocacy.


Help us get on with our mission, Australian Parliament and support this Bill.


As I said, I have permission to read that quote. That is exactly what I have been trying to do in terms of actively engaging with this piece of legislation to try and achieve change and to reflect the comments of civil society and the not-for-profit and charities sector to try and improve this bill. With this aim, I would like to start my series of questions if that is the will of the chamber. In particular, I would like to start where Lin Hatfield Dodds was talking about the gag clauses. In particular, I point out again that, as I articulated in my second reading speech, the independence of the sector is very important to the sector and it is something that the Greens hold very dear as well. So we were particularly keen to see the government respond to that with its amendment that was passed in the House of Representatives, but that has since gone further with the anti-gag-clauses legislation, which we are pleased to see. This is particularly important because the government has a monopoly over funding arrangements. In other words, it is often the sole contractor and the sole funder, which gives it an imbalance of power in negotiating contract arrangements. We have seen that abused in the past with gag clauses in contracts, and we do not want to go back to the bad old days. So this particular piece of legislation is very important.


So what I would like to ask the minister is: can the minister please provide us with a timetable for the introduction of that promised legislation, and can the minister please demonstrate how the government has engaged or intends to engage the not-for-profit sector in drafting this legislation to ensure that it is sufficiently robust to provide the reassurance that the sector is looking for that gag clauses will no longer be included in the Commonwealth funding arrangements.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:53):  On 17 September the government announced that it would introduce legislation to ban gag clauses in Commonwealth contracts with the not-for-profit sector, ensuring ongoing positive engagement and open debate between the government and the not-for-profit sector. The government recognises that a strong, independent and innovative NFP sector is essential to provide an inclusive community. In contrast to this, the Howard government tried to silence the not-for-profit sector through gag clauses. The great doyens of freedom of speech, as they always pretend they are, wanted to gag charities. So they tried to muzzle the independent voice of the not-for-profit sector, and it took the election of a Labor government to act to remove these insulting gag clauses in 2008. We are now seeing a rerun. We are seeing Premier Newman doing the same in Queensland—gagging charities. You guys! You pretenders of protection of free speech: gagging charities because they might disagree with what you are doing. It is just a disgrace and you should be ashamed of yourselves. You pretend in this chamber to be a great, great supporter of free speech. The great defenders of free speech! You have actually been gagging charities. You have actually passed laws to gag people. Don't you stand up in here and try and pretend remotely—you are an absolute disgrace.

Senator CONROY:
  Are you in a Collingwood outfit again? You can keep interjecting!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Order! Let's get back to answering Senator Siewert's question.




Senator CONROY:
  When we get to debate the bill, you can try and pretend the bill is about gagging the media. What you will not be able to hide from is the fact that you gag charities with legislation. You did it. We undid it. The Greens supported it being undone. You did it. And now Premier Newman is doing it again. So everybody knows that if the coalition were to win government again nationally they would put those gags back in place. It is part of your DNA. You cannot help it. It is in your political DNA; you want to gag charities.


The government has announced that it will introduce legislation to ban gag clauses in Commonwealth contracts with the not-for-profit sector because we respect the independence of the sector. The government is currently progressing the preparation of legislation to ban these gag clauses. We are firmly committed to its delivery. Targeted consultation with stakeholders on the legislation is planned to take place during early December. The government will be introducing legislation in the first sitting weeks of 2013 with a view to prompt passage through the parliament.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:57):  This will apply to Commonwealth funding arrangements. Where there are joint agreements between the states and the Commonwealth, is it the intent that the legislation would also apply? In other words, could this legislation also apply to funding that is made available through such joint agreements to ensure that states cannot use that funding and impose gag clauses?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:57):  I thank the minister for his answer and I would appreciate any further information, because obviously there is a lot of money that is delivered jointly. This came up in estimates the week before last when I was in fact canvassing some of the issues around the next bill we will be debating in this chamber, the social and community services pay equity bill. There is a lot of funding delivered through joint agreements. So being able to deal with that through this legislation would give us and the sector a great deal of reassurance. That would be appreciated.


I am aware of the time so I am trying to move through these as expeditiously as possible. The issue of the volunteer individual directors was raised a lot in the various committee inquiries, and we flagged it in our additional comment report. Many of the organisations, as we have been discussing in the chamber second reading contributions, have few if any staff and rely heavily on volunteers to run their organisations. I note the comments from World Vision Australia during the Senate inquiry that it is well accepted that noncompliance is usually a matter of ignorance or underresourcing. In light of these comments the Australian Greens would expect that the commissioner would take an active role—that is what we understand from discussions in the various committees—in educating registered organisations about their obligations and ensuring that volunteer directors have easy access to plain English explanations of their duties and responsibilities under the act and how to perform. Can you tell us how the commissioner will support and educate volunteer directors and what safeguards has the government put in place through the legislation to ensure that volunteer directors are aware of their obligations?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:59):  The government recognises and values the vital contribution made by volunteers and volunteer directors to the not-for-profit sector. We want to encourage them to continue to make an important contribution to Australian charities and not-for-profits. As part of its role, the ACNC will provide education and guidance to relevant responsible entities, including volunteer directors of unincorporated associations, to assist them to meet the requirements under the bill. This is consistent with the ACNC Commissioner's general approach of resolving compliance issues primarily through education and guidance rather than using heavy-handed enforcement powers. This regulatory approach is outlined in the ACNC's implementation report released in June 2012. In addition, as part of the development of the ACNC's regulatory framework governance standards, the government will also be seeking important feedback on the possibility of additional protections for volunteer directors of registered entities.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:00):  I thank the minister for his answer. In terms of the review process, I am pretty certain this is going to be an area of ongoing concern and we are aware that there are already provisions to allow the commissioner to have regard to the size and nature of organisations and the Australian Greens expect the commission to consider whether directors have acted in good faith and the extent to which compliance issues can be resolved through education particularly with volunteer directors and unincorporated organisations. However, we do have concerns about the extent to which the directors of unincorporated entities are exposed to legal liability on behalf of an entity under this legislation. Minister, what approach will the ACNC take in dealing with these issues that involve volunteer directors? Will the review process include an assessment of the impact that the ACNC arrangements have had on entities that are run by volunteers, particularly the impact on the ability of organisations to recruit volunteer directors? One of the points that came up through the inquiries is that this will put off people wanting to volunteer to be on these organisations.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (11:02):  This is obviously an issue where, because we are stepping into a new jurisdiction, the culture of the ACNC organisation and commissioner is vital. The government's view is that it is vital that the commissioner follow through with the education and training aspect long before any other action is needed. We would be concerned if the first step was enforcement action. We think this would lead to a culture that you are describing. So we would only envisage that these powers would be needed in the most extreme examples of misbehaviour. I think we are right to be cautious and we are right to ask these questions as the culture of the agency is very important, but we do not believe that needs to be the first step; it needs to be the last resort in the most extreme circumstances.

So can we go to that second part of the question?

I want to go to issues around the basic religious charities. Basic religious charities are recognised as complex entities that have evolved over time in a way that is different from other not-for-profit organisations. They have been given some special status in these bills and, as a result, some different reporting thresholds and responsibilities apply to this type of entity. Some issues were raised during the committee's inquiries. The Australian Greens are still concerned that these arrangements may not provide sufficient requirements to ensure the accountability and transparency and hence maintain public trust and confidence in these organisations. The amendments introduced in the House of Representatives even further relax the non-financial-reporting thresholds for basic religious entities that operate for schools. While we are not seeking during this stage to amend the legislation in this regard, we would like a commitment that these thresholds will be reviewed when the legislation is reviewed. We would like a commitment that these thresholds will be included as part of that review.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:07):  First, as part of establishing the commission, in consultation with stakeholders the government has decided to provide a targeted exemption for basic religious charities, and I think the senator referred to this. The practical effect is to exempt certain unincorporated religious entities from a number of requirements under the legislation. We do believe the exemption is appropriate. As with all elements of legislation, it will examine the effectiveness of the exemption as part of the five-year statutory review of the legislation.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:08):  I thank the minister for her answer. I have a similar question in terms of the thresholds for small, medium and large entities. Another point of very significant debate during the various committee inquiries was whether those sizes were appropriate. You have a number of organisations that are just over $1 million and some that are hundreds of millions of dollars. That group seems to be very wide. It is the same with small organisations. There is some concern about the definitions of small and medium organisations. When I subsequently looked into it and talked to various organisations I did not hear any better examples. The other examples raised also raised their own issues. I was persuaded to the argument that it is best to see how it runs for the time being and then maybe amend it in the future. Again I am seeking a commitment that specifically that issue will be looked into as part of the process of reviewing the operation of the act.

Senator WONG

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:09):  Thank you. During the committee inquiry, an issue was raised about the inconsistency in the EM on the role of the ACNC board. Can you please clarify how the board will operate and under what conditions it will be able to offer advice to the commissioner? Can the minister expand on the make-up of the board, how the participants will be selected and how the board will ensure that its membership includes individuals with strong experience in operating not-for-profit organisations? To elaborate on that a bit more, during the Senate inquiry there were issues about the board only being able to provide advice on request, and there seemed to be another element in the legislation that conflicted with that and seemed to not quite rely on the concept of the board only providing advice when requested. I seek clarification so that they are really clear on that point.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:10):  I understand, firstly, that the intention is that the advisory board be appropriately representative of the sector. In the EM, however, on page 171, it says that the board would provide advice 'that is not in response to a request from the commissioner'.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  If you look at page 171, it indicates that it is not intended that the board would provide advice that is not in response to a request from the commissioner. I am advised that the commissioner has indicated that they would be actively seeking the board's advice.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:11):  I did understand that that is what the bill said but, because of that issue having been raised during the committee hearing, I was seeking clarification. So it is the intent that, despite any other contradictions, it is only 'can provide advice upon request'?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:13):  Thank you. There was quite a bit of debate during the Senate inquiry and out there in not-for-profit land about the governance standards. I am very pleased about the amendments that are planned for the way in which the regulation process will operate. They do not go as far as we would like, which is that we wanted the process in the legislation. As I articulated during my second reading contribution, I understand the reasons that cannot happen in terms of time frame, because it is a very complex issue. These are critical parts of the functioning of this act, and I am particularly pleased that the section that gave the commissioner the power to direct an entity to act or not act in a specific manner has been taken out, because that went to the very heart of the independence of the sector.


I have a couple of questions about the consultation process. That is an area to which we paid particular attention, and another amendment that I am particularly pleased to see is the inclusion of the consultation process and, further, the inclusion of the commissioner's role in the consultation process. I would just like to tease out here, and get a confirmation of, who will actually be the lead in the consultation process over the government's standards. Will it be the commissioner? Will it be the Treasurer or the minister? I understand it to be the minister. I do understand the process and that the minister is the final decision maker. But from our perspective it is important that the commission takes a very active role in this consultation process. That is the clear message that I have received from the sector. They want to be dealing with the commission; that is why they support a commission, because they see the commission as the body that will now be helping to look after them and helping them to enhance their vibrancy and their independence.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:15):  With all due respect, that did not answer the question! I am glad that the government will seek the commission's advice, but how strongly will the commission be a lead in these discussions? Also, what resourcing will be available for it to undertake that consultation? And a supplementary to that one: will there be resources for the not-for-profit sector to be able to engage in this? This is going to be a really heavy-duty process; these go to the very heart of the operation and how it relates to the not-for-profit and charity sector. So it is vital that this particular process happens appropriately.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:16):  As I understand it, under the legislation it is the minister who consults. But, obviously, that is not an unusual statutory provision and my first answer does stand, which is that we would envisage an active role by the commissioner in consultation as well as, I assume, officers of the Treasury in that process.


I do not quite understand the 'lead' concept, to be honest. We would often have a consultation process where you would have a number of levels of consultation. That is not so unusual; you might have ministerial and you might have the different levels of the public service in any consultation process.


It is not intended as part of this legislation that there be any additional resources. I am sure that you will tell me why we should do that, but it is not intended. We have made various decisions, as you would know, through supplementation for SACS and so forth, for some parts of the not-for-profit sector. But that is for a different process.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:17):  Thank you. Maybe I need to be more blunt? The sector does not want Treasury determining it; they want to see the commissioner, whose role is to support the objectives of this legislation, such as an independent, vibrant sector, cutting red tape and raising public trust and confidence. They have more trust in an organisation that is coming from the perspective of understanding the sector, rather than Treasury.


I will just cut straight to the chase and say that that is the reason they want it. Quite frankly, some of the iterations of this legislation that we have seen have been because there has not been an understanding of the sector. I am not having a go at Treasury and I am not having a go at the ATO; they have their jobs to do. But the commission will bring an understanding and a relationship with the sector that those government departments just do not have. That is what we are looking for, an ability to be able to negotiate and work with the sector.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:18):  Thank you for being blunt; now I understand! I would say to you that it is in the government's interests to ensure proper a consultation process and to ensure that the commissioner is actively involved in that. I understand that the commissioner—Ms Pascoe, is it?—is a well-regarded individual in the not-for-profit sector. I do not have any doubt that the commissioner will be engaged to ensure an appropriate consultation process. If there are issues down the track which I raised with you, Senator, you do have the option, obviously, of making sure that the relevant minister is aware of that.


I should probably defend the Department of the Treasury as well, who actually consult many members of the community across a whole range of issues. But I appreciate what you are saying: the sector want to have somebody who is really engaged with their issues as part of this process, and we would envisage that that would occur.

I realise that you cannot pre-empt something that the commissioner will undertake, but I am wondering if it is possible that there could be an undertaking that, before the consultation starts, the development of the consultation process is discussed with the board or, more broadly, with the not-for-profit sector so that there is not a misunderstanding from the start about how that consultation process will occur.

 (South Australia) (11:21):  I have a series of questions, and these follow on from my spectacularly unsuccessful second reading amendment—I think I was the only voice supporting it—where I called on the government to introduce legislation detailing a definition of charities and charitable purposes and including a public benefit test within 12 months of the passage of these bills. Following on from that, can the minister provide any information on when legislation relating to the definition of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' will be introduced, and will this contain a public benefit test? By way of background, the position in the United Kingdom, which I think is the benchmark for accountability for charities—it is something that has been tried and proven and works well with charities and the not-for-profit sector—–has included these definitions for a number of years. I support the broad intent of this legislation, but my question is: when will we go further with a definition of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' and will it include a public benefit test?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:23):  Obviously the framework we are discussing is focused on charities. The government's intention is that the ACNC be able to fulfil the responsibilities it currently has in the legislation before considering any expansion to other not-for-profits. As a matter of logistics, the earliest point that other not-for-profits could be included in the regulatory framework would be 2014. However, it would be premature to make any decision regarding this as we first want the commission to be up and running and focused on charities and doing an effective job in that regard.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:24):  My final question to the minister in relation to these preliminary matters: can the minister clarify concerns that have been expressed in relation to the responsibility of board members where charities have been found guilty of non-compliant actions? I note some of my colleagues—I heard Senator McKenzie's considered contribution yesterday—talked about concerns raised by Mr Gonski about sanctions for non-compliance amongst directors being more onerous than in the for-profit sector. I did read into the Hansard in my contribution what Mr Gonski said just last month—that he was reasonably satisfied with the revisions. But, given that this was a legitimate concern that was raised, can the government clarify that what has previously been raised as a concern is no longer the case in terms of the proposed framework of this piece of legislation?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:25):  The provisions of the legislation governing obligations, liabilities and offences of incorporated an unincorporated entities have been redrafted, I am advised, consistent with the recommendations of the House of Representatives standing committee inquiry. Criminal liabilities for directors of incorporated charities have been removed completely. The bill also makes clear that, where there is a non-criminal contravention of the bill, the director of an incorporated charity is only liable for any amount payable by the body corporate where this arises from a deliberate act or omission of the director involving dishonesty, gross negligence or recklessness.


I am also advised that the director liability regime in the bill is not onerous when compared with other Commonwealth acts. For example, the bill imposes no personal criminal liability on directors at all, whereas the Corporations Act imposes personal criminal liability in certain situations—for example, breaches of directors duties, which may result in penalties of up to the $220,000 or imprisonment for five years or both. There are also references in the advice I have to similar types of provisions in the tax laws, which are obviously more onerous than the bill before the chamber.

I am pleased to see that there has been more clarification in the bill. But I still have a couple of questions that I would like to follow up on and place on the record. 


The ACNC establishes a time line for reducing unnecessary regulatory obligations on the Australian not-for-profit sector, and I am pleased that, as part of its annual report, it will be detailing its progress against the time line in reducing red tape. However, the red tape issues are, unfortunately, broader than those that are just under the influence of the ACNC and while the ACNC has been given the task of promoting greater integration and fewer reporting requirements, the government as a whole has set forth its commitments to the sector in having ongoing regard to the delivery on that commitment. Will the government also commit to ensuring that an independent regulatory impact assessment is undertaken and factor in the cost of compliance with the ACNC into its regulatory calculator?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:29):  I am a little unclear about which reform you want a regulation impact statement for. What I can say to you is that the government has a very clear framework that applies across government decisions around the need to do a regulation impact assessment, which will look at the costs and the benefits of particular policy decisions. That is the case in this area and across all areas of government policy. Where required under the framework, an RIS—a regulation impact statement—which incorporates the assessment, has to be part of the decision-making process. It was not clear to me in in your question what reform you were saying should have an RIS.

 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:31):  We have a very clear set of requirements under our regulatory assessment process.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:31):  During the inquiry—as I am sure many on that side of the chamber will be aware—various opportunities were looked at for red tape reduction. One of the proposals that was traversed was item 10 in schedule 1 of the transition bill, which states 'The Commissioner may treat a statement, report or other document given … to an Australian government agency' as being an information statement for a financial year or an annual financial report. During the inquiry process the Bishops' Council suggested that the government should amend the statement to read, 'The Commissioner will…' and argued that this arrangement would protect organisations from unnecessary duplication as a result of the ACNC registration until other arrangements can be resolved.


We agree, and the government responded to that. I partly accept the government's concern that taking this step to amend the text of the bill to replace 'may' with 'will' could have unintended consequences. But for all government departments there is no reason this could not be used as a standard until other arrangements are instituted, or put in place for a short-term process to see how it could operate.


Could the minister explain how the process of helping this to happen has been incorporated into the bill and the implementation of the bill to give effect to that concept. Even if you cannot amend the bill from 'may' to 'will', it is the intent that we are looking for. We are seeking a commitment of goodwill that until some of these other measures are put in place and all the harmonisation processes are achieved that for all intents and purposes an effort will be made to replace 'may' with 'will', even if it is not in the bill. Am I making myself clear there? What we are looking for is a commitment that while maintaining transparency and accountability every intent will be made in this transition process to ensure that reports are, as the government has said, 'done once, used often'.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:34):  The difficulty that I have with one of the implications behind the question—and it may not be the intention—is the suggestion that the commissioner would not do the right thing. The government's view is that it is appropriate for there to be discretion. When you are determining a document to comply with a regulatory requirement you would not want that to be mandatory, because you would want to make sure that a person is considering whether that document should comply with it. If it should comply then they have the discretion to do that. If the commissioner is doing the right thing, and we operate on the basis that they will, I do not think the issue that you raise is going to be a problem. With the alternative construction of 'will', you would still have to have an assessment against criteria, which arguably becomes a more legal type of test—'I can only do this if this ticks all these boxes'. What you have here is discretion. The commissioner has to have regard to a range of factors, but the government thinks it is appropriate for the commissioner to have discretion.

I will also put on the record that, as you articulated earlier, there has been a great deal of faith expressed through the inquiry process in Ms Pascoe, and there is very strong support for her as the commissioner. I acknowledge that on the record.


What organisations are looking for is a commitment from government that in this transition process there will be every endeavour made to reduce red tape and to use reports as often as possible so that they do not have to keep reporting. This is not just about the commission; it is also about government agencies and how the commission can facilitate that relationship between government agencies and re-using reports as much as possible. Where is the government up to in meeting those commitments that it has already made to the not-for-profit sector about reducing red tape?

I do not want to pretend to the senator or the chamber that it is easy to reduce some of the compliance requirements with government because, particularly in a devolved financial management framework, a particular entity might have a grant or an arrangement with two or three departments or with the same department but with different funding arrangements, and so that obviously creates a compliance burden, which is a function of the way government works. We have been doing a fair bit of work with Minister Butler, Treasury and Finance and Deregulation to try to work through some of the ways of how we can improve arrangements. You might be aware that we announced on 17 October that we would implement a report-once, use-often reporting framework by the ACNC and that we would support that with the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. There have also been other arrangements in terms of contract management out of my portfolio from which I am happy to try to arrange a briefing. The intention is there—I do not want to overstate it, because having worked in this area for a while I know it is a lot easier to talk about red-tape reduction than actually deliver it. Delivering it requires quite a lot of work, but I think the bill before you and the commitments that the commissioner has given really indicates the approach the government is taking.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:38):  I thank the minister for that explanation. I think your comment about it taking a while to happen is the reason for the sector's nervousness. There were commitments on red-tape reduction before and it is not that the sector is questioning the commitment, it is how it is being done and, in particular, the difficulty of working across various government agencies, and the issue of providing financial reports to one organisation or to continue having to report to individual organisations on individual grants.


Is it the government's intent that where an organisation has reported to one agency on a particular government grant that they could use that same report to report against other grants, if appropriate?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:39):  That was what I was referring to in the first part of my earlier answer: that we have announced the implementation of a report-once, use-often reporting framework and we have supported that through changes to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. The Commonwealth Grant Guidelines are administered by me out of Finance and they establish the grants policy and reporting framework for departments and agencies subject to the Financial Management Accountability Act. I can read all of the effects of that if you wish.




Senator Siewert:
  Table it.




Senator WONG:
  I do not really like tabling these notes, per se. I can read it:


The change will benefit many organisations that will be registered with the ACNC and are recipients of grants from Commonwealth agencies and departments. These changes will state that agency staff should not seek information from grant applicants and grant recipients that is collected by other inter-Commonwealth entities and is available to agency staff. In particular, they will provide that agency staff must not request information already provided to the ACNC by an organisation regulated by it. The changes also state that when determining whether acquittal reporting requirements are required for a grant, agency staff must have regard to information collected by regulators, such as the ACNC. The changes will state that if an entity provides an annual audited financial statement to the ACNC then a grant acquittal should not be required, unless the nature of the activity for which the grant was being provided is regarded as high risk.


I am advised also—I think I made reference to this—that the ACNC has undertaken to develop and make public a red-tape reduction time line and plan, and the annual report of the commission to parliament will also provide details of performance against this time line.

I want to pick up on the last point about the time line. Will that include, both for that reporting process and for the long term review, the success of the legislation in reducing red tape, measures of red-tape reduction or what measures will be used to work out whether red tape has been reduced? I should say, what indicators will be used? Has that been determined, and will you determine some?

Can you give us a quick update on where that process is up to and how soon you expect it to be completed?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (11:42):  The lack of an independent regulator focused on charities and the specific needs and characteristics of the sector has been a hindrance to delivering a national approach to NFP regulation. The government has made a decision to establish a regulator at the Commonwealth level and to provide a platform to deliver harmonising and consistent regulation of charities across Australia. The government is working collaboratively with the states and territories through the NFP Reform Working Group, established under the Council of Australian Governments. I am advised that the South Australian government earlier this month announced that that state will make amendments to its incorporated associations and charitable collections legislation to harmonise reporting requirements and authorise charities to collect charitable donations in South Australia once they are formally registered with the commission. We welcome South Australia's leadership in this regard and look forward to working with other states and territories to deliver similar reform outcomes across Australia. I understand that is also the position that has been expressed by quite a number of entities within the NFP sector.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (09:31):  It is up to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Commissioner to determine the size of an entity for a financial year. There are also some concerns in the industry as to how the commission will use the prescribed enforcement tools. Don't we just love that? When you read about enforcement tools you know you have something to worry about. How the commission will actually operate on a day-to-day basis is yet to be clearly established. How typical of this government—the devil is always in the detail. I note that that is quite an apt phrase to use today of all days—the devil is in the detail. We are waiting for the detail on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We are waiting for the detail on the Charities and Not-for-profits Commission so we can understand how this will work in practice. This government is constantly lacking.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012, which are before us today, will provide the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission with the authority to, amongst other things, issue warning notices, issue directions and enter into enforceable undertakings. These powers will make the commission amongst the most powerful of all of our government agencies—not a power to look at the areas of concern in our community but a power over those committed to caring for our community.


There is dispute about the role of the advisory board and its advice being provided on request. How much advising will the advisory board really get to do? The Smith Family outlined its concern in its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. It stated:


While understanding the advisory nature of such a Board, the inclusion of the phrase ‘at the request of the Commissioner’ in relation to the provision of advice … is, in The Smith Family’s view, unnecessary and undesirable, as it could result in the Board not offering advice in a proactive way.


Policy direction is still decided by the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO determines charitable status and the eligibility of the not-for-profits to access tax exemptions and other concessions, but the ATO's aims may not always be the same and it therefore may not be independent enough, as it is responsible for revenue raising and deciding if a not-for-profit should be given charitable status. As I have said, the states have made their desires known around the relinquishment of their powers to the commissioner, yet large not-for-profits will have to submit the same information to a number of different agencies and so the cost of compliance obviously will be high. The Productivity Commission says a variation in legislation reporting will also add another layer of complexity. I think we can justly ask why there is a need for an increase in power. As Mahatma Gandhi said:


I look upon an increase in the power of the State with the greatest fear because, although while apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality which lies at the heart of all progress…


Across civil society; that is my little added extra there. I think we need to be wary of those things. We have got an entity being established with unheard of power over people and organisations. The coalition have a better idea, one that is going to focus on innovation, advocacy and education. Above all, it will introduce measures that would make it easier to meet the reporting and contractual requirements of charities and the not-for-profit sector. I will not be supporting these bills.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-10-31,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:35):  I indicate that I will be supporting the second reading stage of this bill, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012, and I am generally supportive of the intent of these bills subject to concerns in ensuring that the bills are effective and that they will be fair on issues in terms of compliance. I think this is a significant move forward and rather than, as some members of the coalition have said, stifling the not-for-profit sector, I see this as having great potential to nurture the not-for-profit sector, and I think that it is reform that is long overdue.


I also think that these reforms will enhance the role of charities and the not-for-profit sector in this country. We have seen multiple past inquiries held by various organisations from parliamentary committees to the Productivity Commission and the Henry tax review, and they have recommended the establishment of a body to oversee the charity and not-for-profit sector. I am grateful for the briefing from the minister's office and his advisers in relation to this because that has been a very useful part of the exercise.


This is an issue that I came to largely by accident, in the sense that I became aware of difficulties with one part of the not-for-profit sector, if you like, or a religious organisation, the Church of Scientology, several years ago as a result of speaking out about the whole issue of tax concessions for the Church of Scientology. After speaking out about that particular organisation, my office was flooded with many, many letters of concern from individuals that described horrendous and quite terrifying experiences with the Church of Scientology, an organisation that receives, effectively, a subsidy from every taxpayer in the country by virtue of its tax-free status. 


That prompted me to introduce legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (Public Benefit Test) Bill 2010. It was the subject of an extensive inquiry by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, an inquiry in the very best traditions of a Senate committee process in the sense of the cooperation between both coalition and government members and the way we all worked cooperatively to get the best outcome in terms of establishing the best way forward to deal with a public benefit test for not-for-profits for organisations that receive tax-free status. I would like to place on record my gratitude to the brave people who came forward who were involved in the Church of Scientology and gave evidence and made submissions that articulated their concerns very well. I am sure that that did have an impact, a considerable and beneficial impact on the deliberations of the committee.


Let us look at what the Economics Legislation Committee in a unanimous report said back in September 2010, just over two years ago. The report said, basically, that my bill should not be accepted. I obviously dissented from that, but coalition and government senators took the view that my bill in relation to setting up the specific public benefit test in our tax laws was not the way to go. But the committee unanimously, through every ALP and coalition senator on the committee, made a number of recommendations. They recommended that there ought to be the establishment of a commission which applies a public benefit test. In other words, what the government is doing now, effectively—the same sort of approach. The committee recommended that there be a working group to consider the functions and role of an Australian commission, and that they should include, but not be limited to, the following: promote public trust and confidence in the charitable sector; encourage and promote the effective use of charitable resources; develop and maintain a register of all not-for-profit organisations in Australia using a unique identifying number as the identifier; develop and maintain an accessible, searchable public interface and so on; allow for monitoring and promoting compliance legislation; and stimulate and promote research into any matter relating to charities.


In essence, the committee recommended—and I quote from this unanimous report—that incoming government:


… should follow the emerging international best practice and work with the Council of Australian Governments to amend legislation governing not-for-profit entities to include a definition and test of 'public benefit'.


The reason why we need a public benefit test is that if an organisation is going to receive a tax-free status, it is important that there be a benchmark. The public benefit test, as it has been applied in the United Kingdom and as it has been applied in other jurisdictions—but particularly in the United Kingdom, where the law and practice are best developed—is not an onerous test.


It is a test that effectively sets a benchmark of fairness. The organisation receiving the tax-free status has to show that on balance it does more good than harm. It does not mean that the organisation has to be perfect and it does not mean that the organisation does not make mistakes, but it means that overall the community, or a section of the community, benefits from the work of that organisation. And I want to pay tribute, at this stage, to the enormous good work that the not-for-profit sector does in this country in the many tens of billions of dollars that it provides in net terms as a result of the work of its volunteers and the work of these organisations each year.


The consequence of us not having a strong, viable, robust not-for-profit sector is that it would create a huge chasm that I do not believe any government, even with incredibly deep pockets, could fill. The work they do cannot just be measured in terms of its dollar value or the billions and billions of dollars of good work that is done; it is in terms of the impact that has on the social fabric of our community. The work of those volunteering organisations is something that is tremendous. I know that from his background in Western Australia with not-for-profit organisations and his tremendous contribution, Senator Back paid tribute to that, as he should have. My concern is that the recommendations of a committee of both coalition and government senators made it very clear that we do need not-for-profit commission and that we do need an organisation that is robust and transparent, and one that would actually enhance and benefit the not-for-profit sector.


I think it is important to look at the Charity Commission for England and Wales and to explain their approach, which is at page 19 of the Senate committee report. The charity commission sets out that it is really a question of how the organisation self manages those sorts of issues. It talks about how an organisation functions and the organisation's ability to demonstrate that it satisfies the public benefit requirement. There is, if you like, developed case law or precedents in the United Kingdom which set out how this test has been set out.


I think it is important to set out the reasons why we need a public benefit test, which is not in this legislation. That concerns me, because we simply do not know the extent of the benefits that are provided. I think that the Productivity Commission has estimated it at between $1 billion and $8 billion in tax benefits in this sector. I do not quibble with that, even if it is at the higher end, but I think that it is not unreasonable for there to be a measure of accountability and a measure of robustness; a measure that is not onerous on the sector but a measure that actually increases public confidence in the sector. It is important to make reference to Mr David Gonski, who has been quoted by a number of my colleagues in opposing the bill. Apparently Mr Gonski was concerned—or he is reported as saying—that the liabilities of directors of not-for-profit organisations are actually more onerous than those for for-profit companies—in other words, for public companies. That, to me, bears some examination


It is fair to say that there were some concerns expressed in the earlier drafts of this bill, but the amendments that I have seen from the government indicate that those issues have been dealt with and that the regulatory regime here is tailored to the size of the organisation. If it is a major charity such as World Vision, with a huge budget and huge work that it does here and around the world, there are obviously greater levels of control or scrutiny. I note that World Vision is one of the major charities in this country that is very much on board with this legislation. It welcomes this legislation. But in terms of the smaller not-for-profit organisations—the small community organisations with tiny budgets—the level of compliance is much lower. It just provides a benchmark and a framework. I see it as a support mechanism for those organisations to flourish.


It is interesting to note that there was concern expressed as recently as the end of July 2012. The Chief Executive Officer of Catholic Health Australia, Martin Laverty, expressed concerns in the context of this bill about the regulatory framework. That was at an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics into the exposure draft of the legislation. A lot has happened since then and I think that the government has listened to a substantial degree to some of these concerns. I note that a report in the Financial Standard online of 5 September, just under two months ago, said Mr Gonski:


… welcomed the government's response to revise the bill, saying they have listened to industry feedback and that there are now strong grounds for optimism that the ACNC—


the body that this bill sets up—


will not just regulate but also nurture giving in Australia.


I see this bill as having the ability and the potential to nurture giving in Australia rather than stifling it, and to encourage these organisations to do well and to effectively be able to contribute even further to the wellbeing of our society. 


At this stage I move the second reading amendment standing in my name in which the Senate calls on the government to introduce legislation relating to definitions of public benefit within 12 months of the bill passing. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate calls on the Government to introduce legislation detailing the definition of 'charities' and 'charitable purposes' and including a public benefit test, within 12 months of the passage of these bills


My concern is that the legislative framework in its current form is somewhat too vague. 


If you look at the work that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has done on this in a bipartisan sense, in the best spirit of the way Senate committees work, it made very clear recommendations of the need to include a public benefit test in any not-for-profit or charity organisation's commission framework. That would allow an extra level of scrutiny. It would ensure that the tiny minority of organisations that are not doing the right thing or acting for the public benefit, on balance, are subject to appropriate scrutiny.


I note that the government will not be supporting the secondary amendment. I am fairly confident that the opposition will not be supporting it either. But I think it is important to put on the record that without these new definitions the commission will not have a strong foundation on which to act. It is important that there be some clarity as to what public benefit means in the context of how this commission works. These two issues are inextricably linked. There is no point in establishing a commission without a strong enough definition of charity to work from. I believe a delay in introducing a new definition will mean the commission is not working as effectively as it could. The government has dedicated $53.6 million over four years to establish the commission, and it has committed to introduce the new definitions, so there is a clear intent that this should succeed. So it is difficult to understand why the government feels it cannot support my amendment. I think it is also vital that the government expand the commission's powers to cover the not-for-profit sector as soon as possible. I acknowledge the government's reasons for this delay, and I think it is important that there be an appropriate transitional approach to ensure the smoothness with which this legislation operates.


I think also that it is worth mentioning that the economics committee's second recommendation from the inquiry into my bill two years ago was that the Attorney-General's Department provide a report on the operation of overseas agencies tasked with monitoring and controlling the activities of cult-like organisations, making specific reference to the MIVILUDES agency in France. I was lucky enough to meet the then head of the MIVILUDES agency here in Canberra at a conference on cults that Senator Sue Boyce, coalition senator for Queensland, played a key role in. We co-sponsored and assisted the organisers of that conference here at Parliament House last year.


I think it is important that we put that in context, because that is at the sharp end of when things go wrong when an organisation receives tax-free status. Clearly there needs to be a level of scrutiny such as there is in France for these cult-like organisations. Again, that is at the very fringes, but I think it is important in the context of any regulation of this sector that there be that level of scrutiny. The government rejected this recommendation, saying that the establishment of an agency like MIVILUDES would restrict religious freedom in Australia, which I find incomprehensible. I subscribe to the view, which I hope is held by everyone in this chamber, that religious freedom is absolutely fundamental in our society, but I see this as being not about beliefs but about behaviour, and that is what MIVILUDES in France deals with. That agency looks at the behaviour of organisations on the fringes which could be described as 'cult-like organisations' and which abuse their positions of trust. I think that it is important that we look at what the French have done in relation to this.


I look forward to the committee stages of this bill. I hope that it does go into the committee stages. I believe that these measures in this bill will lead to greater transparency and confidence in the sector, because the public will know that there will be a 'nurturing organisation', to use the words of Mr Gonski, to deal with the not-for-profit sector. Again, I think it is reasonable to ask the government what the level of regulation will be for those smaller not-for-profit organisations, but my clear understanding from the amendments and from the briefings I have had from the government is that it is a graded level of regulation depending on the size of the organisation and that this bill does actually provide a framework of support and nurturing for the not-for-profit sector. Therefore I support this bill, but I believe it needs to be clearer in definitions and we need, sooner rather than later, to have a public benefit test in any legislative framework, as has existed in the United Kingdom for many years and as has existed in other jurisdictions in a way that ensures accountability and ensures nurturing of the sector but also provides increased public confidence in the sector.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:53):  My objection to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 is in relation to both its specific detail in various areas and, more broadly, its general philosophy. I think Kevin Rudd summed it up pretty well when he spoke about the Labor Party's approach to power and governance:


Politics is about power. It is about the power of the state. It is about the power of the state as applied to individuals, the society in which they live and the economy in which they work.


That is why I am proudly a member of the Liberal Party, or the Liberal-National Party in Queensland, and could never become a member of the Labor Party: because of its underlying philosophy that they, being the government or the people that run the government, seem to know better how individuals should run their lives than individuals do. We see that so often in legislation that comes before this parliament. Members of the Labor Party—people sitting opposite us, people who are probably mainly nice, honourable and honest but whose experience in life is very limited—have these ideas. I do not know where they come from. Perhaps it is their education or perhaps an unfortunate view of the world, but they have these ideas that there are wrongs in the world that only they and their group of friends can address.


Labor politicians have this broad approach of saying to people: 'You are not good enough to look after yourself. You are incapable of looking after yourself. We know better than you what is better for you and, therefore, we will attain power and we will, for your best interests, impose upon you what we know is best for you.' That of course has always been my great aversion to the way that the Labor Party deals with Indigenous people and always has done. The Labor Party says to Indigenous people: 'Hey, guys, you're incompetent. Because you're Indigenous you're not capable of doing the things that we whiteys can do, so we'll do it for you. We'll tell you what it's all about and we'll make some rules that you'll abide by which we know are better for you.' That is a view that the Labor Party, generally speaking, has about society and which is, as I say, encapsulated by Mr Rudd's famous maiden speech, when he said that politics was about power of the state.


This bill is telling not-for-profit organisations that the Labor Party knows more about how to run them honestly and properly than they do. I venture to say, and again this is a generalisation, that there are not too many people in the Labor Party who have ever been involved in not-for-profit organisations. I know a lot of them have been involved in for-profit organisations called unions but, when it comes to the Apex Club, which I was proudly involved in for many years, or to the local basketball club, which again I was involved in, and people volunteering their time to help others, the Labor Party seems to be either unaware or sadly remiss in understanding the basic philosophies of these not-for-profit community groups.


One would hope that the Labor Party would start with these sorts of regulatory arrangements in the union movement. We have seen with the HSU what an appalling mess the union movement in Australia is in. Nobody can tell me that that is confined to the HSU. The HSU, through the efforts of some courageous members, actually blew wide open the graft and corruption that exists in that particular union. But, as I say, it defies belief that this is not happening in other unions where there is no accountability and where a small coterie at the top seems to rule the roost and use members' money as if it were their own personal plaything. If the Labor Party were interested in regulating something, it should be more regulation of the union movement rather than regulation of not-for-profit community groups. As I read this bill and as I read the evidence that has been given by various parties to the Senate committee on this, I almost get the feeling that this is a move by the Labor Party to better control some of the church groups in our country. Whilst none of the church groups actually gave that evidence, they did give a lot of evidence which indicated that the good works they do would be curtailed by the extra regulation that would be imposed upon them and none of them could really work out—and neither can I, I might say—what ills this bill is supposedly intending to cure. It seems to me, and to my colleagues who were involved in the committee who have gone into this at some length both in their dissenting report and in speeches given here, that this bill will only bring more regulation on the not-for-profit sector for no particular value. 


That is why I am delighted that the coalition, and Mr Andrews in his lead speech on this, have indicated that we will be opposing this bill for the reasons that I have mentioned, but as well for the reason that the sector itself sees the bill as heavy-handed and an unwarranted interference in the activities of civil society in Australia. We in the coalition believe—and were we fortunate enough to become government at some time in the future we would act in this way—that there should be a small body in this area that could act as an educative and training body to help lift standards without the quite overbearing regulatory enforcement powers that are being proposed in this bill. That is, we would pursue the opposition's general approach to life and governance, as opposed to that enunciated by Mr Rudd in his speech, on empowering people. 


We want to empower people. We want to bring the best out in people. We want to help them to achieve their highest goals. We do not want to exercise power over them. We think that human beings, no matter their education or their background, have an ability to do good, to work things through, to work out what is best for their families and for their society. We do not believe that government should always be there regulating the way people work. 


In my life, particularly before parliament, I was involved in many community organisations. People do not always do things correctly. Perhaps at times they cut the corners, but they are striving for the right purposes. They are there for the betterment of their society. To have the government come in now with this sort of regulation will just dampen any enthusiasm people might have had for selflessly giving up their time to help others. 


I see Senator Williams in the chamber. Senator Williams is also an Apexian, as I understand, and he would recall the hundreds of hours young men volunteered to help those in society less fortunate than themselves and less able to get things done. People in the days of Senator Williams and I were happy to do that. But here is the government coming in now and saying: 'We want to regulate you. We want to tell you how to work. We want to tell you what you have got to do. We want to tell you that you have got to put in all these forms and do all this red tape and raise a bit more money so you can pay a professional accountant and a professional solicitor to double-check these forms that you have got to fill in.' One of the witnesses to the Senate inquiry—I think it was the Australian Institute of Company Directors—said, 'For every hour we pay for compliance we lose about 1½ hours of one-to-one support for our ageing residents'. No, I am sorry, they were quoting the CEO of an aged care company that was part of the membership of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.


So someone in an aged-care home said, 'We can do two things: we can spend an hour filling in additional government forms and regulations or we can spend an hour and a half actually helping the aged-care people that we are here to help'. This legislation effectively says to that organisation: 'Forget the aged people who need your care and attention; for the hour and a half that you would have given to that person—sorry—you will fill in some forms now. You will complete these forms'.


I recently had the following experience that, again, demonstrates what I am talking about. I have not paid as much attention as I should have, I might say, to ABSTUDY matters, but it has become a bit of an issue in the north at the moment because a school that was doing fabulous work for Indigenous kids is in the hands of the receiver. It was likely to close, although I understand that events in the last day or two have led to some arrangement with the liquidators. But the reason this school was in difficulty was that claims for ABSTUDY had not been met by Centrelink.


Centrelink act by the rules given to them by their government, and Centrelink would just say, 'Claim rejected'. I was told that they would not explain why it was rejected—what was wrong with the application; they would just say, 'Claim rejected'. Consequently, the school continued to educate, travel, accommodate and feed the students for whom the ABSTUDY claim had been made but they were not getting the money back to do it. Clearly, they fell into some difficult financial operations. I said to them, 'Why haven't these claims being met?' They then showed me the form—it is 40 pages of questions to be answered by Indigenous people or their parents, many of whom are illiterate, and which I, I might say, as a former lawyer, found difficult in comprehending myself. Very often, the explanatory little note under each question on these 40 pages of questions had 'Refer to some website address for a further explanation'. Madam Acting Deputy President, as you would know, there are many parts of Australia where Indigenous parents do not quite have the access to the website or a computer to actually see what they are supposed to be doing.


This is regulation gone mad: 40 pages to be filled in by either the students or, in many cases, their semi-literate parents. In many cases the school will try to help the parents complete the forms, but in many cases the parents cannot give the information that the school needs to actually complete the form. So the forms go in uncompleted and Centrelink says, 'Claim rejected'. It will not tell them why. Consequently, whilst the school continues to fly the kids down from country Northern Territory or country Queensland and continues to feed them, to clothe them and to educate them they are not getting the ABSTUDY money in because the students—silly kids!—could not fill in this 40-page form that I could not fill in. Or their parents did not have all the information about where the birth certificate was or where other certified information was that had to be attached to the form. This is typical of the philosophy of the Labor Party: overregulation. Again, that exemplifies my opposition and, I am pleased to say, the opposition of the coalition to this bill. I draw the Senate's attention to the evidence given by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. They said this in evidence to the committee:


It is likely that we will need to employ someone on a full-time basis to deal with the compliance issues that this legislation is likely to raise for the Diocese of Sydney—and I am sure we will not be alone in this regard.


That is what they said in their evidence. What is it in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney that the government is trying to regulate that requires them to employ someone on a full-time basis to look at the compliance? I would have thought that the Anglican Church has been going since the days of Henry VIII! I often say to my Catholic friends that the one true church was started by Henry VIII back in the 16th century. But they have managed to get through to where we are today without the need for the assistance of this legislation before the chamber. The Anglican Church—and I am an Anglican—does good pastoral work but also good missionary work where it helps people. That is what its whole philosophy has been for many years. But now, instead of employing someone to go out and help others, they will have to employ someone on a full-time basis to deal with the compliance issues of this legislation.


I ask a government speaker, if there are any government speakers on this, to indicate what it is that they think the Anglican Church needs to do that it has not been doing and that this legislation is going to address? What is the Australian Council of Social Service—which also had very severe concerns that it expressed to the committee—not doing that requires this draconian legislation to overregulate it, to divert its scarce resources into filling in forms to satisfy government red tape?


My colleagues and Senator Xenophon before me have been specific on particular parts of the legislation that need to be addressed. I have not gone there and I will not go there. I simply raise the objection yet again on why it is that the Labor Party thinks it knows better how to control civil society—how it has to better control volunteers doing community work? How is it that members of the Labor Party know better than these community groups on what is good for community groups? I do not want to be offensive or insulting, but you ask me who I would rather have looking after my life and my family's life: members of community groups and volunteers working in the community, or members of the Labor Party government whose basic experience has been the trade union movement? There is really little contest in what the answer would be.


I hope that all parties in the chamber will ultimately see that this bill does not do anything. It overregulates, does not achieve anything and just makes it less welcoming in our civil society for individuals to play their part in our communities and our society.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2012-10-31,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:13):  Today we are debating the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission Bill 2012. This bill covers a range of Australian charities, including non-government organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation. These and other environmental activist NGOs have taken advantage of the significant privilege of charity status to spend large amounts of money campaigning in ways that are hurting both Australian primary producers and consumers. This bill allows the opportunity to take a look at the activities of these tax-exempt NGOs and, in particular, how they are using their money and influence to restrict what products can be sold by Australian producers and bought by Australian consumers. These activities include certification schemes being run and promoted by NGOs, like WWF and Greenpeace in particular, under which they want to be the people with the final say on certifying what is and what is not sustainable in primary production and, in turn, what can and cannot be sold to consumers. We find NGOs such as these more and more trying to establish certifying bodies. All they want to do is tell primary producers how to run their operations, tell you what you can and cannot do to be certified as 'sustainable', and extort money for the privilege.


In the timber industry, we have seen the Forest Stewardship Council—a body supported by several green NGOs, including the World Wildlife Fund, or WWF—certifying products. We have seen it in the seafood industry through a body known as the Marine Stewardship Council, founded by the WWF, and we are also seeing the beginnings of a similar move in the beef industry through what is called the Roundtable for Sustainable Beef Australia, or RSBA, where again WWF is prominent. The ultimate intent of these moves by WWF and other environmental activists involved in certification is to ensure that only goods certified under their schemes are sold through Australian retail outlets such as supermarkets, furniture retailers et cetera. Of course, to have their products certified in the first place, and then have that certification renewed on a regular basis so those products can continue to be sold to the Australian public, costs producers a substantial amount of money. This is a very serious issue for Australian primary producers and Australian consumers.


I am calling on the Treasurer to refer these schemes to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, for investigation on the basis they could represent a secondary boycott. I am also calling on the Treasurer to take action to amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to remove any doubt that the green NGOs who are threatening to instigate boycotts of Australian primary products—especially Tasmanian forest products following the collapse of talks between industry and the green NGOs—can be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission under sections 45D and 45E, relating to secondary boycotts. According to the ACCC definition, secondary boycotts occur when two persons together engage in conduct that hinders or prevents a third person from supplying to, or acquiring goods or services from, a fourth person. They are prohibited if their purpose is to cause substantial loss or damage to a business or a substantial lessening of competition in a market. Isn't that what is happening when the environmental activist organisations collude with others to set up a body or scheme as the arbiter of what is 'sustainable' and what timber wholesalers, retailers and consumers should be allowed to buy or sell or what fish or, down the track, what beef people should be allowed to put on their plates? Everyone involved in this whole process of certification, roundtables and the like should consider their position very carefully. Certainly the ACCC should examine the practices related to product certification—and especially refusal to trade in products available from producers who do not agree to pay for such certification. Regardless of the findings of any ACCC investigation, all primary producers in Australia should refuse to have anything to do with these certification schemes orchestrated by environmental activists.


For example, in the case of the Forest Stewardship Council I referred to earlier, its members in Australia include WWF, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society. All primary producers should look at the membership of that certifying body. What primary producer would want such a collection of radical environmentalists controlling what they are allowed to produce from their properties? No producers that I know. But this is not some far-fetched fantasy from the future. We are seeing constant pressure on timber producers and their major customers to use Forest Stewardship Council products.


While this example has nothing to do with the WWF, there is a lesson to be learned from what has happened to the Triabunna woodchip mill in Tasmania. It processed natural forest wood products from sawmill residue and forest residues from southern Tasmania. It was closed—it may be there to honour some contracts, but it was basically closed—by Gunns Limited in April last year and then purchased in July, well over a year ago, by two millionaire environmentalists. It has not fully operated since then. When or even if it will reopen is not known. The storage of thousands of tonnes of waste and wood that normally would have gone to the Triabunna facility has become a real issue for southern Tasmanian sawmills in recent months. With many storage areas full and incomes down by a third since the closure, there are concerns that some sawmills will have to close, and that is what the Greens want. Does anyone believe years of harassment by the green groups did not play a part in the demise of Gunns Limited, putting so many important Tasmanian jobs at risk? The headlines seen after the collapse of the Tasmanian forest talks last week were completely predictable. There was this one, for example, from the Australian newspaper on 27 October: 'Green groups to resume campaign against sawmills after talks collapse'. The Australian reported that green groups would resume their 'war' against the Tasmanian timber industry, with the Wilderness Society, for example, saying it would campaign to cripple the activities of large Tasmanian sawmillers. A spokesperson said the technique it would use was to target the customers of major sawmillers. That is an all-too-familiar campaign.


So in the timber industry we see green groups once again going to war against producers, launching public campaigns against sawmillers and targeting customers—and using their tax-free income to do it. It would be completely naive to think that these green groups will not follow the same pattern in other primary industries. Of course, in the beef industry right now, with the World Wildlife Fund steering the Australian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, or ARSB—including McDonald's, JBS, Cargill, the Cattle Council of Australia and others—it is completely predictable that the WWF is going to try to push beef producers towards sustainability criteria and an expensive certification scheme. I warn all primary producers that, just because the WWF or one of these other green NGOs is not knocking on your door right now, do not think it will not happen—it will. No primary producer should expect to be spared the threat of environmentalists trying to dictate how you can work your own property. Primary industry sectors will be picked off one by one by green groups like the WWF and Greenpeace—pushing expensive sustainability criteria schemes—unless producers stand together and tackle this issue right across primary industry.


In the case of the Australian timber industry, those industry groups and businesses that choose to go for a certification scheme for their products at least have a choice, apart from the green-NGO-dominated Forest Stewardship Council. They have the option of the Australian Forest Certification Scheme, or AFCS. AFCS Limited, the company that manages the scheme, says that the majority of certified forests in Australia—more than 10 million hectares—are certified under Australian Standard 4708, the Australian Standard for Sustainable Forest Management. AFCS in turn is endorsed internationally by a body called the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, or PEFC. The PEFC is an umbrella organisation. It claims to be the world's largest forest certification system, with more than 30 endorsed national certification systems and over 240 million hectares of certified forests. Of course, groups like Greenpeace in particular are critics of the PEFC. No doubt one of the aims of Greenpeace is to try to remove a commercial competitor for the Forest Stewardship Council organisation it is associated with and leave the Forest Stewardship Council as the only option for the industry, a monopoly organisation able to impose its own standards at its own prices, without fear of competition. That is a nightmare scenario. And make no mistake: these certification schemes, especially those originated by the green NGOs, are expensive for producers. There are costs associated with assessments and audits and use of logos, and on and on it goes, costing thousands and thousands of dollars.


In Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee discussions about the legislation in December a figure of $100,000 was mentioned as to certification. I am not sure that figure is right and I do not claim it. I do not know if that figure is correct, but what you can be sure of is that it will result in a constant stream of income for the NGOs and their friends in associated businesses, like those in assessment and auditing. It is a very popular new business model for the green NGOs, and one they are intent on applying to more and more primary industry sectors. It is a good little earner. What happens with green NGOs working together is seen in the forestry model, where they support one certification body and criticise their commercial competitors. It goes beyond that, well beyond that, and our primary producers can expect to be exposed down the track to what is called NGO 'greenmail'; that is, blackmail with a radical environmental agenda. Former leading member of Greenpeace, Dr Patrick Moore, who has since become disenchanted with the organisation he helped to establish and left its ranks, wrote earlier this year about Greenpeace:


Greenpeace is threatening name-brand retailers and manufacturers who do not agree to a Greenpeace-backed wood fibre and paper policy that gives preference to one particular forest certifier—the Forest Stewardship Council, FSC—over all other forest certification bodies.


We have already seen green activists using exactly those sorts of tactics here. Last year, activists launched coordinated protests and stunts against retailer Harvey Norman. They climbed onto store rooftops and dangled from the Sydney Opera House with banners. Why? Because Harvey Norman sells furniture made from timber legally obtained from sustainable Australian forests. Then there was the Greenpeace Facebook campaign against the Bakers Delight chain, suggesting that it might soon be using genetically-modified ingredients in its bread products, generating customer confusion and concern. Greenpeace demanded Bakers Delight agree not to use GM products. Bakers Delight agreed. What Greenpeace never told any of those 'concerned consumers' was that there is no genetically-modified Australian wheat, and so Bakers Delight never considered using it in the first place. This was just another step in a broader Greenpeace campaign against GM products. Any damage done to the reputation or business of Bakers Delight clearly did not matter to Greenpeace.


Earlier this year, Dr David Pollard, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Forest Products Association, said his organisation was 'deeply concerned' by misinformation being spread by extreme green groups to damage manufacturing and cause job losses in Australia. He referred to a group called Markets for Change, who have been telling customers for Australian wood products in Japan that PEFC certification is inadequate. In Dr Pollard's words:


This blatant attempt at commercial sabotage has two clear objectives: firstly, to close down a natural and sustainable industry in Australia and, secondly, to destroy the brand value of PEFC, the world's largest forest certification organisation, which currently certifies over 240 million hectares worldwide. Some environmental groups ... are on a quest to close down any industry that they take a dislike to—paying no regard to the facts (or) the science ...


If anyone thinks Greenpeace will not attack the beef industry in the same way it has the timber industry, they should think again. Queensland Country Life reported earlier this year that action by Greenpeace led directly to cancellation of orders for JBS Brazilian meat and leather across Europe. A Greenpeace report claimed JBS in Brazil was buying cattle raised on deforested regions in the Amazon, a claim JBS denied. Despite that denial by JBS, the British grocery chain Tesco cancelled its meat contract with JBS. Greenpeace also claimed four other JBS supermarket customers in the UK would not renew current contracts, along with the Dutch based Sligro Food Group and the Swedish based IKEA furniture chain, which was buying leather from JBS.


That is the way Greenpeace works, in cahoots with their mates in the WWF. The WWF cannot be trusted. One executive from the Cattle Council of Australia, sitting at WWF's Australian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, has used the glib expression that 'if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu'. The WWF still wants to carve up Australian primary producers, and they made that blatantly obvious again just recently by once again attacking the beef and sugar industries in the Great Barrier Reef catchment.


On 2 October, the Australian Institute of Marine Science released a report saying that the Great Barrier Reef has lost some of its coral since studies commenced 27 years ago. One of the report's main authors, Dr Peter Doherty, stated:


In the northern Great Barrier Reef coral cover has remained relatively stable, whereas, in the southern regions, we see the most dramatic loss of coral, particularly over the last decade when storms have devastated many reefs.


Queensland senators in particular will remember the devastation caused in February 2011 by the massive Cyclone Yasi and the extensive damage from another category 5 cyclone, Cyclone Hamish, as it tracked south down the reef in March 2009. In fact, the AIMS report blamed the majority of the coral loss on cyclone damage, coral bleaching and, I think, the crown-of-thorns starfish. Well, what did WWF do? WWF blamed farmers for the loss of coral. In a media release on the same day, 2 October, a WWF spokesman said:


Revelations that chemical fertiliser pollution is driving the significant and ongoing loss of coral on the Great Barrier Reef highlights the urgent need for intervention by the Australian and Queensland Governments.


The WWF concludes its Great Barrier Reef media release by demanding that the Queensland government take tougher action on laws to cut farm run-off. This is the very same WWF some cattle producers sit down around the table with. WWF cannot be trusted, and primary producers should have nothing to do with them.


Just a week after WWF attacked Queensland farmers for single-handedly destroying the Great Barrier Reef, Australian fishermen found out what WWF really thinks about commercial fishing—especially trawling. The International President of WWF, Ms Yolanda Kakabadse, told the Australian media that trawling should be banned here. She was completely unequivocal in what she said:


Australia should show leadership and ban trawling altogether—


ban trawling altogether were her words—


to promote sustainable fishing in the region.


Of course, there are at least three Australian trawling fleets that are paying WWF big money to have their trawling operations given sustainability certification by WWF's Marine Stewardship Council, so the international president's ban trawling statement sent local WWF staff scrambling to put some backspin on her media comments. But Ms Kakabadse is no novice. She is a former federal Minister of Environment in Ecuador, and I am sure she meant what she said, 'Australia should ban trawling altogether'. So, now we know the endgame for WWF International, no matter what local WWF staffers might be telling us and the Australian fishing industry.


I again warn all primary producers to address this issue now. Just because it may not be happening to your sector right now, do not think it will not happen. It will happen. The question is not 'if' but simply 'when'. In the same way that our primary producers stand together to fight fires, floods and other threats, it is time to stand together to fight the scourge of 'greenmail' and the extortion attempts behind these extensive, expensive, unnecessary NGO-driven sustainability certification schemes. And they will be using their tax-exempt income to fund it!

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (10:32):  I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the debate. The establishment of the ACNC is positive and future-focused reform. It is evidence-based structural reform which review after review has recommended. It is reform which the NFP sector strongly supports.


The NFP sector is large and diverse, forming a key part of Australia's community and providing many important services to the disadvantaged and to those in need. As the NFP sector grows it is important to support the sector by smarter and better regulation. The NFP sector has made it clear that it wants an independent regulator with a greater focus on the needs of the sector. The ACNC will be that independent and dedicated regulator. The ACNC will drive a reduction in the regulatory burden on the NFP sector.


With the establishment of the ACNC we will have a platform for a national approach to NFP regulation. As the NFP sector grows it will be vital to support this growth by enabling the sector to consolidate its standing in the community through improved transparency and accountability.




Senator Cormann:
  More red tape!




Senator CONROY:
  I note that a senator on the opposite side did interject there. A senator who sits there and votes against the deregulation of the wheat market should not really say anything about regulation. You really should not open up a debate about regulation when you are voting for more regulation in the wheat sector.




Senator Cormann:
  No, I'm not.




Senator CONROY:
  Yes you are. We are voting to deregulate the wheat sector and you are saying no.




Senator Cormann:
  Let's see what you're doing!




Senator CONROY:
  You are saying no. So do not interject and distract in this debate; your credibility on this issue is zero, Senator Cormann, as you are going to continue to interject.


This government is undertaking forward-thinking and evidence-based reform now to avoid a knee-jerk regulatory response to any issues that may arise as the sector grows.


In conclusion, the Senate will vote shortly on legislation to establish the ACNC. It has taken many years to get to this position, but after numerous reviews and reports, extensive consultation and stakeholder engagement and three parliamentary inquiries into the ACNC bills, the time has come for this important reform. The government wants to support and sustain a vibrant, independent and innovative NFP sector. Those supporting these bills in the Senate today share this aim. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:44):  The Prime Minister is to be congratulated on the leadership and vision she has offered our nation through the Australia in the Asian Century white paper, unveiled last Sunday. As we know, the white paper delivers a bold, comprehensive and pragmatic blueprint for policymakers both within the government and in the wider community, particularly those driving policy within industry and education.


The Asian century white paper is both solidly pragmatic and boldly strategic. The white paper is pragmatic because it responds shrewdly to the realities of the world we find ourselves in as a nation—a world in which over the past 20 years China and India have increased their absolute economic size almost six times over and have tripled their share of the global economy; a world in which by the end of this decade Asia will overtake the economic output of Europe and North America combined; a world in which by 2025 our Asian region as a whole will account for almost half the world's output. The white paper is boldly strategic because, as the Prime Minister has reminded us, 'The whole world is moving eastwards,' and that places our nation of Australia in a uniquely advantageous position. Our geographic location, our high standard of living, along with our well-resourced and highly skilled education sector can and will provide Australia with a valuable edge, if the government is given the opportunity to lead our nation into the Asian century.


Of course, a central feature of the Prime Minister's bold vision for our nation is education. The Asian century will afford Australia countless opportunities to boost our national income and lift productivity. But in order to take advantage of those opportunities we must as a nation become 'Asia literate'—that is, all Australian students must gain a better understanding of the culture, history and languages of Asia. In this way, future Australians will be equipped to engage meaningfully and productively with our Asian neighbours, who are rapidly becoming the economic powerhouse of the world and are increasing in global strategic importance.


The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett, has been explaining to the public how Asian literacy will be achieved through the three educational objectives to be implemented nationally. Those objectives, as you know, are: that every Australian student will have significant exposure to studies of Asia across the curriculum to increase their cultural knowledge; that all students will have the opportunity to study an Asian language from their first day of school through to year 12—priority Asian languages will include Chinese-Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese; and that Australia's school system will be in the top five schooling systems in the world, delivering excellent outcomes for all students of all backgrounds and systematically improving performance over time, as outlined in the National Plan for School Improvement. These are bold objectives but ones that must be pursued if Australia is to position itself to harvest the rich opportunities that the growth of the Chinese, Indian and Indonesian economies will present. If we are strategic in our education policy, we can create thousands of high-tech, high-skill and high-wage jobs for Australians.


In concrete terms, the government will require that, from the first day of school, all students will have the opportunity to study Asian culture, history and languages, and all Australian schools will engage with at least one school in Asia to support the teaching of a priority Asian language including through increased use of the much anticipated and beneficial National Broadband Network. The Commonwealth government will negotiate these educational reforms with the states and territories under the National Plan for School Improvement. The government have already made it clear that we are prepared to pay our fair share in delivering the National Plan for School Improvement, including the Asian languages objective.


The visionary educational objectives of the Australia in the Asian Century white paper will build on the significant investments already being delivered by the Gillard government in education, including: $62 million to increase the number of Australian students becoming proficient in languages and understanding the culture of China, Indonesia, Japan and Korea under the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program; $41.2 million to support flexible delivery of language education, including online materials for teaching students in key areas, including about Australia's engagement with Asia; $22.8 million to promote the study of Asia across all curriculum areas in Australian schools through the Asia Education Foundation; substantial investment in developing languages curriculums, with Chinese-Mandarin being one of the first developed; and $27.2 million for the NBN-Enabled Education and Skills Services Program, including the Asia ConneXions Utilising HD-Videoconferencing project.


Given the investment the government is already making and is committed to continue making in negotiation with the states and territories, it is disappointing to see the negative reaction of the Liberal states, especially when you consider that the white paper has been warmly welcomed by business and Asian experts. Industry has no problem understanding the importance of Asian literacy for Australian prosperity. That is why employer groups have welcomed the white paper. Jock Laurie of the National Farmers Federation is just one industry spokesperson who has welcomed the white paper, saying in his statement to the Adelaide Advertiser:


… the important role for farmers in providing food, fibre, knowledge and expertise to the Asian region, and the challenges we must overcome to succeed in doing so, have been recognised.


That is why the government will push on, regardless of the nay-sayers, and work with business and community groups to encourage students to study Asian languages, history and culture.


The Gillard government, along with Australian industry, understand that we face a choice as a nation: either we drift into our future, as the opposition would have us do, or we actively shape it. The Prime Minister's white paper is a bold attempt to respond creatively and strategically to the world in which our nation finds itself at the dawn of the Asian century. It reminds us that how we are positioned as a nation in 10 years from now, in 20 years from now and in 50 years from now will depend on the choices we make, the directions we take and the policies we implement now. We cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand and wait for the future to happen to us. We cannot afford to sit around braying like Mr Hockey on Lateline last Sunday that planning strategically for Australia's future is 'a waste of time'. The Gillard government's plans for Australian education are visionary. Our determination to make Asia literacy a core feature of Australian education and industry is ambitious but it is also necessary and it demonstrates this government's commitment to act now to ensure a promising future for our children and grandchildren.


But what vision does the opposition have to offer Australia? If the Prime Minister's white paper is a 'waste of time', as Mr Hockey would have us believe, let us hear what the opposition has been spending its time planning. Let us hear what directions the opposition is setting, what decisions they are making, what policies they are seeking to implement to achieve the best educational outcomes for Australian children and to ensure the welfare of Australian families. We know what the opposition has been planning. Mr Hockey announced it proudly on last Sunday's Insiders program. Let me outline for you the opposition's bold vision for the future of Australian schools and for the welfare of Australian families. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you know better than I what your plan is. 


For a start, Mr Hockey announced proudly that the opposition plans to destroy, at its first opportunity, Labor's Schoolkids Bonus. This visionary piece of policy will hurt 1.3 million families straight off the bat. For those 1.3 million families—families whom our government has determined can do with a little extra help with their educational expenses—Labor's Schoolkids Bonus is worth $410 a year for each primary school aged child and $820 a year for each of their high school children. It is not much, some may say, but it makes a big difference to Australian families with children at school who are struggling to make financial ends meet. It is not a lot, perhaps, but over the duration of a child's education it equates to significant assistance to their family. By destroying Labor's Schoolkids Bonus the Liberals intend to rip away about $15,000 from a typical family with two children over the time that their children are at school. 


And how did Mr Hockey justify the opposition's plans to sabotage much-needed assistance to these 1.3 million families with school children? He claimed, ignorantly—very ignorantly for a shadow Treasurer—that the Schoolkids Bonus is budgeted to be funded by the mining tax. But Mr Hockey knows by now, if he did not know before, that the money for the Schoolkids Bonus has already been accounted for in the federal budget and has nothing to do with the mining tax. So it is clear that the opposition's plan to scrap the Schoolkids Bonus is not a reaction to a projected shortfall in income from the mining tax, as Mr Hockey would have us believe. It is not a reaction, it is a deliberate policy decision. It is part of the opposition's 'grand vision' for Australian education. The opposition wants to rip $15,000 away from a typical family over the course of the schooling of their children not because of anything the Labor government has or has not done. They want to do it because they believe it is good policy. So that is step 1 in the opposition's grand vision for Australian families and Australian education. 


What is step 2? Again, according to Mr Hockey on Lateline, if the opposition get into office we can count on them to not reinstate the education tax refund. So they will destroy the Schoolkids Bonus, ripping $15,000 from a typical family over the course of their children's schooling, but they will not replace it with their own education tax rebate. And this is despite the fact that their own website currently advertises their promised commitment to increase the tax rebate for children's education. I have it here; I printed it off their own website. Their 'Real Action Plan' to reduce pressure on families hinges on 'increasing and expanding' the tax rebate for children's school expenses. So one has to ask the question: when it comes to opposition policy on financial assistance to families with school children, which Real Action Plan is the real action plan? Is the real action plan the one they promised which is still advertised on their website or is the real action plan the one announced by their shadow Treasurer on national television? The opposition's grand vision for helping Australian families and improving Australian education promises no Schoolkids Bonus and no education tax rebate. 


But wait, there's more. It seems the shadow Treasurer's ambition for our nation knows no bounds. Mr Hockey also confirmed loud and clear on Lateline that the Liberal Party plans to slash up to $600 a year in extra family tax benefit payments. This means that 1.5 million Australian families will lose up to another $600 from their annual budgets. And all this is on top of the Liberals' planned cuts to the household assistance package which includes tax cuts for workers and increased family payments and pensions. The Labor Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, put it correctly when she said that Joe Hockey's plan is 'to wreck the household budgets of Australian families'. So the opposition's grand vision for Australian families and Australian education hinges on misinformation, cutbacks and negativity.


Mr Hockey also tried to convince the Australian people that the Australian economy has collapsed and is flatlining. And this is despite midyear budget predictions which give every indication that the economy will continue to grow close to three per cent this financial year. It seems pretty clear to me that the only thing that has collapsed or is flatlining at the moment is the opposition's sense of vision for the future of this nation. Their imagination has flatlined, their ambition has flatlined, their courage has flatlined. They have no positive vision to offer. All they have left to give us are misinformed justifications for negative policies and complaints that our visionary policies are 'a waste of time'.


In contrast, Labor offers our nation the bold vision of the Prime Minister's Asian century white paper, a vision which, as I said, is both solidly pragmatic and shrewdly strategic. Our Prime Minister has made a choice. She has chosen to set a clear direction for our nation. She has chosen to implement policies now that will pay dividends for our children and grandchildren into the future. The nation as a whole also needs to make a choice. Leaders in education, industry and the community need to make a choice: either we follow the Prime Minister's leadership and position ourselves strategically for the Asian century, or we hang back with the opposition and wait for the future to happen to us, hoping it will all turn out all right.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:05):  On Monday, 29 October, Senator Nash asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing a question on the medical workforce. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



Senator Nash asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Senate on, Monday, 29 October 2012:


Does the minister agree that people studying medicine in Australia have a reasonable expectation of being provided internships in Australia in order to complete their qualifications?


Senator Ludwig — The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:


The provision of medical intern training is the responsibility of state and territory governments. Under a COAG agreement, State and territory governments guarantee internships for domestic students.


My understanding is that students who come from overseas to study medicine in Australia are informed by universities that an internship at the completion of their degree is not guaranteed.


Despite this, the Gillard Government is concerned that up to 180 international graduates of Australian medical schools have not yet been offered internships in public hospitals in 2013. Australia needs more doctors to provide health services to the community, and short term cost cutting in public health systems shouldn't jeopardise the training of our future health workforce.


Overseas doctors make an important contribution to the Australian health system, so it is clear that we should be making the best use of those who have been trained in this country.


The Government is urging the states and territories to take action that will see all 2012 medical graduates placed as soon as possible in internship positions. The Government has offered $10 million to fund up to 100 internship places in private hospitals — well over half the expected shortfall in positions. We call on the states and territories to work in partnership with the Australian Government and commit to providing internships for remaining graduates of Australian medical schools next year.


The Government has massively expanded investment in medical training since 2008. The Gillard Government has provided about $1.2 billion to support the training of medical students in Australian universities and invested $1.06 billion in junior doctor, GP and specialist training for medical graduates from 2010-11 to 2014-15. This is producing world-class doctors, and increasing the number of Australian-trained doctors.


Senator Nash asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Senate on, Monday, 29 October 2012:


Is the minister then aware that the Minister for Health, Ms Plibersek, said on ABC Newcastle that part of this is a good news story. Can the minister explain what part of sending Australian internships overseas is a 'good news story'? What is the point of training more medical students through Australian universities if they cannot finish their training in this country?


Senator Ludwig — The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:


The Senator has answered her own question in acknowledging that we are now training more medical students in this country than ever before. Total medical graduates from Australian medical schools will more than double over 9 years from 2007-2016 (from 1860 to 3970). That's good news for Australia.


The Gillard Government has provided about $1.2 billion since 2008 to support the training of medical students in Australian universities, and invested over $1.0 billion in junior doctor, GP and specialist training for medical graduates from 2010-11 to 2014-15. This is producing world-class doctors, and increasing the number of Australian trained doctors. That's good news too.


It's also good news that this Government is willing to pitch in and help states and territories to find internships for 2012 medical graduates by offering to fund up to 100 internships in private hospitals. The only thing missing from this good news story is commitment by the state and territories to follow the Commonwealth's lead and support Australia's health workforce by funding the remaining positions.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


The mining tax has been a dog's breakfast for some time. The mining tax is an ongoing fiscal fiasco which we have argued for some time is a train wreck in the making. But not even the coalition thought that the mining tax would be such a fiscal mess as it has turned out to be. Last week we all found out that this complex new tax targeting an important sector in our economy, which is costly to administer, costly to comply with and which increased our sovereign risk profile, has not raised any revenue—at least not from those three biggest miners who were given exclusive access to the government to help design it.


One of the key implications of the fact that those three biggest miners are not paying any mining tax so far is that they will continue to accumulate royalty credits. You would be aware that back in July 2010 the Prime Minister and the Treasurer signed this mining tax deal with the managing directors of the three biggest mining companies. They had thrown out all of the officials. The officials in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were quite insistent in Senate estimates to say that on this occasion, before signing on the dotted line, the Prime Minister did not get advice from the Prime Minister's department. The Prime Minister on that occasion got her advice directly from the Treasurer. It was our Treasurer, Mr Swan, who advised the Prime Minister to sign this mining tax deal.


The government initially thought that this mining tax would raise $22½ billion over the initial four years of operation. That went all the way down to $13.4 billion in the most recent budget. In MYEFO we were told it would be $9.1 billion. It turns out that in the first quarter it has not raised anything, at least from those three big miners. No wonder the government was so desperate to rush out the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook on the day it was released, because that was the same day that the first mining tax revenue collection was due.


Here we are and the government is not raising any mining tax revenue. In the meantime, courtesy of the deal that Prime Minister and the Treasurer signed with those three big mining companies, they are accumulating credits for the state royalties they have paid to the state governments. But there is more. Not only are those mining companies accumulating credits but also the government will have to pay compound interest on those credits. It is not a bad rate of return either. It is a risk-free rate of return, and anybody who can get a risk-free rate of return of more than 10 per cent would be pretty happy. That is exactly what the government signed up to in the mining tax heads of agreement that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is clearly not across although it is a mere 1½ pages long. I suggest the finance minister has a close look at it. This is what it says:


All state and territory royalties will be creditable against the resources tax liability.


Then:


Any royalties paid and not claimed—


of course, you cannot claim any royalties if you have not paid any mining tax—


as a credit will be carried forward at the uplift rate of the long-term bond rate—


which right now is 3.12 per cent—


plus seven per cent.


That is a 10.12 per cent interest rate that is applied to the outstanding royalty credits. 


I refer the minister to be government's Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act and specifically section 60-25 part (2) where it describes how royalty credits are treated. When you look at the operation of the MRRT royalty credits from year to year you will see that the interest in any year will include the accumulated credit of the previous year plus interest. It is interest on interest, and that is what you call compound interest.


We have said for some time that this mining tax is not going to raise any money for a long time. It is a complex tax which is distorting, making it harder for smaller miners in particular to be the success stories of tomorrow. At the same time this incompetent Treasurer has attached billions of dollars of expenditure to this mining tax based on the revenue he thought it would raise. This is just extraordinary. No wonder this government has delivered $173 billion of accumulated deficits. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  I too rise to take note of answers to questions asked today of Minister Wong in particular. I was quite taken by Senator Cormann's alliteration. He loves to use the expression 'fiscal fiasco'. I do not know if he has heard of the latest fiscal fiasco in New South Wales where the Treasurer has discovered a $1 billion mistake in his budget which means that many of the cuts that the New South Wales government has made to community services and schools could be challenged and addressed. I will be taking that up with my local member around the issue of community services.


The questions today go in many respects to the fact that the opposition continue to talk down the economy. They fail to acknowledge the fact that we are doing so well. Last week I was at the IPU in Canada. In every bilateral meeting the question was: what is happening? What is the recipe for success in Australia? The recipe for success is responsible government spending as well as responsible government savings. We have made a serious effort and we are the envy of the world. It frustrates me to think that for people who listen to questions in question time and the discussions in our parliament, they do not understand how well Australia is performing in terms of the global the economy and the measurements that are taken by organisations like the OECD.


Senator Wong today reminded us of 21 years of economic growth. That is very significant, a stunning achievement that has not been matched by any other economy in the world. People want to know how and why we are doing it. Solid growth against the odds and low unemployment—significantly lower than in other developed countries. These are achievements we should be very proud of. We have also contained inflation. In Argentina last week we heard many discussions on the real concerns that inflation is increasing. Some people estimate that it is up to 25 per cent in Argentina. We do not have to deal with anything like that in Australia. We have strong public finances and strong public and private savings. We have solid consumption and we have investment growth. This is all very positive news.


We have low official interest rates. Again, Minister Wong spoke about how those rates compare internationally. We now have official interest rates lower than at any time under the last Liberal government. These low rates are of direct benefit to millions of families and to millions of small businesses. We have just overtaken Spain as the 12th largest economy in the world. But what we hear from the opposition is continued carping and negativity about Australia's economic situation. Anyone would think we are all going to be ruined, and it drives me insane that this is the case. We certainly will not be ruined by the outcome of the MYEFO and the decisions that were taken by Treasury to make sure that the economy maintains stability and that the budget is returned to surplus, because our fundamentals are strong, despite the global turmoil. We only have to think about what is happening this week in the US and how the costs of a natural disaster like that are going to impact on the US economy—



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator STEPHENS:
  No, not the US election; I am talking about the US economy. The extensive devastation and the break in productivity that will occur after this US disaster are things that we really do need to be very mindful of. This will have an impact around the world and it is certainly something that we need to be thinking about.


We need to make sure that we are doing the responsible things that we need to do as a government. That is what we saw in MYEFO. We saw responsible savings that will continue to ensure that we are performing well. The Treasurer and the economic team have continued to forecast the message that we as a government are going to do everything we can to ensure that low- and middle-income people benefit from a strong budget and a strong economy—and we will continue to do that.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  Interestingly enough, I have learned, as some of my colleagues would know, to become a student of form in recent years. And, given we are in Spring Carnival time, I think it is probably a good time to study the form that is in fact to the fore of the debate here. On the form, on the history of Labor governments and, more particularly, on the sad and sorry story that is this Labor government, the form tells me that it is looking more and more unlikely that Labor will actually make a surplus. I think they might even abandon their promise to return to surplus, on the form that we see in front of us at the moment. After all, why else would they have brought forward the MYEFO to October—for only the third time in history? They must be worried about something.


They have themselves wedded to the 'return to surplus' mantra, but their resolve, it seems to me, seems to be weakening. Just listen to the change in words used by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—moving from their 'promise' to much more weasely words. It was a surplus which was 'promised' to start at $3 billion but was reduced to $1.5 billion in the last budget. Now, if you just move the numbers around a little more under the thimbles, you get to $1.1 billion. So let us hope, for the sake of the Australian people, that those thimbles do not move too much further. They have brought $2 billion out of the Future Fund into the budget to save just over $400 million this financial year—and then they launch into the superannuation accounts of Australian workers to try to find themselves $500 million more.


There are a lot of things you hear in coffee shops around the towns and cities of this country. But I was actually sat back on my chair by a woman the other day who was talking to her ageing parents. She said to her ageing parents—



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator PAYNE:
  Well, I did leave; there were some undesirables. She said to her ageing parents—



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator PAYNE:
  No, they were members of the Labor Party, Senator. I heard her say to her parents, 'You know; if Gillard does that'—and I am quoting; not using an inappropriate term—'that's the end of it for me and it should be the end of it for every other Labor voter.' That is just coffee chat; that is not people on a political soapbox or anything like that. It is falling apart at the seams for this government.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator PAYNE:
  The person who should be listening to that is the member for Lindsay—but, of course, he and his glass jaw will be off somewhere else on a patrol boat doing something entirely different. This whole government is falling apart at the seams. It is a 'commitment' and a 'promise' that is apparently now a 'plan' and a 'determination' to deliver a surplus. It is absolutely typical of a crazy-spending, irresponsible government that has absolutely no plan to fill a gaping $120 billion black hole in its own budget. It is absolutely inconceivable that the Australian people would trust this government to deliver even a $1.1 billion surplus or any surplus at all with the red ink that is flooding across the pages of their balance sheet.


Apparently the Treasurer thought that delivering a surplus was as easy as raking off the record profits from Australia's miners through the MRRT. Wrong again. Now the government, apparently, is going to receive nothing meaningful from the MRRT. Only a government that could invent a carbon tax that costs more money than it recoups, than it takes in, could conjure up a tax that raises no money. If it were not so serious it would be funny. 


In fact, I am not entirely sure it is not an episode of TheHollowmen. I am just waiting for Rob Sitch and Lachie Hulme to pop up in various roles across the chamber—and, I am sad to say, neither Rob nor Lachie will be playing Senator Feeney in that regard—and to pop up in the House of Representatives and say: 'It’s ok; it was a joke. It's a script for TheHollowmen.' But, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a script for TheHollowmen; it is our country; it is our economy; it is the Australian people—it is their lives, it is their livelihoods, it is their businesses.


Fifteen billion dollars of the MRRT windfall was promised to people who probably fell for The Hollowmen joke and who thought that there really would be regional infrastructure funds paid for, superannuation increases paid for and concessions to small business paid for. But they will not be paid for by the MRRT; they will be lost in the vortex of Labor spin that is this government and this budget—and the Australian people deserve better. (Time expired)

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  Mr Deputy President, through you, I would like to thank Senator Payne for sharing with us her thoughts about TV programs. But we are actually here today taking note of answers, to talk about the economy—because that is what question time was largely about today. The minerals resource rent tax was always likely to be a volatile tax. The PRRT did not generate the dollars that it was expected to at the time that it was introduced many years ago. In fact, it made about half the amount of revenue that was forecast. I am somewhat surprised that those opposite seem to be so opposed to the idea of progressive taxation as opposed to royalties on Australia's mining companies—particularly at a time when we know that commodity prices have fallen. We want to keep strength in the Australian economy, and it completely befuddles me why those opposite do not subscribe to the idea of progressive taxation—taxation based on profits, which have clearly fallen given the fact that commodity prices have fallen. It is not within their economic rhetoric. I do not believe that those opposite, when they were in government, taxed nearly enough of the super profits that were made by many of Australia's mining companies. Frankly, I would say the same of my own state Labor government under its royalties regimes. The simple fact is that this government has delivered a surplus. Those opposite have tried to argue that there is no surplus. We have just delivered a midyear economic forecast with billions of dollars worth of savings to return the budget to surplus as forecast. We are committed and we are very much on track to deliver it. This is really very important, because a budget surplus gives the Reserve Bank the flexibility that we want them to have to keep interest rates in this nation low—as it has several times in the past year when it has cut interest rates. This is of maximum benefit to the Australian economy and to Australian households.


What we are about are fiscal settings that will always be appropriate for our economy, for the nation and for the jobs that we seek to create. That will never change. These are Labor's values and Labor's priorities. That is why this government stepped in to support the economy at the height of the global financial crisis. We have had some debate today about the so-called success of the stimulus package. It was successful, and it is proven by the 200,000 jobs that were saved at a time when many economies around the world were losing jobs hand over fist. 


What have we got from the opposition at this time? What have we got when it comes to their economic fundamentals? We have a Liberal Party with a $70 billion budget crater. We know, because they said it on Sunrise, and they have never been able to refute it. We have a party that has botched their costings, and we have a party that voted against the stimulus package—voted against the very measures that have saved hundreds of thousands of Australians' jobs and have kept momentum in our economy. If we had taken their advice during the global financial crisis, we would have been in recession and I think we would be in a much greater state of deficit. It would be much harder to come to surplus, because the momentum would be completely sucked out of the economy.


We should not forget that official interest rates are now less than half the level that the government inherited from those opposite. That speaks to our good economic management and the fact that we are making the right decisions to put downward pressure on interest rates. We have a proven track record of putting in place the fiscal settings that are appropriate for our economy. (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (15:26):  I have sat in this chamber for 14 days now, and I have endured 14 hours of question time. In that time, I honestly do not think that I have heard a question answered that has been put to the other side by the Liberal Party, the Nationals, the Independents or even the Greens. I am sure it is not a new phenomenon over the last 14 days. I am sure that questions have not been answered for a lot longer than that. I do not think that is acceptable. It is an extraordinary waste of everybody's time, and I think it is deflecting us from the real issues that we should be here talking about.


Today, again, there were a whole heap of questions asked in relation to the so-called budget surplus. It now seems that that budget surplus may not eventuate. I believe that over the last 18 months the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, collectively, have said 45 times that it was entirely not negotiable and we were going to have a budget surplus. So I can only hope that the assurances from the other side are true and that we are going to get a budget surplus.


The question that we really need to ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is: if this budget surplus is not going to be achievable, how long have they known that it was not going to be achievable and when are they actually going to come clean on it? Only a matter of a couple of months ago, I was running my own business. A lot of the decisions that I make in my own business are based on the information that is in the market. If this government knows that we are not going to have a budget surplus, they have got a responsibility to tell the people of Australia that we are not going to have one, so that they can use that market information to make the kind of investment decisions that they need in their business. I think it is an absolute disgrace if we are not getting that information. If business fails to provide that sort of information about the market, ASIC comes down on them like an absolute tonne of bricks. So why is it that the government can fail to provide information to the market that could reasonably be expected to mislead the market and have significant consequences? 


Moving on from the fact that there seems to be one rule for the government and one rule for the rest of us, what of the MRRT? Where are the plans and what are the projects in relation to filling and plugging that gap with these billions of dollars that we were supposedly going to get but have not seen? We need to know what projects are going to be funded and what projects are not going to be funded. Are there projects that are going to be shelved? My understanding is that we did warn the government when this mining tax was brought in that it was highly unlikely that there was going to be any money earned from the tax—certainly in the short term. And yet now we have got a situation where they have not earned any money and yet they have allocated projects against the revenue before it was even earned. 


As for so many promises that were on the agenda, we need to know which ones are going to be off the agenda, because we do not have the money to pay for them. It is the same as all those other projects that we seem to have been promised. Where is the money for the National Disability Insurance Scheme? Where is the money for the dental scheme? Who is going to fund Gonski? The list goes on and on and on.


I suggest that the people of Australia are, justifiably, getting pretty sick of these promises that are never likely to eventuate, and they are certainly understandably peeved they have been constantly misled. 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'; now we have a carbon tax. 'There will be no cuts to private health insurance'; there appear to be. 'There will be a $9 million windfall from the mining tax'; there is not much to show or account for that at the moment. 'There will be a surplus in 2012-13'; it does not look like it.


So today we have had questions from the opposition on the mining tax, the budget surplus, the national building scheme, the stimulus package and education spending. Today, have we had answers to any of them? Senator Pratt chastised Senator Payne for talking about TV when we are here today to talk about the really important issue of the economy. Maybe Senator Pratt should go back to her frontbench ministers and say that when they are asked questions about the economy they might like to answer them.


Senator Wong says, 'Don't talk down the economy.' I do not think we are talking down the economy. I think what we want to know is the actual truth about things out there. We are sick to death of rhetoric. If you give us the answers, we will not be talking down the economy, we will just be providing correct market information. Finally, the public are not stupid, so stop treating them as if they are stupid and give us the information so we can decide whether you are a good enough government. (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-10-31,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:44):  You can tell at the outset the matters of public importance written by the Australian Greens compared to those that are written by the coalition. This is a matter of great urgency. I want to begin with the international law dimensions because the matter raised does speak directly to the fact that sales of uranium to a country that stands outside the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are illegal at international law. Australia is, of course, a signatory to the treaty of Rarotonga. For senators who are not aware, that is the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. It creates a geographical region in which nuclear weapons are banned, but it does more than that. It stipulates that a condition of nuclear trade is full-scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Senators may not have been aware that the only way you get full-scope safeguards with the IAEA is by signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty; and it is because Australia has these treaty commitments that every Australian government for the last 41 years has upheld the principle of not selling uranium to non-NPT states.


Here is somebody I would not normally quote in the Senate. In fact, this might be the first time I have ever done so. The current Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, said in 2006, from opposition:


As the second biggest supplier of uranium, Australia cannot have one set of rules for some countries and another set for others … Labor calls on John Howard to clarify his support for the NPT and rule out the export of uranium to any state unless and until that state joins the NPT.


What a difference a change of government makes. Minister Ferguson, who has since then been a diligent sock puppet on behalf of the interests of the uranium mining industry, has completely turned that former position on its head. What interesting timing for Australia to be undermining international laws and treaties, just when we have secured a seat on the United Nations Security Council. The same UNSC in 1998, after India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons, adopted resolution 1172, and it is worth quoting from. That resolution:



Encourages all States to prevent the export of equipment, materials or technology that could in any way assist programmes in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons or for ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons, and welcomes national policies adopted and declared in this respect;


Some senators might remember the Cold War and the Cold War suicide pact between the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the various alliances that shifted during the period of the Cold War. During that nuclear suicide pact, fortunately, although these weapons were never stood down, the finger stayed off the button. But we still have nuclear weapons targeted on the subcontinent at the enormous metropolises of Delhi, Bombay, Karachi and Islamabad. India and Pakistan are engaged in an active and expanding nuclear arms race in the Asia-Pacific region. What a remarkable contribution to the Asian century it will be to have Australia's name on a piece of paper saying that we do not particularly care about fuelling that arms race.


I understand that senators might be a little uneasy and I know there are many of them inside the Labor Party; I have always suspected there would be a handful inside the coalition, but they are very, very quiet—I am sure they are there. They would be very uneasy about expanding the uranium trade to India.



Senator Mark Bishop interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I can dream, Senator Bishop. You never know. But senators would at least want to know that the safeguards regime is watertight and that—and I suspect there is total agreement in the chamber on this matter—Australian uranium will not end up in nuclear weapons in India or anywhere else. I see some nodding, so I sense that is correct. Tell me, if you will, how a safeguards agreement would cope with the following. The former head of the national security advisory board in India suggested this in 2005—see if this sounds familiar:


Given India's uranium ore crunch and the need to build up our … nuclear deterrent arsenal as fast as possible, it is to India's advantage to categorise as many power reactors as possible as civilian ones to be refuelled by imported uranium and conserve our native uranium fuel for weapons-grade plutonium production.


Somebody tell me how a safeguards agreement can be written to prevent the Indian authorities from doing exactly that. Nobody is making eye contact anymore; isn't that interesting.


My colleague Senator Waters will discuss how Campbell Newman, inspired by the sale of uranium to India, swiftly dumped a clear election commitment not to mine uranium in Queensland. The rest of the country is watching with a kind of horrified fascination as Campbell Newman abolishes the Public Service and runs absolutely roughshod across environmental regulations in Queensland. I will leave those comments to Senator Waters. Senator Rhiannon will discuss the dopey reversal of the 26-year ban on uranium mining in New South Wales earlier this year. That was very, very carefully dealt with during the election campaign because it is a nasty thing to talk about. Nobody goes into an election campaign promising to expand exports of a carcinogenic material, apart from Western Australia, actually. So let us go there. I will focus my remarks on what is happening in my home state of WA.


Many people in WA are very deeply concerned about the prospect of Toro. They are a small exploration outfit; they have no cash reserves; they have never actually run a mine; their parent company, OZ Minerals, describes them as a non-core asset. They are proposing to strip mine a relatively small by international standards calcrete deposit across an ephemeral watercourse that runs into a salt lake, Lake Way, in the north-east goldfields. The Western Australian government's Environmental Protection Authority took a look at it, and I would observe that that name was not intended to be ironic—that you would have an environmental protection authority and you would hope that its objectives would be based on protecting the environment, but that appears to have fallen by the wayside. Based on remarkably sketchy and insufficient evidence and the complete absence of some very important pieces of information, the EPA has given it the tick, as we knew it would. 


The Barnett coalition government in Western Australia has turned the environmental impact assessment process into a one-way foregone conclusion. Nobody seriously believed that the EPA was going to knock that proposal out on the grounds that it did not satisfy the EPA's objectives. This is a uranium mine that has a proposed 14-year lifespan, but the company can only tell us where it is getting its water from for the first seven years. After that, I guess we just have to hope for the best. In a state with so many mining projects, with fully allocated surface water resources and a very well documented decline in rainfall, that is completely unacceptable.


Minister Tony Burke, in my view, is entirely within his rights to ask the company where it plans on getting the water for the second half of the mine life. He should ask the Western Australian government to do its job so that he can do the job assigned to him under the Commonwealth EPBC Act. He cannot do his job in assessing this project if he is not provided with the information that was required by law. The Barnett government and Toro have failed to do that. The minister does not get to be pro-nuclear or antinuclear, and I think that is kind of sad but I respect that his act says he assesses the project according to the law. It is my view that he cannot do that at the moment because Toro have not presented their proposal in full. The director-general of the WA Department for the Environment and Conservation has stated that there is a significant risk of loss of another individual taxon, probably at both species and subspecies level, of Tecticornia should the project proceed as proposed. So a uranium mine that will leave a permanent carcinogenic hotspot across a salt lake bed in the north-east goldfields may also wipe out a number of listed species. That is fantastic news. I wonder if anybody else would care to address those concerns on the way through.


The Commonwealth environment minister by law cannot preside knowingly over the destruction of species. He cannot preside over the extinction of particular species. So you would think that the proper studies and information would be provided, for example on stygofauna, nominated by the WA EPA as a threatened ecological species in 2008. But, no, we have this headlong rush to get the first uranium proposal up before the next state election. Those are the kinds of imperatives we are dealing with here. It is pretty offensive. Nobody, certainly not Toro, not Colin Barnett or the industry's man in Canberra, Martin Ferguson, appears to give a rat's.




Senator Cormann:
  He is actually a good Labor minister.




Senator LUDLAM:
  He is one of yours, Senator Cormann.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Interjections are disorderly. And direct your remarks to the chair, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  My apologies, Deputy President. But it is worth noting, isn't it, the number of times that coalition MPs in this place and the other will claim Martin Ferguson as one of their own.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I may be mistaken but I thought I heard Senator Ludlam use the phrase 'don't give a rat's', which I think is bordering on the unparliamentary. We know what the 'dot, dot, dot' is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The 'dot, dot, dot' was not emphasised, if that is the case. Senator Ludlam is in order.




Senator Fifield:
  Does not give a rat's what?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield, I am not going to debate the English language with you but I do not rule that disorderly. Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  That is an entirely sensible ruling, Deputy President. In conclusion, I quote a friend of mine and a great campaigner, Dave Sweeney from ACF: 'On a good day Australian uranium becomes nuclear waste and on a bad day it becomes fallout.' Right now that is fallout across Japan's Pacific coast. It has shattered the farming industry and the fishing industry, it has destroyed horticulture and it has led to the evacuation of 150,000 people. I used to wonder how the Australian government would react if uranium from Kakadu and uranium from central South Australia was blasted all across the landscape, forcing mass evacuations, destroying industries and destroying lives. Now I do not have to wonder because I know what the reaction is. People avoid eye contact. They shuffle their feet. They will not discuss it anymore. They pretend it is not our problem, and it is our problem. It is time we got out of this industry once and for all.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:55):  Here we go again. The Greens, the very bastion of moral purity, once again are telling us what is right and what is wrong: that it is right to have low carbon emissions but that it is wrong to have nuclear power; that it is right to bring the world out of poverty but that it is wrong to give people the tools they need to accomplish this. Once again in a demonstration of bizarre ethical ambiguity the Greens continue to want everything but to give nothing. Alas, what more can we expect from this confederacy of protest movements that is the Greens in the Senate.


Let us give the reality of this situation some perspective. India is a nation where 40 per cent of people live below the poverty line, a nation that by 2025 will outnumber China with a population of some 1.5 billion persons. It is a nation that is growing quickly, as is its energy consumption. It needs the sort of stable and affordable energy that as Australians we take for granted. Currently 40 per cent of Indians have access to electricity for less than 12 hours a day and an estimated 300 million people still lack access to energy there at all. I asked the Greens how one billion people of India are going to meet their energy needs without nuclear power. How will their nation modernise, how will they grow? And how will they do this without pumping hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere? Coal, or maybe wind turbines as far as the eye can see, stretching from Calcutta to Bangalore. Or maybe the Greens just think India should not have electricity at all. 


According to the Australian Academy of Sciences, for every 10,000 tonnes of Australian uranium we export we stop the generation of 400 million tonnes of CO2 from conventional power sources. That is quite a remarkable figure. How can the Greens sit here arguing that exporting uranium is wrong when it makes such a huge and clear difference not only to the lives of Indians but to our global environment. No matter how the Greens want to look at it, no matter how they paint it, the answer is the same: nuclear power equals development and the Greens want this stopped. 


This is perhaps the ideal example to highlight the failure of the Greens party to celebrate their naive views on foreign policy with reality. It is their stance on issues such as this one that shows why Australia will never accept the Greens as a government in its own right. They just do not have the pragmatism required. It is one thing to want the world to be a better place but quite another to make it happen. If we really want a global clean energy future, not just one for the rich and privileged, we need to acknowledge that for large developing countries, particularly a country such as India, nuclear energy is one of many strategies that must be employed if this is going to happen. Australia can afford the luxury of not using nuclear power but India is not so fortunate.




Senator Fifield:
  You pronounce nuclear the way George Bush did.




Senator FEENEY:
  I always welcome your contributions, Senator Fifield. It cannot be because India has nuclear weapons. We sell uranium to Russia and China, both of which are nuclear powers. Are the Greens afraid that India is engaged in some sort of regional arms race? China is engaged in one of the fastest military modernisations in recent history and yet obviously we continue to engage with China. They surely cannot be worried about nuclear proliferation. India tightly guards its nuclear technologies and has never been found guilty of proliferating those technologies. The Greens' stance only makes sense when we look at it from a pre-2007 perspective when not selling uranium to India was part of an international strategy to bring India into the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But this ended with the US-India nuclear agreement of 2007, which ended the international de facto ban on nuclear cooperation with India. So, although you may not agree with India's decision not to sign the non-proliferation treaty, you can certainly understand their reasoning, which is that it would force the world's largest democracy to abandon their nuclear weapons, despite the fact that the UK, the US, China, Russia and France are all allowed to hold on to theirs, and despite the fact that, on its very own border, Pakistan openly displays its nuclear capabilities. This is a treaty that asks India to have its own national security policy dictated to it by Western powers, and, no, this was not an arrangement that was ever realistic.


Until recently, Australia was the only nuclear supplier in the world that would not deal with India. Not surprisingly, this was offensive to a large trading partner. Last financial year, we exported almost 7,000 tonnes of uranium, with a value of around A$600 million, without adverse health or environmental consequences, but we did refuse to sell uranium to India. We have 33 per cent of the world's commercially recoverable uranium, and we are well placed to capitalise on growing global demand. This is an industry that can provide long-term economic benefits to Australia, including generating employment in regional areas, providing benefits to Indigenous populations and generating export income, yet the Greens still say, 'No, you cannot export to India.'


India's importance to Australia will only grow in the coming years, and a policy of choosing not to sell uranium to India would be an obstacle to developing the strategic and economic partnerships that we want and, indeed, that we need. Make no mistake about it: India will and does have nuclear power, whether the uranium comes from us or from somewhere else. So why not have some say over the process? Why not have some say over the protections and some influence in how uranium is safeguarded? But, once again, the Greens would rather vote for 100 per cent of nothing rather than for 80 per cent of something. That is the reasoning that caused them to vote against the CPRS bills not once but twice in this Senate, and that is the reasoning that saw them stand in the way of any cross-chamber arrangements regarding immigration laws.


The Greens do not think in terms of accomplishing reforms. They would rather Australia had no say, no control and no influence over the nuclear powers in our region. Selling uranium to India is not giving them a blank cheque. Let me be clear: exports will comply with our international legal obligations. But, before any exports of Australian uranium to India can take place, Australia and India need to negotiate and conclude a bilateral safeguards agreement. This agreement would address Australia's stringent safeguards and transparency requirements and would specify that the uranium may only be exported for peaceful, civil nuclear power generation.


The legislative framework in Australia is already in place to cater to this agreement. If there are any specific legal requirements in addition to the legislative framework, these will be addressed in the context of negotiations through our bilateral agreement. The Greens policy on this issue is illogical and it is hypocritical. They seek to damage our wider relationship with India but offer no viable alternatives. They continue with posturing and rhetoric but have no practical solutions.


India is the world's largest democracy, a sobering fact worth remembering. It is a fellow member of the Commonwealth, with a strong philosophical commitment to peace and cooperation. It is a law-governed state, with a free press and a vibrant civil society. It has proven over the decades to be a stable power in an increasingly hazardous region. I not only reject the Greens stance on this matter; I applaud the government for opening our borders and giving Australia a say on nuclear safeguards in India. I also say with some pride that this was a matter that was ventilated and robustly debated at the ALP National Conference. This is a conference that is open to the public—




Senator Brandis:
  Dominated by trade union thugs.




Senator FEENEY:
  a conference that is open to the press and open to the ramblings and raving criticisms of people such as Senator Brandis. It is a conference where the whole country can sit in judgement of our public policy processes and where ALP delegates can freely debate their ideas before coming to a final resolution. It is a process that stands in stark contrast to the continuing secrecy of the Greens and their decision-making processes and stands in stark contrast to the closed conferences and secret cabals that make up the decision-making process of their party, the last secretive party left in Australian public life.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:04):  As I have been sitting here, listening to Senator David Feeney, I have been grappling with a conundrum: which is the greater, the depth of ignorance of the Greens or the vastness of the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party? I am just not sure, but they are both vast indeed. To listen to Senator David Feeney address the Senate and go through all this pious rodomontade about how terrible the Australian Greens are, this formulaic denunciation of the Australian Greens and all they represent—whilst I might agree, by the way, with every word he has to say about the Australian Greens—omits one inconvenient truth, and that inconvenient truth is that the government of which Senator David Feeney is a member is in office today because of a written agreement, signed, sealed and delivered, between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens. Just as in the state of Tasmania the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens form a formal coalition government, here in the national capital they form an informal coalition government. So much for the hypocritical pieties of Senator David Feeney.


I rise to oppose the proposition in this matter of public importance because, as I said at the beginning, the only thing that rivals the vastness of the hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party is the depth of ignorance of the Australian Greens. It was on display again this afternoon in Senator Scott Ludlam's speech on the Treaty of Rarotonga. First of all, one would have thought that if one were going to bring on a matter of public importance debate about the Treaty of Rarotonga, it would be a good start to be able to spell it correctly. But, in fact, the Australian Greens are not even able to spell the name of the treaty which they seek to enforce. More importantly, it would be good as well if they understood what the treaty of Rarotonga stipulated. Unlike, apparently, Scott Ludlam and his flea-bitten cohort of former communists and well-meaning fools who constitute the Australian Greens, I have actually read the treaty. In fact, I have a certified copy of the treaty in my hand. Everything Senator Scott Ludlam had to say about the treaty of Rarotonga in relation to uranium sales to India is wrong. I take those who might be listening to this contribution to the provisions of article 4 of the treaty of Rarotonga, to which Australia is a signatory of course but which applies to the South-West Pacific zone. This treaty was entered into by a previous and more honourable federal Labor government, the government of Mr Bob Hawke. Article 4 of the treaty of Rarotonga states:


Each Party undertakes:


(a) not to provide source or special fissionable material—


which includes uranium—


to:


…   …   …


(ii) any nuclear-weapon State—


and we know that India is a nuclear weapon state—


unless subject to applicable safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).


Any such provisions shall be in accordance with strict non-proliferation measures to provide assurance of exclusively peaceful non-explosive use …


That is the obligation that Australia assumed when it signed the treaty of Rarotonga during the period of the Hawke government.


Senator Scott Ludlam, you are not right when you say that the prohibition lies on selling fissionable material to non-member states of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is a prohibition against selling material to nuclear weapon states with whom there exists no current safeguards agreement recognised by the International Atomic Energy Agency. There is a safeguards agreement; there will be a safeguards agreement. That is a point that I am sure Senator Mark Bishop, another member of the government supported by the Labor-Green's coalition, will make in his forthcoming contribution, upon which we wait with bated breath.


The substance of this issue is that throughout the entire life of this period of Labor government—this lamentable, corrupt, dishonest, incompetent, wasteful, spendthrift, profligate, hopeless Labor government—for the five years Australians have suffered under this Labor government, there has been nary any attention paid to the Indian subcontinent. Mr Kevin Rudd managed to visit India for one day during his prime ministership—a prime ministership, it must be said in his defence, was foreshortened very suddenly by a steel blade through the back from Ms Julia Gillard, his successor. Lo and behold, late in the piece Ms Julia Gillard, eager to seek photo opportunities, discovered India and visited India.


Mr Howard when he was the Prime Minister did not need to be shown a passage to India. He visited India twice during his prime ministership, for substantial state visits. It was the policy of the Howard government—condemned at the time by the Australian Labor Party—to sell uranium to India, provided a sufficient and comprehensive safeguards agreement was in place. When Mr Howard announced that policy in 2006 he was condemned to the rafters not just by the Greens but by the Australian Labor Party. Fast forward six years and all of a sudden the Australian Labor Party have caught up with where the Liberal Party and the coalition were six years ago and have seen the wisdom of fostering and strengthening the important strategic relationship between Australia and India by selling India the uranium to use for peaceful purposes only that the people of that very large nation so desperately need.


What would the Greens have the people of India do? Would they prefer them to depend on hydroelectric power? Apparently not. Would they prefer that they derive their power from coal-fired power stations? Apparently not. So what would the comfortable,wealthy, middle-class radicals who comprise the Greens do for the people of India? In all of their vanity, conceit and complacency they would leave them poor. There is all this talk about social justice and we hear all of these pieties from the moth-eaten former communists and middle-class radicals, but when it comes to the reality of what they would do for the people of India they would be content to leave them poor.


That is why this is such an important measure. It is why the Liberal Party is so glad that the Australian Labor Party on this occasion have stood up to their Greens alliance partners, have caught up to where the Howard government was more than six years ago and, albeit subject to the intellectual distinction of a Labor Party national conference where a motley gang of trade union thugs and crooks were asked to rubberstamp this policy, have eventually signed off on it.


It is important that Australia nurture and foster its strategic, trade, commercial and educational relationship with India. It is important that Australia sells uranium to the Indian government, subject to appropriate safeguards agreements, so that nuclear power plants can be used to provide electricity to the starving people of India, because at the moment it is beyond the capacity of that state to provide it for all of its people. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in pretending to be distant from the Greens is only matched by the hypocrisy of the Greens in uttering pieties about social justice while all they want to do is keep the people of India poor.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (16:14):  I am glad that Senator Brandis is having fun, but I am sorry to disappoint him: I am neither flea-bitten nor moth-eaten. I am very sorry about that Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  I wasn't talking about you




Senator Siewert:
  Were you talking about me? Scottie?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! You have the call, Senator Waters.




Senator WATERS:
  As Senator Ludlam said, a fortnight ago Queensland's new premier, Nuclear Newman, as he shall now be known, lifted the long-standing ban on uranium mining in Queensland. This actually came as a complete surprise to me and to every other Queenslander, given that prior to the election Mr Newman had assured us that he had no plans to mine uranium—a promise that he repeated as recently as two weeks ago.


Sadly, this was just one of a number of backflips since the election, including the promise that public servants would be safe from mass sackings, that gay surrogacy laws would remain and that there were, likewise, no plans to overturn the wild river laws which limit big mines and dams in our most pristine rivers. The premier also says that he has no plans to allow mining in national parks, so I hope that these 'no plans' are different to the no plans that he had for uranium mining.


Clearly, throwing Queensland open to uranium mining is toxic, dangerous and completely unnecessary in the Sunshine State. We are still the state with the best sunshine, despite the fact that the premier has slashed funding for both small- and large-scale solar programs across the state. We tried this before: 30 years ago we closed our last uranium mine, Mary Kathleen. And it has been leaking ever since. For the last 20 years there has been an informal ban on uranium mining. I say 'informal' because, unfortunately, the state Labor government never had the guts to legislate the ban, and they permitted exploration for uranium throughout those 20 years. Clearly, they should have legislated this ban when they had the chance and stopped exploration for this toxic stuff.


Unfortunately, federal Labor has now also overturned its opposition to uranium mining so we have a unity ticket with Julia Gillard and Campbell Newman on digging up and exporting toxic, radioactive uranium. I am pleased to say that the Greens have always had a clear and consistent position on uranium, and that is that we oppose all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle—and that is nuclear, not 'nuc-u-ler', for the benefit of folk who might have been listening earlier. It is simply too risky, it is environmentally dangerous, it is economically foolish and, frankly, we have clean, green, renewable alternative energy sources that will not make the world's conflicts worse. Perhaps Senator Brandis might like to look up and notice that great energy source in the sky.


Yesterday, Premier Newman announced the membership of his new uranium mining committee—the one whose role is perhaps a little perfunctory, given that cabinet has already lifted the ban on uranium mining. The premier says that he is going to develop 'world's best practice' environmental and safety standards. But this is from the guy who has rolled back most of Queensland's environmental protection laws, so I am afraid that I lack confidence in that statement. Maybe the committee is going to start with doing the economic and employment modelling, which the premier admitted last week that he had not done despite making claims about the jobs and royalties that uranium mining would provide—now shown by his very words to be baseless. Frankly, he is just making it up as he goes along. A cursory look would show that the global price of uranium has tanked in the last five years, even before Fukushima. It is now almost one-third of what it was in 2007. It has dropped from US$138 a pound to US$43.50 a pound, and it shows no signs of recovering.


Nuclear Newman's committee might also look at the fact that Mary K is still leaking after rainfall events after 30 years. Maybe it could look at the impossibility of guaranteeing that Queensland uranium does not fill nuclear weapons? Despite the so-called safety agreements that have been bandied about in this debate, as Senator Ludlam said, there is no way that we can guarantee that our uranium simply does not free up other uranium to end up in nuclear weapons. I would like to put on record how disappointed I am that this federal Labor government is prepared to sell uranium to India, despite it not being a signatory to that non-proliferation treaty, and despite the fact that India has just killed five antinuclear activists—despite Senator Feeney's confidence in India's peacefulness.


Perhaps this new committee could look at how to store nuclear waste, which remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years? They are going to be pretty busy, really, solving all of the problems that the world's scientists have been unable to solve in the decades that we have been grappling with this problem.


One last thing in the short time that I have remaining to me is my concern that the federal Labor government is going to leave this stuff solely in Premier Newman's hands, given the COAG deal to hand over federal environment powers to the states. What a toxic and dangerous situation that will be.

 (Western Australia) (16:19):  Before I introduce some remarks of substance in this debate, I really should address the opening comments by Senator Brandis, which coloured the entirety of his contribution. My memory is that he accused my colleague Senator Feeney of a 'formulaic denunciation of the Greens', meaning that every time there is a debate on there is a faux attack on the Greens and that it has no heart and no substance. That is my understanding of Senator Brandis's comments.


Let us test the veracity of that proposition. I think to myself, 'How does one test the veracity of the proposition that the Australian Labor Party has been engaged in a formulaic denunciation of the Greens—a pretend denunciation?' There is a way to do it. Senator Brandis, as we all know, was a member of the front bench of the former coalition government. And since the coalition have been in opposition he has constantly been in a senior position on the shadow front bench. He is one of those key people involved in the internal processes of his party who gives advice, sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected—and properly so—by their leader.


After the last election, of course, the results are known: the Australian Labor Party and the Greens Party are in some sort of arrangement. Whether that be de facto or de jure it does not matter; it is an arrangement where your support is guaranteed on the floor of the House. But, of course, before those negotiations were completed a similar set of identical negotiations was entered into by Senator Brandis's leader, Mr Abbott—with the full knowledge of the frontbench at that time to enter into a negotiated agreement—so that the Greens could be a partner with the Liberal Party if they should be a government. So that is the first test that I suggest we use.


The second test of objective reality, which Senator Brandis also well knows but chooses to ignore, is what is going on at this very moment in this very Territory in Civic, because there is a round of negotiations, engaged in by the eight Labor elected Territory representatives and the one Green elected Territory representative, in an attempt to form a majority government. But, gee whiz, there is also another set of negotiations going on, and I see my Green colleagues at the other end of the chamber nodding knowingly and the coalition ignoring the nodding. We have the eight elected Liberal Party coalition Territory members engaged in a similar set of negotiations, Senator Brandis, so that they can be part of a government, so that they can be in alliance with the Greens in the ACT. Everyone in this chamber knows it, so your description of formulaic denunciation by Senator Feeney really does sound a bit hollow and really does run a bit thin.


Having established that, let me now turn to the substance of the motion that has been brought to us by Senator Ludlam. I will not read it all out, because we know what it says, but when I examine some of the key words—'illegal', 'toxic', 'deficient' and 'capacity'—I am reminded of debates that I was involved in—30, 35 or perhaps 40 years ago when I was starting out as a very junior official—in various forums in South Australia and Western Australia. Always in those days there were debates about uranium—value-adding, export and transport—and those who opposed uranium mining, uranium transport, uranium export and indeed uranium value-adding always used the same words that are in this motion today.


Nothing has changed: fear, threat, possible Armageddon and health concerns, all of which has been addressed over at least the last 30 years by the successful use of technology. The 'solution' then was the same 'solution' as now outlined by Senator Waters: close down the mines, stop the exportation, don't develop, don't share, don't spread the technology and don't participate. Well, it did not work then and it does not work now. Indeed, I remember those debates well. Often I think I was a minority of me in those debates at various forums. But after a while other people started to understand the wisdom, and the minority of me became a minority of some; and now it is a minority of nearly all of us and we, one of the partners in this alliance, do invite the Greens to come forward into the modern age and use technology in a proper safe way to exploit uranium and even perhaps get—instead of US$131 a pound or the US$48 a pound that Senator Waters referred to—thousands of dollars a pound by value adding and having a refined product. Your party is in favour of value-adding and of going up the value chain—and that would be a useful thing. I issue that invitation to the Greens and I know they will give it mature and proper consideration, because they always say they do. But if they do not we are clearly able to forecast their future because of those four that became one a week or 10 days ago here in the ACT; and the same thing is going to happen to three of their senators at the next election because they will be replaced by Labor Party twos or threes or perhaps coalition threes or fours. So the invitation is there, we would welcome you to come forward and we would welcome your contribution.


In this discussion on the export of uranium what are the real issues? What are the real issues involved in nuclear exports to India? What does the Australian government say? We say Australian uranium sales to any country, including India, but particularly India in the case of this debate, are subject to strict framework agreements and guarantees of safeguards and safe handling. These may potentially include safeguards on handling and security of radioactive material, restrictions on re-export and guarantees of use for peaceful purposes.


Why is it important that we engage properly, fully and sympathetically with the government of India on the issue of a safeguards agreement attached to the export of uranium from this country? What do we know? We know that about 40 per cent of the Indian people currently live below the poverty line. Forty per cent in a population of 1.1 billion or 1.2 billion is something approaching 450 million or 500 million people, and it is really inconceivable, given those sorts of figures, that almost half a billion people of India's population live below the poverty line. Over the next decade that population figure is expected to grow past China's and go to a population of 1.5 billion and if the issues of poverty are not addressed that means we will have, on an ongoing basis, almost 700 million people living in poverty in that subcontinent.


With that sort of population growth in India its rates of energy consumption are almost the fastest in the world. The WEO estimates that India's demand for energy may double in the next 25 years. If they are serious about growth and if they are serious about shifting some of those 500 million—or even 700 million—people out of poverty to a reasonable standard of living, the rate of demand for energy will not double but triple. So you have to ask the obvious question: do we say to those half a billion or so people, 'You shall remain poor forever and you shall remain without forever, but your cousins in China may go up the value chain and improve their standard of living while you'—the 500 million or 700 million Indians—'may not'? The absolute critical precondition for those 500 million or 700 million people lifting themselves out of poverty is access to power and access to sources of power generation. With all the goodwill in the world, alternative sources of energy, as currently understood and as currently used and as forecast to grow and improve over the next 25 years, are not going to have an iota of significance in delivering power to those 500 million or 700 million people—not water, not hydro, not coal or all the other alternative sources. So the power to lift people out of poverty has to come from somewhere, and it comes from assistance by countries like—(Time expired)

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (16:29):  It appears that the Greens need a lesson in geography. We have heard more today about Queensland then we have about India. As a senator from Western Australia, I welcome the fact that after years of dithering, the Labor Party has finally came to its senses on the question of uranium sales. Not surprisingly, as a Western Australian senator, this is particularly interesting to me because, as many would be aware, uranium is poised to become a significant element of Western Australia's resource industry. Western Australia has approximately 211,000 tonnes of uranium located across 30 separate deposits with four projects currently undergoing Commonwealth and state environmental assessment, those four projects being Cameco's Yeelirrie project, the Cameco Corporation/Mitsubishi Joint Venture at Kintyre, the Mega Uranium Lake Maitland project and the Toro Energy Wiluna project. It is worth reflecting on the figure of 211,000 tonnes as large areas of the state are yet to be fully tested by exploration. The first uranium mine is expected to be in production late next year after having been subject to what I would regard as rigorous environmental assessment processes.


Equally, I welcome the Labor government's sudden discovery of India. This government has ignored India for too long, first under Prime Minister Rudd—as we heard from my colleague Senator Brandis—whose obsession with China is well documented, and then under Prime Minister Gillard who has openly admitted she has little interest in foreign affairs. I could be unkind and suggest her ham-fisted negotiations with East Timor and Malaysia over illegal immigration suggest she has little aptitude for foreign affairs either, but that is a discussion for another day.


All the bluster from the Greens and from those in Labor who still oppose uranium sales to India overlook one simple reality: if India does not get its uranium from Australia, it will simply go elsewhere. It may well go somewhere that does not have in place the rigorous safeguards that Australia has for dealing with uranium. Australia has the strictest international safeguard agreement in the world in relation to uranium sales. Are opponents suggesting they would honestly prefer it if India went to a country that does not insist on the same high standards to source its uranium? What would that mean for the safety of the international community? Such opposition is wholly illogical but totally consistent with the head-in-the-sand approach of the Australian Greens.


It is in Australia's interests to help the world's largest democracy achieve its full economic potential. I think we would all rather deal with democracies over authoritarian regimes. Equally, it is in our national interest to pursue trading opportunities with nations that are becoming increasingly powerful in economic terms. India's economy has enjoyed rapid expansion over the past decade—not in the same league as China, but impressive nonetheless.


There were significant structural reforms made to India's economy in the 1990s: floating the rupee, dismantling trade and investment barriers and encouraging foreign investment, paying down India's external debt, and abolishing layers of bureaucratic and regulatory inefficiencies. These reforms unlocked India's economic potential and Australians should applaud it and be excited by it. As a result, the Indian economy grew on average by over six per cent per annum. That growth rate meant the economy quadrupled in size between 1991 and 2008.


Certainly, as is the case around the world, the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 had an impact. India's growth rate slowed, but there are signs of recovery. The Economist Magazine reported that India's GDP expanded at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the quarter ending June compared with the previous year. Granted, that is still at the bottom end of the growth range of the past decade in India, but it was above expectations. There is some reason to believe that this position will further improve as the Indian government implements a range of further economic reforms that will streamline processes and make it easier for development projects to get off the ground, particularly in relation to the new infrastructure that India so desperately needs.


But the lack of private sector investment is still holding India back. And part of the reason for this is that India lacks the capacity for power generation, a capacity that is desperately needed to unleash its full potential. A recent survey by India's central bank found that spending plans by private firms on large new projects dropped by almost 50 per cent in the year ending March 2012. According to India's Ministry of Power:


India needs, at the very least, to increase its primary energy supply by three to four times and its electrical generation capacity by about six times—


to achieve the growth it needs. Yet this will be difficult to achieve through reliance on coal-fired power generation alone. In fact, uncertainty surrounding the supply of coal has recently forced NTPC, India's largest power company, to drastically cut its investment levels. 


This represents opportunity for Australia. The World Nuclear Association reports that India plans to expand its nuclear power capacity from under five per cent to at least 25 per cent of its total requirements by 2050. Why is it in our national interests to assist India with its electricity production? Because increasing production will drive economic growth and swell the ranks of India's middle class. A larger, wealthier middle class in India would be a boon for Australia's economy. India's population is increasingly urbanised and sophisticated. India's urban population has doubled in the last thirty years and the rapid development of tech-savvy cities like Mumbai are testament to the country's modernisation. According to the OECD:



India could witness a dramatic expansion of its middle class, from 5-10 per cent of its population today to 90 per cent in 30 years. With a population of 1.6 billion forecast for 2039, India could add well over 1 billion people to its middle class ranks by 2039.


That is an additional one billion people who will be demanding higher standard products, better quality food, and better educational opportunities, and people will be looking to travel and holiday overseas. All of these things represent a massive opportunity for the future of Australian exporters. By helping India to meet its need for power generation now thorough uranium sales to India, we will help to boost India's growth rate, lift millions who currently live in poverty out of the mire, and gain a potential one billion new consumers for Australian products and services The economic opportunity this presents is so obvious even Wayne Swan can see it, yet once again the Australian Greens come into the chamber and complain.


Ever the enemies of progress here in Australia, the Greens now want to try and impose their backward economic policies on other countries as well. The Greens, who claim to be concerned about greenhouse gas emissions, air quality and cutting pollution, want to prevent India reducing its reliance on coal for power generation. The Greens, who pose as the great humanitarians in this parliament, want to prevent the economic development that will lift millions and millions of Indian citizens out of poverty. The Greens actively seek to deny to those living in poverty a higher standard of living—all so that they and their dwindling band of supporters in comfortable, middle-class suburbs can feel morally superior. It is shameful.


The Liberal Party welcomes the Gillard government's belated decision to sell uranium to India—a process that John Howard had the foresight to initiate when he was Prime Minister, in the face of Labor's bitter opposition. By ensuring that the export of uranium to India is undertaken with appropriate safeguards in place—the most stringent safeguards of any nation in the world—we can play a vital role in assisting India to meet its full economic potential, build on the already significant trade relationship we enjoy with India and, most importantly, help those in India who want to provide a better lifestyle for themselves and their families to achieve that objective, simultaneously creating new customers for Australian goods and services.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-10-31,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:38):  I congratulate my colleague Senator Ludlam for this important debate to oppose the growing support of state and federal governments for an Australian uranium industry. Listening to the speakers from the coalition and Labor, you would think this was just about some other trade issue. What we are talking about here is uranium, one of the most dangerous substances that we have. It is so well documented how dangerous it is. Not one of the speakers from the other parties has at least acknowledged the tragedies that have occurred when uranium mining has been imposed on communities. That at least should have been part of this debate, not the superficial carrying on that we have seen.


When we listen to Senator Brandis thunder about hypocrisy, those words need to be turned back on that senator himself, because he was really there describing his double standards. Surely at some point he should have given attention to the radioactivity that we are dealing with here—the radon gas and how it results in the cancers, the tumours and so many illnesses, and how water and land are poisoned and can never be used. That is what we are talking about here, and that is why it is so important that we have this debate. There are the risks to workers and the risks to people who live near where uranium has been mined, has been used in power plants or is being used in nuclear weapons that have been tested. The damage has been enormous, and it is very disgraceful that the people who are backing this industry do not at least acknowledge the tragedies that have unfolded for so many communities.


Senator Brandis and his colleagues that have gone on this tirade should at least think of the Navaho people. When the Navaho people heard that a uranium mine was going to be opened up, they welcomed it. They thought that they at last had work. What they now have is the cancers, the tumours, the illnesses and the sores. Their stock is poisoned. Their lives are effectively ruined. They were never informed by the US government of what could befall them.


We have seen this tragedy closer to home, in Australia. The word 'Maralinga' is now known by many people in Australia—unfortunately, not because it is a very important spiritual place for the Aboriginal people who made their home there for tens of thousands of years but because it became the site of a large number of tests by Britain of its own nuclear weapons. The armed forces who were there and the Aboriginal people ended up with so much illness: long-lasting cancers, sores and blindness. This is a tragedy that I do not believe we have ever taken full responsibility for. Again, none of this was acknowledged by the speakers who have come into it.


Then we heard Senator Feeney and others speak about the great benefits this will bring and how essential it is for the Indian economy and India's future energy needs. You really got the impression that India is dependent on uranium for its nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy in India today only accounts for about 2.3 per cent of its energy. This is a very small component, and right now there are huge protests across India—very successful protests that are actually holding up the building of nuclear power plants. Fisherfolk, local villagers and many supporters from the larger cities across India know that there should be no future for nuclear energy in India. They should be phasing it out, not building new nuclear plants.


Right now, in the last day, about 100 people have been arrested in Tamil Nadu. Thousands have been protesting outside the assembly. One of those people arrested was David Bradbury, the Oscar-nominated Australian filmmaker. I congratulate those people, because they are doing a service not just to their immediate community, India, but to the world. The world has to say, 'The era of nuclear power and nuclear weapons is over.' We need to now be cleaning up the world, not adding to the pollution and the dangers that will beset so many generations. When you listen to Senator Brandis, Senator Feeney and the others who have spoken from Labor and the coalition, what they are outlining is to impose dangers, hardships, sickness and illnesses that will kill so many people if their policies continue and are put in place.


This issue right now is very relevant for the people of New South Wales. The Premier, Barry O'Farrell, placed the issue of uranium mining back on the agenda in November last year when he approved the resumption of granting uranium exploration licences in New South Wales, overturning the state's 26-year uranium ban. The Premier of New South Wales linked the decision to the announcement days earlier by the federal Labor party that it would overturn its ban on uranium exports to India, saying that New South Wales would be crazy not to look— (Time expired)

 (Queensland) (16:45):  I present the 13th report and Alert Digest No. 13 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Now that there is agreement that the report be printed so everyone can read it, I now move:


That the Senate take note of the report. 


I thank the secretariat and the legal advisor on the quite brilliant work they do in assisting the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I reiterate what a professional job the committee secretariat and the legal advisor Mr Leighton McDonald do in looking through so many bits of legislation that come before this parliament and in looking at them to determine if they do unduly trespass on the personal rights and liberties of Australians, whether they have an inappropriate delegation of legislative power, whether they unduly restrict the rights of citizens, whether they give too much discretionary power to delegation of legislative power or whether there is retrospective application. These are the sorts of things that the committee looks at.


The committee in its report today highlights a number of bills. The committee always acts in a very non-partisan way. We do not get into the rights and wrongs of the bill itself but simply alert other senators to provisions of bills that might impinge upon the rights that we have as Australian citizens and which the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is specifically asked to look at. I urge all senators to read the report. I will briefly mention a couple of the matters that are referred to in the report.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee Bill 2012 has a delegation of legislative power. It is proposed in the bill to cover the costs associated with the payment of advances to former employees whose employer becomes bankrupt. The appropriation could also apply to any additional schemes introduced, which can be done by regulation. The explanatory memorandum argues that a standing appropriation is necessary because the volume of payments is unknown and it will provide certainty. The committee noted that argument in the explanatory memorandum, but went back to the government to seek advice on whether the government thought a sunset clause should be considered, especially as new schemes can be introduced.


Similarly, in the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill 2012, the committee alerts the Senate to proposed subsection 768CA, which would enable the making of regulations that may modify the provisions of this act or the transitional act. So this act is giving power to the regulatory process; that is, the primary legislation can be amended simply by regulations. That is regrettably all too common in legislation. It is referred to as the Henry VIII clause for the reason that Henry VIII used to have a parliament but he provided in it that laws of parliament could be amended by regulation. Not that my history of how the government worked in those days is all that good—

  You mean chop off their heads! Senator Boyce, you have led me into that. Henry VIII only chopped off the heads of certain people. You are leading me into territory where I should not go. I will be pilloried should I respond further to your interjection. Getting back to the Henry VIII clause in the Fair Work Amendment (Transfer of Business) Bill, the committee has pointed out that the explanatory memorandum did not give any reason as to why it should be that the executive government, by regulation, could change the primary legislation passed by this parliament. So, it is not whether the committee gets involved in whether that is good, bad or indifferent; it simply points it out. The committee has resolved to seek advice from the minister whether there is a justification for it. When the justification comes from the minister—and I suspect there will be a justification—that will be presented to the parliament. I mention those couple of things as a short indication of the work done by the committee in alerting the Senate to matters which should be considered when the Senate considers these bills in their more substantive form.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (17:43):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I congratulate the Western Australian state government and, in particular, the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, on his response to the resolution. The Western Australian government is committed to preventing domestic violence and ensuring that its victims are supported both in and outside of the workplace. In his response to the resolution of the Senate, the Premier refers to the WA strategic plan for family and domestic violence2009-2013, which outlines state-wide systematic reform arrangements for family and domestic violence, focusing on better interagency responses, improved safety for victims and programs to help perpetrators of domestic violence.


In reviewing the Premier's response, I took the opportunity to have a look at the WA strategic plan. I am pleased to see that the strategies included in the strategic plan that aim to support the integrated responses are to:


Strengthen community understanding and awareness that family and domestic violence is not acceptable,


Focus family and domestic violence prevention and early intervention initiatives on children, young people, health and respectful relationships,


Provide an accessible, integrated 24 hour response throughout the State that includes crisis and post crisis intervention, and


Ensure that a range of evidence based programs and interventions for perpetrators of family and domestic violence are provided.


Certainly the aim of the strategic plan is to send a clear message to all Western Australians—and indeed all who read the strategic plan—that abuse in all forms will not be tolerated in our homes or in our communities.


I also note that the strategic plan acknowledges that family and domestic violence abuse is a fundamental violation of human rights and will not be tolerated in any way. In that vein, the coalition understands that violence against women in particular has a profound and devastating impact on both its victims and the community as a whole. The coalition has a zero-tolerance policy on violence against women. This violence is quite simply not acceptable. We believe that keeping women and their families safe from violence is the most fundamental step towards ensuring their security and their prosperity. Violence undermines our social fabric and prevents women from achieving social and economic equality and advancement.


When we were previously in government, the coalition established equitable and appropriately funded policies and programs for women, for families and for children. In particular, the coalition's policies aimed to ensure that all women could enjoy greater personal safety and that domestic violence was tackled and did not become intergenerational. The achievements of the former Howard government in relation to domestic violence are echoed in the response of the Premier of Western Australia in his response to the Senate resolution. From 1996 to 2007, the Howard government carried on the Liberal tradition of supporting and improving the position of women in Australia. The safety of women was a top priority for the Howard government, as it is a top priority for the Western Australian government under Premier Colin Barnett. 


The Howard government dedicated $75.7 million over four years from July 2005 to the Women's Safety Agenda which addressed four broad themes of prevention, health, justice and services. The initiatives included the national 'Violence Against Women, Australia Says No' campaign that so many of us will be aware of and the national 24-hour helpline on the 1800 number. 


The Women's Safety Agenda under the former Howard government aimed to prevent, reduce and respond to domestic and family violence and sexual assault. The Howard government also continued funding for the Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse and the Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault national resource centres which provided central points for the collection and dissemination of Australian domestic and family violence and sexual assault policy, practice and research. This funding was exceptionally important as it enabled research into domestic violence and sexual assault, and training for nurses in regional and rural areas where we know that unfortunately the incidence of domestic violence is exceptionally high. It included assistance to release general practitioners for training for the criminal justice sector on sexual assault and continuation of the valuable research program on the various aspects of sexual assault by the Australian Institute of Criminology.


The Howard government also funded projects aimed at reducing the incidence of domestic and family violence and sexual assault in the Australian community through the domestic and family violence and sexual assault funding initiative. Many projects were directed at addressing violence and/or sexual assault experienced by women and children from Indigenous communities, non-English speaking backgrounds and rural and remote areas as well as women with disabilities and their children. In fact, a major element of the Howard government's commitment to women's safety was the $23 million national initiative to combat sexual assault.


We also noted that it is not just the women that we need to look after. We provided funding for Mensline, a professional support phone line providing advice for men to help them deal with relationship problems, and we made sure that this was continued. The Howard government also worked in partnership with state and territory governments, organisations, communities and many committed individuals. There are many committed individuals in our society when it comes to working towards reducing—and ultimately hopefully getting to zero—the number of domestic violence incidents. These individuals improve the position, participation and circumstances of all Australian women.


A future coalition government will take a whole-of-government approach to implementing policies that reflect not just a zero-tolerance attitude towards domestic and family violence but also the Liberal values of nondiscrimination and a fair go for all. As I have stated, domestic violence is just not acceptable. It is an issue that is also above politics, and I know that both the government and the Liberal Party see a zero-tolerance approach as the only approach that can be accepted by society. In going forward as a coalition spokesperson for the status of women, I look forward to a day when we are not standing in this place and reading out the statistics that one in three women are still subjected to violence in society. That would be a great day.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:51):  I rise to speak on the response we have here. It was welcome to see the premiers of a number of states respond to this important proposal with regard to addressing domestic violence in the context of the workplace 


I noted that the Western Australian government did supply considerable detail and I certainly acknowledge that, these days, domestic violence is taken most seriously by governments at all levels and there are many outstanding programs.


The point of the original motion that went before parliament was to address domestic violence in the context of the workplace and how we can assist the victims of domestic violence, by far the majority of whom are women, so that the discrimination and the hardship they suffer are not further exacerbated by the situation that can arise in their workplace. They may have to take time off to attend court, they may feel humiliated, there may be difficulties in being able to handle their work properly, and conditions need to be provided to assist them when they are being abused in some domestic or family situations. Clearly, workers have the right to be safe at home and at work from domestic violence. I mentioned this in my first speech in this place: while there is a lot that divides us, I have a great belief that there is a lot that unites us—and this is one of those issues. Domestic violence can put jobs at risk. It affects performance, productivity and even safety at work—the safety of not just the person who is suffering domestic violence but also their colleagues.


We need a supportive and informed workplace where the victims of domestic violence will feel that they can disclose the crimes that are being committed against them. I want to acknowledge Australia's leading role in bringing forward many programs in this area, but it is in the particular area of workplace reform that we need to bring forward a number of changes.


In 2009, the Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse and the New South Wales Public Service Association began discussions regarding the introduction of domestic violence entitlements into industrial instruments. That is something that the Greens very much support. We believe that it is time for the government to advance this. So much work has been done. We have the proof that it is needed. Now we need the legislators to act, and that is where we have a responsibility. 


The Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse, a project of the UNSW Centre for Gender Related Violence Studies, is a national organisation. The quality of its information is really outstanding. I would recommend that senators acquaint themselves with this work because it clearly underlines why we need to ensure that in an industrial context, in a workplace context, we need to make these changes. 


The ADFVC provided evidence to the Public Service Association of a link between domestic violence and workplace safety. Both safety and performance clearly can be impacted if somebody goes to work traumatised because they have been abused in their home by somebody they have had a loving relationship with at some stage, and now they have to cope with this terrible change in their life. Clearly, they and other workers could be at risk. In Britain, this issue has been taken up strongly by a number of unions. We have considerable experience to draw on.


In December 2009, the Community and Public Sector Union, the State Public Services Federation and the Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse resolved to develop a model domestic violence clause to log in the 2010 round of enterprise bargaining in the New South Wales university sector. This work is being advanced by unions and a number of workplaces. Some businesses are coming on board, but there is a lot more that government should do. That was the intention when I put forward the original motion, and we are now receiving the response from state governments. I am a great believer it is going to happen. So much work is being done and the need has been demonstrated. I just hope that we do not drag the chain too much and that we can give support to the people who have done the research and demonstrated the need. So many people are victims of domestic violence. It is time that we advanced this program that would help expand the suite of policies and programs for victims of domestic violence, but there is this area that has not been addressed by our government in the detail that is required. I strongly urge Prime Minister Julia Gillard to add her voice to an issue that I believe unites our parliament.


Question agreed to.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-10-31,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (17:43):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I congratulate the Western Australian state government and, in particular, the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, on his response to the resolution. The Western Australian government is committed to preventing domestic violence and ensuring that its victims are supported both in and outside of the workplace. In his response to the resolution of the Senate, the Premier refers to the WA strategic plan for family and domestic violence2009-2013, which outlines state-wide systematic reform arrangements for family and domestic violence, focusing on better interagency responses, improved safety for victims and programs to help perpetrators of domestic violence.


In reviewing the Premier's response, I took the opportunity to have a look at the WA strategic plan. I am pleased to see that the strategies included in the strategic plan that aim to support the integrated responses are to:


Strengthen community understanding and awareness that family and domestic violence is not acceptable,


Focus family and domestic violence prevention and early intervention initiatives on children, young people, health and respectful relationships,


Provide an accessible, integrated 24 hour response throughout the State that includes crisis and post crisis intervention, and


Ensure that a range of evidence based programs and interventions for perpetrators of family and domestic violence are provided.


Certainly the aim of the strategic plan is to send a clear message to all Western Australians—and indeed all who read the strategic plan—that abuse in all forms will not be tolerated in our homes or in our communities.


I also note that the strategic plan acknowledges that family and domestic violence abuse is a fundamental violation of human rights and will not be tolerated in any way. In that vein, the coalition understands that violence against women in particular has a profound and devastating impact on both its victims and the community as a whole. The coalition has a zero-tolerance policy on violence against women. This violence is quite simply not acceptable. We believe that keeping women and their families safe from violence is the most fundamental step towards ensuring their security and their prosperity. Violence undermines our social fabric and prevents women from achieving social and economic equality and advancement.


When we were previously in government, the coalition established equitable and appropriately funded policies and programs for women, for families and for children. In particular, the coalition's policies aimed to ensure that all women could enjoy greater personal safety and that domestic violence was tackled and did not become intergenerational. The achievements of the former Howard government in relation to domestic violence are echoed in the response of the Premier of Western Australia in his response to the Senate resolution. From 1996 to 2007, the Howard government carried on the Liberal tradition of supporting and improving the position of women in Australia. The safety of women was a top priority for the Howard government, as it is a top priority for the Western Australian government under Premier Colin Barnett. 


The Howard government dedicated $75.7 million over four years from July 2005 to the Women's Safety Agenda which addressed four broad themes of prevention, health, justice and services. The initiatives included the national 'Violence Against Women, Australia Says No' campaign that so many of us will be aware of and the national 24-hour helpline on the 1800 number. 


The Women's Safety Agenda under the former Howard government aimed to prevent, reduce and respond to domestic and family violence and sexual assault. The Howard government also continued funding for the Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearinghouse and the Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault national resource centres which provided central points for the collection and dissemination of Australian domestic and family violence and sexual assault policy, practice and research. This funding was exceptionally important as it enabled research into domestic violence and sexual assault, and training for nurses in regional and rural areas where we know that unfortunately the incidence of domestic violence is exceptionally high. It included assistance to release general practitioners for training for the criminal justice sector on sexual assault and continuation of the valuable research program on the various aspects of sexual assault by the Australian Institute of Criminology.


The Howard government also funded projects aimed at reducing the incidence of domestic and family violence and sexual assault in the Australian community through the domestic and family violence and sexual assault funding initiative. Many projects were directed at addressing violence and/or sexual assault experienced by women and children from Indigenous communities, non-English speaking backgrounds and rural and remote areas as well as women with disabilities and their children. In fact, a major element of the Howard government's commitment to women's safety was the $23 million national initiative to combat sexual assault.


We also noted that it is not just the women that we need to look after. We provided funding for Mensline, a professional support phone line providing advice for men to help them deal with relationship problems, and we made sure that this was continued. The Howard government also worked in partnership with state and territory governments, organisations, communities and many committed individuals. There are many committed individuals in our society when it comes to working towards reducing—and ultimately hopefully getting to zero—the number of domestic violence incidents. These individuals improve the position, participation and circumstances of all Australian women.


A future coalition government will take a whole-of-government approach to implementing policies that reflect not just a zero-tolerance attitude towards domestic and family violence but also the Liberal values of nondiscrimination and a fair go for all. As I have stated, domestic violence is just not acceptable. It is an issue that is also above politics, and I know that both the government and the Liberal Party see a zero-tolerance approach as the only approach that can be accepted by society. In going forward as a coalition spokesperson for the status of women, I look forward to a day when we are not standing in this place and reading out the statistics that one in three women are still subjected to violence in society. That would be a great day.

 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:00):  I move:

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—





Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013



Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012 2013 provides additional funding to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for:


requirements for departmental equity injections; and


requirements to create or acquire administered assets and to discharge administered liabilities.


The total appropriation being sought in Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012 2013 is $267,980,000.


The Government will provide the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with $267,380,000 of administered assets and liabilities funding in this Bill for the Offshore Asylum Seeker Management program. This is to meet the initial capital costs required to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island, as recommended by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers.


I note that the reestablishment of offshore processing in these places has the support of the Coalition.


The Government will also be providing the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with $600,000 of departmental equity injections funding in this Bill for the Settlement Services program. This is for the departmental capital costs associated with implementation of the recommendation of the Expert Panel to increase the Humanitarian Migration program to 20,000 places. 


These are vital elements that go to the implementation of a suite of measures that can break the people smuggling trade and save lives at sea by preventing these dangerous journeys in the first place.


We want to remove the incentive for people to travel to Australia by boat, whether it's by providing more offshore refugee places, removing Special Humanitarian Program family reunion concessions for boat arrivals, or transferring post-13 August arrivals to Nauru and Manus Island.


The way in which this Government has been implementing the Expert Panel's recommendations provides clear evidence of our determination to break the people smugglers' business model.


But this is only the beginning. Transfers continue to Nauru, while Manus Island will shortly start receiving arrivals – and work is continuing on both islands to increase capacity.


Of course as we continue to implement more of the Panel's recommendations, we will start to see a greater impact on reducing boat numbers.


Should the Opposition, or the Greens for that matter, choose to stop hindering and start helping the Government to save lives, they would support the Malaysia Arrangement – an agreement the Expert Panel acknowledged was the pathway to a truly regional and sustainable solution to irregular migration.


 




Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013



There are two bills being proposed at this time:


Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013; and


Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013.


These bills seek urgent appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.


These bills require immediate passage to provide additional appropriation to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.


These bills address the increased costs of irregular maritime arrivals resulting from higher rates of arrivals and the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers (the Expert Panel), including capital works and services for regional processing facilities on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.


The total appropriation being sought through these two bills is $1,674,982,000.


Turning now to Appropriation (Implementation of the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013; the total appropriation being sought in this bill is a little over $1.4 billion.


This includes $110.6 million for Houston Report measures, including:


•   $92.043 million to increase the Humanitarian Program by an additional 6,250 places to 20,000 places per annum from 2012-13;


•   $8.181 million to increase to the Family Reunion Stream of the Permanent Migration Program by 4,000 places; and


•   $10 million to fund capacity building initiatives in regional countries.


It also includes $1.296 billion to meet expenses arising from the management of higher levels of irregular maritime arrivals, and the operational expenses associated with the implementation of the Expert Panel's recommendations to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. This includes a $186 million accrual from 2011-12.


It is only this party — only this Government — that is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Panel, which was led by Angus Houston.


The funding sought in these appropriations is consistent with and already budgeted for in MYEFO.


No one should doubt the Government's commitment to implementing the 22 recommendations of the Expert Panel, to break the people smugglers' business model and help to stop people dying at sea.


This suite of measures, as outlined in the Panel's


recommendations, is the only way we will begin to see a reduction in the rate of boat arrivals


And that means, of course, the immediate implementation of regional processing on Nauru and Papua New Guinea which we are doing swiftly and effectively.


We have almost 400 people on Nauru currently and transfers will begin shortly to Manus Island.


Nauru will have a capacity of 1,500 beds — it currently has about 500 places — and we expect to see 600 places in Papua New Guinea as works continue on those facilities.


As I referred to earlier, the Government has also increased Australia's humanitarian intake to 20,000 — providing increased resettlement options for people in need from priority regions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.


Only last week I announced the makeup of that intake, targeting those in most need, especially vulnerable people in camps around the world.


We are providing more opportunities for vulnerable and displaced people to pursue safer resettlement options in Australia — we're


telling desperate people that there is a better way than taking a dangerous boat journey — a better way as part of an orderly humanitarian program.


The message here is that taking a dangerous boat journey will provide no advantage — there is no visa awaiting people on arrival, no speedy outcome and no special treatment. This tells the lie to the people smugglers' spin.


In the meantime, the cost of processing and accommodating asylum seekers is expensive, it always has been. But the only way to reduce these costs is to have fewer people arriving by boat.


No one should doubt our commitment to doing that, but it is something we could do much more effectively with the implementation of the Malaysia Arrangement.


We know that those opposite for so long stood in the way of offshore processing legislation, refusing to let the Government implement its border protection policies — because they don't want the Government to succeed.


We know the Malaysia Arrangement can indeed break the people smugglers' business model — its time to allow it to be implemented.


No one can deny that the combination of regional processing on Nauru and PNG, along with returns to Malaysia, would not stop the flow of boats and provide that iron clad deterrent.


There is still some way to go before we see the real effects of the policies the Government has been implementing — and people smugglers will continue to test our resolve.


But there can also be no doubt that we are starting to see positive ¬if only early — results.


To date, the Government has facilitated a number of voluntary removals to Sri Lanka, with more than 70 people choosing not to engage Australia's protection obligations and to instead return home.


With more returns expected, this is further proof that people smugglers only sell lies and make false promises about what awaits people in Australia.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:50):  In relation to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's annual report 2011-12, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


As senators would be aware, the Commonwealth Ombudsman is the first port of call for many Australians who believe that they have been aggrieved by an executive decision. The ombudsman, as we know, is a pillar of our administrative law regime in Australia. Without the Commonwealth Ombudsman, many Australians would not have an opportunity to seek review of an executive decision. Their only option, really, would be to proceed through the Administrative Review Tribunal or through the Federal Court via the ADJR Act. Despite costs orders, the prohibitive cost of litigation means that, without the Commonwealth Ombudsman, review of government actions would simply be out of reach for so many of those people who need it most. This annual report provides some very interesting statistics. Over the past year the number of complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman has increased from 38,919 to 40,009. I acknowledge that this is a double-edged sword because although 40,000 Australians felt aggrieved enough by decisions of the executive government to complain to the Ombudsman, it is heartening that so many Australians are seeking justice through the merits review the Commonwealth Ombudsman provides. On the positive side, the number of complaints that related to correctness, propriety or timeliness of agency decisions or actions was down from 72 per cent to 70 per cent. 


But unsurprisingly the agency which tops the list of complaints is Centrelink, then Australia Post, the ATO, child support and immigration round out the top five. Over the last three years the number of complaints about Centrelink to the Commonwealth Ombudsman fell, but in 2011-12 the number of complaints rose. The report identifies accessibility to Centrelink as a common ground for review. The report notes that telephonic communication with Centrelink can be problematic, and many Centrelink recipients had difficulties understanding correspondence from Centrelink. Many of Centrelink's services are migrating online and as a result the Commonwealth Ombudsman notes that age pension recipients and to a lesser extent disability support pension recipients have difficulty accessing these online services.


I am pleased to say that the government has listened to the complaints of those who use Centrelink and has responded. As my colleague Minister Kim Carr said today, the government was aware that the average call wait times this year peaked at an unacceptable 16 minutes. New technology and the deployment of more staff using new methods to respond to phone calls has meant that as of today the average call wait time is down to six minutes and 15 seconds. I also note that Minister Carr informed the Senate in question time today that the call-back service will be extended, allowing more citizens to go about their business while not losing their place in the queue.


There is much work that the Commonwealth Ombudsman does. It is not just a complaints hotline. The Ombudsman serves as an important purpose of following up on individual citizen's cases as well as conducting investigations, producing reports to assist agencies ensure transparency and making submissions to parliamentary inquiries. I think the work of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is critically important. I commend its work and I commend the annual report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-10-31,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:58):  Last week in Brisbane the family and many, many friends of Clarice Brown gathered to celebrate her life. Clarice was almost 90 when we lost her on 7 October. I first met Clarice in the early 1990s. She was an amazing woman: small, impeccably groomed and made up. She often wore chiffon cardigans to rallies and she carried her parasol. I truly believe that if there was a public rally of any kind in Brisbane and Clarice Brown was not there, it did not have cred.


It is fascinating to learn about a person you met and respected when people gather to tell their stories about that person. I deeply want to thank her son Kevin who put together a wonderful list of memories of Clarice. She was born in Longreach in 1922. Her dad, Curley—his real name was Marcus but no-one called him that—and her mum lived in that area and Curley was a genuine activist, a shearer, a union member and his politics were inbred in Clarice, her brother and her sister. Clarice went to primary school and high school in Longreach. These were the days of the Depression. She grew up doing it tough in regional Queensland—and those memories stayed with her all her life. Her mum and dad moved to Brisbane but Clarice stayed in Longreach to continue at school. Finally, she did give in and moved to Brisbane with her family.


Clarice worked as a stenographer/secretary for many years. She worked with parliamentarians as a secretary. A wonderful group got together in Trades Hall where Clarice worked during the war. Like many young women in Brisbane at that time, she had a good time and enjoyed herself and was known as a party girl. She said of that period:


With my father's early working class influence there was no escape for me. People used to continually ask me when I was going to join the communist party or the Eureka Youth League. It wasn't long before I decided to join them both.


Clarice embraced the activity. It was very much a social time but she was involved in politics at that time as well.


In 1945 Clarice met and married very quickly Ron Brown. They met at a Clerks Union meeting and within three months they were married at the Albert Street Methodist Church—an icon church in the centre of Brisbane. Immediately Clarice came upon the sexism that operated not just in the wider community but also in the union movement. The Storemen and Packers Union, for which Clarice worked—and she loved her job—had a policy that when women married they left the workforce. So Clarice lost her job. That was the experience of many women at that time and for many years later. Clarice went back to work in Trades Hall, where both her husband Ron and her father Curley were employed. They were working in research and they were known across the movement as 'The Three Musketeers'.


There were a number of major industrial actions at that time in Brisbane. There was the major meat strike in 1946, about which Clarice wrote:


Many people like ourselves were forced onto a diet of rabbit. In that period we ate rabbit cooked in every way it could be cooked—and sometimes in ways that it really shouldn't have been. On one occasion we bought a rabbit which proved to be bad. Luckily for us the meat strike finished the next day.


The 13-week Queensland rail strike began in early 1948. The Eureka Youth League was very active in the strike and members like Clarice distributed thousands of leaflets and sold copies of the Communist Party newspaper the Guardian. That was a very special memory for Clarice, and she told me almost 40 years later about being on the streets of Brisbane selling the Guardianand 'maintaining the rage'.


At that time there was evidence of particularly vicious police attacks. The police were called 'the demons'. They seemed to particularly focus on women. It was as though women were an easy target at that time. There were stories about particularly verbal abuse and also the 'speciality' of kicking the women on the picket lines just on their ankles. This happened many times to Clarice when she was on the picket line outside the Milton Railway workshop. Many years later she showed me her ankles and exactly how this was done and said, 'You have not felt pain until you have experienced that for the cause.'


The Queensland rail strike dragged on and became more violent—this was a famous time in Brisbane, Queensland—and led to the bashing of Fred Paterson, to this day our only Communist member of parliament elected in any parliament in Australia. This very famous incident happened on St Patricks Day 1948 during that strike. Clarice talked about it many times for the rest of her life.


For a short time in 1949, Clarice and Ron moved to Darwin, where Ron became the editor of the North Australian Workers Union journal, the Northern Standard. At that time Clarice joined the Housewives' Association, which later became the Union of Australian Women. This wonderful group of women were involved in many, many effective campaigns about, for example, rationing and child care. There is a wonderful story in Brisbane about a large action they took about the quality of stockings. Women in those days wore stockings as a matter of course, but the stockings were not of high value and were quite expensive. The women got together through the Housewives Union—just before it was called the Union of Australian Women—and had an effective campaign about the importance of quality in nylon stockings. I think that is a great example of responding to the need, taking action and having success.


Clarice and Ron moved back to Brisbane and they continued their work and raised their sons. They lived around Fortitude Valley—where Clarice lived for most of her life. She always loved that part of Brisbane, which is very close to where I live and where my office is now. She continued her campaigning and stayed in tune with the activities of the day.


In 1968, Clarice lost her dad Curley. Ron gave the oration. Ron was a great speaker and at many times was used in this way. At our meeting when we were celebrating Clarice's life, his son talked about the fact that he had learned from his dad how to make these kinds of speeches and when he was talking about his mum he was talking for his dad as well. I thought that was a particularly moving comment.


Clarice and her family were involved in the Bjelke-Petersen years in Queensland—which most of us survived—and were involved in all the activity at that time, including the Springboks Rugby League activity in 1971. 


In 1984 Clarice and her family were out in the SEQEB strike—again, handing out leaflets and being involved and always working to ensure that people were comfortable. Clarice was known for her endless servings of tea, scones and sandwiches and her smile and warmth—just making sure that people were secure and that they were being looked after. My favourite memories of Clarice, after many, many marches in Brisbane around the antinuclear movement or feminism issues, was coming back to where we had started and having Clarice standing there surrounded by her teapots and making sure that we were all okay and that we had all got back to the right spot. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, keeping workers together in a march is sometimes a tough thing. We were known to lose a few along the way, taking different routes. Clarice was there waiting to welcome us back, to ensure that everybody was there, that they had a way home, and that they understood what they were doing and the importance of campaigning. 


She was a true nurturer and a mentor to young activists. She was particularly proud of her friends in the Revolutionary Socialist Student Alliance at UQ and the Students for a Democratic Society. She was always willing to help, to have a story, to work with us to make sure that we felt important.


In 1980, she lost her husband, Ron, after 35 years of a wonderful partnership. She continued to live around the valley; she had a new partner for a number of years, Ted Williams. They remained together for 30 years. Ted passed away in December 2010, and two years later Clarice followed. 


At her funeral, Clarice's son Kevin said: 'Clarice was a loving and nurturing mother to my brother Ray and myself, and she was very special. But, without contradicting myself, I believe there are many Clarice Browns in this world. Many of them, male and female alike, have been mentioned by Clarice herself in her writings.' She kept strong diaries. Her life reflected the life of struggle, the life of activism and the life of humour and love in Queensland. We miss you, Clarice, but we will always remember you.
