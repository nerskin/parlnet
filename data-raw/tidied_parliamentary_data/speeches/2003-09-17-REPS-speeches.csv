"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I am very pleased to again stand up in this House and represent my electorate of Braddon, on the north-west coast of Tasmania, in relation to family tax benefit matters. Last night, when I was speaking on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003, I was pointing out what I believe are some of the major anomalies in this rather flawed system. I am pleased to say that, if I have heard the news bulletins correctly overnight, the relevant minister associated with this legislation has been talked into not pursuing moves to withdraw the payments over the holiday breaks for those people on the Pensioner Education Supplement Scheme. I was pleased to have spoken in this House on 11 September on that very issue when we were discussing the closure of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme.
I hope this news is correct, because it gives support to those people, as I pointed out in that speech, who are battling away with families under a lot of financial pressure. We had a minister who in a mean-spirited way was going to take away their payments, their financial support, for their studies over the holiday breaks. I think it was a matter of $350 to $400 per person. It was a very mean-spirited decision. I hope representations made by people like me overturned that intention and that the current provisions of the Pensioner Education Supplement Scheme will be retained. I hope that is true. That would be good news for all those people on the scheme.
Yesterday I pointed out that members on this side who have been trying to deal with the anomalies involved in the family tax payments scheme have been accused of supporting people who are being dishonest in this system. I read a letter sent to me by Greg and Lyn of Ulverstone, who said how offended they were by the comments of the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, for alluding that anyone in this system who owed a debt and who complained about the flawed mechanism for registering that debt were people who were inherently dishonest. That is absolutely ridiculous. The problem with this system is that you register your change in circumstances but the formula cannot take that into account quickly enough, so people have to guesstimate not only about their income but about the effects of a change in the guesstimate of their income, and so on and on it goes.
I have had representation from a lot of people in my electorate—for example, Tanya from Strahan, Kathleen from Devonport, Sonya of West Ulverstone, Karen from Latrobe, Lyn from Devonport, another Karen from Burnie, Peter and Sally from Devonport, Greg and Lyn of Ulverstone, Kerri-Anne and Jamie of Penguin, Debbie of Somerset, Melissa from Burnie, Anthony and Tanya from Devonport, Kathryn from Burnie, and Rod and his family from South Riana. These are just a sample of the number of people who are trying to come to terms with this family tax system and some of the flaws in the way it calculates and then asks for any overpayments to be repaid. They understand that they may have been overpaid, but the system itself, the mechanism itself, is a pain in the neck. I do not care which side of politics looks at this situation, it has to be fixed. At least one of those anomalies has been dealt with in the legislation before us today, although we on this side have moved some amendments to that legislation, pointing out some of the failures. 
I would like to share with the House, in the last few minutes remaining to me, how this situation affects families. I think it is really important we get a direct example of this. Rod from South Riana, speaking on behalf of his family, writes:
I am writing to express my extreme disappointment in the way my family have been treated by the Family Tax Benefit system.
Jarrod, one of my sons began the ... financial year as a full time student and on January 21st he began full time employment.
My wife was receiving fortnightly FTB payments for him and also our youngest son.
When Jarrod became employed, my wife notified Centrelink and FTB payments for Jarrod were stopped as from her payment on 25th February.
so be it—
When my wife received her tax return she found that $626.04 had been retained for FTB overpayments, money she had already budgeted for—
and this is a common situation in many thousands of families—
When she inquired about this she was told that even though Jarrod was a dependant for over half of the year, he was not considered a dependant for any of the year, because his income was over the limit.
This limit is listed as being $8079, Jarrod's taxable income for the year was $8357, a mere $278 over the limit. 
Because of this $278, my wife not only had to repay the $626.04 but also would have been entitled to a further $355.32 after Jarrod's FTB payments were stopped, had his income not exceeded the limit.
In short Jarrod's earning of $278 cost my wife over $980 in FTB!!
This situation is even more shameful—
the letter continues—
considering that $1682 of Jarrod's income was earned working nights while a student.
For him to earn this money we had to run our car from South Riana to Bernie & return 3 nights a week, to pick him up, sometimes at 11 or 12 PM ...
For those who do not know the beautiful area I live in, that is a 75-kilometre round trip. The letter goes on:
The money he earned by working nights was less than many of his friends were receiving through Austudy allowance for doing nothing. Even though our travelling expenses were probably more than Jarrod's income for this night's work, we encouraged him to do it, because we wanted him to experience earning his own money and to develop a work ethic.
Something I believe our country needs from more of it's citizens.
This is how the tax system thanks us for it!!!
Jack Hill the blind miner can see that this system has got a number of serious flaws and anomalies in it. This legislation at least tackles one of those of anomalies—and we, on this side, applaud that, although we had listed this as an anomaly for some time. There are many more anomalies in this, but if the minister will listen to the pressure of her own backbench, her own caucus, and listen to this side, then we are going to get decisions that are equitable and fair—particularly, as I mentioned earlier, in relation to the pensioner education supplement. If I have heard that correctly, the current provisions will be retained. But it is a pretty mean and mean-spirited minister who does that when we have so many anomalies related to the family tax benefit payments—in many ways, it is a family tax flawed scheme.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2003-09-17,"—First of all, I would like to acknowledge all those members who have contributed to the debate on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003.
—Particularly those on our side.
—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has just reminded me of the fine oratory skills of the members for Mitchell and Macarthur and the member for Riverina, who gave lucid and considered opinion on this extension of time limits by 12 months for the family tax benefit. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions, although less generous in their content, of members of the opposition: the members for Lilley, Hasluck, Throsby, Fowler and Braddon.
This bill makes a number of important changes to the family assistance law. In broad terms, these changes will give families more time to claim family tax benefit or child-care benefit as a lump sum for a previous income year and will provide greater capacity to pay top-ups of the family tax benefit. Under the current system, families have 12 months from the end of the relevant income year in which to make a lump sum claim for the family tax benefit or child-care benefit of that income year. The bill extends this time limit by 12 months. This means that families will have two years after the end of the relevant income year in which to make a lump sum claim. This change will apply from the 2001-02 income year and will enable families to claim family tax benefit or child-care benefit for 2001-02 up until 30 June 2004, instead of the current 30 June 2003.
This bill also extends the time frame for payments of top-ups of the family tax benefit. Top-ups for families who overestimate their income for the year are a feature of the FTB system that did not exist under Labor's old system. Centrelink has already paid out around $870 million in top-ups since the introduction of FTB. This is an important point; there were never top-ups under the old system which was put in place by the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, many people lost out on social security payments because of the poor policy that they had in this area. Under the current rules, a top-up of family tax benefit can only be paid if the customer lodges the relevant tax returns within 12 months after the end of the income year to which the payment relates. If tax returns are not lodged on time then the amounts of a family tax benefit paid in the relevant income year become a debt until such time as income reconciliation occurs.
The amendments do not affect the basic requirement to lodge tax returns within this 12-month time frame to avoid a debt being raised. They do, however, ensure that a top-up of family tax benefits can be paid if the relevant tax returns are lodged within two years after the relevant income year. This is an extension of 12 months, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and I know the people of Maranoa will welcome it. This measure will enable top-ups to be paid in respect of the 2001-02 income year if the relevant tax returns are lodged by 30 June 2004, instead of the current 30 June 2003. The new time frames will also apply to later income years. The deadline for lodging tax returns for taxation purposes is not affected by these measures. Around two million Australian families, and around 3½ million Australian children, have already benefited through the introduction of family tax benefit. This is the vast majority of Australian families with dependent children. Government expenditure on family assistance increases by around $2 billion a year. This measure in the bill will affect approximately 35,000 families. 
The government opposes the opposition's proposed amendments. The time frames relating to the exchange, use and destruction of tax file number data for income reconciliation purposes is extended from two to three years, in keeping with the extended time frames for lump sum claims and payments of top-ups of family tax benefit. Consequential amendments are also made to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to enable families who use the services of a recognised tax adviser to make lump sum claims from 1 July 2003 until 30 June 2004 to continue to be able to claim the adviser's fee as a tax deduction. I commend this bill to the House. The government will be opposing the opposition's amendment.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Swan's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The opposition has a number of reservations in terms of the public policy that underpins the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003, particularly in the context of the recent controversy concerning Manildra and the ethanol industry. The background to the government's alternative fuels policy dates to 1999 when, as part of the deal with the Democrats to pass the GST, it announced its Measures for a Better Environment package. Subsequently, in September 2002 the government announced that it would be imposing an excise on ethanol and biodiesel fuels at the same rate as that applying to petrol and that, in exchange, it would introduce a domestic producer subsidy as an offset. This policy followed the release of the fuel tax inquiry—the so-called Trebeck inquiry—which recommended that excise/customs duty should apply to all liquid fuels, with rates applied according to the relative energy content of each fuel.
In the 2003 budget the government announced its intention to reform the fuel tax arrangements and to support measures designed to encourage cleaner fuels. It did so, however, by basically junking the Trebeck report. This indicates one important aspect of government policy making—it is all ad hoc. Its alternative fuels policy is all ad hoc and, of course, it is a strategy of not only picking industry winners but also of picking individual companies within those industries. This is reflected in the outrageous decisions that were made to benefit Manildra at the expense of other Australian companies, some of them much smaller companies, and I will come to that issue in due course.
Labor has a number of concerns about the bill—most particularly, the lack of transparency in the government's fuel subsidy arrangements. We have a concern about the lack of a seamless subsidy scheme—in particular, how ethanol subsidies are not captured in this bill and have been separately appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). We are also concerned about the ability to prescribe by regulation what constitutes a cleaner fuel. This opens up scope for wide access to the scheme and a lack of accountability and transparency as to who may benefit from this particular provision. Also, we look at the so-called progressive nature of the scheme, where the regulations will prescribe what clean fuel is as it becomes eligible for a grant, not the other way around. We are also concerned about the cost of the scheme and the continuation of production subsidies to an industry without regard to performance or success. The historic performance of the industry, despite it enjoying zero excise status over many years, and the findings of the Trebeck report are genuine concerns. Let me quote from the Trebeck report:
... no analysis has been undertaken to establish the benefits to rural and regional areas of the tax concessions and whether they could be achieved at lower cost by other means. 
That is a very important quote. When you have got no analysis being undertaken to look at the benefits to rural and regional areas you have really got a government that is flying blind and allocating a substantial amount of money without a guarantee to the Australian taxpayer—the hardworking Australian taxpayer—that the money is going to be well spent to achieve a public interest outcome. 
The overall fabric of the policy is poor and has been designed around the needs of selected companies, not taxpayers or consumers. Labor is yet to be convinced that the public interest is being met by this particular legislation. Of course, we point to the Manildra-gate controversy as an example of where the government has gone wrong in its alternative fuels policy. Labor wants an effective biofuels strategy for Australia. We believe in an effective alternative fuels policy, and our energy task force is working on that particular goal in terms of our policy development. One thing we can say for sure is, `Look at the Manildra-gate scandal and you'll find a very good example of how not to do it.' If you look at the way in which the government has handled the ethanol industry you will see a classic case study of how not to run public policy in this country. The Manildra-gate controversy not only involved the misleading of the parliament but also debased the integrity of economic policy in Australia. We have effectively seen the formation of a public-private cartel, with the Howard government working hand in glove with one company—Manildra—to disadvantage every other company in the ethanol market. It is ad hoc, it is picking winners and it is discriminating against other Australian companies and economic interests.
It is more than just picking industry winners; it is picking one company in a particular industry—in this case the dominant ethanol producer in Australia—to protect and preserve that company's near-monopoly status. This is a stunning example of crony capitalism at work. Let me explain the sequence of events and the perversion of public policy. On 24 July last year representatives of Trafigura met with Manildra in an attempt to secure a domestic ethanol product. Manildra stalled and then refused to supply Trafigura and another competitor company, a small Australian owned firm called Neumann Petroleum. On 1 August, the head of Manildra, Mr Dick Honan, met with the Prime Minister. At this point Manildra had an important piece of market information: if it did not supply Neumann and Trafigura, the only way in which they could obtain their product was from overseas. The official record of the meeting shows that Mr Howard and Mr Honan discussed `the payment of a producer credit to ethanol producers to enable Australian ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product'.
On 10 September last year cabinet decided to act on Honan's request by imposing excise on ethanol and paying an equal production credit for domestic producers. By this time, Neumann and Trafigura had arranged an ethanol shipment from Brazil. In an amazing act of favouritism, the government used the resources of the Australian Embassy in Brazil to monitor the shipment and ensure that it could never dock profitably in Australia. At this point the fix was in. While Honan had received a public subsidy of more than $200 million, his two competitors were stranded on the high seas with ethanol losses of $1 million.
The Howard government did not even have the decency to tell Neumann and Trafigura of the new policy arrangements. The government sat and watched the shipment cross the Pacific Ocean knowing that this would financially damage Manildra's competitors. Not surprisingly, Mr Paul Morton, the head of Neumann and its 59 Australian staff described the situation as: 
Pernicious and treacherous. The way they did it was absolutely meant to punish Trafigura and Neumann. They weren't just changing the law to protect Manildra but were setting out to cause us a financial loss.
So let that be put on the record: this is a government that is willing to discriminate against an Australian owned, Australian run, Australian staffed small business to protect the big player in the industry and do so in a pernicious and treacherous fashion. There was no transparency, no accountability and no letting Neumann and Trafigura know about the arrangements but rather a deliberate attempt to hurt them financially—not only an attempt to benefit Manildra but to hurt the competitors financially.
If these things had happened solely in the private sector, the members of the cartel would have been prosecuted under the Trade Practices Act—that is how bad this is as a piece of public policy. If this had been happening exclusively in the private sector, they would have been up before the ACCC and the courts for breaches of the Trade Practices Act. It is one of the worst pieces of public policy in memory—a signpost in the deterioration of the Howard government in their drift towards crony capitalism. At the end of day this government does not believe in competitive markets. It does not believe in fair trading arrangements; it believes in preference, special deals and insider arrangements for the mates of and donors to the government. That is what has happened shamefully in the ethanol industry.
In terms of economic policy, crony capitalism of this kind distorts investment. It leads capital into inefficient uses. It hurts competitiveness. It hurts those who are relatively powerless in the industry. It hurts the consumers and the taxpayers who have to pay more. It is bad economic policy and it is a sign that, under the influence of the National Party, the government is trending back to McEwenism. All those rorts, all those distortions, all those unfair trading arrangements that we had in the sixties and the early seventies—they are trending back towards McEwenism under the influence of the National Party. That is all they ever know. They are not interested in competitive markets. It is a very short-term simplistic view of economic policy. They back their mates. They back their donors and the competitive markets can be thrown out the window. That is the basis of McEwenism. It is the only thing the National Party has ever known. It is all they have ever stood for.
—What they disadvantage is good economic policy and the likelihood that investment will be used in an efficient public interest way in this country. That is what the National Party is always on about—it is the special deals, the insider deals for mates—and the member for Riverina should know better. She is one of those National Party members who stands up and says she backs small business. Where was she when Neumann Petroleum was left on the high seas sure to take a heavy financial loss because of the deliberate favouritism and policies of the Howard government? Where was she, with all that small business rhetoric, standing up for the small player in the ethanol industry? She willingly allowed the government to do that company in the neck. She sat there knowing that that company would be disadvantaged by this policy arrangement and all those millions of words about small business were just totally neglected and disregarded. Why? Because she with other National Party members were looking after a big business mate. A big business donor to the government was getting preferential treatment and was getting the sort of favouritism that disgracefully is known as McEwenism. She is into it up to her neck, and she has no defence for the outrageous public policy decision that was introduced. 
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! The member for Werriwa will please address his remarks through the chair.
—I will indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. So there is no defence for the rort that was pulled. There is no defence for the favouritism and the insider deals of the National Party. For all their rhetoric about small business, for all the protests and talk that we hear in this parliament day after day that this is a government that stands for small business, I say just one thing: remember Neumann Petroleum. Remember the small Australian owned, Australian run, Australian staffed company that wanted to do nothing more than trade in the Australian market in ethanol. They went through all the processes and followed all the rules to find out what? To find out that the Prime Minister had cut a deal in secret with the head of Manildra, the big business competitor and then, even worse, set up arrangements that sold Neumann a pup. It allowed them to get that ethanol product shipped out of Brazil and sail across the high seas with the government—and the government alone—knowing that this was going to incur a financial loss for Neumann. They did not even have the decency to tell the small business that they had been sold a pup. They did not even have the decency to tell the small business they were doing them right in the neck.
That is the shame of this public policy fiasco. It is quite frankly a replay of all the worst aspects of McEwenism—the National Party in there trying to mould the market instead of allowing competitive capitalism to do its best; the National Party in there with special deals and favours for its mates; and, the National Party trying to pretend that it knows more, it knows better and it can pick the winners to determine industry outcomes.
I thought that we had left all that behind us 20 years ago, when a Labor government introduced reforms to open up and liberalise the Australian economy, to establish a level playing field and to restore and respect the integrity of competitive markets. We hear government ministers saying, `We supported all those things through the Senate. We were a responsible opposition in supporting all those reforms through the Australian Senate,' but now they are back to their worst. They have crawled out from under their rocks in the ethanol industry and they are back in there picking winners and playing favourites in an industry that, quite frankly, deserves better.
The bottom line is that you have a replay of the bad outcomes of McEwenism. When they get in there doing the rorts, the favouritism and the preference for their industry mates, it hurts the whole industry, including Manildra. The scandal, the bad publicity and the lack of consumer confidence in ethanol should be a lesson to people like the member for Riverina. It just does not work. Rorting industry policy does not work because the whole industry suffers.
The motoring public is very cynical about this issue. I have driven through parts of regional Victoria where service station owners have placards up guaranteeing that there is no ethanol in their petrol. And you have the motoring organisations speaking out for their constituency and raising the fears time after time. When on top of those consumer concerns you see the rorting of industry policy and all the scandal that came out of it—debated in this parliament—the lesson is clear cut: you hurt the industry by rorting industry policy. 
After the lessons rammed into our brains in the sixties and the failure of McEwenism, for the National Party, including the member for Riverina, to come back to these rorts is absolutely pathetic. They should know better. But it is not just the member for Riverina who should know better; people higher up in the government should also know better. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, defended the industry rort. He said that this was good public policy. He stood up to defend the way in which the Prime Minister had not only misled the parliament but also formed a public-private cartel with Manildra. But let us go beyond the Treasurer and go to the advice of the Treasury. In its coordination comments to the cabinet on 10 September last year, Treasury said:
Treasury is strongly opposed to linking development of the ethanol industry with assistance for the sugar industry. Such development will do nothing to assist sugar farmers and will only raise false hopes.
It went on to say:
... ethanol is an inferior product to petrol, having only 60 per cent of the energy content of petrol, potential operational problems and, currently, significantly higher production costs than petrol. Without a clear direction being set as to the long-term tax treatment of these fuels, it is likely that the alternative fuel industries will continue to grow in a highly inefficient way ...
That is the Australian Treasury talking. That is the Australian Treasury giving its best economic advice to the Howard government. It concluded:
We note that, unless ethanol's production costs can be reduced over time, expanding its production would inevitably lead to a growing fiscal cost (if subsidised) ...
One can only imagine what Treasury has to say about this bill.
Clearly Treasury is against the ad hoc policy making. It is against the strategy of trying to pick winners—not only industry winners but also corporate winners—in the ethanol industry itself. The Treasury, very clearly in this advice, is against the sorts of rorts and favouritism that the Liberal and National parties have pulled in the ethanol sector. But it was not only the Treasury; the Department of Finance and Administration is also scarifying in its criticism of government policy. This is what Finance put through in its coordination comments prior to the cabinet decision:
Finance does not support the inclusion of measures relating to ethanol production in this package.
... an expanded domestic ethanol industry would have little or no impact on the world sugar price or the price available to Australian sugar producers supplying the ethanol industry.
Finance went on to say that it:
... considers that the measures raised for Ministers' consideration will do nothing for the sugar industry, duplicate the objectives of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme, offer no quantifiable environmental benefits, appear poorly targeted, impose significant costs on other Australian industries, especially rural and regional industries, and will potentially result in significant costs to the Budget.
Whack, whack, whack! In terms of public policy, whack, whack, whack! Basically it has said that there is nothing good about the government's ethanol strategy.
We have people like the member for Riverina and the Treasurer standing up and saying it is good policy. How would they know? Why are they saying that they know better than the government's economic advisers—the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration? So what will the member for Riverina—a McEwenist economic thinker in the National Party—stand up and say about how she knows better than the government's economic advisers and how she knows better than the workings of competitive capitalism? Do you know what she is going to say? She will say, `I met some of these people and they showed me around their plant,' and then we will probably find out that they kicked in for her election campaign. That is the basis on which she thinks she can decide that this one company alone, Manildra, should receive preferential treatment—that, because she met these people, inspected their plant and got a donation, this is the company that should be the beneficiary of government policy at the expense of all other Australian companies in this industry. 
How is the Howard government operating? It is a government for insiders; a government for its mates; a government for special deals—if you meet them, show them around the plant and kick in for the campaign, you are going to get a policy outcome. What does that say about the outsiders—the people who are left out; the people who do not have a direct link through to the Prime Minister's office or a direct link through to the office of the member for Riverina? What does it say about them? Through no fault of their own, they are discriminated against and disadvantaged in the formulation of government policy. It is cronyism. It is a return to Bjelke-Petersen principles. No wonder you can see the fingerprints of the National Party all over it. That is what they know best; it is the only thing they have ever done in public life—the rorts, the cronyism, the special deals and the favouritism. It is plain bad for the making of economic policy. It is bad for the ethanol industry—and we have seen a very public display of that in recent times.
The other bad thing it does is set an appalling demonstration effect, because it says to all the spivs and all the would-be rorters, `The Hawke and Keating governments put you under a rock with liberalising, open economic reform in the eighties and nineties, but now the McEwenites, the National Party, the rorters and the insiders are back in town. Come out from under your rock and try your worst in all the other industries that had been cleaned up over a period of time.' That is the really sad thing about this: it is the demonstration effect to say to the spivs and rorters, `You should get out from under your rock—the National Party is back in town with McEwenism and you have a fair chance with them to get an insider's deal, to cut the favouritism and benefit at the expense of other competitors in your industry.' That is no way to run economic policy.
Labor's view of this particular legislation is very much coloured and fashioned by our recent experience with these rorts in the ethanol industry. It is bad for that industry, and it is bad for the Australian economy. The government's economic advisers know it. They just do not have a Treasurer who is willing to back his own department and stand up to the rorters around the cabinet table. They do not have the integrity to support competitive markets rather than crony capitalism. It is not a good sign, and basically the only way that it is going get cleared up is with the election of a Labor government.
Only Labor in this parliament stands for competitive capitalism—open, free and fair trading, where companies are treated on their merits rather than on the striking of special deals and favouritism. It is only a Labor government that is going to restore the integrity of economic policy in this country. It is only Labor that truly believes in competitive capitalism. It is only a Labor government that is going to develop a sensible, effective, alternative fuels policy—our energy task force is working on that at the moment. We can do a lot better than the government's shameful performance on the ethanol industry. They stand condemned. It has been one of the worst episodes in economic policy in living memory. Our stance towards this legislation is very much fashioned by recent experience. We will do better for the future because we believe in a better system of economic policy—not only for the ethanol industry but for every single industry and company in this country that wants to do things the right, fair and decent way. ",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-09-17,"—I have sat here and been accused of a whole host of measures by the member for Werriwa concerning, certainly, my election campaigns. I find the attack and the personal approach of the member for Werriwa in this debate on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 to be quite outstanding. It is just incredible to hear the member for Werriwa speak of this company, Trafigura, as being a small business. Trafigura is not a small business. Trafigura is not in a small country town.
I will never walk away from defending small businesses and their rights in employment in country areas. The member for Werriwa consistently moves on with his economic rationalism, his economic pathway to reform and his competition policies and process that only ever benefit city jobs. The only people who benefit from economic rationalism and from economic pathways to reform are those with jobs in the city. There are more city jobs and fewer country jobs. It is there. It is documented. The only people who are losers are the people whom I represent. I will never stand back or move away from supporting those people who live and work in country New South Wales and country Australia.
The member for Werriwa continually indicated that Trafigura is a small business and that, following McEwenism, the National Party came in and took away the rights of the small business. I have an excerpt from the Wall Street Journal web site that indicates that we had some significant difficulties with the food for oil program and some difficulties with Iraq gaining an illegal $9 million by sneaking thousands of barrels of oil past UN inspectors at an oil platform off the coast of Iraq. In speaking about this process and the oil tanker named the Essex, the article states:
The Essex was chartered by Trafigura Beheer BV, a Dutch-based oil trading company with major operations in London. Trafigura had purchased its oil from a middleman, Ibex Energy France, which in turn had bought it from SOMO, the Iraqi government's oil monopoly. The entire cargo was eventually sold to U.S. refiners.
This article indicates that, in a sworn affidavit in a lawsuit between the two companies in the British High Court of Justice, Ibex's general manager said that Trafigura and Ibex split the proceeds 60-40, with Trafigura getting roughly $383,000. In his affidavit, the same gentleman said:
... the scheme was cooked up by Trafigura to make up for an earlier loss on an Iraqi oil deal that fell through in 1999.
We could go on. There is more. But I do not want to waste the time of the House in dealing with allegations from the Wall Street Journal web site. I merely want to say that the portrayal of this company as a small business and the attack on me as representing small business does not equate to the facts. I will not say `the truth', because that is generally the opposition's call—to call for truth. I just say that they are not generally the facts and that the member for Werriwa has utilised parliamentary privilege in here this morning to ensure that he could stand there and indicate that which was not fact. Not only that, he also smeared and slurred National Party people—great National Party people—from earlier times.
Today I want to speak about the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003. This bill outlines a framework for the payment of grants to importers and manufacturers of cleaner fuels, as announced in the government's 2003-04 budget. You would not really have known that that is what the bill was about if you were listening to the member for Werriwa. You would have thought that the bill was about the National Party and John McEwen and about my election campaign. That is where I take exception. I wish that I had all of those tools and all of that finance that are supposedly available to me to assist my election campaign. Sadly that is not the case. What we do talk about here are fuel tax reform and cleaner fuel measures, which are important issues that this government has and will continue to work on to improve conditions not just for our manufacturers and importers but also for our consumers. In addition to the benefits such assistance will bring to those directly involved in the industry, it will also mean a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations of Australians. 
We have certainly come a long way in the production of fuel, and now we have an opportunity to continue the work we have achieved and produce a cleaner fuel in an exciting new industry. This is what this government is about: supporting new industry and business, which means new jobs, increased investment and a greater future for all Australians—including those regional Australians that, of course, the member for Werriwa never takes into consideration with his rationalist policies and performance. Last week I spoke in this House about the developing ethanol industry and the important role it has in the future growth of rural and regional communities. The advances being made in biofuels are truly exciting, with the potential to reduce emissions, thus creating a healthier environment for our future generations.
Like ethanol, biofuels also present many opportunities for development in rural and regional areas. I come back to my point that the member for Werriwa stands in this House and claims that I do not support small business and that I do not support rural and regional people. Biofuels offer a renewable resource. Like ethanol, biofuels will help to reduce Australia's dependence on non-renewable overseas resources. As Australia, like many other countries, has discovered, our resources are not never-ending and we need to work toward a new method of producing fuels. I have one such manufacturer in my electorate—an extremely effective and successful small businessman who is embracing this exciting new development and has groundbreaking evidence of the benefits. In the meantime he is encouraging investment in rural and regional communities. This is a small businessman going ahead and investing.
Cootamundra Oilseeds has been operating since 1992. The company is owned entirely by local farmers and businessman, producing products using only Australian grown seed. Cootamundra is located in one of Australia's premier grain-producing areas, and that happens to be right in the electorate of Riverina. I would like to quote from a story recently by the ABC in New South Wales on 18 August 2003:
Bruce Smith from Cootamundra Oilseeds says the Federal Government is offering grants to boost the industry, but eco-fuel is not being encouraged in the public transport system.
He says Australia is well behind Europe, where 35 per cent of new cars run on biodiesel. Mr Smith says it means Australia is lagging in reducing fuel emissions.
The news piece states that Cootamundra Oilseeds plans to lodge a development application for two crushing plants and a refinery in the next few months, and I certainly welcome that. Mr Smith also says that the federal government is doing a great deal to assist this industry, including the provision of grants. But without the support of state governments to utilise this exciting new resource, businesses like Cootamundra Oilseeds will not be able to develop the industry. I take this opportunity to applaud the assistance being offered by this government and call on the state governments to offer their assistance and work toward implementing systems that allow biofuels to be used. Imagine the difference it would make to Sydney's air pollution if all public transport systems were to use this biofuel and if we were out there promoting that it is efficient and effective and that vehicles run well on it. I know Mr Smith himself runs all his vehicles on biodiesel and it is proving to be a very efficient and effective form of renewable fuel. 
This scheme will allow for the payment of a grant to importers and domestic producers of final fuels containing biodiesel. The grant will offset the excise and customs duty payable on biodiesel from 18 September 2003 and continue the current excise rate of zero for 100 per cent biodiesel until June 2008. Grants like this support and enhance, and excite and inspire, those people willing to invest, such as Bruce Smith from Cootamundra Oilseeds. The grant will also be payable on fuel blends containing biodiesel, extending an excise rate of zero to the biodiesel component of fuel for the same period.
Under this scheme, grants will also be provided to offset the excise and customs duty on the manufacture and importation of ethanol. The grants payable for biodiesel and ethanol will be progressively reduced in five even instalments, starting July 2008 and ending July 2012, to arrive at a final excise rate for these fuels. Under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme, grants will also be made to encourage low-sulfur fuel production. As announced in the budget, this bill will address the issue of fuel tax reform while also ensuring that the fuel we import and produce is cleaner, in line with the Prime Minister's commitment in 1999 to encourage producers, importers and consumers to move away from using the dirtiest fuels to the cleanest fuels. That is what this bill is all about. This bill is about actual happenings. This bill is about actual incentive. This bill is about moving forward to a progressive Australia. This bill is not about McEwenism. This bill is not about inflammatory and false statements that at times are made in the House. Mr Bruce Smith of Cootamundra Oilseeds has met with me regarding the development of a biofuels industry in the electorate of Riverina. He states:
The development of an alternative winter active grain only pulse crop with significant oil content, will greatly assist producers, consumers and Australia's access to fossil fuel reserves. The growth market of the future will be oils and meals both for fuel and domestic consumption and so Australian farmers have the opportunity to grow these to cater to demand for the product.
Mr Smith's objective is to have 25 per cent of Australian total diesel usage substituted by a home-grown replaceable or renewable sustainably produced fuel crop by 2025 using rapeseed, canola or Ausola. So, as a country small business person, Mr Smith is saying, `Let us get on with production. Let us get on with putting in crushing plants. Let us get on with renewable fuels. Let us utilise the grants that have been made available by the Howard-Anderson government to ensure that country people can stay in country areas to secure employment and so that industries and small businesses can reap the rewards of the flourishing abilities and capacities of rapeseed, canola and Ausola crops.'
According to figures from Cootamundra Oilseeds, Australian total diesel usage is about 12 billion litres. Europe is producing 2.5 million tonnes of biodiesel, which is composed of all sorts of blends including recycled oils, tallows, vegetable oils and rapeseed. This equates to almost 25 per cent of Australia's diesel usage—nearly 2.8 billion litres. I would like to quote from a briefing I received from Cootamundra Oilseeds, as I believe it outlines a very strong argument for the development of an Australian biofuels industry, which this government is assisting. The document says: 
The long term view is that the production of bio-fuels could be extremely cost competitive and provide substantial benefits to the Australian economy.
Advantages outlined by Cootamundra Oilseeds are:
	a reduction of imports of oil and therefore diesel, keeping profits in Australia
	the production of a renewable fuel source, reducing Australia's dependence on overseas imports and any future supply problems
	reduction in green house gas emissions by growing such crops and the reduction of diesel emissions
	value added industries would be needed in rural Australia to process this crop, giving an enormous boost to job growth
	development of a sustainable cropping systems approach could be implemented again giving green house gas emissions advantages
	development of new and improved crops: canola, rapeseed and Ausola
	Growth in educational skills with flow-on benefits to universities, TAFE etc, because value-added industries and new crop technologies will require scientists, laboratory technicians and researchers
	Having a fuel which can be used in environmentally sensitive areas without any risk
	Reduce smoke, smell and emissions, in areas already experiencing problems with these.
Canola oil is a natural diesel with natural lubroscity, unlike diesel which has the lubroscity added. It is the additives that give diesel its emission problems.
Ecofuel is canola/rapeseed/ausola oil refined to remove gums and has 78 per cent less C02 emissions than diesel, and it has no smell. Ecofuel is a natural lubricant and is an ideal fuel for the more sensitive areas of Australia where emission problems are highest or the risk of spills is greater, such as heavily populated areas and harbour and river areas. Such a fuel would be ideal for use in vessels operating in and around oyster and crayfish areas, fish farming, the Great Barrier Reef and national parks and wildlife refuges.
That is what we are trying to promote; we are trying to promote a whole of Australia answer to an issue that is burgeoning not just in the Riverina but in the waterways and the fragile ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef and other areas. The biofuel industry, like the ethanol industry, has so much to offer our economy, with rural and regional communities playing a leading role. That is what the National Party is all about: how rural and regional people can play a leading role in the future of production of renewable fuels and energy so that they can choose to live and work in country areas instead of having to be pushed off into the city to have a lesser quality of life than they might be accustomed to in rural, regional and remote areas. These bills are about assisting our emerging biofuel industry and ensuring our communities benefit from these exciting developments.
In my electorate, Southern Oil Refineries took a waste product that was being used and then burnt—to enable the production of cut flowers and so on, but it was still a problem—and turned it into clean fuel. The waste product was filling our reserve landfills all around the nation. Southern Oil Refineries, a group of local farmers and businesspeople put their money where their mouth is—unlike many people speaking on these issues in the House who have never committed a dollar of their own, never invested a dollar of their own in case they might lose a dollar of their own. These people have invested their own money. They have invested from their own pockets. Should they lose, they lose from their pocket, not from the purse of the public. Southern Oil Refineries have turned a waste product of oils collected from businesses, such as mine and my son's—businesses which have waste oil that they need to get rid of—into a product that is providing a clean fuel, a renewed source of energy, and it is being done in an environmentally friendly manner. They in turn were recipients of benefits from this government to ensure that they were able to move forward and continue to provide this valuable reversal of a waste into a product that is recognised and accepted and is utilised for various purposes.  
These are bills that I totally support. If these bills get the support of the House, they can move toward ensuring that rural and regional people can play a major role in the revitalisation of their areas by growing crops, encouraging investment, encouraging small business and encouraging anyone who is willing to invest in these products in rural and regional areas; and this, of course, encourages job opportunities for Australian country people. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—It is important that the House understands the contribution that the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 make to the debate about cleaner fuels and how important it is that we get this legislation right. I intend in my contribution to also make some comments with respect to the ethanol industry and how the Howard government has got it wrong. As the House well knows, these bills go to the subsidy arrangements for the fuel industry. Those subsidy arrangements relate to the fuel industry in Australia through to 2012. For that simple reason, it is vitally important that we undertake a proper assessment of the issues involved.
It is for this reason that the opposition has serious concerns about the government's motivation for debating these bills at this time. The House should recall that we are debating these bills less than one week after they were introduced. We are being forced to deal with this issue in lightning-quick time, giving us and the community insufficient time to consider these bills in proper detail. This unique haste makes me think that the government has something to hide with this legislation. It concerns me that the appalling policy development practices it has already adopted in relation to the ethanol industry are being repeated here. It raises serious questions about what the government is seeking to hide from this parliament and the Australian people at this time.
While not denying the passage of these bills through the House today, the opposition does contend that this legislation should be given the consideration that it deserves. We are talking about significant financial support by way of production grants and subsidies for the biofuels industry. This issue therefore deserves more than a fleeting glance before being ticked off. Too often, I believe, the Howard government treat issues that relate to the ethanol industry with contempt. In their arrogance, they expect the opposition to sit back and watch while buckets of money get handed over to the ethanol industry without due process and without the appropriate checks and balances. Too often, therefore, the Howard government dismiss serious concerns about propriety and integrity with respect to decision-making processes and legislative consideration of issues of vital concern to the Australian community.
I remind the House that, despite all the issues debated in this place and in the broader community in relation to ethanol, we have still failed to see any demonstrated advantages in the subsidisation of the local ethanol industry. I also remind the House that much to the disappointment of members such as the member for Dawson it is still not clear that a significant government subsidy will result in any clear benefit to the sugar industry. We all appreciate how passionate the member for Dawson is when it comes to the sugar industry and how she does not let facts stand in the way of fiction when it comes to defending it and promoting it. I therefore want to take the House back to a debate in the House last week in which the member for Dawson launched an astonishing attack on the Australian Automobile Association, blaming that reputable association for embarrassing the government over a report showing that ethanol blended petrol is not suitable for a significant number of vehicles in the Australian passenger fleet. 
The facts speak for themselves. Up to one-third of the 10 million cars in Australia will not operate satisfactorily on petrol containing 10 per cent ethanol. The government's own task force has known this for more than a month but this did not stop the member for Dawson, De-Anne Kelly, from launching an unjustified broadside at the Australian Automobile Association, claiming that it had somehow allowed into Australia substandard vehicles that are unable to use ethanol blends. The truth is that it is the Howard government, a government of which the member for Dawson is a member, that has responsibility for setting standards for the import of vehicles from overseas into Australia, not the Australian Automobile Association.
I therefore found myself in violent agreement with the Executive Director of the Australian Automobile Association, Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, when he said last week that he suspects the member for Dawson has been misled by overzealous promoters of ethanol fuel in Australia. I think it is fair to say that this contribution by the member for Dawson is typical of the Howard government's modus operandi when it comes to the truth about ethanol. In essence, it is not about proper policy; it is about supporting your mates, looking after your donors, blaming others and hiding the truth. Rather than let the Australian consumers know what the risk is, the Howard government—with the support of people such as the member for Riverina and the member for Dawson—have sought to walk away from looking after Australian consumers and doing what is in the best interests of Australia as a nation. They have sought to protect existing ethanol producers in Australia by hiding information that should have been publicly available to consumers.
In many ways, a decision to purchase a car by many in the Australian community is still a financial challenge. Many of those purchasers enter into hire-purchase arrangements to pay off those purchases over a considerable period and that puts financial strain on households. For the Howard government to then turn around and have members in the House attack reputable organisations such as the Australian Automobile Association or blame oil producers for actually trying to get through to the Australian community vital information about choice in purchasing simply smacks of contempt, dishonesty and a lack of integrity with respect to policy-making processes in Australia.
I therefore ask the House a question, one which is pretty fundamental and which I think the minister should answer in his response to this debate: when will the Howard government deal with the ethanol issue ethically? When will it develop policy for all of Australia based on fact and the proper development of processes to ensure consumer choice and not just develop policy which is premised on what is in the best interests of its own political endeavours and in the best interests of party donors? The organisations on the ethanol task force know their customers and/or represent organisations that know what customers want. They want a factual debate, an ethical debate, an honest debate—one which is about getting the best result for all Australians, not a minority of people who make substantial donations to the political coffers of the National and Liberal parties in Australia. 
There is nothing in ethanol promotion and subsidisation for rural producers, sellers or users. They know that, but they are being dragged to meetings to brainstorm how to increase the use of ethanol. These organisations are being asked—if anything, pressured—to ignore and cover up the impact on confidence in their fuel product and the impact on the operation of the vehicles they make, sell and operate. Those on the task force have made it clear privately to some in the community that the meetings have been intimidatory and that there have been clear endeavours by the Howard government to get a political outcome rather than a policy outcome which is in the best interests of all Australians. The task force knows that we have had a battle on ethanol labelling and that today we are charged with defining long-term support for biofuels subsidisation; but this is not where the ethanol debate stops. The task force also knows that mandating is still very much on the Howard government's agenda, and especially on the agenda of the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I suggest to the House, has made thinly veiled threats to the industry that if they do not support increasing the use of ethanol then the government will force things—it will impose it on Australian consumers and the Australian community at large; in essence, the government will mandate for and force the use of ethanol irrespective of the impact on consumers and irrespective of the impact on the automotive industry in Australia.
In its Biofuels for Cleaner Transport policy released for the 2001 federal election the government claimed:
The level of support currently provided through the fuel excise exemption regime to fuel ethanol will be maintained.
On the basis of this election promise the government firmly stated that fuel ethanol would not attract excise. As a result of that, many potential ethanol producers in regional Australia invested in the ethanol production industry. But then, in the May budget, the ground rules changed. The government announced that excise for fuel ethanol producers would no longer be zero. Excise for ethanol would commence in 2008—only five years from the announcement. There is still no indication exactly what the rate of excise will be, but excise will apply all the same. This is in direct contrast to the election commitment given in 2001—another one of the government's infamous non-core promises. I think it is fair to suggest to the House that, as a result, the ethanol industry has come to a standstill. This has occurred not as a result of any campaign by the opposition, not as a result of any campaign by oil producers and not as a result of any campaign by the Australian Automobile Association or its state clubs but as a result of Howard-Anderson government policy.
The truth is that, as a result of this standstill and because of the Howard government's broken promise on excise, banks and other investment houses are not prepared to invest a bean in the industry. The government knows this, investment houses know this and so does regional Australia. Potential investors are entitled to a fair return and some certainty with respect to the environment that they are investing in. They are also well aware of the fact that the only beneficiaries of the excise exemption up to 2008 will be existing ethanol producers—and we all know who they are: the huge coalition donor, Mr Dick Honan, and the Manildra Group. Potential investors are clearly laying the blame for the current state of investment in the ethanol production industry at the feet of the Howard government. 
What has been the response of the government? Has that response been based on integrity and honesty in terms of policy? No, it is all about blame—yet again. The government blames the opposition. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has tried his hardest to convince the Australian public that it is the fault of the Labor Party that the ethanol industry has not taken off, and I quote:
The Labor Party's continuing parliamentary attacks on ethanol show it has no interest in regional development and the production of alternative fuels, said the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson.
His press release continued:
The ALP's hatred of this industry—which offers a worthwhile alternative use of rural product such as wheat, sugar or wood waste and will reduce the nation's reliance upon imported fuels—knows no bounds.
Let us get the facts right. The truth is that the hypocrisy of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services knows no bounds. He fully knows that new entrants to the ethanol industry are being inhibited by one thing, and one thing alone—that is, his government's decision to change the excise regime. This raises issues of accountability and honesty which lie fairly and squarely at the feet of the Howard government. The time has come for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to cease being a hypocrite and to tell the people of rural and regional Australia the truth—that the future expansion of the ethanol industry has stalled because of policy decisions of the Liberal-National Party coalition government.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! I am bound, given the Speaker's precedent on the use of the word `hypocrite', to invite the honourable member to assist the chair by withdrawing that remark.
—I withdraw the reference to the minister being a hypocrite and simply ask that he tell the truth with respect to the responsibility for the faltering state of the ethanol industry at the moment, which lies at the feet of the Howard-Anderson government. I am also waiting for the minister to tell the truth to people in northern New South Wales and coastal regions of Queensland about how much the excise decision will affect sugarcane growers. With no new investment in the ethanol industry because of coalition policies, cane growers cannot expect any benefits.
It is about time the minister came clean on this issue and told the people the truth. But the truth is something that is clearly in short supply on the other side of the chamber. The deceit has even extended to the party room, where the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister cannot even tell his deputy the truth; he waited till he was out of the country to announce that he was dudding him and remaining as the Leader of the National Party. In the most self-indulgent act I have ever seen in this place, he ended another chapter in the `Will he or won't he go?' saga. Let us hope that this ends the ongoing public hand wringing that he engages in and he gets on with his job as a minister.
The Howard government will not accept Labor's persistent claim that ethanol is a serious issue for industry and consumers. As we saw with the unacceptable delay with labelling regulations, the Howard-Anderson government could not give a damn about choice and information for consumers and motorists. They were prepared to tell untruths to try to con consumers and motorists into purchasing petrol containing ethanol. 
When the ethanol issue was first raised, the government stuck their heads in the sand and tried to ignore it, hoping that it would go away. The community has subsequently learnt that the government were getting all their policy advice on the issue from Dick Honan. In essence, through donations, Dick Honan and Manildra bought government policy outcomes. The government's handling of this issue has destroyed confidence in the product, shown the government's policy-making processes to be dishonest and confirmed that government policy can be bought and changed for substantial political donations.
Instead of being allowed proper time to consider this important bill, we have been given little time to scrutinise the details of it. That said, I commend the objectives of the bill before the House but clearly indicate that, so far as I am concerned, with respect to the ethanol industry the government's policy direction, from start to finish, has represented a dishonest, un-Australian approach to policy making in Australia. It is about time the Prime Minister made it clear that, in terms of policy development in Australia, a process by which policy outcomes can be bought for political donations is no longer acceptable in the House of Representatives—because that is what has squarely occurred with respect to the development of the ethanol industry in Australia.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not believe the imputations that were made in those last comments about the Prime Minister—
—The government, not the Prime Minister.
—or the government—buying policy direction were appropriate. The member should withdraw.
—Perhaps the member for Batman might clarify whether he was referring to the Prime Minister or the government.
—I was referring to the Howard-Anderson government. Its policy development is up for sale.
—During the course of the debate, there have been some very strong remarks which have been responded to on the other side. It would assist the chair if the honourable member were prepared to withdraw those remarks and rephrase. I will give him time to do that.
—I withdraw those remarks and clearly indicate that we believe that political donations influenced the government decision-making process with respect to the ethanol industry.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-09-17,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the associated Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. The Greens welcome the government's commitment to the production of alternative and renewable fuels and a phasing out of the use of so-called dirty fuels in favour of more appropriate, cleaner fuels. In this context we are generally talking about biofuels—biodiesel, ethanol and other alcohol fuels et cetera—along with the removal from fossil fuels of nasties such as benzene and sulfur.
As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration stated in his second reading speech last week, this scheme is part of a long-term initiative by the government to rationalise the various excise and customs duties applying to fuels either produced or imported into Australia. The purpose of this bill—which as the previous speaker, the member for Batman, pointed out has been rather hurriedly introduced; I do not feel we have been given appropriate time to consider its detail—is to establish the cleaner fuels grants scheme, which provides for grants to importers and manufacturers of cleaner fuels. 
From 18 September biodiesel is due to become subject to excise and customs duty. However, under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill a grant equivalent to the amount of duty will be available to importers and manufacturers, giving an effective zero excise/customs rate. This bill and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill set up the machinery for the grants scheme.
A bit of background on this bill is appropriate. The appearance of the bill in the House can be traced back to the government's Measures for a Better Environment statement, which appeared in May 1999. In that statement the government undertook to introduce an energy credits scheme that would provide price incentives and funding for conversion from the dirtiest to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels.
The Prime Minister announced in March 2001 that the government would establish an inquiry into the total structure of fuel taxation in Australia. The inquiry handed down its recommendations 12 months later. One of the recommendations handed down was that excise and customs duty should apply to all liquid fuels, irrespective of their derivation. The government initially rejected this recommendation, at least partly on the basis of it being `contrary to the government's election commitment to maintain excise exemptions for fuel ethanol and biodiesel', but it subsequently reversed this position in the 2003-04 budget. This decision was accompanied by decisions regarding offsetting grants programs.
As previously mentioned, grants in relation to biodiesel are supposed to apply from tomorrow, 18 September. However, I understand that at present they are stalled in the other place. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill, grants will also become available under the cleaner fuels grants scheme for ethanol manufacture and importation once existing ethanol subsidy arrangements expire in 2008. Grants will also be available in relation to the manufacture and importation of low-sulfur fuels from 2006 and low-sulfur diesel from 2007.
Whilst the Greens support in broad terms these moves by the government in relation to biofuels, we are also of the opinion that these measures only go part of the way towards addressing the need for the promotion of the use of biofuels and alternative energy sources. Our reliance on old and dirty fuels is becoming increasingly unacceptable and backward. It is clear that Australia has fallen behind in this area of clean fuels. It is clear that our reliance on fossil fuels must be phased out in time. The Greens are of the opinion that government intervention in and assistance with this process must be faster.
It is extremely unfortunate that over the last 12 months the debate in Australia on the use and promotion of biofuels, specifically ethanol, has become so politicised and convoluted. There has been much discussion in this House and in the media on the personal links between the Prime Minister and Dick Honan of Manildra, the largest producer of ethanol—and the previous speaker mentioned some of that discussion. We know that Manildra is a major donor to the coalition and the major beneficiary of the import protection arrangements. We have heard the various attacks by the opposition—`Manildra-gate', as they like to call it. This has muddied the waters in regard to the whole biofuels and ethanol debate. 
A further element has been the spirited anti-ethanol campaign by the oil companies to ensure that they do not lose 10 per cent of their 19 billion litre per annum market to the Dick Honans of the world or to the local ethanol industry. On top of this, there is conflicting opinion within the scientific community on the greenhouse gas status of certain biofuels such as ethanol, with some reports presenting it as greenhouse neutral whilst others, both here and overseas, indicate that it is positive by a factor of anywhere between two to one and 10 to one.
Obviously, research needs to be undertaken in Australia to determine an answer to some of these questions or to reinforce some of the opinions that have already been expressed. We need to determine what is the precise greenhouse impact of the production of ethanol and biofuels in Australia from industries such as sugarcane and wheat. There is no doubt that Australia is a late entrant to the biofuels market and to the debate, such as the one we are currently engaged in, that has been taking place in other parts of the world over the last 30 to 40 years. We know that ethanol blended fuels and alcohol fuels are being widely used in South America, the United States and Europe; yet in Australia we are being bombarded with mixed signals about the industry.
Last week the Sydney Morning Herald ran the headline `Ethanol found to be bad for millions of cars' and cited the findings of the ethanol working group that a third of Australia's 10 million cars would not run satisfactorily on a petrol blend of 10 per cent ethanol. Yet, in the same report, Bob Gordon, Executive Director of Australian Biofuels Association, pointed out that car companies which approve the use of ethanol and other alcohol based fuels in the US have said the opposite in Australia. What is the truth? What is going on here?
Australia's total ethanol production at present is small: 135 million litres are produced per annum and about 37 per cent, 50 million litres per annum, of domestically produced ethanol is used in fuel blends. The balance is used for pharmaceuticals, food beverages, chemical manufactures, paint et cetera. The government has set a target of 310 million litres of biofuel by 2010 and will pay a capital subsidy for new or enhanced capacity until the target is reached, with a maximum grant of $10 million per plant.
I understand that the industry is not satisfied with these measures, as they do not provide enough certainty. I have been told that the industry is seeking a 10-year excise-free period in order to develop the industry and to invest. It is not happy with the five-year period announced in the recent budget and on offer from the government. The industry has indicated to me that this is stalling investment in the industry and that the government has to answer for it. The government needs to reassess its support for the ethanol industry within Australia and to reconsider where that support will come from and the time frame for it.
Biofuels have a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the Greens are of the opinion that it is also of crucial importance that the government has a more comprehensive and meaningful strategy to fulfil our obligations in addressing the global greenhouse problem, to which Australia is such an embarrassingly large contributor. The Greens acknowledge the government's move in relation to biofuels and the steps it has taken on this issue. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that there are questions about the government's motivations in regard to part of this strategy. We hope that these issues are addressed soon. 
The issues in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels are too important for the government to move slowly on. We call on the government to confront head-on our obligations on this issue and show the world that Australia is taking this matter seriously and taking our obligations to the rest of the globe on this issue seriously. We must support local industry, local jobs and innovation in the biofuels and alternative energies area. Government must encourage the industry and provide certainty for investment. It must provide a framework in which that investment can be carried out over coming decades. This is not happening at the moment.
I can only reflect the comments of other speakers in saying that I hope politics and self-interest will be put aside and we can move forward on the ethanol and biofuel issues in a way which will provide a positive outcome for Australia's consumers and the environment.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—We have here legislation in which the government continues its endeavours to support and, indeed, prop up the ethanol industry. The bills before the House, the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, provide for the payment of production grants or subsidies for the import and production of biofuels, including ethanol. The bills will apply to ethanol production grants when the existing arrangements administered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources conclude on 30 June 2008. It is suggested that the government proposal involves subsidies of $15 million for the year 2003-04, $44 million for 2004-05, $76 million for 2005-06, and $99 million for 2006-07, and that there would also be a low-sulfur fuel subsidy of $1 million in 2006-07 and $41 million in 2006-07.
These are bills which were introduced last Thursday. From the point of view of the opposition there are several aspects which warrant additional review, including lack of transparency in the bill and in the accompanying explanatory memorandum—particul-arly in relation to the current appropriation arrangements for ethanol subsidies and the applicability of the bill for ethanol subsidies after 2008. We also want to know what is intended by the provision for regulation of what constitutes a cleaner fuel for the purposes of the subsidy in these bills. For example, that could allow for regulations of further ethanol subsidies. We want to know why there are separate funding and administrative arrangements for biofuel grants and for ethanol, even though they are both alternative fuels for the stated policy purpose of these bills. Frankly, it is a very poor policy approach which has seen continued subsidies for the alternative fuel industry despite poor performance and return.
These bills need further review. I believe they will be the subject of further review by a Senate committee. That is certainly something that we need, rather than just having these bills rushed through the parliament without the sort of information that voters are entitled to, in thinking about whether these are appropriate measures.
In the last budget, the government said it would reform fuel tax arrangements and support measures to encourage the introduction of cleaner fuels. Whether the changes it has made will have that effect is certainly open to debate—the impact on LPG, for example. In September last year it said it would impose an excise and related customs duty on ethanol and biodiesel used in petrol at the rate currently applying to petrol—that is, the 38.143c per litre—and also introduce a domestic producer subsidy as an offset. Labor has raised substantial concerns about these measures. The excise subsidy arrange-ments for the local fuel ethanol industry create a protection regime, as against this government's continual advocacy of the benefits of free trade. The subsidy is not available for imported fuel ethanol, thereby placing it at a significant price disadvantage. 
In addition, the environmental qualities of ethanol are a matter of debate. We have had analyses of the life cycle of ethanol done by the CSIRO and RMIT suggesting that, compared to normal petrol, there is no greenhouse benefit in using ethanol. The Trebeck report—the government's fuel tax inquiry—said that no analysis has been undertaken to establish the benefits to rural and regional areas of the tax concessions and whether they could be achieved at lower costs by other means. It also appears likely that there will be little or no benefit to the sugar industry. Most ethanol produced in Australia comes from wheat, and the sugar industry's greatest problem is a low world price and not a lack of market access. Production of ethanol from either wheat or sugar wastes in Australia presently costs around 70c to 75c a litre. That is around double the price of production costs of refined petroleum products—35c a litre at current crude oil prices. So we have got a situation where production of ethanol from either wheat or sugar wastes is unlikely to be competitive with refined product. Indeed, if large-scale production of ethanol were to occur from primary sugar output then the cost of ethanol production from this source would increase substantially—possibly up to around the $1 a litre mark.
There is a series of concerns that we have about the way this government has handled the ethanol industry. Not least amongst those concerns has been the personal role of the Prime Minister in relation to this issue. I have mentioned to the House before, but I need to mention it again, that the Manildra Group received something like 96 per cent of ethanol subsidies paid by the Howard government last year. Mr Honan's company, Manildra, got over $20.8 million between September 2002 and June 2003 while its only fuel ethanol competitor, CSR, received just $845,000. The Howard government asks the people of Australia to believe that it has not framed its ethanol package with Manildra in mind. That is laughable. Here we have a company with over 96 per cent of the market; it simply beggars belief that the ethanol package, the assistance package, is not all about Manildra.
It is also the case that, according to the returns lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission, Manildra's donations have included $10,000 for the Prime Minister's re-election campaign in Bennelong and $10,000 to the Prime Minister's Leader of the House, the member for Warringah, Mr Abbott. The Electoral Commission returns also show that the member for Parramatta has been happy to receive $20,000 from this company. Actually, the member for Parramatta is usually a great advocate of free trade.
—He's a protectionist.
—Yes; he also received donations from people who want to get into the country. It makes a change from some people who believe in free trade in products but not in people.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe there has impugning of the good names of some members. It has been implied that they are taking money for specific purposes. I ask the member to withdraw those allegations.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have done no such thing. I have simply set out the facts of this matter—that these members have received donations from the Manildra company. If the member for Murray wants to draw conclusions about the significance of that, that is a matter for her. These facts are already a matter of public record and I am entitled to raise them in this place. 
 (Mr Barresi)—I will listen carefully to the member for Wills, having only just taken the chair. The member for Wills may continue.
—The record of the meeting with the Manildra Group on 1 August 2002 states that the attendees of that meeting were the Prime Minister, Manildra Chairman Mr Dick Honan and a Ms Susan Murphy. In the copy of the record of that meeting provided to the opposition under freedom of information, just about everything is then blanked out. That record says that the meeting focused on two issues. The second issue was said to be the Australian ethanol industry. The record says, `Mr Honan commented that—' and then everything is blanked out, pursuant to section 22. We are told that the Manildra Group has engaged Ernst and Young to develop a model for the introduction of a renewable fuel policy in Australia based on ethanol.
The record of the meeting also says that the Prime Minister referred to the Hildebrand report, but we are not able to know what the Prime Minister said about the Hildebrand report because that part has been blanked out as well. He noted that `the government will be seriously looking at the ethanol industry as part of its response to the Hildebrand report'. The final bit—the conclusion of this meeting—is blanked out as well, so we do not know what was said at that meeting. That was a meeting that the Prime Minister did not disclose to the parliament when he was asked questions without notice about it in this place back in September last year. His explanation for his failure to advise the parliament of that meeting has been rightly rejected right around the country as completely inadequate and not plausible.
The opposition has been seeking information about the government's handling of this issue, in particular the decision to put an excise on Trafigura's imported ethanol shipment. It has been very interesting to see how this freedom of information request has unfolded. The freedom of information request surrounded the voyage of a ship known as the Oriental Wisteria. The voyage of this Oriental Wisteria certainly caused `wisteria hysteria' in the department of foreign affairs, who were monitoring the shipment. When my colleague in the Senate Senator Kerry O'Brien lodged a freedom of information request with the department of foreign affairs, seeking documents surrounding this issue, he was told that the total likely cost of his freedom of information request was some $3,568 and that he would be required to pay a deposit of $892 if he wanted his request dealt with.
In coming to this conclusion the department of foreign affairs said they believed there were about 1,000 relevant pages and it would take them a certain number of hours. Based on their formula for freedom of information costs, they calculated that it would cost them over $3,500 to process this application. So Senator O'Brien was going to have to pay this money and also front up with a deposit of $892 in case his credit was not good. Many people might have backed off, confronted by that kind of cost, but—to his credit—Senator O'Brien persevered. He found out from the department of foreign affairs that they in fact had 32 pages in relation to their work on the Oriental Wisteria and the importation of ethanol from Brazil.
There are only two possibilities arising out of this. The first possibility is that the department exaggerated the number of pages that were prospectively available under a freedom of information request—said they had 1,000—in order to suggest to Senator O'Brien that he would face a massive charge should he proceed and to intimidate him into not proceeding. That is a complete abuse of freedom of information principles and it should be condemned by this parliament. The second possibility is that just about all of those 1,000 pages went missing—that the department, when it was actually required to front up with responses to the freedom of information request, could only produce 32 pages because the rest had mysteriously disappeared. 
Neither of those explanations reflect satisfactorily on the department or this government, and the opposition continues to demand in the Senate the production of all documents regarding the government's handling of the ethanol importation issue—that is, the way in which it was lobbied by Dick Honan, the response of DFAT in Brazil and the apparent spying operation that was carried out on the imported product, and the way in which the government acted to advantage one company to the detriment of other ethanol suppliers or importers.
I have here correspondence from the Australian Lot Feeders Association which was forwarded to me and, I dare say, other members of parliament in the last week or so. The Lot Feeders Association advise me and other members of parliament that they represent the growing $3 billion grain-fed beef industry, which is a major contributor to regional employment, beef production and beef export income. They say:
This industry's prospects are now threatened by what we believe are the ... consequences of government policies aimed at stimulating ethanol production in Australia.
They say that, due to current government policy:
... the ethanol industry is being shielded from competition due to the excise exemption subsidy only applying to Australian produced product.
And:
This anti-competitive “assistance” is at the expense of an industry that is major export oriented and is competing on a daily basis in the international market place.
They have produced a paper headed Why Subsidies to Ethanol Producers Damage Regional Australia. They take the view that the Commonwealth government's subsidising of Australian ethanol producers will:
... adversely affect the cattle feedlot industry and, contrary to the government's intentions, has the potential to have a net negative impact on regional employment.
They come to that conclusion based on the view, firstly, that the government's assumptions that other agricultural industries will not be adversely affected are quite wrong. They have produced an analysis which says there is going to be `... a growing shortage of feedgrains in Australia ...' and `Industries, including cattle lot feeding, will be disadvantaged i.e. subsidised jobs will be at the expense of others.' They point out that `ABARE, as well as other agencies, have publicly stated that ethanol production is “not commercially viable without assistance”.'
They note: 
The feedlot industry has capital invested, at replacement value, of over $1 billion, and spend over $2.7 billion per annum on inputs from regional Australia through unsubsidized operations. 
There is good evidence that a tonne of grain used for value adding, export focussed beef output generates more economic activity than one in ethanol output.
The Australian Lot Feeders Association have come to the conclusion that the government's ethanol policies are going to disadvantage a very important industry in this country. 
These bills are further evidence of this government's mishandling of the ethanol industry in Australia. The way they have handled it—failing to introduce the labelling requirements until required to do so by the Australian community and Australian consumers and failing to introduce the 10 per cent cap that Labor put forward in our policies—has certainly damaged public confidence in the ethanol industry. They have completely mishandled this industry from start to finish and they deserve to be condemned by Australians for it. Their handling of it and the association with one particular company—Manildra—has all the hallmarks of crony capitalism. We simply will not support it. We are on the side of consumers. We will continue to approach this industry, as we do others, with the interests of consumers in mind and ultimately the way in which we handle these bills will have the best interests of Australian consumers and Australian motorists at heart.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I congratulate the member for Wills on his forensic account of what has gone on in the ethanol industry over the course of the past few months. I should acknowledge that the focus of this debate has understandably been on the ethanol issue. Why wouldn't it be when the Prime Minister is handing out such large amounts of taxpayer-funded money to one of his mates—his mate who controls 96 per cent of the ethanol industry? The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are comprehensive. I am not too sure that those who cover proceedings in this place understand just how comprehensive they are. On that basis, it is very disappointing that these bills were introduced into this place only last week and that the government insisted that they be brought on for debate in the House of Representatives this week. In other words, there was very little time for the opposition to properly comprehend the extent and scope of the bills being considered this afternoon.
They are wide-ranging bills. They effectively deal with the government's fuels policy out to 2012. They do not just deal with ethanol; they provide subsidy grants to all biofuels in this country. In addition to that, they deal with measures to encourage a greater uptake of low-sulphur diesel and of course the more environmentally friendly unleaded petrol. It is worth noting that those initiatives are being funded with additional taxes on fuels for motorists. I will acknowledge that they are not large ones, but it is still a fairly sneaky additional burden on motorists in the absence of any real public debate on that issue. These are important matters because the motorist has, of course, in recent years already had a GST imposed on unleaded petrol. The government would argue that the excise was reduced on fuel to partly offset the imposition. I underline the word `partly' because, as you know Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, at a strike rate of about 77 cents the GST begins to compound the price of unleaded petrol and therefore that 7c reduction in excise is only effective up until the 77c range for unleaded petrol. So we are dealing with additional taxes on the Australian motorist as part of these bills; that is an important point to make.
Under the provisions of these bills, an entity will be entitled to a cleaner fuel grant if it imports or manufactures biodiesel or certain other cleaner fuels. The cleaner fuel grant will offset the customs excise duty payable on the biodiesel such that the current effective excise rate of zero for pure biodiesel is continued. Recent debate on this matter has shown the complexity of this debate and has demonstrated that the development of a self-sustaining and diverse biofuels industry is an extremely complex issue. Therefore, it is an issue that requires complex answers and well thought out policy solutions. It is not about helping your mates; it is about taking a holistic, whole-of-government approach to fuels policy in this country. 
I made the point that these bills deal with matters that apply until at least 2008—I think until 2012. We can only assume that this is the government's transport fuel policy for the next decade or more. This is it; this is as good as it gets from the government. It is a piecemeal approach to subsidising certain fuels and will increase taxes on motorists to offset the costs of some other clean fuel initiatives. This is it. Where is the energy policy? Where is the government's nationally integrated approach to transport fuels in this country? I acknowledge that, as a result of the Trebeck report, the government has committed to tax neutrality across all transport fuels. The member for Wills mentioned that that is going to have an impact on industries that are currently exempt from excise.
It is interesting that, when Trebeck first made that recommendation, the Treasurer, in a media release, rejected that proposal. Why did he reject that proposal? On that day, he said in writing that the government believed the excise imposed on LPG would destroy the LPG industry. In this year's budget, the Treasurer turned around and said that, regardless of what Trebeck said when he first delivered his report, the government is now going to impose a tax across the board, including on LPG. Where is the mechanism to cushion the blow on the LPG industry? There isn't one. The Treasurer said, when Trebeck reported, that it could not be done, because it would destroy the LPG industry. Then in this year's budget he just did it, without any indication whatsoever of any initiative taken to cushion the impact on the LPG industry, a burgeoning industry—a cleaner industry, compared to traditional fuels—which is important to employment growth in this nation. There was no initiative whatsoever.
The government needs to take a wholly integrated approach to energy policy in this country, not one that deals with these matters on a piecemeal basis. That might, at some point in time, mean tax-neutrality across fuels, but how about a discount for environmental efficiency? That would be one means of ensuring that the impact on industries, or on sub-sectors such as LPG, were cushioned. The government needs to take initiatives to grow the consumption of gas-based fuels in this country, not only on environmental grounds but as a means of addressing our increasing dependency on the importation of traditional fuels. As the House would be aware, we have enormous gas reserves in this country, many of which are stranded and uncommercial at this point. But they could more quickly become commercial if the government were to encourage greater consumption of gas-based fuels—gas to liquid diesel being the most obvious example. But there is no plan. All we have is a hotchpotch of subsidies to certain industries and certain mates, and a very subtle approach to cleaner fuels in the unleaded petrol and diesel areas but paid for by the taxpayer.
Returning to the matter of ethanol, the government's approach over the last few months has damaged, and undermined public confidence in, the ethanol industry. The government has done this by delaying the introduction of a cap on ethanol blends until 1 July this year and by only introducing their labelling bill to parliament on 26 June this year, four months after it was promised on 19 February; it has done so by doing special deals to favour the government's mates and misleading the Australian people by saying that the Prime Minister did not protect the business interests of the Manildra Group; and it has done so by falsely promising sugar growers and their communities that ethanol would be a panacea for all the sugar industry's problems. 
The Prime Minister's special deal was a taxpayer funded subsidy, 96.1 per cent of which will be received by the Manildra Group. The subsidy amounts to a benefit of over $150 per tonne of grain, in favour of the Manildra Group, which will disadvantage intensive agriculture industries such as the chicken, pork and lot-fed beef industries, as the member for Wills just pointed out. These are, of course, major employers in regional Australia.
Unlike the Howard government, Labor is committed to ratifying the Kyoto protocol. I think the Kyoto protocol sits at the core of many of these issues. In December 2002, Labor moved to more than double the Howard government's mandatory renewable energy target to five per cent by the year 2010. Of course, the government voted these initiatives down. These are signs of Labor's real commitment to the environment. The bills before the House today are a sign of a lack of planning and a lack of commitment to energy policy, and they are certainly a sign of a government that is prepared to help a mate.
The member for Wills raised an important, relevant issue: the government's determination to frustrate the release of the FOI documents in respect of the Brazilian shipment and the role played by the government, in conjunction with the Manildra Group, in frustrating the passage of that cargo. As I understand it, the Senate will sometime this week be dealing with the excise imposed on ethanol as part of its total package. This means that a tax will go on ethanol to offset the grants already paid to the Manildra Group. The talk around the place is there is a big chance that the passage of that bill will be denied in the Senate. That would mean that Dick Honan would walk away with his big subsidy grants but would not pay tax on the ethanol produced.
People are asking, `Who will be at fault if this comes to pass?' The government will be at fault. The first question I ask myself when considering this proposition is whether the Labor opposition, notwithstanding its concerns about the subsidy to ethanol, supported that subsidy when it came to this place. It did not. Of course, the subsidy did not come into this place. The subsidy is being provided under a contractual agreement between Minister Macfarlane's department and the company, and this parliament has not had a say.
If the government wants to go ahead paying a subsidy to a mate in the expectation that the opposition will happily put its hands up in the Senate for a new excise imposed on ethanol, it may find it has another thing coming. The very easy, clear and sure way for the government to ensure that those excise provisions pass the Senate by the end of this week is for it to do what we have been asking it to do for some time now—that is, release the rest of those documents that we are seeking under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. If the government comes to this issue with clean hands, if the government has nothing to hide, it will release those documents. If it does not release those documents and those excise provisions do not go through the Senate and the Prime Minister's mate Dick Honan finds himself with a big fat bonus, there will be only one person to blame—and that will be the Prime Minister himself. ",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—This is a government which declares its support time and time again for the market based economy, yet this is a government which will also declare its support for an individual company when that company dominates an individual marketplace. This government will declare its support for a massive subsidy worth hundreds of millions of dollars for the produce that that individual company places on the market, and it will allow that company to dominate the marketplace because of the subsidies which it is prepared to offer that company. The government does this despite the fact that it is at the substantial cost to the taxpayers of this nation; it is potentially at the substantial cost to the motorists of this nation; and it is at the general cost to the environment of this nation, I would suspect, although there are some arguments in favour of blended fuels involving ethanol—however, I think those arguments are probably questionable. There are certainly very strong arguments in favour of alternatives, but those alternatives are being sabotaged in the marketplace, which this government normally declares its support for. I would like to canvass with the House the arguments in favour of that general proposition.  
The subsidies which we are talking about in the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are quite substantial over a period of time. In a series of what I would describe as policy bungles, this government has proceeded from catastrophe to catastrophe in relation to the ethanol debacle. The amounts of money which it is proposing to grant to what is effectively a single company in this market are very significant. The ethanol subsidy alone is worth several hundred million dollars over the period of time we are talking about here, and the whole process will last well into the next decade. 
The biodiesel grants are quite substantial, although they are in a different category and have not been associated with the ethanol process. They go well into the hundreds of millions of dollars, as do the grants which are associated with the low sulfur fuel—they come out at $42 million in the period up to 2007. I should stress that, in the case of biodiesel and low sulfur, they have avoided the odour which is associated with the ethanol process. Because of the Prime Minister's association with a particular individual involved, because of the very complex and disgraceful way in which the grant process was announced and because of the difficulties associated with the shipment which was coming from Brazil—and they have been canvassed by my colleagues—that whole process was very much tainted in a public policy sense. I think the issues have been adequately canvassed over the last few months in this House and probably do not need to be further canvassed by me. I need to discuss other more relevant matters. 
When we look at the whole issue of blended ethanol fuels, because of the vast sums of money involved in the subsidies and revenue forgone over the next, shall we say, decade—that is the period involved—we need to go well beyond the issue of just ethanol, because ethanol is not the only alternative fuel. Yes, ethanol as an oxygenated fuel is one alternative to consider when looking at ways to change the fuel blend mix, ways to advantage the environment, ways to reduce the amount of pollutants and particulates in the atmosphere, ways to reduce the sulfur dioxides and nitrous oxides in the environment and ways to potentially reduce greenhouse gases in the environment. 
All of those things are worthy objectives and can possibly be addressed by alternative fuels. But, if we are going to invest hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars, if we are going to change the way in which motorists fuel their cars and, in the case of ethanol, potentially put some of those vehicles at risk of damage and potentially cause motorists to spend additional maintenance dollars on their vehicles—and anyone who has looked at the press releases from the various vehicle manufacturers in recent days knows that this is a very complex issue, because they have put out very complex statements involving various vehicles, various years and various models; it is not a simple matter of differentiating one vehicle from another and saying which vehicles can safely take which blends of ethanol and petrol products—if we are going to put all of those facts before the public and if we are going to subject them to those kinds of burdens as motorists, then we owe it to the motoring public and the taxpaying public to look at this issue as a whole. We cannot single out one fuel and simply place a burden on the taxpayers and the motorists by writing cheques from the Treasury to one supplier of one fuel, saying, `You have the chosen fuel, and you are the chosen supplier. In this case, you are the chosen corporation and you will receive the tax dollars; you will receive the tax largesse. That is the way the issue will be resolved.'  
Rather, we should not only take an economically rationalist approach, which this Treasurer and this government have espoused in the past; we should also take a scientifically rational approach and review the literature, review the fuels and undertake some research. The government should have produced an overriding transport fuel strategy which would have allowed the parliament and the motoring public to review the options over a period of time and develop a proper long-term strategy to analyse the situation. 
I think if they had they would not have settled on ethanol and they would not have settled on the Manildra Group as the beneficiary of this largesse and as the solution to this environmental issue with which Australia is confronted. For example, they would not have sabotaged the LPG industry in the way they have, had they reviewed the matter in that overall way. I believe this bill is a very significant component in sabotaging the LPG industry in Australia.
Over the last decade or so, Australia has developed a very significant LPG industry. Many people in my electorate have invested in converting their cars to LPG. They have spent significant funds in ensuring that their vehicles are not only more cost-effective but also certainly better for the environment. They are better for air pollution standards in cities like Adelaide and even more so in cities like Melbourne and Sydney, where air pollution standards—and particulates especially—are now becoming quite an important issue. Anyone who has stood in a high-rise building in Sydney on an adverse weather day and looked outside can tell from the haze that diesel particulates and other air quality issues are now becoming quite a significant challenge to our major cities.
The environment in general from an air quality point of view is now becoming quite a significant challenge for Australian motorists and for Australian governments, and LPG can make quite a difference to that. Australian motorists have looked at that challenge, have looked at the cost-effect-iveness, have looked at maintenance and have looked at LPG and seen something of a solution, even though LPG vehicles are only really in a preliminary stage of development. Converting regular petroleum based cars to LPG is only the first stage in the development of this industry, because that is obviously a solution that is less than optimum. Converting a petrol powered vehicle to LPG is really the first stage in the process. Doing that would obviously not be an optimum outcome. You would obviously wish to develop a vehicle that is powered by natural gas—by LPG—ab initio, because that way you could optimise the air pollution outcomes and the maintenance and performance outcomes of that vehicle and maximise the internal storage boot space as well as the comfort and performance for the motorist, which is something you cannot do when you convert a petrol-powered vehicle. Of course, you could also improve the cost outcome for the motorist, which is not the case when you convert an existing vehicle, because you obviously pay for the original vehicle and then pay for the conversion costs as well. 
But what has this government done? By subsidising ethanol and then ultimately imposing a tax on LPG, they have effectively balanced the equation in favour of one fuel and withdrawn the benefit for another fuel, without a compensating subsidy. Therefore, they will ultimately destroy the LPG conversion industry in Australia. They have not diverted the kinds of subsidies which they have provided for ethanol to LPG or CNG by way of balancing that equation—nor have they diverted the kinds of resources for looking at alternatives like a gas powered vehicle that they have diverted by way of subsidies for ethanol. So in recent times we have seen and in the next few years we will see massive diversion of resources into the ethanol and even the biodiesel—the biofuel—industries. Consideration should also be given to alternatives like gas powered vehicles.
We should look to our friends across the Pacific to learn not only from the good things that they have done but also from the mistakes that they have made. The United States have had a very substantial ethanol lobby—the corn lobby. Over the last two decades, they have invested some $US7 billion to $US11 billion in ethanol subsidies. You might have thought that we could have learnt a bit from that—$US7 billion to $US11 billion in subsidies to the ethanol industry by way of revenue foregone and subsidies has not bought them much by way of improvements in air quality or by way of benefits to their rural industries. The majority of that expenditure has just gone straight to effectively supporting an industry which has delivered little in real returns. The analysis of their outcomes has not been such as to justify that level of expenditure.
While the US is now working, by way of compensation for that, on an advanced natural gas vehicle, we are not doing the same here. None of the revenue that is being foregone on ethanol or biodiesel subsidies—none of that balancing equation which, in the United States, is now being invested in an advanced natural gas vehicle through the jet propulsion laboratories and the Department of Energy—is being put into the equation here. Whereas the gas powered vehicle in the United States is now reaching a second generation, which of course ultimately will benefit greenhouse despite the fact that the gas is methane, which is a greenhouse gas itself and which has serious problems in that context, it is better in many ways than straight out petroleum.
The benefits of a gas powered vehicle in terms of a reduction in particulates and a reduction in nitrous oxides and sulfur dioxides are real. The distribution mechanism is already in place, and there is a reduction in maintenance costs and there are clean burning outcomes. There are performance outcomes for the second generation vehicles. The tanks are designed to be part of the vehicle. The storage space, which is now consumed by the tanks in the first generation vehicles, which were obviously converted from the petrol vehicles, can be reclaimed over time with the second generation vehicles. The benefits are real for motorists and the distance travelled can be very much the same as for a petrol vehicle.
Obviously that is down the track in terms of when those things can be made available but it is a much more effective transition to the hydrogen economy in the longer term. Of course, that is a benefit which all members of this House are potentially aware of and one which all members of the House would want to see come in the long-term trend but one which we are nowhere near. The government's rush to subsidise the ethanol industry through its partners, the Manildra Group, is a very negative outcome for motorists. 
We have a clear alternative with compressed natural gas, with liquefied natural gas and with the existing LPG which Australia has. We have a domestic gas industry. Australia is one of those countries which is blessed with substantial gas deposits—some onshore and the majority offshore. We have an opportunity here to develop a gas industry which can benefit the environment, which can be a significant contributor to improved air quality standards and which can be a significant contributor to both the chequebooks and the driving comfort of motorists.
I would suggest that the government have failed those tests, because they have not looked at the overall outcomes here, whether those outcomes are financial, environmental or energy policy or indeed whether those outcomes are accountability to this parliament and to the taxpayers of this country. They failed all those tests, because on balance they have not looked at the long-term outcomes for any of those policy areas, and they must. If they are to be accountable to this parliament and to the public, they must look at all those long-term areas and balance them, one against the other. You cannot assess energy policy in isolation. You cannot look at one fuel and not balance it against the competing market opportunities and the competing environmental opportunities of another.
That is why this government has failed that series of tests and that is why I would suggest that the policies outlined by the shadow ministers, whether they are for resources or environment in this context—or indeed the Treasury, when one is looking at the various accountability issues which have arisen, unfortunately, in the pursuit of this policy—are all relevant in this context because they have all been highlighted in each of the various aspects of this issue. I think the destruction of the conversion industry and then of the long-term opportunities which we will fail to address if we ignore the options available to us through the various forms of the gas transport industry in Australia and the failure to perceive those opportunities as transport energy policy will be a very short-sighted failure and one which motorists and the gas industry in Australia will long regret.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—It is a pleasure for me to join with so many of my colleagues in speaking on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 and particularly to follow the member for Bonython and his usual insightful and incisive remarks about the public policy choices which we are confronted with here. What we have in this legislation and in the package of policy decisions around it, of which this is simply the current parliamentary reflection, are legitimate public policy purposes pursued by some of the worst public policy processes in recent Australian public history. It leads inevitably to appalling public policy and appalling economics. The member for Bonython pointed out clearly that, when you make decisions to provide subsidies, special benefits, for one product or one industry—in this case, effectively, for one company—apart from other issues I wish to refer to about the propriety of those processes and outcomes, you have clear adverse consequences, which in this instance were known in advance, on other industries and other potential measures for achieving the same public policy purpose in a perhaps more efficient manner.
This legislation provides a framework for the government's policy to pay grants for the importation and manufacture of biofuels. It reflects what was announced in the government's budget. In addition to allowing for the payment of a grant for the importation and domestic production of final fuels containing biodiesel, the grants will also be provided to offset the excise and customs duty on the manufacture and importation of ethanol when the existing subsidy arrangements administered under the department of industry contract expires on 30 June 2008—and I want to comment on that in a moment—and for the payment of grants to encourage the production of low sulfur fuels. 
I want to say, first of all, that I have very profound reservations about the propriety of the process under which the direct contract payments of the ethanol benefits are currently being made, which will eventually be picked up by this legislation. A proper manner for entering into government subsidies by companies for what is a government public policy purpose is through legislation such as this. Even if I disagree with the purpose with respect to biodiesel and low sulfur fuel, nobody could argue that this is not the proper way to go about a government reflecting its intention that it wants taxpayers' money provided for this purpose. But there is no comparable scrutiny; there is no comparable capacity to review here in the parliament in order for the public to see and be aware of the details of a contract entered into, such as that which the department of industry has entered into, particularly with Manildra, for ethanol. I think the public policy process there is improper. It should be terminated, and if the government wishes to continue to deliver that benefit—and we will argue about that, but it is pursuing a purpose which it is entitled to pursue, and we will come in here and express our opinion—it should be doing it through this legislation now, not continuing to do it by commercial contract until 30 June 2008.
I consider that profoundly improper, and I am dismayed that the Minister for Finance has allowed that process to continue. I would not have agreed, had I been the Minister for Finance, with even the temporary arrangement, because I do not think there is any urgency or crisis. But let us assume for the moment that, because of the priority which the government gives to this matter, it felt that there was urgency and there was a need for an interim contract to be entered into to provide this benefit. I do not share that view, but let us assume for the moment that that was the cabinet's view and they authorised the contract. It should not be the ongoing basis of the provision of massive public funding, effectively to one corporation, outside this legislation, outside the legislative framework and delivered by contract. I am astonished that the finance minister agreed to that and it is, in my view, improper.
The government has announced these measures—not just the measures reflected in this legislation but the package of measures of which this is a part—under the title, `Fuel tax reform and cleaner fuel measures' but the most cursory examination makes it clear that the government has shown disdain for real reform of fuel and fuel taxation. My colleagues have dealt with a whole range of issues with regard to that, which I will not repeat. I want to talk about the way in which the Trebeck report, which the government commissioned, was discarded and dismissed because it gave the government politically inconvenient advice. About this particular matter, the Trebeck report said:
... no analysis has been undertaken to establish the benefits to rural and regional areas of the tax concessions and whether they—
those benefits—
could be achieved at lower cost by other means.
That is a polite but stark statement of what should have been obvious to the government. It was reflected in the proper coordinating comments by departments. Those comments went to the cabinet and were brushed aside in the political enthusiasm to provide massive largesse to the company particularly involved in this business and to the ethanol industry. 
Accusations have been made—and targeted in particular at me on some occasions—that in some way we have in our campaign sought to damage the legitimate role of ethanol in the fuel mix of modern fuel policy for a 21st century Australia. I absolutely, categorically repudiate that allegation. Just in case anybody missed it, the Deputy Prime Minister has, from time to time, come into the House and quite knowingly and incorrectly asserted—he may not have known the first time, but he has known subsequently—that in some way I apologised for the public role I played in this issue. Let me repeat what I have said in a personal explanation in this place: I have never apologised; I have nothing to apologise for. I have campaigned for good public policy, and I will continue to do so. After all, what was the policy I was campaigning for that the government thinks is so shocking? A 10 per cent limit on ethanol. What is the government's policy now? A 10 per cent limit on ethanol. The government thought it was shocking when I said that that was what they should do and that there were risks associated with not doing it. I highlighted those risks, and the government was appalled. They attacked me, they said it was terrible and then they adopted the policy—displaying double standards of the highest order.
The reputation of ethanol has been substantially damaged, not by me but by greed. It has been damaged by the greed of those who sought to put a percentage of ethanol in petrol that was beyond the recommended limits. They did that because they thought they could make more money out of that process, and in the short term they were correct. Some of the individual retailers acted absolutely in good faith and with propriety in this matter. I do not reflect on all of those individual fuel retailers who dealt with this product, but there is no doubt that the reputation of ethanol has been affected—and so have the very legitimate attempts by companies to introduce E10 products. Every time I have spoken on this matter, I have said that I thought E10 was a legitimate product and that if it could be successful in the marketplace it had a legitimate role in the spectrum of fuel supplies in this country. It is not for me to advocate this product or that product, and I did not do that, but I accept that that is a legitimate product.
The government has now adopted the policy which they always knew they would have to adopt and which all the professional advice they received told them they should adopt. But they refused to do it because they were serving the interests of Manildra. This is why we have been so outspoken on the issues of subsidies, grants and excessive levels of ethanol. That is bad public policy—appalling public policy—which flies in the face of the recommendations of the government's own inquiries and the government's own advisers. In recent times, the issue of ethanol has reinforced the emerging image that the Prime Minister's word cannot be trusted. Ethanol is one of those factors which highlights that particular emerging public view. It has not created that impression, but it has certainly enhanced it and it has certainly played a significant part in it.
But in the remaining time available today, I want to talk not about that deplorable public policy process but about the economics of this circumstance in which we find ourselves. There have been many arguments canvassed in the House regarding ethanol. People say it has advantages in industry and in regional development and they talk about its use of renewable resources and its potential to reduce emissions and improve the environment. But in this place when we are dealing with taxpayers' dollars for the pursuit of public policy purposes, we always have to argue, saying, `At what budgetary cost will these outcomes be achieved? Could they have been achieved more efficiently through other means? Which sectors of the economy will suffer if we provide benefits to some other sector?' 
The shadow Treasurer was talking about the return of McEwenism and the failure to realise that, when you provide massive subsidies in one place, you cause damage in another. The irony is that representatives of the National Party come in here purporting to speak on behalf of rural and regional interests, saying that we should have this big subsidy because it will be good for rural and regional Australia. But they fail to recognise, respond to or heed the concerns raised by rural industries that are being disadvantaged by the economic consequences of this policy.
They have had the unanimous view of the Red Meat Advisory Council of Australia. It has said, `Please do not provide the subsidy—you are forcing up the price of grain.' The Red Meat Advisory Council has said that this policy will distort the operations of the domestic feed grain market. Of course it will; that is stating the obvious. Most tellingly of all in these times, and I cannot imagine how a National Party representative could ignore it, the Red Meat Advisory Council said, correctly, that this distortion of the operation of the domestic feed grain market—that is, this subsidy to ethanol so that ethanol producers can pay more for grain, which forces up the price—has a particularly adverse effect on those utilising grain for drought feeding as a means of sustaining their stock through the drought.
We have had debates about whether we should be subsidising grain to drought affected farmers. At the same time, the government are implementing policies that are forcing up the price of grain. They had unanimous advice from the Red Meat Advisory Council. That council wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry expressing its concern and expressing the warning that I just outlined. The government rejected it because it was not politically convenient. My only advice to the Red Meat Advisory Council is: donate lots of money. That seems to me to be the only alternative proposition.
—They have a lot to catch up!
—Yes, they do. That seems to be the only useful advice I can give them for dealing with this policy. Their argument is valid and 100 per cent accurate, but I have to tell them that it is not going to work. My only advice is: donate lots of money to the Liberal Party.
We also had concern expressed by the Australian Lot Feeders Association. It commissioned a report by Macarthur Agribusiness, which quantified the impact that the ethanol subsidy was having on the domestic feed grain industry. The report stated that the excise concession has had the effect of subsidising feed grain purchases by ethanol plants to the level of around $152 per tonne. It describes the impact that grants will have on competitive access to domestic feed grains, the growing pressure they will place on grain production and the longer term impact of this on the growth of the livestock industry, particularly during periods of drought.
Why aren't the economics of this obvious to everybody who has to make public policy on this matter? It was obvious to Treasury and Finance. Both Treasury and Finance warned the government about the distortionary impact of such a policy. The government has ignored that advice. It is entitled to do so. Treasury and Finance are not the government and the government is entitled to reject their advice. But we are entitled to criticise the government and say, `You were warned that significant Australian industries and industries that are adversely affected by drought would suffer because you are choosing, for your political purposes, to subsidise ethanol. That is having very adverse effects on the red meat industry, the livestock industry and the lot feeding industry, and you knew when you made the decision that that would happen.' 
—You can't be serious!
 (Mr Barresi)—The member for Kennedy will have his opportunity to speak very shortly.
—The Red Meat Advisory Council were unanimous in their advice. When you subsidise grain, you put up the price. Drought affected farmers are finding the price of grain more expensive. It does not suit the prejudices of those who think that the taxpayers' dollar is a magic wand which, when they wave it, will have good effects in one place and no consequential downstream effects elsewhere. I have to say that governments can do a lot, but one thing they cannot do is change the laws of arithmetic. The law of arithmetic on this is compelling. If you provide a subsidy, you increase the demand for a product. The price then goes up and the other users or potential users of that product suffer. This is not rocket science; it is basic arithmetic. It has escaped the member for Kennedy for 30 years, so I do not expect him to catch up with it now, but it is not rocket science.
—It has not escaped the government. I excuse the member for Kennedy because he does not know, but the government does know. It knows what it is doing is having this consequence and it chooses to ignore that, for purposes which I think are entirely unjustifiable.
Treasury confirmed that this subsidy would not help the ailing sugar industry. I know people wish it would and they legitimately want to pursue the purpose of assisting the sugar industry, but, under the current tax structure, this policy will not deliver that support. It has been dealt with in detail by my colleagues and I will not go back to it, but we are in a situation where the current tax structure of the alternative fuel industry is both unsustainable and inefficient, and the government knows it. The government knows that the arrangements it is putting in place are both unsustainable and inefficient.
The Department of Finance also warned that the benefits to the sugar industry were, as they put it politely, questionable and that they could not flow from this arrangement—that would only happen if there was an agreement with the Queensland state government on other matters relating to the package. That goes to the very important question of the sugar tax, which clearly, as the shadow Treasurer says correctly, should be lifted. It is an unfair tax which is not necessary to fund the necessary support for the sugar industry.
The conclusion we are coming to is that we have a government which spouts the benefits of competition, contestability and economic reform, but which, for partisan political advantage, runs away from those things at the first opportunity. It pursues a legitimate public policy purpose with appalling public policy. The government knows the economics of this proposal are wrong and that it is having adverse downstream consequences for important and suffering rural industries. It knows that it is pouring taxpayers' money down a hole. This is not the most efficient way of achieving its public policy purpose and increasingly that is being exposed.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-09-17,"—Listening to the last speaker on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, you can understand why the ALP's popularity is standing at 32 per cent in Queensland. Their market neutrality has brought the country to where it is, and now they are attempting to blame the government. When the government—in the form of the Prime Minister, I might add; I do not think there are too many others in the government—moves slightly away from the philosophical and policy position of market neutrality toward user pays free markets, we have bleatings from the opposition, who are the architects of the free market. You cannot ask for free markets and then ask for the right to collectively bargain for your unions. In actual fact, the right of the average trade unionist was damaged almost irreparably by Mr Keating and the legislation he was responsible for throughout the period that he was in office, and the national competition policy—
 (Mr Barresi)—The member for Kennedy would be aware of the bill.
—Yes, I am very much aware of it, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the argument concerning ethanol is: do we move away from free markets? We moved away from free markets when we took lead out of petrol. I for one did a fair bit of screaming about that, because lead was not very dangerous in Cloncurry, Charters Towers or Julia Creek, although it may have been dangerous in Sydney or Melbourne. But where human health is concerned, action is taken.
The demands and impositions placed upon the mining industry are horrific, compared with those in place 20 years ago. There is no market neutrality there, because there are environmental considerations. So we have no market neutrality when it comes to human health and no market neutrality when it comes to questions on the health of the environment, but we have a magnificent exposition of adherence to these policies by the member for Fraser—to his shame, as he is an ALP member. If we turned the clock back 20 years, an ALP member would be ashamed to stand in this place and say what he has just said, because of course if you adopt the policy that he wishes to impose upon the people of Australia you can close down trade unionism. But given the honourable member for Fraser's background I do not think that would worry him too much.
The honourable member for Fraser said that there was no benefit to the sugar industry and that Treasury said there was no benefit to the sugar industry. I do not think that I would regard Treasury as any kind of expert in the field of the economics of the sugar industry, but I have no hesitation in casting myself in the role of having some degree of expertise in the economics of the sugar industry. For the edification of Treasury officials and in deference to the honourable member for Fraser, let me give you the figures. I am not dealing in the matter of conjecture but, as the last speaker said, in `the mathematics'. We will deal with the mathematics, because obviously his understanding of the mathematics is towering ignorance, as is Treasury's.
I admit freely and frankly that it is a very small gene pool that we work with here in Canberra. There are only 300,000 people. In my experience of public servants in Queensland, you would have to put a cattle prod on them and hold it on to move them out of Brisbane to Canberra—and the situation in Sydney is similar. So we are working with a very small gene pool. But even with that small gene pool they should be able to find out that there are 540 litres of ethanol in a tonne of sugar. If you do your sums, at $360 a tonne you have 67c a litre—that is the cost. You have to add processing costs to that, which everyone and his brother knows is around 15c a litre. There are those that argue that it is as low as 10c, but I am willing and happy to deal with the figure of 15c a litre for processing costs. 
You do not want to put things down in writing unless you have done your homework—unless you have sat down and done the sums—but Treasury have said that it was $200 a tonne. Well, I am working on $360 a tonne. The reason I do so with such great conviction is that when I was Minister for Northern Development and Minister for Mines and Energy in the Queensland government, I—unlike Treasury—went to the leading experts in the world: Wright Killen of Houston, Texas, and Fluor Daniel of Austin, Texas. We paid them a considerable amount of money to do the figures for us. They said it was $360 a tonne. The average price of sugar at the time over a 10-year period was $340 a tonne. It was actually about $400 a tonne at one stage. But there was no way in the world the Queensland government were going to talk to Transfield—the company who wanted to proceed with ethanol in the late eighties—on the basis of anything less than $340 a tonne, because clearly that was the price we were already receiving for sugar. But, as I have said, unlike Treasury we went to the trouble of getting the world experts in. Even though we had a gene pool of 3½ million people to work on in Queensland—including the northern rivers district—we still did not consider that we wanted to ignore the world experts. Clearly Treasury know more than the world experts in this field!
Let me come back to the figures. If you add the 15c a litre for processing costs, that is 82c a litre for ethanol, which is much more expensive than petrol. At the bowsers, if you are a service station proprietor, you will buy it for about 40c. If you take off the government charges in New South Wales of about 49c, you will come back to about 40c a litre. Remember that you are only dealing with a tenth of a litre here. Only one-tenth of each litre is ethanol, which is 82c a litre, and the rest of it is 40c a litre. So it raises the price of petrol by 4c a litre. We make no apologies for the fact that we do not want petrol to be raised in price by 4c a litre.
I would like to know just how greedy Treasury becomes in this issue. If they give us back an environmental rebate of 20c out of the 38c a litre excise, that is pretty mild compared with the United States, where people are getting US55c a gallon in rebates. I do not hesitate to say that it has the sidelong effect of keeping Brazilian ethanol from coming into Australia. The Brazilians do not want their ethanol to come to Australia—they have many other fish to fry, I can assure you. The important thing is that makes a difference of 2c a litre. So now it is only 2c a litre more expensive than petrol that we now buy at the bowser. I represent an area that is very sensitive on petrol taxation, so we would not want to see the price of petrol being raised by even 2c a litre.
All of this is predicated upon the decision—as I said the day before yesterday in this place—to remove aromatics from our petrol. Aromatics are carcinogenic. We removed lead and we allowed the oil companies to replace lead with aromatics. Health experts—which I most certainly am not; I might be an expert on figures in the sugar industry, but I am most certainly no expert in this field—have said that the aromatics are arguably more dangerous. Most certainly, benzene is a very well known carcinogenic and we have no restrictions upon benzene in our petrol tanks. There are some gentlemen's agreements behind the scenes, but our petrol may contain five per cent, six per cent or seven per cent of benzene, whereas the United States bans any use of benzene over one per cent. 
Other countries removed the aromatics long ago. In the United States they replaced the aromatics—and when I say `replaced' that is to say they have taken levels from about 40 per cent down to arguably around 20 per cent—with stuff called MTBE. The oil companies—and I do not want to repeat the speech I made on Monday—had the choice of going to ethanol or aromatics when lead was removed to get the octane number back up to about 94 or whatever it was supposed to be. Aromatics are carcinogenic—they kill people; ethanol does not. The other difference, of course, is that aromatics are produced by the oil companies; ethanol is not. Oil companies make a profit out of aromatics. One-millionth of a second later, we have the likes of the member for Fraser coming into this House and advocating that we should stay where we are at the present moment because of market neutrality—because of a philosophy and a policy that is imposed upon the Australian people by the big corporations in the United States and Europe, because they want a jungle out there; they know that they are bigger and tougher than anyone else in the jungle and they will crush everybody else if they have got free markets everywhere. That is the reason why. The last person in this place to advocate that policy and that philosophy should be someone from the Labor side of this parliament.
If I may say some words in favour of the Prime Minister, he seems to me to be the one exception of those on the front benches on both sides of this House who seems to have realised that these policies have been disastrously bad for this country. The member for Fraser, a representative of the Labor Party, comes into this place and openly advocates market neutrality, even though people are going to die as a result of the continuation of successive Australian governments to leave a 40 per cent aromatic content in our petrol. People will die as a result of him advocating the policy of the giant American corporations. Is it any wonder that he took off out the door at 100 miles an hour before I got up and exercised the right of reply? Is it any wonder?
For Treasury's edification, if the aromatics are taken out, the advice to the Queensland government is that ethanol will increase the price of petrol by 4c to 6c, which is the range that we got from Wright Killen and Fluor Daniel. The removal or the reduction of aromatics would take the price down by about 4c to 6c. So one is offset by the other. We do not come into this House advocating 10 per cent ethanol. We come into this House advocating 10 per cent ethanol with the lowering of the aromatic content in our fuel. That is the deal here.
Let me also add the small particles argument to that. The honourable member for Werriwa missed out on the little education session, so for his edification I will give it to him again today. The member for Werriwa will get a little bit of education which will be very valuable for him in his electorate. In fact, if he listens closely to me, he may actually become a bit of a hero in his electorate. Professor Ray Kearney is a hero because he has said, `This is wrong, this has got to stop,' and he has taken a lot of lumps, bruises, criticisms, cuts and lacerations out there in the marketplace because he said this.
I went to the chief medical scientist of one of the biggest state governments in Australia and I said, `Is Kearney right?' and he said `This is conventional medicine. It is not hypothesis; it is not theory. Small particles that are coming out of your exhaust are killing people.' Maybe all of these professors that we have spoken to are telling lies. Maybe they are running around saying, `People are dying from small particle emissions,' when they are not. I do not know why they would be running around telling these lies, but maybe they are all lying and maybe the member for Fraser and the member for Werriwa are right—but I doubt it. 
The American Medical Journal, the most distinguished medical journal in the world, published the results of a study that was done for 16 years on 500,000 people. The graph is on, I think, page 8 of the study. The graph indicates that the number of people who die of lung cancer doubles when you reach small particle contents in the air similar to that which exist in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It is possible that the American Medical Journal is wrong and the honourable members for Werriwa and Fraser are right. It is possible that the New Scientistmagazine, which ran a long article along the same lines, is wrong and the honourable members for Werriwa and Fraser are right—but, once again, I doubt it. Let me return to the benefits of this industry to Australia.
Debate interrupted.
—Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101A.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—My question is to the Prime Minister in his capacity as representing the Treasurer. How does the Prime Minister explain the comments of the head of Treasury, Ken Henry, who yesterday identified the housing `bubble' and excessive household debt as serious risk factors for the Australian economy ahead, thus contradicting claims by the Treasurer that consumer debt was not a problem for this country? Prime Minister, hasn't Ken Henry pricked the government's housing truth bubble?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Housing Affordability and Household Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—I welcome this question from the Leader of the Opposition, whose spokesman on Treasury matters has a trifecta of approaches and policies towards Australian home ownership that I will come to in a moment. Yesterday, Mr Henry commented on a number of economic matters, including the escalation in house prices. We have to understand the perspective of this. The effect of the escalation in house prices has been to add to the net wealth of the overwhelming majority of Australians. I have not found any Australian coming up to me in the street and saying, `Look, Howard, I'm angry with you; the value of my most precious asset has gone up consistently since you have been Prime Minister.' I have not had many people say that to me.
The reality is that we have seen an escalation in the value of houses, and it reflects a number of factors—all of them are, as we speak, under consideration by the Productivity Commission—including the impact on the cost of housing of stamp duty imposed by the states and the impact of the land release policies of local governments and state governments.
—And what about that GST?
—The Leader of the Opposition interjects, `What about that GST?' I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that the GST does not apply to existing dwellings—and 85 per cent of first home buyers buy existing dwellings; only 15 per cent of them buy new dwellings. We introduced a $7,000 first home owners grant and we doubled it for very good economic reasons early in 2001. I think the combination of those policies has been enormously to the benefit of a large number of Australians.
But the other reason why the cost of housing has gone up—because people feel they can afford to borrow more—is that interest rates are much lower now than they were under Labor. What is the figure? I think the average loan repayment in Australia is now $450 a month. I say to the opposition that they will be hearing a great deal more of that figure over the many months ahead. Household mortgage interest rates have fallen to historically low levels of 6.5 per cent. We all remember the rates at 17 per cent back in the Hawke and Keating years.
The government does recognise that the strong rise in house prices has generated significant wealth gain for approximately 70 per cent of households. Mr Speaker, let me remind you that the increase in house prices means that there have been beneficial wealth effects for 70 per cent of Australian households. With this in mind, the government recently announced a Productivity Commission inquiry into housing affordability for first home buyers. 
I cannot resist the opportunity of saying something about the alternative approach to housing of the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, who is the Labor Party spokesman on economic matters, has three solutions—or he did have; or he might have; or he could have if he were allowed, if he were let off the leash by the Leader of the Opposition. Back in the 1990s, when the member for Werriwa spoke with the freedom of a born-again economic reformer, he was in favour of extending the capital gains tax to the family home. The last Labor Party economic spokesman who said something about that was Peter Walsh. Peter Walsh mused about extending the capital gains tax to the family home. But, not content with that, back in the 1990s the member for Werriwa thought that a 30 per cent land development tax was not a bad idea and, not content with that, he thought it ought to be extended to renovations. But then, of course, when he finally grasped the Holy Grail of the economic spokesmanship for the Australian Labor Party, the first night on television on Lateline—
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the Prime Minister has not addressed what the head of Treasury said about the problems of the housing bubble.
—The Leader of the Opposition is well aware that standing order 145 applies to relevance. The chair has not at any stage had any capacity to determine the way a question is answered. The question was about housing ownership, and the Prime Minister is in order.
—Ken Henry told the truth.
—Order! The Prime Minister has the call.
—When the member for Werriwa was appointed he sort of mused about getting rid of negative gearing, but he was then dragged into line by the Leader of the Opposition. But we know that, deep down, the real member for Werriwa wants to extend the capital gains tax to the family home, to put on a 30 per cent betterment tax and he wants to get rid of negative gearing.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about what Ken Henry said, not about what the member for Werriwa said.
—I have dealt with that matter of relevance.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Housing Affordability and Household Debt</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,answer
"Mr RUDDOCK,MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer. 
—The minister may proceed.
—In relation to the way in which financial returns by political parties are prepared and lodged, the donations received by the Berowra federal electorate conference are properly reported when they are over $1,500 from any individual. The only reason that the donation that has been the subject of comment became known was because it was properly reported as required. When those returns are lodged, the person who makes a donation is required to—usually because they are unaware of the reporting requirement, I suspect—prepare and lodge a separate return detailing their knowledge about the donation made. Invariably, it is a reconstruction of what they think might have happened. I indicated earlier—

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. I wish to raise a matter of unparliamentary behaviour by a member of the government frontbench. It involves threats of intimidation and physical violence. These threats were in fact carried out yesterday and today when the Minister for Small Business and Tourism repeatedly charged into parliamentary colleagues at a training session for the parliamentary rugby world cup. The injury toll—he is leaving—is mounting: the member for Paterson, ribs; the member for Hunter, thigh; the member for Warringah, nose, and today face; and the member for Richmond, hamstring. Could you obtain, Mr Speaker, the tape of the training session on the Senate playing fields as you did in the case of a lesser incident involving the Holy Grail about a year ago? Since the parliamentary equivalent of the football judiciary is the Privileges Committee, could you refer the minister's rampant behaviour to the parliamentary Privileges Committee or at least put the minister in the sin bin so that his team-mates may recover in time for the first game in October.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—by leave—In March 2002, the Australian Democrats proposed amendments to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2002 relating to child abuse. In short, the Democrats' amendments proposed to impose requirements on states and non-government education authorities to report to me on the administration of relevant state legislation pertaining to the protection of children and young people in government and non-government schools, detailing the procedures and responsibilities of schools in dealing with the physical, sexual and emotional abuse of students. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2002 received passage through the parliament on 21 March 2002 without these amendments. However, I indicated to the House at the time that the government would consider this issue further in consultation with state governments and the non-government sector, which employ schools' staff and which have the legal responsibility for the children in their care.
All school authorities, government and non-government, are committed to addressing this important issue and all have adopted a range of appropriate responses in their policies and practices. The government's responsibility therefore is to facilitate—in close cooperation with education authorities, parents and the broader community—the establishment of a framework that encourages the adoption of best practice approaches to establishing and maintaining safe school environments.
As all states and territories are represented on the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, the council was the appropriate forum for progressing this issue. I wrote to all of the state and territory ministers and gained their agreement to have the issues of child protection and safe schools discussed at the 13th MCEETYA meeting on 18 to 19 July 2002. The National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Council of Australia also expressed their support for a national collaborative effort to ensure the best possible procedures in child protection.
At the July 2002 MCEETYA meeting, I tabled a paper outlining a proposal for the development of a national safe schools framework. From the Commonwealth's perspective, it was important that the framework focus on the full range of safety issues that can arise from, and be positively addressed through, the interactions of members of the school community, including bullying, harassment, violence, child abuse and neglect. A national framework approach would recognise that individual schools and school jurisdictions have policies and procedures in place for responding to these issues and that they have primary responsibility for this area, while providing the additional guidance that school communities generally require in this area given the complexity and sensitivity of the issues. A nationally endorsed framework would also bring the greater attention that these serious and substantive issues deserve. 
Council accepted the government's proposal, agreeing to the development by early 2003 of a national safe schools framework that acknowledges the work already being undertaken by education jurisdictions in collaboration with other portfolios. Ministers also agreed that the framework, to be considered by them out of session, should be developed by the MCEETYA Taskforce on Student Learning and Support Services (SLSS).
I am pleased to inform the parliament that the government and the states and territories have now agreed on a National Safe Schools Framework.
The framework was developed by a Commonwealth-led working group of the Student Learning and Support Services Taskforce following extensive national consultations with government and non-government school sectors, community groups and of course academics. It is succinct and written so as to be easily understood by the wider school community. The framework draws upon existing good practice and contains useful and practical pointers to guide schools in implementing appropriate policies and programs.
The framework is based on a shared vision that every Australian school is a safe and supportive environment. In seeking to realise this aspiration, schools can refer to a set of guiding principles and related key elements and approaches that should inform all policies and programs to prevent and address bullying, harassment, violence, child abuse and neglect.
In making the decision to develop the framework, ministers also agreed to the government's proposal that jurisdictions should report through MCEETYA's annual National Report on Schooling in Australia on the extent to which they have aligned their strategies and initiatives with the framework. The development of appropriate reporting measures under the framework is to be undertaken by the Australian Education Systems Officials Committee (AESOC).
I am proud of the government's achievements in the last 12 months. The National Safe Schools Framework seeks to provide a common agenda on which all stakeholders can work jointly to achieve a common goal, and I intend for its implementation to be built on a foundation of strong government support. To this end, I have committed up to $300,000 in Commonwealth funding to develop materials to help schools and jurisdictions implement the framework.
In addition to this, safe schools are a new priority area under the Commonwealth's quality teacher program (CQTP) and school jurisdictions can apply to use their quality teacher program funding allocation to develop and deliver teacher professional learning activities in this area. A number of quality teacher program 2003 project plans received from school authorities in May have included proposals for activities in this area. The Commonwealth is providing $27 million for quality teacher program 2003 professional learning projects, which are being undertaken by government and non-govern-ment education authorities. 
Implementation of the child protection aspects of the framework will also be supported by the establishment of teacher registration processes in jurisdictions and the preparation of model uniform legislation that provides for nationally consistent procedures and processes for the conduct of criminal record checks of persons seeking to work in educational settings with children, both of which are being progressed through MCEETYA.
Australians rightly expect school authorities to do everything possible to protect young people from bullying, violence and physical or sexual abuse.
The developments I have outlined today demonstrate that the government believes the issue of safe schools deserves national action and is committed to exercising leadership in promoting the development and adoption of best practice in this area. I present the following paper:

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—All governments have a responsibility to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people in our schools. This National Safe Schools Framework does give expression to this responsibility. State and territory ministers for education and the federal minister endorsed it at the June 2003 Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. I am pleased that the minister has decided to table the agreed framework in this parliament, because that gives an opportunity for all members of parliament to add their voices in support of the strategies that have been outlined in this document.
I certainly support the minister's statement that the framework provides a reference point for schools to improve their practice in providing safe and supportive environments for all students. The National Safe Schools Framework is an agreed national approach of all government and non-government education authorities to help schools and their communities tackle bullying, harassment, violence and child abuse and neglect. As the report points out, schools are among the safest places in the community for children and young people. But none of us can afford to be complacent about this. The wellbeing and safety of our children are too important to take for granted. The framework has the potential to support teachers and school communities to improve their practice in this area. But we need to go to the next step, to develop and implement new approaches to make schools even safer places for our children.
Critical to the success of the framework's objectives is the professional role of teachers and principals. All teachers need to be competent in the support they provide to their students. Because of this, the framework contains significant implications for initial teacher education and in-service training. Teachers need to have a good understanding of their students' needs in the face of a problem, whether it is bullying, harassment, violence, child abuse or neglect. Many teachers will need to learn new skills and gain new understandings. These should be part of a national professional standards approach and in the content of teacher education programs. The framework also has implications for school curricula. Students need to develop their own knowledge and skills in solving their own problems and developing positive personal relationships with others. 
These are areas in which the Commonwealth has responsibility. I note that the minister has committed up to $300,000 in Commonwealth funding to develop materials to help schools implement the framework. This is a good start, but it is always the case in an area like this that more needs to be done. The framework includes provision for the protection of children against abuse, including sexual abuse. I certainly welcome the commitment of all ministers for education to support the development of model uniform legislation of nationally consistent procedures for the conduct of criminal record checks of people seeking to work in schools or other educational settings with children.
I remind members that Labor have announced a broader check for people who are working with children. We have announced that, in government, we will introduce what we have called a working with children check, which will be implemented across all organisations that receive Commonwealth funding in an effort to give parents much greater confidence that their children are in safe hands. We have also announced that we will establish a national commissioner for children and young people, who will play a proactive role in promoting and protecting the welfare of the nation's children, including Indigenous children. The commissioner will provide leadership and coordination in developing national standards on children's issues.
In addition to that, we will develop a national code to protect children from child abuse, in consultation with the states and territories. This will ensure that all organisations that we deal with at the Commonwealth level, including all of those in receipt of Commonwealth funding, have adequate policies and procedures to prevent child abuse and to handle complaints. These policies will complement the implementation of the National Safe Schools Framework in government and non-government schools across Australia, and I am certainly pleased to inform the House that Labor supports this National Safe Schools Framework. I commend it to the House for further discussion and debate.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—It gives me no pleasure to raise this MPI concentrating on the heartless policies that are punishing Australia's families and its pensioners. It has never been clearer than in question time today that this government is practised in deceit. There has never been a government more practised in deceit than the one we saw today, and there has never been a Prime Minister who has been more practised in telling untruths. This Prime Minister is the doyen of distraction. That was what we saw today—he was the doyen of distraction. He came into this House and was asked a question about taking the assets of aged and disabled pensioners and having them sold out from underneath them, which Senator Vanstone said on A Current Affair that she would do, and he simply denied it. He denied it, despite the fact that it is written up in the budget papers. 
He also said one other thing, which is absolutely incredible. He said, `Any suggestion that Senator Vanstone is a bully is one I reject.' I would have thought that is true by definition: Senator Vanstone is a bully. When she went on A Current Affair she was directing those bullying tactics at a couple, Clive and Joan from my electorate, who were unfortunate enough to receive a bill for $20,000 and were threatened with the sale of their house—bullied by Senator Vanstone.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Lilley will address his remarks through the chair.
—But, as I said before, this government—and this Prime Minister particularly—is the doyen of distraction. Then the Prime Minister was asked about the 30,000 parents caring for disabled children and children with chronic illnesses. He was asked whether Senator Vanstone's cut to remove 30,000 of those 120,000 parents was still being applied. He said, `Oh, no, I don't think it's being applied,' despite the fact that he told Alan Jones that he had put a stop to the review. There are families all over this country currently losing their carers allowance, and that cut applies to them. But all we had was more deception from the Prime Minister. He comes in here and says, `I'm honest John.' He puts his hand over his heart and says, `Believe everything I say: I'm honest John.'
Does that sound familiar? Where has this tactic been used before it was used on those who receive carers allowance and on those who are going to have their assets taken by his government agency? Of course, we have heard it in the House right throughout the last two weeks. We heard it about the JIC report yesterday: `Look, I don't know that I've seen that. I don't know that that report was passed to me.' Remember when we had the debate about kids overboard? He came into this House and maintained that he had not been told by Minister Reith that children were not thrown overboard, despite the fact that they had that conversation on the very day that Minister Reith was told by Air Vice Marshal Houston that kids were not thrown overboard. Once again, the great doyen of deception—we have seen it all the time.
Now Peter Reith has been appointed to a job in London. How much for?—$250,000 a year. When the Prime Minister talks to the people of Australia—when he talks to the pensioners who are affected by his harsh policies, when he talks to the families who are caught in the family payment debt trap, or when he talks to the carers of children with Down's syndrome and so on—he wants them to believe that he is honest John with his hand over his heart. He says to them, `I'm not lying to you; I'm just being liberal with the truth.'
—The member for Lilley will address his remarks through the chair.
—This Prime Minister uses code words all the time to say that black is white and white is black. That is his standard technique. This deception is all about his desire to hide his mean and arrogant policies behind a wall of coded language and a wall of concern about national security. That is the political tactic. He hopes people will listen to what he says rather than look at what he does. He hopes people will concentrate on national security rather than the bread-and-butter issues which are affecting the daily lives of people in this community—people at the kitchen table and sitting in the lounge room. He hopes that, when they are looking in that direction, they are not actually noticing what he is doing. 
This government is very good to a small group of people. It is very good to the better off in our community and very harsh to people on low incomes. He had the hide in this House today to talk about the fact that he had a commitment to the social safety net, and he implied in what he said that there was a fair distribution of wealth in this community and that under his government people were getting a fair go—the hide of the Prime Minister to say that, when the Australian Bureau of Statistics about two months ago gave lie to that assertion. Those figures showed a mere couple of months ago that, in the last four years, the incomes of the top 20 per cent have increased at seven times the rate of the bottom 20 per cent. While the bottom 20 per cent saw their weekly incomes increased by just $3 in four years, we saw the top 20 per cent of weekly incomes surge by $109.
The Prime Minister had the hide to say: `There is a bit of a gap opening up. The well-off are doing okay, but those at the bottom have been protected.' Three dollars in four years! In that time the GST has been introduced. And who does that flog? People who spend all of their money on the essentials of life, on those essential bills on the kitchen table, which, for those people, are their hurdles in life. He would not have a clue about how people have difficulty paying an electricity bill or putting petrol in the car or fixing it when breaks down—and he has the hide to claim that the bottom 20 per cent of income earners are doing well under his policies.
Let us look at the flip side of that. Tax office figures show that in the last five years the combined annual income of our nation's millionaires has grown by more than 300 per cent, from $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion. If you look at the evidence that has been assembled before the poverty inquiry established in the Senate, there is an avalanche of misery in this community and there is a substantial growth in the number of working poor. The number of people living below a modest poverty line has increased from 2.1 million to 2.4 million. There has been a very substantial increase in the number of people in work who are living below the poverty line. Under the Howard government, average Australians are paying more tax than ever before, and many are losing the rewards of their hard work. Those at the top are doing better and better all the time, and a chasm is opening up between them and the rest. Those at the very bottom are slipping behind. But today we had an assertion from the Prime Minister that those at the bottom were doing very well. With his hand on his heart, he says, `I'm not lying to you; I'm just being liberal with the truth.' That is the practice of this Prime Minister.
The real third term agenda of the Howard government is to put the squeeze on Australian families through higher taxes, higher medical costs, higher education costs and deep cuts in the social safety net. The government are in there, punching big holes in the social safety net and moving towards the objective of the CIS, which is to move to time-limited benefits. We have talked about that before. What we are witnessing under this government is the Americanisation of social policy in this country. That is what they are moving to. It is happening in Medicare, in health and in education, and it is happening by stealth to the social security safety net. That is why in this year's budget there were cuts of $660 million to the Department of Family and Community Services. They are taxing people to the hilt while at the same time making cuts of $660 million. They are taking away the very small helping hand that we provide to people in the community who have bad luck or who need assistance. 
How does that manifest itself? It manifests itself in measures to take 30,000 families—parents of children with disabilities and chronic illnesses—off the allowance. There is an established quota. It is not as if people are being judged on their merits. The budget papers show a figure of 30,000, and that is continuing to be implemented. But far worse than that, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Family and Community Services pretended that they were going to change that. As result of criticism from Labor, Minister Vanstone did a doorstop interview some weeks ago and said, `We're going to re-list six disabilities.' The problem was that very few people in that area were going to be removed. What people in the media did not twig to was that they were still going to remove roughly 30,000 people from the allowance. But the doyens of deception went out there and said, `We're very honest with you. We're not telling lies; we're just very liberal with the truth.' All of those parents out there who are looking after disabled children with chronic illnesses know that. They know what being liberal with the truth is. They see it for what it is: political lies from this government to hide its record, because it is not game to front up in this parliament and confess to its record.
A good thing happened in the Howard government yesterday: nine Liberal backbenchers found a spine. I know it is rare, but nine of them found one. So we had the cancellation of the measure which was going to take $350 from the pensioner education supplement. That is a minor amount of money—$60 a fortnight—which is paid to pensioners who seek to stand on their own two feet, to better themselves through their own hard work, through further education. The government thought, `We really feel like being mean today; we'll just go and kick a pensioner. We will take the $60 a fortnight off them over Christmas.' Senator Vanstone gets a kick out of being mean to the vulnerable, which is why I have described her as a political hyena. It is absolutely obscene that in this community, where there has been an increase in wealth over the last decade of some 100 per cent—we are unquestionably a very wealthy community—this government has a political hyena going around and doing that to pensioners who are trying to get an education, and to the parents of disabled children.
There is no doubt that that was the reason why this very important article written about Senator Vanstone was entitled `The moderate who wasn't'. Does that not sum up the Howard government: `The honest man who wasn't,' or `The moderate who isn't'? That is why Frank Robson declared:
The “real” Vanstone may be determinedly private, but as a politician she remains very much John Howard's loyal Rottweiler.
I do not know what her dog, Freddy, the weimaraner, thinks about that. He might get a bit jealous. We do not want two of those in the family. The truth is that what Senator Vanstone is up to is the implementation of a very harsh American style approach to social policy which is punching big holes in the Australian way. That is the point. I reckon that those nine backbenchers ought really to be thanked for their effort yesterday. Fancy nine people being able to roll Senator Vanstone. Think about it. What a Herculean effort. I wonder what Minister Anthony thought about it. Congratulations, anyway, even though you were not part of it. Nine of them showed some gumption. The challenge for them now is to show some guts on the bigger issues and to do something about the family payment system, which is saddling so many Australian families with debt. 
One in three Australian families end up with debt. Did you know that a quarter of a million Australian families incurred debt in the first two years of the family payments system's operation? That is the number of people who have debts from both years. As we have just finished the third year, we are likely to have a whole generation of people who have got three years worth of debt. What is the solution of this government to this problem? Senator Vanstone says, `Look, we've got a really fair, just and equitable solution to the family debt problem: don't take your payments.' Isn't that a wonderful solution! Payments are there for parents to feed, clothe and educate their children but, because Senator Vanstone cannot organise a system which gives them the payments they are entitled to when they need them, she just says, `Don't take them'—as if the kids' feet stop growing, as if the kids stop eating, as if they do not grow, as if they do not need school uniforms. `Just don't take them,' she says. That just shows how out of touch Senator Vanstone is and that is why we need those on the back bench who showed some guts in the party room to stand up and say, `We want some change in the family payments system.' The truth is this: Australian families cannot afford this government. They simply cannot afford it, and the record that the government has is absolutely woeful. 
Can you imagine the riot that we would have in this community if one day the government decided that they were going to take the share options of 25 per cent of our top executives, that it would just cancel the share options of 25 per cent of our top executives! But when this government comes in and says, `Oh, we're going to cancel the carers allowance for 30,000 families,' there is not a peep. That is what is wrong in this community today: there is not enough compassion and there is not enough care for our fellow citizens. That is the problem that lies at the heart of this government: because it is so out of touch with the lifestyles of the average people in the street and the people at the kitchen table, it simply wants to punch holes in the social safety net. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Before I call the minister, I would like to make a comment. There seems to be a habit developing in this House whereby members when they are speaking turn their back on the chair and do not refer to the chair. I think that it is only manners that proceedings in the House are conducted through the chair. I remind members of that.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1,speech
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2003-09-17,"—I am delighted to speak on this matter of public importance. It is interesting that part of it is about Australian `families and pensioners' but there was not one word whatsoever from the shadow Minister for Family and Community Services on older Australians. His whole presentation today was a diatribe of personal abuse on a member of the government. It is fine to play the ball but not so to play the man—or, in this case, the woman. That is what the member for Lilley did in a pretty pathetic attempt at this MPI, which is meant to be about the welfare and health of families and pensioners but all we got was this show pony playing to the audience, with his back to the Deputy Speaker—and I agree with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that should not be done—
—I do not need any support from the minister.
—I am quite happy to support you. So there was this pathetic diatribe about how this government has allegedly not looked after Australian families or pensioners, even though there was not one mention of older Australians. I think it just goes to show how a person like Mike Seccombe was very accurate when he said that if there is one example of anything that is wrong with the modern Labor Party it is Wayne Swan: anodyne, unimaginative, poll driven—a shocker. Here is the member for Lilley trying to accuse the Prime Minister and the government of being family unfriendly—again with not one mention of aged pensioners—and of not having principles and he has been dragging in `children overboard' and all of the other distractions that he could come up with while talking about principle and character. Yet this is the guy that was quite open about putting the knife into his leader. The irony is that, unlike others who went back to the back bench with a bit of honour, the member for Lilley had to stay here to preserve his position, even though he has been totally disloyal. If you are going to be totally disloyal to your leader, how can you possibly be totally loyal to and honest with the Australian public? 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. The MPI is about the heartless government policies that are punishing Australian families and pensioners. I ask that he resume his speech on the MPI. 
—There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat.
—Isn't it amazing: they have a glass jaw; they can dish it out but they cannot take it. Isn't that incredible? We had 15 minutes of character assassination of Senator Amanda Vanstone—and he smiles now because even he knows that the member for Lilley is a little bit of a slippery character. But we will return to the member in due course. Interestingly, the member for Lilley was talking about question time today and about principles and the Australian government not doing the right thing. Isn't it interesting that we talked about Centenary House beforehand? Those opposite are quite happy to have a huge benefit from the Australian taxpayer through a rort directly going to their—
—I do not understand how that has got anything to do with the business before the chair.
—I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I will link it directly. They are quite happy to take financial benefit for their own party and yet they masquerade themselves as representing Australian workers and families when what they say and what they do are two different things.
But let us look at what the government have achieved for Australian families, and I will also describe what we have done for pensioners, which was not even mentioned once in the member for Lilley's speech on the MPI. The first thing is that Australian families today are infinitely better off than they would have been if the alternative government had been in power today, with their track record over 13 years of stewardship. It is interesting when you look back at that period because I think that is the only thing we can set an example by. We have to look back at the period that the Hawke-Keating government was in power to at least get a feel for and a flavour of what it might be like today if the Australian Labor Party had been lucky enough to capture the Treasury benches. If we look back at that period and talk about the lower quartile of Australian workers, even back then under the Accord—which is this deal done between the ALP and the unions—there was a five per cent fall in real terms in wages in the six years from 1990 through to 1996. There was an actual reduction in the salaries of those people that the member for Lilley is meant to be advocating for and preaching on behalf of.
Even looking at that quartile, there has been an 8.4 per cent increase in wages that we have been able to measure from 1996 through to at least 2000. Of course we want to see further increases in wages in a moderate context, but that is actually happening under a conservative government, not under an ALP government. So the first point where he is absolutely wrong in his argument is that wages have gone up, particularly for those people who are in the lowest quartile when it comes to earnings. Talking about those families, I say that one of the benefits that we have provided has been in being more generous through the family tax benefit: an extra $2 billion was paid out in 1990 and the amount continues to climb. We are looking now at the average family receiving about $4,700 through family tax benefit part A and maybe up to about $1,900 through family tax benefit part B. 
This conservative government—this Liberal-National government—believes it should support 90 per cent of Australian families with these payments. We are going to give them more money but in turn we want to make sure they get their correct entitlement, not more and not less. That is exactly why we have a top-up provision—something that did not exist under the previous ALP administration.
—It is a catch-up, not a top-up.
—I point out to the member for Lilley, who is clearly interjecting, firstly, that real wages have grown, which I have demonstrated; secondly, there have been increases in family assistance payments; and, thirdly, the greatest thing you can do for Australian families is give them a job. Again, when we look back at the record, when they were sitting on this side of the House, we had record high unemployment. But the coalition has created 1.2 million jobs. There are families in which both mum and dad, or the son or daughter—1.2 million Australians—are gainfully employed because of the policies of the Howard-Anderson government. There is no doubt about that. There were 80,000 new jobs created last month, and that is benefiting Australian families.
The fourth point is interest rates. If there is one thing that is going to help Australian families it is ensuring that they are paying affordable interest rates on their mortgages. Despite the increases in property prices, we have seen today that the cost of a variable home mortgage rate is 6.55 per cent. Back in 1995 or 1996, when the member for Lilley was last involved—he was probably too busy doing the Centenary House deal—the variable mortgage rate was around 10 per cent. Going back a few years before that, it was 17 per cent. Talk about family friendly policies! We had a mortgage rate of 17 percent; that was fine. We had a real reduction in wages; that was okay too. We had a reduction in what were previously social security payments; you could not get top-ups. This is the classic example of how Australians were worse off. They were worse off because, remember, we had the recession that we had to have! There would of course be a recession again if the Australian Labor Party were ever able to take the treasury bench.
The member for Lilley talks about the government's third term agenda on Medicare and on the social security safety net et cetera. This government wants to give people a hand up, not just a handout. We want to ensure there is an appropriate social security net and we also want to maximise people's opportunity to regain employment, whether that be for older Australians, Australians on the disability support pension or Australians who are caring for their kids or their loved ones. This government has a very proud record when it comes to looking after Australian families.
It is interesting when we look at some of these other areas. The member for Lilley talks about spine, but we know that the member for Lilly—old jellyback—does not have much of a spine at all. In a press conference in Sydney on 11 June 2003 he said: 
The sad truth is the public don't strongly support Simon Crean and there are no signs that he can gain the public confidence that he requires to beat John Howard.
Here is a guy who is castigating the government—who says we are not being honest enough—yet is quite openly attacking his leader. He continued:
Labor's vote is about to be decimated nationally and I can't stand by and see that happen. 
He would still be on the front bench. He continued:
It's not just a wipeout. I think we are headed for a train wreck and someone has to put their foot on the brake.
—Casey Jones!
—Indeed; that is a very good comment from the member for Parkes. When we are talking about spine or character we know that what they say and what they do are two different things. Again, I think it is quite regrettable that the member for Lilley had to spend all his time on a character assassination of Senator Amanda Vanstone rather than going to the issue of policy, or at least painting a picture for the Australian public of an alternative policy from the Australian Labor Party.
Let us go back and look at pensioners. Again, nothing was said at all. They obviously disregard older Australians. That is interesting. If you look at older Australians, they have done remarkably well. There is more work to be done—no one denies that—but the average pensioner is today receiving $3,000 more than they did in 1996.
—How much?
—How much?
—Both the member for Cowper and the member for Parkes are out of their seats.
—They are receiving $3,000 more in their pension than they would have been receiving back in 1996. I can see the enthusiastic support from hardworking members, whether in the electorate of Parkes, Cowper or even Gilmore. They know that pensioners are getting $115 a fortnight more than they would be if the ALP were still government. Why? It is not just because of indexation, which clearly has been in place for a long time, but because we decided to link pensions to a minimum of 25 per cent of total male average weekly earnings. The government created a low inflation environment—which is a good thing for families who are paying off their mortgages or even for grandmas or grandpas who want to give a loan to their son or daughter for a house or who maybe are paying off the mortgage on their home after retirement age. We created low interest rates, but we decided to tie the pension because we knew that wages growth was healthier, particularly for people on low incomes or moderate incomes, than it was under the previous ALP administration. By tying the pension to 25 per cent of total male average weekly earnings the government gave pensioners an extra $36.40 a fortnight that they would not have received had the ALP been in government. That is $946 a year. We made a deliberate decision to help pensioners. We knew we were doing a great job at keeping inflation down but with indexation alone pensioners were not going to get a lot, so we decided to give them a bit more by tying the pension. Australian pensioners are significantly better off. There is more work to be done—no-one denies that. Pensioners have received $3,000 more since 1996 than they would have had the previous Labor Party been in government.
Other areas include state seniors card holders—that is $25.5 million. Again, these are concession card holders. We are trying to negotiate with state ALP governments, who are being far less constructive in this particular area. There is the issue of pensioner bonus schemes. There is also the issue of private medical insurance. That is another classic example where we believe Australian families or older Australians should have a choice. If they want to have a private health insurance policy they get a 30 per cent rebate. We know exactly what is going to happen if the ALP ever have the opportunity of winning government. They will take away that 30 per cent rebate. The absolute doublespeak from the rooster here—or chicken; I do not care—where he talks about— 
—How dare you reflect on the Deputy Speaker. That is what he called you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Order! The member for Batman should look at the Hansard to see how many times he has been called to order.
—The Deputy Speaker is one of the most robust individuals and ex-canefarmers I have ever met, unlike people on that side of the House. This is the whole mockery. The member for Lilley talks about the government not particularly helping families, but I have clearly demonstrated that the government has helped families through low interest rates, increased job growth and increased FTB payments. I have not mentioned child care, but this is another classic example of how we are helping Australian families. 
What disappoints me, though, is that we still have this diatribe from the member for Lilley. He did not speak about any policy or any particular vision—even though their policy or vision might be wrong—and he did not paint a picture that might be to the benefit of Australian families or pensioners themselves; he gave us the classic example of if they cannot play the game they have to play the person. In this case, it was Senator Amanda Vanstone. Perhaps there is a slight passion underneath there for attacking Senator Amanda Vanstone, but she does a very competent job in a very difficult portfolio of administering social security payments. 
I would like to say again that, when it comes to Australian families, we provide over $19 billion in payments—whether it is the family tax benefit, the child-care benefit or parenting payments. This is an example of a government not only putting its money where it should be and saying that it will deliver for Australian families and pensioners but also following through in this area. Again, I state: the greatest thing you can do for Australian families is create jobs; the greatest thing you can do for Australian families is keep interest rates low; the greatest thing you can do for Australian families is recognise them and compensate them through the family tax benefit scheme, which has been modified and which will continue to be modified. I have also demonstrated quite clearly what we have done for Australian pensioners in a couple of areas.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I do not know who the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was demonstrating his arguments to—whether it was the three members of the backbench who sat through that presentation or the fourth one who meandered in when the minister had about three minutes to go. That is how much support the minister has for the arguments he has mounted. His arguments were so persuasive that only three backbenchers were present. That would have to be a world record for non-attendance while a minister was presenting his case—and in this instance it was a pretty pusillanimous case.
—It's part of the revolt.  
—Yes. The shadow minister so ably addressed the macro, and I want to talk about the micro. The minister, who is scuttling out of the chamber, has basically said that Minister Vanstone is liked. She is not liked around the city of Casey, I can assure you of that. Let me talk to you a bit about the city of Casey and the impact of the minister's policies and the Howard government's policies on the families in the city of Casey. 
—He ran away. He couldn't take it.
—The minister has gone. In the city of Casey, there are 20,162 two-parent families with children under 15, and there are 4,349 single-parent families with children under 15. That gives us a total of 24,511 families in the city of Casey with children under 15. There are 41,051 children—welcome back, Minister—aged between zero and 12 years. 
Families in my electorate of Holt are doing it tough. They are having to work harder to make ends meet, and more and more are struggling even to do that. The Howard government is Australia's highest taxing government. My constituents are paying more tax than ever. According to the Age on Monday, 15 September, Australians paid $19 billion more tax in the last financial year. These tax increases are not being paid by the Prime Minister's rich mates; instead, it is the families in my electorate of Holt who are having to shoulder the burden of the Howard government's inequitable tax system. 
Let me talk about one particular issue. The minister talked about the family tax benefit, but I want to talk about the family tax overpayments. As the shadow minister knows, this is a big issue in my electorate because there are so many young families. There are 14,236 households in the city of Casey that are repaying housing loans with payments of between $800 and $1,800 per month. This is an area where the median weekly household income is approximately $800 per week. A growing majority of these families have not only home and credit card debts but family tax benefit debts to contend with as well. 
One in three families are accruing unavoidable debts under the family tax benefit system that the minister presides over, and the debts accrued by these families now total more than $1 billion for the first two years of the scheme. One such family in my electorate that has been affected by this is that of Sara and Dwayne Godden. The situation of this family serves to illustrate how inherently flawed and inflexible the system is. Two years ago, the Goddens were slugged with a $1,000 family tax benefit debt when Dwayne's employer erred and overpaid him by $2,000. So it was not this constituent's fault. Consequently, the Godden's income was greater than the estimate they provided to Centrelink. This is not their fault, but they had no choice but to agree to have the debt taken out of their future family tax benefit payments. 
The following year, in keeping with the advice provided by the government, the Goddens elected to overestimate their income to avoid overpayment. However, despite overestimating their income by $12,000, Sara and Dwayne Godden have now been hit by another overpayment debt. The Goddens did all the right things—they overestimated their income and they notified Centrelink of their change in income—but the Howard government's system is so inherently flawed that not even these preventative measures made any difference at all. They now have another overpayment debt of $1,500, which is $1,500 that they have told me they cannot afford. What is Senator Vanstone's suggestion to families like Sara and Dwayne's? Whack the debt on your credit card. On 23 June, Senator Amanda Vanstone said: 
Some people ... would choose to pay by credit card, because we all know some people, who do not travel as much as we do, desperately seek Fly Buys as they want to travel more—
So this is the minister's way of giving the constituents of Holt more Fly Buys—give them more debt. It is a disgrace. With credit card interest rates at 17 per cent, if Sara and Dwayne followed the minister's advice, they would be slugged an additional $255 in annual interest payments. 
But if families like the Goddens cannot pay up, then the Howard government sends in the heavies to recoup the money. Only the Howard government could justify, firstly, forcing families into debt and then sending the debt collectors to recoup the funds. In June this year, the debt collection agency Dun and Bradstreet were pursuing 7,037 families who have been betrayed by the inherent defects of the family tax benefit scheme. That is 7,000 families chased by the heavies because they could not pay their family tax benefit overpayments. 
In the city of Casey, there are 37,898 women who are either employed or looking for work. There are 3,816 two-parent families whose household income is $600 or under per week. There are 4,060 single-parent families whose income is $600 or under per week. Many of these families cannot afford to place their children in a child-care centre. For them, their only alternative is to place their children in the affordable and more flexible family day care program run by the city of Casey—and this is an excellent program. However, the Howard government intends to cut the $800,000 operational subsidy which is received by the City of Casey Family Day Care program. This is an issue that has been raised by the city of Casey, because they are very concerned. Two thousand children access this family day care scheme. My question to the minister is: will you guarantee that the city of Casey will have this $800,000 operational subsidy?
—He doesn't care.
—Obviously the minister does not care. If the operational funding for this program is removed, the majority of the parents of these children will simply not be able to afford to continue to work. One such parent is my constituent Jennifer Tranter. Jennifer and her partner have two children—Hannah, aged four, and Blake, aged 18 months. Both Jennifer and her partner work full time. Jennifer said:
If I could not afford to send my children to day care, I wouldn't be able to go to work. With only my partner's income to live on, we would be in a worst case scenario and we would end up losing our house. Day care is just so important to us.
Jennifer and her partner pay something in the order of $200 per week for family day care. With a mortgage and a young family, they simply cannot afford the estimated $400 per week that a child-care agency would demand. The 7,876 families in Casey who earn $600 and under per week are in no position to spend $400 per week on child care. The prospective closure of the family day care program—the only alternative for many of these families—will give parents no option but to stay home rather than work, which is the Howard government policy. Jennifer said:
I don't know anyone who stays at home to look after their kids. People just can't afford to. I know many couples who are in the situation where one partner works days whilst the other works nights so they can have the Australian dream of owning a house and giving their kids a good future.
Only John Howard could subsidise his best mate's company to the tune of $20 million, a sum that would provide operational funding for the City of Casey family day care program for something like 20 years or more.
I have been asked to mention the impact of the decline of bulk-billing on individuals with special needs. The Howard government is attacking not only young families, through the destruction of the family day care program and the inequities of the family tax benefit scheme, but also the most weak and vulnerable in our society: those with special needs and those who care for them. One example is Jarrod Thomson of Cranbourne South. The decline of bulk-billing under the stewardship of the Howard government has had a devastating impact on individuals like Jarrod and his parents, Rhonda and Peter. I would like to refer to a letter written by Peter Thomson that was published in the Herald Sun on 4 September this year. The letter states: 
Our son Jarrod is 23, has spina bifida, and has difficulty getting around. He relies on us for support ... As a disability pensioner he is refused bulk-billing at the Cranbourne Family Medical Centre, which still bulk-bills aged pensioners and veterans. This is not fair as Jarrod can least afford the $30 up front, let alone the extra expense and time on our part to get some of it back for him, as he does not understand forms ... John Howard, you and your Government are responsible for this mess. Why don't you sink the boot in a bit more to the most vulnerable section of society while you are at it?
That is a fantastic comment—and fairly accurate. Sink the boot in? The Prime Minister certainly has.
In the time remaining, I would like to talk about the carers allowance. This government has planned to strip the carers allowance from 30,000 families with children with disabilities. Thus far, 5,000 families have been stripped of their allowance. It seems that one of the most disadvantaged groups in our community can expect no mercy from a government that insensitively makes more and more demands on the carers who already have enough to bear. One such carer is Amanda Stapledon, whose son Pete has autism, epilepsy and challenging behaviours. Amanda said:
Having a child with a disability is not something that we have to deal with from time to time, it is something that we deal with ALL of the time: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I liken the responsibility to the analogy of carrying a bucket of water. It is OK for the first 5 metres or so, but after that, it becomes very heavy.
These altruistic individuals who provide this support should be congratulated, commended and supported; yet, characteristically, the Howard government is instead heaping a myriad of inane demands upon their already heavily-burdened shoulders. Australia has 2.3 million carers who provide $20 billion per year in unpaid services. It is worth keeping in mind that the $20.9 million subsidy provided to the Manildra Group would have enabled 9,166 carers to receive an allowance for a year. That puts it all into perspective. Families are being crucified by the Howard government.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—I cannot believe this matter of public importance. They really had to get to the bottom of the barrel to find something to have a go at. When I had a look for these so-called `heartless policies that are punishing Australia's families and pensioners' some very surprising information turned up—and the member for Lilley should not be surprised by the results. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: where are you, member for Lilley? Why don't you sit and listen? He should not be surprised by the results.
—I listened very quietly. The results indicated that, before 1996, the then federal government, of which the member for Lilley was a member, was seen not so much as heartless as it was held in utter contempt by Australian families and pensioners—and we have had a few elections since then to drive that point home. In fact, I have yet to hear the member for Lilley speak about his electorate. All I have ever heard him do is scaremonger, harp on and carp about things he knows have benefited his electorate. That reminds me of the scorpion and the frog. When the frog said to his friend the scorpion, `Why did you bite me?' the scorpion replied, `That is my way. I know no other way.' How true that is of the member for Lilley. He knows of no other way than to scaremonger the Australian people. 
In the absence of any set of coherent policies, we have flim-flam promises seeping out from this opposition and those of us on this side of the House are faced with this enormous vacuum. We on this side are taking the initiative to improve the circumstances of Australian families and pensioners and we need to make some assumptions—assump-tions that are based on facts that are before this House today. Those facts are made evident by this MPI. It says everything about this Labor opposition. They actually think that growing the economy and delivering real increases in living standards for Australian families and pensioners is heartless. It is true: as tragic as it may seem, they think that getting the job done for all Australians is heartless.
For the Labor Party it is somehow virtuous for Australian families and pensioners to put up with pain and suffering. It is good for them, they suggest in this motion. In putting such a motion today, pain and suffering must be some sort of virtue for Labor. How else do you describe Labor's 17 per cent interest rates that made home ownership unaffordable for Australian families? Silly of me! That was supposed to be good for everybody—I forgot about that! How else do you justify the `recession we had to have', which blew out unemployment to double digits? Didn't Australian families and pensioners enjoy that! What do you do with the huge inflation rates experienced under Labor? Didn't families and seniors get excited about that!
Let us accept the Labor definition of what it means to be heartless: that to be heartless is to deliver real benefits to Australian families and pensioners. At the most basic level, Australian families need a roof over their heads. Under the coalition government, a first home buyer can apply for a $7,000 grant to help them own their first home. Since it was implemented, 482,000 individuals and families have received $3.8 billion in first home owner grant scheme payments. The coalition has also helped keep interest rates low and inflation under control and has boosted real wages by 10 per cent since 1996. Many of those families live in my electorate of Gilmore. In fact, 49.8 per cent of families living in Gilmore now own their own dwellings or are in the process of buying them.
Unfortunately, while the federal coalition government has been seeking to help first home buyers, Labor, in government in the states, have placed a stumbling block in front of those seeking to own their first home. Labor, in all states around Australia, have increased their tax take on an average home. In Sydney, it has risen from $6,000 to $16,000 since 1995. This is Labor's policy of being kind to first home owners—that is, the average Australian family. How kind they are to them! The member for Werriwa wants to give stamp duty exemption to public servants only. More bizarre than this is the member for Werriwa's plan to increase the first home buyers grant to $12,000 for people living in Sydney only—an increase of $5,000 that would not be available to residents living in any other city in Australia, let alone the residents of my electorate of Gilmore. This is Labor's policy of a fair go for all. Labor's plan is to discriminate against first home buyers by occupation and by residential location—and that is the prelude to the member for Werriwa getting stuck into the negatively geared investments of Australian families. 
Let us look now at the policies that they are having a go at. What is the government actually doing for Australian families? The government have a proud record of economic management, lower interests and lower inflation. We introduced a fairer tax system, recognising the cost of raising children. What did the Labor Party do? In Gilmore, the government also helped to reduce the effective marginal tax rates faced by many parents entering the work force, allowing decisions about returning to work to be made with fewer economic disincentives. Around two million Australian families and 3.5 million children benefited from the introduction of the family tax benefit. All they do is harp on and carp about some of the inadequacies. They never put forward a positive proposition whatsoever for themselves.
The income-testing arrangements are more generous, with more families receiving maximum levels of assistance and families able to keep more of each dollar that they actually earn. There were 541 family and community projects, worth $71 million, approved for funding under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which helps families and communities to build resilience and develop local solutions to local problems. What did Labor do? They do not like to see any help whatsoever being given to families.
The government have also made significant improvements to child care. The government spent more than $7 billion on child care in their first six years of office, over 70 per cent more in real terms than in Labor's last six years in office. Not only that; we made it fairer: we gave a choice to families. Is that punishing families? Is that being heartless to families? The family tax benefit, the child-care benefit, the parenting payment, the maternity allowance and the maternity immunisation allowance were all delivered under the coalition government. In addition, we brought in the baby bonus, worth an estimated $171 million in the coming year. The baby bonus provides additional assistance to families following the birth of a first child. But where are Labor's policies in this regard?
We have also set up a departmental task force to look further at assisting families in balancing their work and family responsibilities. The task force will consider if more needs to be done in a broad range of areas, including paid maternity leave schemes, family payments, child-care services and the promotion of family friendly practice at the workplace level. But what has the Labor Party done, apart from scaremongering the Australian people? The pensioner education supplement will stay. Student pensioners continue to have access to an education entry payment of $208 to assist with the cost of study at the beginning of each academic year.
The carers allowance was discussed in great detail. This is the biggest scare that the Labor Party is giving the Australian people. We are doing a review to see that the money is provided on a fairer, more equitable basis. It is not a review to take it away. In fact, we have added another six disabilities to the list. We have added Down syndrome to age 16; fragile X syndrome to age 16, boys and girls; cystic fibrosis; haemophilia; and epilepsy. Is adding further to the list for the carers pension being heartless? I do not think it is being heartless. As I said, a review does not mean taking it away; it means a fairer application for all Australian families. Labor simply will not stand up to help ordinary Australians trying to own their first home—unless they live in the Latham home city of Sydney. For Labor, every one of these hard fought gains is utter heartlessness because every one of these gains reinforces to the Australian public the failure of Labor both in government and now in opposition. Pensioners have already been mentioned by the minister. 
In closing, the debate put up by the Labor Party today underlines a significant question about the capacity of this opposition under its current leader and aspiring leaders such as the member for Lilley. The Australian community are waiting. When will Labor give them a choice? When will they do the hard yards to put behind them their flimsy set of promises and get some decent policies? Nothing we have seen to date from the opposition even approaches the calibre of the government's record. If this government's record means we are heartless in the eyes of Labor, then I suggest it can only be said that at the heart of the Australian Labor Party there is something terribly, terribly wrong. I repeat: this coalition government has been extremely— (Time expired)

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth and 10th reports of the committee for 2003 relating to the construction of a new chancery in New Delhi, India, and the refurbishment of staff apartments in the Australian embassy complex in Paris, France.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—by leave—The New Delhi works are intended to provide a new chancery for Australia's diplomatic mission to India. There has been no significant refurbishment of the current premises since the chancery was constructed 36 years ago. Since that time, staff numbers have increased and the chancery no longer provides adequate space, amenities, building services, technological provisions or safety measures. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade intends that the new chancery will fulfil the requirements of the New Delhi post for the next 50 years. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $24.61 million.
The works proposal consists of the construction of a temporary recreation centre and interim office accommodation, the demolition of the existing chancery building, the construction and fit-out of a new chancery building, associated services infrastructure and landscaping works, and the provision of five additional on-compound accommodation units through the construction of two town houses and the conversion of an existing house into three apartments. At a confidential briefing conducted prior to the public hearing, the committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on project costs. Issues covered in that briefing included taxes and duties, fees and allowances, sundry costs and contracting arrangements.
At the public hearing, the department informed the committee of an amendment to the original proposal for the new chancery. Initially, the new chancery was to be set back 15 metres from the northern boundary of the compound perimeter. However, in order to improve the long-term security of the building against terrorist attack, it is now proposed that the new chancery building be set back 25 metres. The department assured the committee that the level of security planned for the interim chancery building is appropriate to the current threat environment, and added that higher levels of security will be incorporated into the permanent building to ensure its security in the event of any future deterioration in the local threat level. The committee invited the department to comment on fire safety and flood mitigation measures. The department described a range of fire safety measures planned for the new chancery building and explained that the new building will also be elevated to accommodate local flooding. 
The committee observed that other overseas missions have experienced difficulties with heating and cooling, and was interested to learn more about the specific type of airconditioning that would be installed in the new chancery building. The department told the committee that it intends to install energy efficient, zoned airconditioning suitable for the climate in New Delhi. The committee asked the department to supply technical details of the airconditioning system when these become available and recommended that the department ensure that the airconditioning system installed at the New Delhi chancery is operationally effective, energy efficient and cost effective. As the majority of construction and fit-out works will be executed by local tradespeople, the committee sought assurance that the building would be constructed to Australian standards. The department told the committee that it anticipated a high level of expatriate supervision throughout the construction period will take place. While the majority of construction materials are to be sourced in India, Australian timbers and finishes will be used in public areas to endorse an Australian image.
The proposed works in Paris are intended to modernise 29 apartments in the Australian embassy complex. It is envisaged that the works will extend the life of the property for another 25 years before further major refurbishment is required. The estimated cost of the proposed works, at June 2003 prices and exchange rates, is $9.5 million. This building is quite an icon building. It is a building of architectural importance. It was built in 1977 and was designed by the well-known Australian architect Harry Seidler—who worked on this building in collaboration with prominent French architect Marcel Breuer. The Paris apartment complex is over 25 years old and, while the apartments have been well maintained, finishes and fittings have deteriorated. Work is needed to ensure compliance with current building codes and standards, and occupational health and safety regulations. The work elements to meet the department's objectives consist of the replacement of electrical wiring and fittings, the upgrade of fire detection equipment, the upgrade of heating and lighting, the installation of secondary glazing, the refurbishment of bathrooms, the replacement of door hardware and locks, the refurbishment of kitchen exhaust systems, the repair of damaged wall sections, repainting, and the refurbishment of surfaces and finishes.
At the public hearing, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the committee that a prototype apartment, serving as a model for the remaining 28 apartments, had provided a sound basis for costings and had received the approval of residents. The department assured the committee that it intends that the refurbishment will be executed in compliance with both Australian and French building regulations and occupational health and safety legislation. When questioned by the committee as to the compatibility of Australian and French building standards, the department responded that the codes are of a comparably high standard. The department acknowledged that, due to their split-level design, the apartments do not conform to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. However, it is envisaged that facilities for disabled residents, such as travelators, could be installed in the apartments as required. The committee also wished to know if the refurbished apartments would comply with the Commonwealth energy policy. The department replied that provisions for increasing energy efficiency included the installation of low-energy fittings and secondary glazing, and the replacement of whitegoods with the latest models. 
In response to questions about security and fire safety measures, the department assured the committee that current arrangements at the embassy complex, which include 24-hour guard services and controlled lifts to the apartments, were deemed sufficient for the current threat environment. The department added that security arrangements for all overseas posts are currently under review. The department explained that battery-powered smoke detectors in each apartment were to be replaced by more sophisticated fire detection equipment. As the Australian embassy complex in Paris is considered to be a building of architectural significance, the committee was interested to know what impact the works might have on the architectural integrity of the property. The department responded that the exterior will remain unchanged and that proposed interior works will maintain the original style of the apartments.
Finally, the committee asked the department to clarify whether any revenue would be derived from the project through leasing of the apartments. The department stated that rental was charged at the Paris market rate and may increase once the works are completed. The department explained that the plan-ned refurbishment works are necessary to enable them to attract tenants. The department added that, while the apartments are leased to individual agencies on a commercial basis, the resulting revenue is spent on administration and maintenance of the property.
Having reviewed the information for both these works, the committee recommended that the proposed construction of a new chancery at New Delhi, India proceed at an estimated cost of $24.61 million and that the proposed refurbishment of staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Paris, France proceed at an estimated cost of $9.5 million. I would like to extend thanks to my committee colleagues, the secretariat staff and all those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who helped with the inquiry process for the proposed New Delhi and Paris works.

The works proposal consists of the construction of a temporary recreation centre and interim office accommodation, the demolition of the existing chancery building, the construction and fit-out of a new chancery building, associated services infrastructure and landscaping works, and the provision of five additional on-compound accommodation units through the construction of two town houses and the conversion of an existing house into three apartments. At a confidential briefing conducted prior to the public hearing, the committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on project costs. Issues covered in that briefing included taxes and duties, fees and allowances, sundry costs and contracting arrangements.
At the public hearing, the department informed the committee of an amendment to the original proposal for the new chancery. Initially, the new chancery was to be set back 15 metres from the northern boundary of the compound perimeter. However, in order to improve the long-term security of the building against terrorist attack, it is now proposed that the new chancery building be set back 25 metres. The department assured the committee that the level of security planned for the interim chancery building is appropriate to the current threat environment, and added that higher levels of security will be incorporated into the permanent building to ensure its security in the event of any future deterioration in the local threat level. The committee invited the department to comment on fire safety and flood mitigation measures. The department described a range of fire safety measures planned for the new chancery building and explained that the new building will also be elevated to accommodate local flooding. 
The committee observed that other overseas missions have experienced difficulties with heating and cooling, and was interested to learn more about the specific type of airconditioning that would be installed in the new chancery building. The department told the committee that it intends to install energy efficient, zoned airconditioning suitable for the climate in New Delhi. The committee asked the department to supply technical details of the airconditioning system when these become available and recommended that the department ensure that the airconditioning system installed at the New Delhi chancery is operationally effective, energy efficient and cost effective. As the majority of construction and fit-out works will be executed by local tradespeople, the committee sought assurance that the building would be constructed to Australian standards. The department told the committee that it anticipated a high level of expatriate supervision throughout the construction period will take place. While the majority of construction materials are to be sourced in India, Australian timbers and finishes will be used in public areas to endorse an Australian image.
The proposed works in Paris are intended to modernise 29 apartments in the Australian embassy complex. It is envisaged that the works will extend the life of the property for another 25 years before further major refurbishment is required. The estimated cost of the proposed works, at June 2003 prices and exchange rates, is $9.5 million. This building is quite an icon building. It is a building of architectural importance. It was built in 1977 and was designed by the well-known Australian architect Harry Seidler—who worked on this building in collaboration with prominent French architect Marcel Breuer. The Paris apartment complex is over 25 years old and, while the apartments have been well maintained, finishes and fittings have deteriorated. Work is needed to ensure compliance with current building codes and standards, and occupational health and safety regulations. The work elements to meet the department's objectives consist of the replacement of electrical wiring and fittings, the upgrade of fire detection equipment, the upgrade of heating and lighting, the installation of secondary glazing, the refurbishment of bathrooms, the replacement of door hardware and locks, the refurbishment of kitchen exhaust systems, the repair of damaged wall sections, repainting, and the refurbishment of surfaces and finishes.
At the public hearing, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the committee that a prototype apartment, serving as a model for the remaining 28 apartments, had provided a sound basis for costings and had received the approval of residents. The department assured the committee that it intends that the refurbishment will be executed in compliance with both Australian and French building regulations and occupational health and safety legislation. When questioned by the committee as to the compatibility of Australian and French building standards, the department responded that the codes are of a comparably high standard. The department acknowledged that, due to their split-level design, the apartments do not conform to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. However, it is envisaged that facilities for disabled residents, such as travelators, could be installed in the apartments as required. The committee also wished to know if the refurbished apartments would comply with the Commonwealth energy policy. The department replied that provisions for increasing energy efficiency included the installation of low-energy fittings and secondary glazing, and the replacement of whitegoods with the latest models. 
In response to questions about security and fire safety measures, the department assured the committee that current arrangements at the embassy complex, which include 24-hour guard services and controlled lifts to the apartments, were deemed sufficient for the current threat environment. The department added that security arrangements for all overseas posts are currently under review. The department explained that battery-powered smoke detectors in each apartment were to be replaced by more sophisticated fire detection equipment. As the Australian embassy complex in Paris is considered to be a building of architectural significance, the committee was interested to know what impact the works might have on the architectural integrity of the property. The department responded that the exterior will remain unchanged and that proposed interior works will maintain the original style of the apartments.
Finally, the committee asked the department to clarify whether any revenue would be derived from the project through leasing of the apartments. The department stated that rental was charged at the Paris market rate and may increase once the works are completed. The department explained that the plan-ned refurbishment works are necessary to enable them to attract tenants. The department added that, while the apartments are leased to individual agencies on a commercial basis, the resulting revenue is spent on administration and maintenance of the property.
Having reviewed the information for both these works, the committee recommended that the proposed construction of a new chancery at New Delhi, India proceed at an estimated cost of $24.61 million and that the proposed refurbishment of staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Paris, France proceed at an estimated cost of $9.5 million. I would like to extend thanks to my committee colleagues, the secretariat staff and all those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who helped with the inquiry process for the proposed New Delhi and Paris works.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled: Report 54: Treaties tabled in June and August 2003; Social security agreement—Croatia; Pollution by hazardous and noxious substances; Employment of dependants of diplomatic and consular personnel—Belgium; Working holiday arrangements—Belgium; Bougainville Transition Team, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Report 54 contains the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into five treaty actions tabled in the parliament in June and August 2003, relating to the matters identified in the title of the report.
The social security agreement with Croatia, tabled on 17 June 2003, is similar in terms and approach to several other agreements of its kind, three of which were examined in the last report of the committee. These social security agreements essentially address gaps in social security coverage and provide for portability of benefits from one country to another. They predominantly cover age pensions, disability support pensions for people who are severely disabled and survivors' pensions. 
The protocol on pollution incidents by hazardous and noxious substances was tabled on 24 June 2003 and provides for a global framework for international cooperation and planning in major incidents or threats of marine pollution by hazardous and noxious substances other than oil. Once the protocol enters into force, it will operate to strengthen Australia's existing response arrangements under the national marine chemical spill contingency plan, CHEMPLAN, by giving Australia access to international assistance in the event of a major incident.
The bilateral agreement between Australia and Belgium on the employment of dependants of diplomatic and consular personnel will enable spouses and certain other family members of diplomatic and consular officials to undertake paid employment for the duration of the officer's stay in another country. Australia has 26 similar arrangements, only five of which have the status of a treaty. In this case, a treaty level agreement was required under Belgian law. The committee agrees with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the lack of opportunity for spouses and family members of Australian diplomatic and consular officials to engage in paid work is sometimes a significant disincentive for officers to serve in particular countries. In order to encourage other states to provide employment opportunities for dependants of Australian officials overseas, Australia offers reciprocal opportunities for overseas officials based here.
The second bilateral treaty with Belgium examined in this report was tabled with the aforementioned treaty on 12 August 2003. The agreement between Australia and Belgium on working holiday arrangements will allow Australian and Belgian nationals aged between 18 and 30 years to stay in the territory of the other country for up to 12 months and, according to certain conditions, undertake paid work during their stay. Australia has working holiday maker arrangements with 14 countries and is currently negotiating with a further 12 countries. Not all such agreements have the status of a treaty, but, again, Belgian law required it in this case. The committee is aware of the recent study by the University of Melbourne's Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research which showed that about 8,000 effective full-year jobs are created by the annual intake of 80,000 working holiday makers from countries with which Australia has agreements in place.
The final treaty action examined in this report was the protocol concerning the Bougainville Transition Team. This multilateral agreement between Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu takes over from the Australian led peace monitoring group and its predecessor, the truce monitoring group. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you and other members of the House will be aware of the ongoing role that Australia has played in promoting, facilitating and instilling confidence in the peace process in Bougainville and in the transition towards autonomous government. Under the peace agreement signed in August 2001, parties to the peace monitoring group were scheduled to withdraw between the middle and the end of 2002. At the request of the government of Papua New Guinea, Australia agreed to maintain a presence beyond that date, and operations were then scheduled to end on 30 June 2003. Following further requests from the Bougainvillean leaders, as well as the government of Papua New Guinea, Australia decided in late May this year that it would be prepared to lead a small civilian team.
Because of the need to rapidly deploy this civilian team and to be able to extend the same legal protections to team members as had existed under the previous agreements, the protocol was concluded and came into force before the normal treaty review process could be undertaken. While the committee has expressed concern in recent months at the apparent increased incidence of treaties entering into force, or enabling legislation being introduced, prior to the conclusion of the committee's review, it acknowledges the urgent need for this protocol to be in place. It recognises the limitations which were placed on the government in terms of timing for negotiation and conclusion of the protocol. 
In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in the interests of Australia for all the treaties considered in report 54 to be ratified where action had not occurred prior to the committee's review, and the committee has made its recommendations accordingly.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
With respect to the amendments from the Senate relating to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003, the government wishes to accept those amendments, although reluctantly. The Senate amendment would delay the commencement date for listing of deductible gift recipients under the bill from 29 June this year to the date of the royal assent. This amendment reverses a parliamentary amendment passed by the House last week. The commencement date of 29 June 2003 for the deductible gift recipients added by this bill was designed to interact appropriately with measures in another bill currently before the parliament, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003, which apply from 1 July this year.
While the Senate amendment may on face value appear a relatively minor amendment, it in fact sheds light on the Labor Party's irresponsible and misguided opposition to sensible improvements to the way in which important organisations, worthy of deductible gift recipient status, are granted concessional tax status. The Senate amendment to this measure in the bill reflects the opposition by the Labor Party to certain measures in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 that would specifically list deductible gift recipients by way of regulation rather than by the present slow and administratively cumbersome requirement of amending principal legislation. The proposal has obvious benefits to organisations granted deductible gift recipient status by streamlining the process for their listing, thereby improving the timeliness with which they can seek donations and improve tax certainty to their donors.
In seeking to understand why the opposition is objecting to such sensible measures, I was appalled to discover that amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 2003 moved by Senator Sherry earlier this week would have stripped the concessional deductible gift recipient status from some 200-odd organisations that are currently specifically listed in the tax law—and I imagine that the member for Kingston would be as shocked by that as the government was. Despite Labor protestations that this was not their intent, it does reflect a shameful ignorance of the measures and highlights the cynical political opposition and opportunism at the core of the approach of the Australian Labor Party.
I want to point out to the honourable members opposite, and to the House more generally, that the government will not support any Senate amendment to the deductible gift recipient measures in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 2003 given the obvious benefits that will accrue to the charitable sector. However, the government will reluctantly accept the Senate amendment to this bill that changes the commencement date for schedule 1 from 29 June 2003 to the date on which this act receives the royal assent. 
I want to give notice that the government will seek to restore the proper interaction between deductible gift recipients added by this bill and the measure in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 2003 when the House considers Senate amendments to that bill. This assumes that the member for Kingston and his Labor colleagues are able to finalise the drafting of their amendments to the bill in such a way that it does not obliterate the existing tax concessions currently enjoyed by specifically listed organisations and their donors. I imagine that is a matter that my friend the member for Kingston is going to have to look at very closely.
Senate amendments (2) to (5) relating to the PRRT infrastructure licences oppose the efforts by the government to promote a more effective use of existing petroleum infrastructure. The measure rejected by the Senate would amend the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to recognise, at the time the production licence ceases, costs associated with closing down a facility that is no longer used for a petroleum project but continues to be used under an infrastructure licence. This measure would remove a disincentive to the take-up of infrastructure licences which sees the lives of facilities extended by putting them to use processing petroleum from other projects. The introduction of the infrastructure licence provides industry with the opportunity to continue to utilise existing petroleum infrastructure to process petroleum from other areas. The PRRT measure in this bill is a necessary change to support the infrastructure licence initiative.
Without this measure there would be a marked disincentive in converting to an infrastructure licence. (Extension of time granted) This is because, under the PRRT, operators will remain assessable on the future economic value of the production facility, but a deduction for future closing down costs would be deferred until the infrastructure licence ceases. Therefore the government's measure addresses the mismatch between the treatment of receipts and expenditures when a petroleum facility moves from a production licence to an infrastructure licence. It should also be noted that in the absence of this measure more projects will be closed down at the end of a production licence in order to ensure that they were eligible to claim deductions for closing down expenses at that time. This would obviously have negative implications for the development of nearby marginal production fields.
The House of Representative Standing Committee on Industry and Resources—that is, the Prosser inquiry—tabled its report entitled Exploring Australia's future—impediments to increasing investment in minerals and petroleum exploration in Australia in parliament at the beginning of this week. While the recommendations of the Prosser inquiry are still to be considered by the government, it is worth noting that the report indicated that future discoveries of oil are likely to be in small or marginal fields that are more expensive to develop. This is precisely the type of field that would be cheaper to develop if already existing petroleum infrastructure from nearby fields could be utilised under an infrastructure licence to process that petroleum resource.
The profitable exploitation of Australia's petroleum resources is of benefit to the Australian economy as a whole. This includes providing increased competition in Australia's domestic market, stronger exports, increased employment and the attraction of associated manufacturing industries that utilise petroleum products. It reflects poorly on both the opposition and on the minor parties who have chosen to obstruct this reform and demonstrates that they are entirely unable to understand the connection between responsible structural reform and Australia's future economic growth. In contrast, Madam Deputy Speaker, you will not be surprised that the Howard government remains determined to deliver the reforms necessary to continue a robust economy. 
This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to ongoing improvements in the tax system by promoting equity, easing compliance costs and introducing structural reforms that will maintain a strong and stable performing economy. The current strength of the economy is a testament to the positive reforms undertaken by this government. We remain committed to the ongoing changes necessary to allow the economy to grow and prosper for the benefit of all Australians.
The government, with reluctance, agrees to accept Senate amendments to excise schedule 5 of the bill, recognising the importance of the other measures in the bill and the fact that no conversion to infrastructure licences is imminent. I do recall the contribution made by the member for Kingston in earlier discussions in this place—in particular, his previous undertaking that he is open to reconsidering this issue in the context of any future PRRT amendments. The member for Kingston is nodding, and I thank him for that assurance. I point out to the member for Kingston that he will indeed have the opportunity to rethink his opposition to this measure, as the government remains committed to returning this amendment at a later time. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration for his quiet acquiescence to our amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003. The amendment to the gift provisions is one which I think will be maintained. I understand, from the limited extent to which I have been able to follow the Senate debate, that the Democrats will also support our—
—It is always a hard debate to follow.
—It is always a hard debate to follow in the Senate, but I understand that the Democrats will support our amendments to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 to take out the government's proposal to provide named organisations deductible gift recipient status by regulation. The reason we are doing that is that we are concerned, in light of the current debate about the draft bill on charities, the government will, at least in respect of organisations that receive deductible gift recipient status by being named, impose conditions on them in the regulatory process, which will have the effect of silencing them and stopping them criticising government policy.
—Regulations can always be disallowed.
—Regulations can always be disallowed but, in the process of disallowing regulations that have obnoxious conditions attached to them, we would also have to disallow deductible gift recipient status for those organisations. So we will be maintaining our opposition to that regulatory process. The amendments to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 have, I understand, been redrawn. I believe that they will not have the unintended consequences that the amendments that we moved in this House would have had in upsetting other aspects of the bill. I think it will be quite safe for the Senate to pass those amendments to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7).
I am very pleased that the government has accepted our amendments in relation to the infrastructure proposal, to preserve the integrity of the petroleum resource rent tax. We have expressed considerable concerns about that measure—partly because the government has been unable to provide us with satisfactory costings. The government has been unable to tell us what the cost per field will be, how many fields would be affected by it and how often there would be fields that would be affected by it. We were unable to get any satisfactory information in the course of a Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing on that matter. 
I have made further suggestions in the second reading debate as to the sort of information the Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office could perhaps provide which would shed some light on that matter. That information has not been forthcoming. We still have a fundamental concern about that measure—that is, it is not appropriate to bring forward deductions for expenditure that has not been incurred by some years or in fact, in relation to this measure, possibly decades. That would be an enormous tax concession for PRRT payers, and it is not one that is justified. We are concerned that, in terms of the final dismantling of those platforms, it would reduce the financial capacity of those companies to properly dismantle them and remediate those fields when they actually come to do it. And, having no tax deductions available at that point, they would no doubt at that point seek to defer that remediation process. We think it is bad policy, we think it is costly and we think it is uncosted. (Extension of time granted)
I have given the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association an undertaking that the opposition will have a look at those measures again when they are brought back in the package of PRRT changes that the government is apparently planning to bring forward. APPEA have indicated that that is entirely satisfactory to them. This particular measure is not time critical as far as any particular project is concerned at the moment. In fact, they are unable to tell us when any of their members would want to access this sort of measure. So, if it gives the parliamentary secretary comfort, I can reassure him that we will examine this measure when the government brings it forward in that context.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-09-17,"—I will be a little less passionate than usual in the next five minutes and a little more cerebral, because there are a lot of matters here of very great import that need to be read into Hansard about the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I read from the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Economic Report 813, The energy balance of corn ethanol: an update, by Shapouri, Duffield and Wang of the Office of the Chief Economist and the Office of Energy Policy and New Uses. This is a report to the United States Congress and the Secretary for Agriculture. The summary document says:
Production of ... ethanol is energy efficient, in that it yields 34 percent more energy than it takes to produce it, including growing the corn, harvesting it, transporting it, and distilling it into ethanol.
I deeply regret to say that the significance of that is that, acting upon advice of government departments, the Parliamentary Library has put together a document saying that ethanol is negative for the environment. Either the United States Department of Agriculture, reporting to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Congress, is wrong or the information published by the library is wrong. They cannot both be right. There is a 34 per cent difference. I go on from the summary: 
The initial impetus for ethanol commercialization in the United States came when the 1970s oil embargoes exposed the vulnerability of U.S. energy supplies. Fuel ethanol was seen as a gasoline extender; mixing it with gasoline was considered a means of extending the Nation's gasoline supply. In the 1980s, ethanol established a role as an octane enhancer as the Environmental Protection Agency began to phase out lead in gasoline.
Would to heaven that we had done the same. It continues:
Later, ethanol production received a major boost with the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Blending ethanol with gasoline has become a popular method for gasoline producers to meet the oxygen requirements mandated by the act.
Once again, we have an assertion that this is proceeding because of its value to the environment. On page 2 of the report there is a table about energy input assumptions. It mentions all of the major reports that have been done in the United States on whether ethanol is beneficial to the environment. Since 1992, six studies have been done, and all six say that it is enormously beneficial for the environment. The people in Australia who are saying that it is not must feel very embarrassed when they realise that all of the major reports done in a country the size of the United States are in complete conflict with their statements. Those reports done in the United States prior to 1992 have a different approach. Of course, the US corn yield has almost doubled—or certainly increased by about 50 per cent—in that period of time, which somewhat explains the differences between the older reports and the newer reports. Moving on to the conclusion, it says:
... ethanol is energy efficient, as indicated by an energy ratio of 1.34; that is, for every Btu dedicated to producing ethanol there is a 34-percent energy gain. Furthermore, producing ethanol from domestic corn stocks achieves a net gain in a more desirable form of energy, which helps the United States to reduce its dependence on imported oil. Ethanol production utilizes abundant domestic energy feedstocks, such as coal and natural gas, to convert corn into a premium liquid fuel. Only about 17 percent of the energy used to produce ethanol comes from liquid fuels, such as gasoline and diesel fuel. For every 1 Btu of liquid fuel used to produce ethanol, there is a 6.34 Btu gain.
I move now to an information bulletin put out by the European Union. That bulletin—a draft directive to the European parliament—says that annex B should be implemented. Annex B says that in 2005 there should be a two per cent ethanol blend and in 2010 there should be a 5.75 per cent ethanol blend. In other words, the Europeans have a draft directive, which they are considering at this very moment, which moves near enough to a six per cent ethanol blend. An article by CSIRO says that ethanol is not positive to the environment. The information bulletin going to the European Union on environment and climate change says that CO2 is the main gas responsible for climate change.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2003-09-17,"—The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 establishes the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme that provides for payment of a cleaner fuels grant to importers and manufacturers of cleaner fuels. It delivers on two measures in the 2003-04 budget. The first of these relates to fuel tax reform and the second to the cleaner fuels component of the Energy Grants Credit Scheme, in line with the measures proposed for a Better Environment commitment to encourage conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels for a new century. The cleaner fuels grant will apply to not only biodiesel but also ethanol from 1 July 2008. The grant rate for ethanol will be reduced in five even annual instalments from 1 July 2008 to 1 July 2012, raising the effective excise rate from zero, before 1 July 2008, to its final rate. These reforms will provide a broad taxation framework for fuels and will address anomalies in the current fuel tax system. 
I now move to some of the comments made by others who have spoken on this bill, and in particular I would like to direct my attention to matters raised by the member for Werriwa in his speech to the House. The member for Werriwa spoke at length and he spoke of Trafigura Fuels, which was the company that was going to import on the Oriental Wisteria some millions of gallons of Brazilian ethanol into Australia last year. The House will recall that at that time there was great concern that imported ethanol would undermine the local industry and also, because at that time it was excise free, it would enjoy a subsidy from the Australian taxpayer of some $5 million. Not unnaturally there were those—apparently not in the Labor Party—who believed that a taxpayer subsidy of $5 million to Brazilian ethanol created through Brazilian jobs was unreasonable and that Australians might object to subsidising Brazilian ethanol and then having to drive on it. Australian taxpayers considered this to be not a reasonable proposition.
However, when the government sought to impose full excise on imported fuels with a production subsidy for domestic ethanol, it was the right decision at the time. But Trafigura Fuels was the company that was seeking to import this on the Oriental Wisteria, and the member for Werriwa has portrayed Trafigura Fuels as a small-business victim of the government's decision to protect the Australian ethanol industry. I would like to look at this small-business victim and read some of the things that this supposed small-business victim has been up to. I would like to share with the House some details from an article in the Wall Street Journal of 2 May 2002:
The strange odyssey of an oil tanker named the Essex shows that Iraq doesn't rely on surcharges alone to divert funds from the United Nations's oil-for-food program.
The House will recall that this was prior to the coalition of the willing overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. So at that time the Hussein regime was still in power and, quite properly, there was an embargo against Iraq. But there was in place the oil for food program, which allowed Iraq to sell quantities of oil in exchange for food, medicines and various other necessities—a very sensible program. I will now quote again from the Wall Street Journal. Referring to the oil tanker the Essex, it states:
In this case, Iraq reaped an illegal $9 million by sneaking thousands of barrels of oil past U.N. inspectors at an oil platform off the coast of Iraq. The episode began last May, when the Essex docked at the Mina al-Bakr oil platform. As U.N. inspectors watched, the ship was loaded with 1.8 million barrels of crude oil. Then, after the inspectors left the scene, the pumps were secretly turned on again. The cargo was topped off with another 230,000 barrels, according to the ship's captain, Theofanis Chiladakis, and shipping records. No one has alleged that the U.N. inspectors, who were contract workers for a Dutch-based company, Saybolt International BV, knew about the extra oil. Saybolt declined to comment.
So who chartered the Essex and tried to run illegal oil for Saddam Hussein? Who would do such a thing, knowing that that $9 million would undoubtedly be used to buy weapons—not food or pharmaceuticals but weapons? These were weapons that were to be used possibly against the Iraqi people, as we have seen with the mass graves that have been found, or, even worse, to be used perhaps against another racial group, the Kurds, as was done in the past. Who would charter the Essex to give illegal funds to run the barricade for Saddam Hussein? Who would do that? That is a low act—to smuggle oil for Saddam Hussein. Who did this? My goodness me, our little small-business victim, Trafigura Fuels, did it—but of course the member for Werriwa wants to defend them. 
Trafigura Fuels ran an oil smuggling business for Saddam Hussein, diverting oil for illegal dollars to buy arms. A small-business victim indeed—oil smugglers for one of the most brutal regimes on earth. Good old Trafigura! So do not shed too many tears for Trafigura. Then, when they got foiled by the Australian government, they pretended that they were hard done by. No, not this lot. These were the modern pirates. They were prepared to smuggle for anyone, even the most treacherous and brutal regimes on Earth.
So do not worry about Trafigura; for once they got their just deserts. I only hope—and I am sure the House will agree with me—that they are going to get their just deserts when, as the article says, the UN investigates their activities further. There are some wonderful quotes in this article, such as `Trafigura denies the allegations'. How can you deny allegations when you are caught with the oil? A small business victim, indeed! The scheme was cooked up by Trafigura. The article states:
... the scheme was cooked up by Trafigura to make up for an earlier loss on an Iraqi oil deal that fell through in 1999. 
You cannot say that Trafigura do not try every commercial avenue, can you—even dealing with murderous and treacherous regimes? The article continues:
He said a Trafigura trader “informed me that the top-up oil could be bought from SOMO—
that was a state oil marketing organisation for Saddam Hussein—
at a 10% discount and sold at full price.”
Good old Trafigura. They certainly were not going to miss their profits, were they? It continues:
... SOMO was “pushing to carry out such a transaction as it would mean more money for them.”
I will bet they were. And we know where the money went: to buy illegal arms. The article goes on to say that the two companies—Trafigura and its fellow company:
... attempted the same scheme again last summer, with the same captain and the same ship. On this occasion, the Essex was heading to the U.S. with more than two million barrels of Iraqi oil—including 272,000 that again had been topped up without the knowledge of U.N. officials, the ship's records show ... SOMO paid about $5.4 million for the illegal oil.
But—poor old Trafigura—the deal fell through. Gee, it is hard being a pirate and an oil smuggler, isn't it? Things do not always work out your way. Anyway, the article continues:
... the captain blew the whistle, notifying the U.N. and U.S. authorities by fax ... Trafigura officials panicked when they learned of the captain's letter and asked Mr. Cayre—
who was in charge of the shipment—
to shred all ... records relating to the cargo ... Trafigura gave him a new file to replace his shredded file.
These people are not just pirates and oil smugglers; they are serious fraudsters. It continues:
He also said he was told that “a similar file” would be given to U.S. authorities, according to his affidavit.
So that is our small business victim: oil smugglers for Saddam Hussein. 
—All-round nice guys.
—Thoroughly decent people, of course. Because one deal had fallen through and they could make a full profit—of course, we have got to be commercial about these things—they were prepared to truck the oil and make up for a previous shipment that, unfortunately, went bad. It is hard being an oil smuggler these days. They knew where the money was going; it was going to buy arms for Saddam Hussein. And they objected because the Australian government had stepped in and thwarted their plans for the Oriental Wisteria. Yes, that is who the opposition want to defend: oil smugglers for Saddam Hussein. I have to say that I have heard the member for Werriwa defend some unusual parties, but this has got to be the best.  
I would like to go on to some of the ill-informed comments made by the member for Batman, who seems to have suddenly become attached to the Australian Automobile Association and their spokesman, Lauchlan McIntosh. This is the organisation that recently sent me a media release saying that their only concern was their six million members. That is appropriate. However, if they were truly concerned about their six million members, wouldn't you suppose that they would want those members to have choice—like US motorists do, like Brazilian motorists do, like European motorists do, like Japanese motorists soon will have—on the type of fuel they can drive on? Wouldn't you suppose that that is what the Australian Automobile Association would want? Moreover, wouldn't you expect that they would be wanting their members to drive vehicles that were manufactured to the same standards as those in the United States and elsewhere? After all, one should expect that vehicles here would be manufactured to the same high standards as they are in the US and Europe. I refer specifically to vehicles' fuel flexibility.
—What is the association saying?
—Again, they have released, or leaked, a half-completed report that says that nearly four million vehicles in Australia cannot operate on E10 ethanol. The mystery of all this comes when you look up the list of vehicles and then turn to the details on these vehicles in the United States. Let us look at Ford Motor Co.—a well-regarded manufacturer. The leaked document from the Ethanol Confidence Building Working Group—it is rather ironic that the Automobile Association are on an ethanol confidence building working group with a straight face, but we will pass over that small anomaly—which was convened by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, states in the details concerning Ford Motor Co., `All Falcon petrol vehicles since 1998 will operate satisfactorily on E10. Please contact the Ford call centre for information on whether other Ford vehicles can operate on E10.'
Turning to the American literature, going back as far as 1992, the industry `bible'—titled Changes in Gasoline II and available from Downstream Alternatives—states under `Ford Motor Co.' in chapter 5, which deals with auto manufacturers' fuel recommendations, `Your vehicle should operate normally if you use blends that contain no more than 10 per cent ethanol, such as gasohol.' Why isn't the Australian Automobile Association querying why their six million members are apparently given inferior vehicles insofar as fuel flexibility is concerned compared with vehicles available for American motorists? 
I have written to every major manufacturer and importer of vehicles in Australia stating the anomaly and quoting from the appropriate chapters and asking whether this is in fact so. It may be that some of these manufacturers and importers were not quoted correctly in the working document that was leaked. But we will see. I have no doubt that these responsible companies, well known around the world, will seek to clarify the situation and restore the good reputation of their vehicles. 
—Have they responded yet?
—Not as yet, but I expect it to take them a couple weeks to gather information together and respond. We need to be concerned, though, that the member for Batman is defending the Australian Automobile Association.
The member for Batman went on. He took issue with the fact that I have raised these questions. Why wouldn't you raise the question as to the entitlement of Australian motorists, first of all, to a fuel choice similar to that in other countries and also to vehicles that offer the same fuel flexibility with the same warranty? That is not an unreasonable request. It seems, though, to have passed the member for Batman by. It certainly passed the Australian Automobile Association by. We know that there are vested interests at work here that want to hold Australia back from a 21st century fuel.
—Who are they?
—It is the Australian Labor Party, with the same old fossil fuel approach and the same old fossilised thinking. I have to say that the Labor Party's attacks on me and my National Party colleague the member for Riverina are frankly a signal of their desperation in this argument and their rank political opportunism. They have added nothing to a debate about taking Australia forward with 21st century fuels.
—Troglodytes.
—Absolutely; they are troglodytes, I am afraid. However, I am convinced that ethanol's time will come. This fuel offers a significant greenhouse gas abatement measure. Motorists will be offered the choice of using either standard fuels or a new green, renewable fuel blend. There are also health benefits. Studies in the United States show that up to 20 per cent of lung cancers are directly attributable to vehicle emissions. Unfortunately, the studies in Australia have not been completed in detail enough yet to draw the same conclusion. I take issue with the Labor Party's very negative thinking. If there is a political line, they will run it. They have not got a vision for Australia. They certainly have not got a vision for Australian motorists, for the Australian environment in terms of greenhouse gas abatement or for rural and regional jobs.
I commend the bills to the House and look forward to the day when we can all choose our fuel blend—no thanks to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Automobile Association. As they do in Minnesota, we will be able to choose to drive on an ethanol blend of 10 per cent or perhaps—if we feel like we really want to contribute to the environment and jobs—an ethanol blend of 85 per cent. The day will come—old thinking cannot last forever.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-09-17,"—I rise to speak on the cognate bills, the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. In doing so, I endorse some of the remarks that have been made by previous speakers about the use of ethanol in our fuels. One of the disappointments about this debate and the issue generally is that neither the government nor the opposition are really pushing in the direction of establishing an ethanol industry in the near future. One of the great disappointments those in agriculture and those who live in the country may well have—from both sides of politics and for a number of reasons—is that we may well see the opportunity for building what could potentially be a great industry and a great investment opportunity in terms of the fuel industry via biodiesels, ethanol and other substances wasted. 
I do not say that just to be a bit nitpicky with the government. The government is probably attempting to put in place a policy mix and it has been criticised very heavily by the opposition about that policy mix. I agree with what the government is trying to do but I do not think the policy mix goes by any means far enough to encourage private sector investment. That is not just pulling something out of the air; you have to talk to the people who are actually interested in developing the ethanol industry—those in Australia and those in America—and those bankers who are prepared to bankroll private sector investment in this industry. What seems to be coming back to me is that under the current policy mix the investment will not take place.
There are a number of things happening here. After the government brought out its cleaner fuels policy in 2001—which was admirable—nothing happened for a few years. Now we have this development that in order to move towards the target of 350 million litres of biofuel by 2010 the government has to put in place some form of policy to try and help drive that. That is commendable. But there is a removal of the fuel excise out to 2008 by the government, which will take place as of today—it is retrospective from today, I think, even if the bill does not go through the House. Then there will be a phasing down of that excise arrangement—some people have been calling it a subsidy; I will get to that a little bit later—in five instalments through to 2012.
When you talk to people who are interested in investing in the industry at the moment and who do not have a plant operating, it would take them something like two years to get operative in terms of when they would roll out their first litre of ethanol. That would take them through to nearly the end of 2005 and leave them with two to three years of relief from the excise. That is by no means enough time to make the thing stand up economically, even though after 2008 it phases down until 2012. So things are just not going to happen under that particular arrangement.
Another thing that the government did put in place—and I commend the government for this as well—is the capital grants arrangement. If the government were to look seriously at using the $50 million that was set aside—with a maximum, I think, of $5 million for each investor—and making some changes at that level to try to compensate for the lack of excise exemption, that would be one way of overcoming the difficulty that is there at the moment. The point I want to make is that the policy mix has to be changed—otherwise we will not see the industry develop as we would like it to. The Labor Party are carrying on with the fanciful notion that ethanol is going to poison fuel tanks and poison engines and that cars will never run again. A number of speakers and experts have said that that is a nonsense. If you are looking at 10 per cent ethanol in the fuel mix, it is a nonsense that that is going to harm anything.
—They've destroyed community confidence in it.
—As the parliamentary secretary says, they have, in a sense, been attempting to destroy community confidence—but I do not think that should be used as an excuse by the government to hide behind a tree on this. The government is looking for an out to show that it was not its policy mix that caused the problem; it was the dreadful Labor Party that caused the problem. I think the government is going to have to revisit the policy. As the government keeps reminding me from time to time, the government is in government. The government says that the Labor Party is going to stop this policy from working, stop this industry from starting and stop private sector investment from cranking up—but you cannot have it both ways. The government is the policy maker. It should make the policy and get on with it, irrespective of the mischief of the opposition and the spoiling role that they have been playing. 
I notice that the former shadow minister for small business has entered the chamber. He is very interested in ethanol. I think he is a proponent of the ethanol industry—at least I would hope so—because he realises that our fossil fuels are not going to last forever, particularly in his area of the Hunter. Who is going to benefit from the current government arrangements? If we presume for the moment that new investors will not be able to start up in this industry because the policy mix will not suit them, then the only beneficiary is, essentially, Manildra. I do not have a particular problem with that, but the policy mix—the 2001 arrangement that was put in place in relation to clean fuels—was to encourage an industry with a view to having at least 350 million litres of biofuel being produced by 2010. Manildra is not going to be able to do that. I am not absolutely sure of the figures, but Manildra would be struggling—even with some development of its plants—to reach one per cent in terms of the total fuel mix. I will come back to the actual numbers in a minute.
What opportunities do we face in relation to ethanol? I raised this issue the other night in the parliament. Just in my area and the member for Gwydir's area—where there is some very good cropping country, as there is in southern Queensland on the Darling Downs—there are enormous opportunities. Currently there are three investors prepared to invest in this particular industry. For instance, in Gunnedah there is a proposal to develop a $120 million plant which would produce half of one per cent of our fuel needs. There is another proposal, as I understand it, in the Dalby area for a $60 million plant which would produce a quarter of one per cent. In the Quirindi area, which is not all that far south of where I reside, there is another proposed $60 million plant which would also produce a quarter of one per cent. The production from those three investments totalling $240 million of private sector money—not government money—would equate to one per cent of the petrol fuel needs of Australia. That would be an enormous investment. It would have an enormous impact on agriculture, employment, regional growth, import replacement and all those sorts of things—not to mention some of the very important aspects that the member for Kennedy spoke about in terms of health, aromatics and using ethanol as a replacement for lead in fuel because of its carcinogenic effects. That in itself should be reason enough for the government and the opposition to be more serious about this issue.
So I am talking about $240 million of private sector investment in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland—that is not government money; it is private sector investment. For instance, if the plants at Gunnedah and Quirindi went ahead then there would be a further $120 million of private sector investment in the natural gas pipeline from Dubbo through to Tamworth. The implications that has in terms of infrastructure are enormous. We all sit in this place and talk about infrastructure, regional development, encouraging employment and those sorts of issues. Here we have a policy mix that, in my view, is inadequate to do that. It could be made adequate—and I would encourage the government to that—and it could have enormous influence. The three plants and the natural gas pipeline would total $360 million worth of investment. Talking about investment, and I know the parliamentary secretary is very keen on investment and matters of employment growth et cetera, if we were to have ethanol or biodiesel making up 10 per cent of our fuel mix—and this is quite feasible; it happens in the United States and many countries in southern America and Europe and across the world, and in fact some countries have an even greater percentage than that—then that would equate to something like $2½ billion in private sector investment. 
—Would you mandate it?
—I would. I am very pleased to see that the opposition is starting to talk the correct language now; it should be mandated. A mandate of 10 per cent is an encouraging breakthrough in the policy area. I am absolutely delighted—
 (Ms Gambaro)—The member for New England has the call.
—that the member for Hunter, whose electorate I travel through quite often, is supporting a mandate. A lot of countries in the world have a mandate. The US Senate recently mandated 10 per cent, and a lot of states have mandated 10 per cent. Some parts of the world are up to E85, and engines can be modified to handle that. So 10 per cent is absolutely no problem at all. That would overcome a degree of reliance on other nations for our fuels and the uncertainty in the world at the moment. If the three plants in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland that I was talking about were to be floated, that would require something like a million acres of sorghum—or variations on that theme, such as corn or wheat—to be produced. The member for Kennedy spoke the other night—
—Eloquently!
—Yes; I was delighted there were so many people in the gallery to hear him. They are not here tonight; they have obviously received the scientific information that they required, and many of the thoughtful people within the press gallery would be rewriting the scientific journals as we speak. A million acres of sorghum would be required to produce those amounts of fuel, with $240 million of private sector investment. That is one per cent of the fuel needs. So even a very small mandate could have an enormous impact on regional development. I do not think people fully appreciate the magnitude of that.
We have a policy that is going to encourage Manildra to keep going—and I hope they do—and no-one else to start up. It is not going to be long. The policy mix, the stand-alone option that the Deputy Prime Minister keeps talking about, says that you cannot remove an excise from an industry, that at some stage it has to return to full excise; otherwise, it will not be a viable industry. I think this business of saying the removal of a tax is in fact a subsidy is one of the worst corruptions of the economic language that I have seen.
The member for Werriwa and the member for Fraser spoke earlier today about market neutrality. The member for Kennedy spoke quite well—he was even passionate at times in his contribution—about labour markets. The Labor Party talk about market neutrality and, quite rightly in my view, about the rights of people to earn reasonable amounts of money with some degree of regulation. They argue against some of the things that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is trying to do in suggesting that invading the precinct of market neutrality in the labour market is okay.
The same government that says the process with ethanol has to stand on its own feet by fully returning 38c a litre in excise has no problem at all with subsidising the housing industry because of a change in taxation policy. When the GST came in, there were—quite rightly—judged to be some impacts on the building industry. The Prime Minister moved quickly to develop a housing loan arrangement—this was spoken about today in question time—and then doubled it. 
—The first home buyers grant.
—No-one seems to be whingeing too much about the first home owners grant, but we are not seeing that return anything to the market. The current government has put $1.7 billion into that compensatory mechanism, that free-market invasion. If we are serious about developing, maintaining and promoting industries, maintaining employment (we are not paying our people Bangladeshi wages; if that is what the global market is, maybe that is the sort of thing the Labor Party will start to talk about) keeping people living in some of our country towns, doing something with the sugar industry and promoting agriculture so that it is not so dependent on overseas trade relations—our poor old would-be Deputy Prime Minister returned home today a bit bashed and beaten, and that will keep happening for years; there will never be a completely free trade arrangement—then here is an opportunity to develop, within our own nation, our fuel for the future. It is environmentally friendly, and it has all the benefits that both sides of the parliament rave on about caring about: job creation, regional development et cetera.
With regard to the fuel taxation policy, having an excise at all on petrol and diesel when we are supposed to be a trading nation is itself a corruption of the market. The government seems to accept the $13.6 million annually from that. That is not market neutrality, but the government has no problem accepting that. That is taxation—and if you are going to remove some of that taxation then that is a subsidy! That is how corrupt the language has become in this place. If we are serious about looking at fuel taxation—and I know that is one of the reasons that LPG and other fuels have been phased in as part of the `return to stand-alone' mentality that the government has adopted through its policy—and really want to put it to the Australian people, we should look at increasing the goods and services tax, rather than have this abnormality, this enormous 50 per cent goods and services tax on fuel, when we are an island nation. I just cannot understand that sort of mentality.
The member for Werriwa, the member for Fraser and others, including some on the government side, are running a purely economic rationalist approach to all these sorts of policies. I have a phrase that I use from time to time: if we want to deliver the highest number of services to the greatest number of people for the lowest possible unit cost, the way to do that is to develop a feedlot. That is what a feedlot is about. We are doing fairly well at developing that in Sydney at the moment. We are encouraging it with the growth in housing prices, the pressure cooker approach that both state and federal governments are using to try to grow Sydney and the utter reluctance to put in place a policy mix that would assist people or create an opportunity for people to move out of Sydney and Melbourne.
Are we serious about this feedlot? If we are serious about it, I think the government and the opposition should start to say to country people, `You should remove yourself and proceed to the nearest feedlot,' because that is the most effective way to deliver the economic resources to the most people. To develop that sort of American-style policy in a nation of this size, with such a small population, shows why people are looking for alternatives to major parties. They have agreed on a common policy. 
As a nation we have an opportunity to look at other opportunities for creating jobs for our kids and grandkids into the future. One of those is to look at the things that we are going to need as a nation. We are going to need fuel as a nation. Are there any options? Can we pull more out of the ground? Can we get some more coal? Can we do other things? Can we produce ethanol? The answer is: yes, we can produce ethanol. We can do it quite effectively. We can do it on the agricultural land that is there now. Ethanol could be used for import replacement; it could be used to soak up unemployment; it could be used for a whole range of reasons. It could be cost-effective in terms of the health of our community. It would be more than a major contributor to the economic health of our regional communities. If the government and the opposition are serious about this, let us get the policy mix right.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—in reply—This has been a very interesting debate with a substantial number of contributions made by honourable members on both sides of the House. I would like to thank the participants in the debate on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 for their participation.
A number of quite interesting points were made by those honourable members who spoke in the debate. I listened carefully to the contribution made by the member for New England. I know that he quite passionately believes in the points of view that he put forward before the chamber today. I was, however, a little disappointed to hear the honourable member say that the government does not have the right policy mix to encourage new biofuels. Perhaps he meant to say that he is doubtful as to whether we have. I imagine that he probably has an open mind—
—Talk to the investors.
—You will be watching very carefully, my friend, to see just how the government's policy works. The government are confident that we do have the policy mix right, and I hope that ultimately you will come to admit that. You said that at least the government are trying to do something and that the opposition have gone a long way to undermine community confidence in ethanol and biofuels. I, too, think that is an extremely unfortunate thing.
—Hear, hear!
—Thank you. In referring to the comments made by the member for New England, I want to say that the government has established long-term certainty on excise through its budget announcement. It has also provided capital subsidies of $37 million for new biofuel plants. The likely mix of ethanol and biodiesel remains to be seen, but there are a variety of proposals under consideration. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism noted in his press release of 25 July this year that some 15 ethanol and 16 biodiesel projects are in preparation, and I suspect that the honourable member for New England has seen that.
The member for Dawson in her contribution highlighted the hypocrisy of some companies in the United States, where people have a genuine choice; here, people do not have a choice. I listened very carefully to what she said. The member for Werriwa queried why ethanol was not covered by the grants arrangements under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme. The government's decision to extend the existing arrangements for ethanol was announced by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism on 22 July this year. The current subsidy arrangement for ethanol is administered under contract by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources and is paid in respect of domestically produced ethanol only. This arrangement provides for additional short-term payments prior to the stage at which production is classified as fuel ethanol, which could not be accommodated under this scheme. Under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme, grants will be paid for both domestically produced and imported fuels from 2008. 
The member for Werriwa also made the most amazing statement that the government's support for ethanol is bad policy. The government's policy on alternative fuels was announced in the budget. It sets out a framework for moving the biofuels industry to a true commercial basis. The package provides for an orderly transition to neutral taxation treatment for biofuels by continuing longstanding effective excise-free treatment until 30 June 2008, with a phase-in of excise over the period to 1 July 2012. Most people would consider that to be an eminently reasonable approach. It also provides capital subsidies to encourage the establishment of new production capacity. The package will remove uncertainty by providing a stable long-term policy climate for investment while encouraging industry to pursue efficiencies to enable biofuels to compete in the longer term, without ongoing government assistance.
The member for Werriwa made another interesting statement—another incorrect statement—that the government's handling of ethanol is causing problems for business. I think it is the opposition's attack on ethanol which has created a great deal of doubt in the community mind. The response to the member for Werriwa is, again, that the bill does not deal with ethanol until 2008. Despite supporting the ethanol tariff bill in the House, the opposition has stalled the bill in the Senate. This is leading to serious uncertainty for business. If the opposition is serious, it should remove the uncertainty and pass the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. In reality, it is the approach of the opposition which is creating uncertainty and difficulty for business; it is certainly not the approach of the government, which is all about bringing about certainty.
The member for Werriwa claimed that the regulations prescribing cleaner fuels will result in a lack of transparency. The government is yet to announce the final excise rates to apply to currently untaxed fuels. In addition, the fuel standard for future clean fuels is yet to be determined. Therefore, it is not possible to prescribe cleaner fuels and grant rates for cleaner fuels, other than for biodiesel, at this stage. Although these issues will be prescribed by regulation, those regulations are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and, if the parliament disagreed with them, certainly could be subject to disallowance.
The member for Wills and the member for Fraser both spoke in the debate, and they claimed that subsidies for ethanol have a negative effect on feedlot beef and the beef industry. In response to that, I am pleased to point out to both honourable gentlemen that the basic aim of the government's policy is to provide a transition path to remove subsidies which have been in place through excise exemptions originally established in the early 1990s. The major feedstock currently used for ethanol production is waste from starch production, and not grain. I am surprised that those honourable members were not aware of that fact.
The member for Bonython made the accusation that the government has not provided the LPG industry with subsidies similar to those provided for ethanol. I want to point out to the member for Bonython the current fuel excise system has longstanding exemptions for both LPG and ethanol. These predate the current government, as the member for Bonython ought to be aware. The government's fuel taxation policy was announced in the budget in May this year. It seeks to provide a neutral tax policy with specific incentives for particular fuels through this bill and other measures to allow for certainty and the rational development of alternative fuels and introduction of cleaner petroleum fuels. The feedback I have received from the Australian community is that people are very pleased with this policy. It has been very well received, and the government is very proud of it. The government has based its policy on the detailed assessment of factors such as environmental performance and energy policy. 
The member for Hunter, who was here previously, criticised the incentives for low sulfur fuels because they are funded by additional taxes on fuels. The increases in excise anticipated to be necessary to fund grants to encourage the production of low sulfur fuels is around 0.7c per litre on diesel and 0.06c per litre on petrol. The community will benefit from the environmental gains associated with the use of these cleaner fuels. Cleaner fuels also cost more to produce, and it is appropriate that these additional costs are borne by fuel users.
The member for Hunter queried how the government will reduce the impact of excise on LPG. In line with longstanding commitments, LPG will not become excisable for five years—that is, from 1 July 2008. Tax on LPG will not apply to non-transport users. The final rate of excise is yet to be announced but will be phased in over four years, from 2008 until 2012. The government has held discussions with the Australian LPG Association, who will be further consulted in development of LPG excise arrangements.
The bills give effect to two measures announced in the 2003-04 budget. The first of these relates to fuel tax reform and the second to the cleaner fuels component of the government's Measures for a Better Environment commitment to encourage conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels. The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme will apply from 18 September this year and will initially provide the mechanism to pay grants for the importation or production of biodiesel so that the effective excise payable on biodiesel is zero until 30 June 2008.
The bills are part of the government's long-term reform of the existing fuel tax arrangements, where all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines will be brought into the excise system by 1 July 2008. The scheme will provide the mechanism for phasing in excise and customs duty on currently untaxed fuels between 2008 and 2012 by the use of offsetting grant payments. The bills also provide the mechanism for the payments of clean fuel grants to encourage the early production of ultra low sulfur fuels before new standards are mandated under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000.
The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill brings the administration of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme under the administrative and compliance framework contained in the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000. Amendments to the Excise Act 1901 and the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 make provision for information gathering and information sharing. These amendments will ensure the protection of the revenue and appropriate compliance with the scheme. I commend both bills to the House.
Question agreed to.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2003 has been brought on with indecent haste. It was introduced only last Thursday. Although Labor will not oppose this bill in the House, Labor has some major concerns about its possible implications. Because of this, Labor will reserve its position in relation to the bill and possible amendments, depending on the evidence gathered in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearings. Labor's concern over the speed with which this legislation was introduced, and debate was brought on, is to do with its lack of detail, which apparently will be contained in regulations yet to be drafted. It seems that those regulations will contain a large part of the substance of the measures proposed, and Labor is not going to give the government carte blanche on those matters.
The purpose of this bill is to allow one spouse—the splitting spouse—to transfer part of their superannuation contributions into a second account held by the other spouse—the receiving spouse. The rationale for this is to provide non-working spouses, who may otherwise be unable to access the superannuation system, to do so. Although there is merit in this proposal, Labor has a number of serious concerns about this bill as it stands. It would provide significant tax benefits to a high-income couple that splits contributions, including access to two RBLs—reasonable benefit limits—and two tax-free thresholds in retirement. To summarise our concerns, they are the equity of the measures, the cost to revenue, the cost to and efficiency of superannuation funds, the cost to individual fund members, and the addition of complexity to an already complex system.
Let me touch on the administrative costs. Although in some cases a receiving spouse may have an existing superannuation account, many will not. In addition, the receiving spouse, even if they hold an existing account, may choose to open a new account. Given the very serious problem with the current number of superannuation accounts, this measure can only contribute to an increase in the number of accounts and ultimately the costs across the superannuation system. This will add many extra accounts to the existing 25 million accounts for nine million fund members. This runs counter to the view of the government—as expressed in its support for the portability regulations and the introduction of so-called choice of funds—that there is an urgent need to reduce the number of accounts. 
Obviously, with the increase in the number of accounts there will be a corresponding increase in the administrative burden on funds—an administrative burden accompanied by increased costs which will ultimately be spread over all of the members of the fund regardless of whether or not they are in a position to, or do, take advantage of the contribution-splitting measures. In addition to the increase in the costs to funds, where there are two accounts there will also be an increase in fees, charges and commissions—a particular concern where retail funds are involved. There is clear evidence that the fees, charges and commissions relating to retail funds far exceed those of industry, public sector and corporate funds.
The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, in a survey of administration costs, found that annual administrative costs per member for industry, corporate and public sector funds were $54, $147 and $60 respectively. Retail funds on the other hand had administrative costs of $160 per member. The comparisons are striking—and this does not include the other charges, such as exit fees and commissions, that are typically charged by retail funds. It goes without saying that retail funds will market themselves aggressively to attract these new accounts, and the issue of their fees, charges and commissions needs to be very seriously addressed, particularly in relation to any splitting of compulsory superannuation guarantee contributions.
These things add considerably to the inefficiency and complexity of the system—inefficiency and complexity to which the government has given us no solution. One wonders whether the government considered the interrelationship between the family law superannuation amendments, which allow for the splitting of superannuation in divorce settlements, and these proposed new measures. The mind boggles at the added complexity this interrelationship will cause, particularly where there are prenuptial agreements.
The government has also failed to look at the long-term costs of these measures. While the forecast costs over the budget estimate period appear modest—between $4 million and $11 million, depending on the option the government chooses to enact in the regulations—they could rise over 10 to 20 years to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Given the projected significant rises in individual superannuation balances driven by Labor's superannuation guarantee, which reached nine per cent on 1 July last year, and the return of positive investment returns, which will lead to a reversal of the decline in voluntary contributions—which dropped by 17 per cent in the year to March 2003—it is extremely important that the long-term costs, which ultimately fall on the entire community, are known.
Why has the government not provided us with these costs? The government continually lectures the community about the long-term costs of an ageing population; there are legitimate policy considerations for health, aged care and pension costs, amongst other things. But has this particular proposal's cost been examined for its long-term impact? If not, why not? Did Treasury model the cost of this measure and incorporate it in its Intergenerational Report? No, it did not. The Treasurer in particular talks about intergenerational issues. For instance, in response to a question without notice on 27 March this year, he said: 
The importance of sound budget management is to deal with the big structural questions that are confronting all advanced industrial societies, such as the ageing of the population.
This government remains committed to addressing those areas that will challenge our finances with the ageing of the population—in particular, pharmaceuticals, health care, disability and welfare reform.
Why then is the government adding significantly to revenue costs, without appropriate modelling, while at the same time preparing to make cuts to essential health services, such as pharmaceutical benefits, in the short term?
Let us now go to the tax advantages and the costs to revenue of those advantages. The income-splitting proposal as it stands allows the establishment of two accounts, each with its own RBL. It is evident that the only fund members who can take advantage of the two RBLs—the lump sum RBL of $588,056 and the pension RBL of $1,176,106—are very high income earners. A fund member would need to have an income greater than $100,000 a year for most of her or his life and/or be in a very generous fund to reach the RBL limit. Very obviously, the majority of fund members—low- to middle-income earners—have little chance of reaching the RBL, yet the cost to revenue of this measure will be borne in part by them.
The same applies to the tax-free threshold. How can low-income earners—earning $20,000 or less—ever be expected to accrue sufficient savings to exceed the current tax-free threshold of $117,576 on retirement? What we do not know is the likely extent of superannuation tax concessions that will be accessed through this measure and which taxpayers will therefore be carrying a relatively larger proportion of the tax burden. Once again, we have a set of government measures that will provide the greatest benefit to high-income earners and little or nothing to the low-income earner. What is the equity of these proposals?
The real policy priority is to lower the contributions tax on both compulsory superannuation guarantee contributions and voluntary contributions, which would benefit all superannuation fund members. In 1996, when this government was elected, the tax collection was $1.6 billion a year; it has now increased to over $5 billion in this financial year—it must be one of the fastest growing areas of revenue collection for this Liberal government.
In Simon Crean's last two budget speeches he outlined a positive, alternative position to cut the contributions tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent.
—For everyone.
—Yes, for everyone, as the member for Lowe says. This alternative is costed, responsible, ultimately fairer and, very importantly, does not increase the complexity of the superannuation system for both funds and their individual fund members.
Apparently, this is too hard for the Treasurer, who said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:
It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way it—
I think he meant `in'—
started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us. ... So it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.
Well that is certainly not the view of professionals in this area. The Treasurer is concerned about the complexity of the superannuation system when it suits him but not when it does not suit, as is the case with these income-splitting measures. 
There is merit in this measure in that it may enable some individuals, who would otherwise have no access to superannuation saving, to access the system. But the measures as they stand raise serious issues, including those I have discussed—the costs, complexity and equity—that Labor believes must be addressed before these measures go ahead. Labor consequently will not oppose the passing of this bill in the House but reserves its position in the Senate on the bill and possible amendments subject to the evidence received at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SPLITTING) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—I thank the member for Kingston for recognising in his contribution tonight that there is merit in these measures being put to the parliament this evening. But I observe that Labor do not have any policies in this area. It is quite bizarre that they released a paper for comment in August last year but there are still are no policies. The chronology is that Senator Nick Sherry, Labor's spokesman on retirement incomes and savings, released a discussion paper on superannuation in August 2002 which forecast a policy in future—we have heard `forecast a policy in the future' before. Senator Sherry's most recent release announced that Simon Crean would unveil `a substantial part' of Labor's retirement incomes and superannuation policy in November 2003. The position today is that Labor has no superannuation policy 12 months after the release of their discussion paper, and Senator Sherry has been left out of announcing any part of the policy, apparently, in November 2003.
Labor's promises to improve superannuation ring very hollow indeed when for several years Labor has been opposing measures that will give workers choice over where they invest their own money. We now hear the member for Kingston reserving the Labor Party's right, when it comes to this bill going to the Senate, to further seek to frustrate the government in relation to getting its legislation through and in operation for the good of this country. When we talk about the good of this country we talk about the good of its people, and these amendments provide for the tax consequences of the government's election commitment to allow members to split their superannuation contributions with their spouse.
The splitting of superannuation contributions will assist many Australian families. In particular, it will allow low-income or non-working spouses—and there are so many people in that particular position—to have superannuation assets under their own control and have their own income in retirement. The marvellous result of all that is that this measure is expected to particularly benefit women, and that is a fine and laudable outcome of this particular legislation. The changes will provide single income couples, including those not able to make voluntary contributions, with access to two eligible termination payment low rate thresholds and two reasonable benefit limits in the same way as dual income families.
The government is proposing an annual split model for the splitting of contributions—that is, at the end of the financial year the member could request that contributions made in the previous year be split with their spouse. Over the past several years I have had many requests for this particular measure. It is a very popular measure, and when this legislation is passed it will be very widely appreciated by so many families.
The exact details of how this will operate quite sensibly will be specified under regulations. Where a split of contribution is made in accordance with those regulations, the tax consequences will be as set out in the bill. The basic principles of that treatment will be that contributions of a member—that is, the splitting spouse—that are split in favour of their spouse—the receiving spouse—will be paid to another fund or transferred to an account within the existing fund for the receiving spouse. Payment or transfer will be considered as an eligible termination payment rollover for the receiving spouse. 
Any surcharge liability that attaches to any contributions that have been split will remain in respect of the splitting spouse and generally be payable, in respect of the splitting spouse, by the superannuation provider to which those contributions were originally made. It sounds technical but the result is what is wanted for Australian families. I know that the many families that have spoken to me over the years seeking this particular measure through the parliament will be very pleased to see this become the law of the nation. I support the bill, and I thank the Labor Party for its qualified support for it.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SPLITTING) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I also want to make a brief contribution to this debate and support the comments made by the member for Kingston on Labor's position. We are reserving and offering some qualified support to this bill in the House. This will provide us with an opportunity to get some further information before we make a final decision on whether to seek to amend the bill or oppose it in the Senate, depending on the evidence that will be gathered from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearings on the bill. The member for Kingston outlined a number of concerns we have about how this measure will work and, in particular, he referred to the speed with which it has been introduced. That goes to some of our concerns in that we do not have the information to be able to give our full support to the bill at this stage.
The issues that I would like to touch on fall within my responsibility as shadow spokesperson for issues affecting women in the community. Some of the previous speakers have raised this issue and how it is a measure which can apply to either gender: it can be a husband who is earning an income and seeks to transfer some of his superannuation payments to his wife, or the reverse. But we know that the reality of the working community at the moment is that this is a measure which is most likely to be used by husbands for the benefit of their wives. For that reason, there are a large number of women's groups and organisations within the community who are very keen to see this measure supported. At the same time, I would like to express some words of warning and caution—and these are some of the issues we would like to pursue through the Senate committee—that there are also concerns by large numbers of women's groups and on our side of the House that these benefits are really only able to fully taken advantage of by people who are on extremely high incomes, not those who are on moderate or low incomes.
Everybody has the potential to benefit from these provisions but, by virtue of the thresholds, the people who are able to get the most advantage from them are those on very high incomes. It concerns us that it appears that the government is more interested in providing assistance to high income earning men to support wives who are staying at homes—perhaps caring for children or doing other things. Whilst we do not oppose the idea of trying to assist women in those circumstances—in fact we think it is very important to look at ways that we can assist women who might choose to spend some of their lives at home caring for children—we do not want this to be something that is only for those women who happen to have partners or husbands with very high incomes.
There is another issue of interest and concern to a number of women which has not been dealt with. This is an initiative of benefit to women—and it has been promoted by the government as such—only if the male partner who might be splitting his superannuation chooses to allow that to be the case. I do not think that we should overplay that this will be a great change for women and they are suddenly going to have economic independence that they have not had previously. It is something that will be negotiated between couples presumably; it will be something that people will take advice on from their accountants and others. While it might be welcome and an advantage for some people, it is perhaps a little premature to say that this is going to create some revolution in the way that women can have economic independence even if they choose to stay at home. 
One of the major issues that we will be pursuing in the Senate process is how the distribution will work. What does it mean when you have thresholds that are extremely high? What will the impact and take-up rates be for women who are in low-income families or families that are on low incomes who might seek to use this sort of provision? I wanted to make sure, as Labor's spokesperson for women, that we did place on the record that we are seeking a substantial amount of extra information from the government about the equity of these measures and how we will be able to convince ourselves and the community that this is an efficient use of public money. Obviously, the measures have a cost impact and, if they are going to be promoted as an initiative which is of great benefit to women, we should be able to explain to the community whether they will benefit all women or only those in certain income brackets. If it only benefits women in certain income brackets we will have to assess, in making a decision on whether or not we support this bill, if it is the best use of money to assist families in making financial arrangements, care arrangements and other long-term decisions.
Many in this House know that there are a lot of challenges facing women in the community at the moment whether it is achieving a proper work and family balance, the industrial regulations that cover their working relationships, the severe lack of child care or the fact that the government is still procrastinating over paid maternity leave. All of these are issues that have a significant impact on women, but the government has chosen to act quickly in introducing this legislation and seeks to market it as a fantastic, whizz-bang, be all and end all answer for women. It is not taking any action on a range of other issues that we believe are fundamental to women's participation in the labour force, such as managing to have both a comfortable and happy work and family life or planning for their own economic security if they are not working or out of work for some period of time.
That was the main issue that I wished to place on the record. I advise the government that is one of the issues that we will want to pursue in some detail in the Senate. We will be looking for how the equity across income brackets will work—that is, how this measure will work, particularly for low- and middle-income families. Unless we have a lot more information, it will be very difficult for us to be able to assess whether the costs and the proposed benefits really do stack up.
I am not going to talk for any longer on this bill. I think my colleague the member for Kingston has raised the other issues of concern to us, but I wanted to add the concern that we have about whether or not this is the best benefit that could be available for women by using the money that is available in this measure. Until we are able to get some more information on the exact cost of this measure to the community, it will be hard for us to make a proper assessment about whether or not it is the best way to spend the money. 
The community can rest assured that the Labor Party will be monitoring this very closely and that we take seriously measures that may be of benefit, particularly to women in the community. We know that that is the intention of the measure—I think the minister has expressly said that her interest in pursuing this legislation was to be able to provide some benefit for women—but we want to make sure that it is well targeted, well designed and a good use of public money before we in the Labor Party will be able to give whole-hearted support to this measure.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SPLITTING) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-09-17,"—I rise today to support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2003. This bill is about delivering one of the government's election commitments—to allow working Australians to split both their personal and their employer superannuation contributions with their spouse. That is something that I have supported for a significant time now. Of course, as we all know, under the current law, Australians are unable to split their superannuation contributions with their partner, including compulsory superannuation guarantee contributions.
The splitting of superannuation contributions will assist many families in my electorate of Riverina. I have taken an enormous amount of representation on this issue over the five years that I have been the member for Riverina. On my understanding, it will be particularly useful to low-income or non-working spouses, allowing them to have superannuation assets under their own control and have their own income in retirement—something which I really do support. This measure will benefit women in particular. I certainly understand the member for Gellibrand's concerns with respect to that, but this is one area that encouraged me to come into the House and speak in what is a very busy time for me. I do believe that this bill bring great benefits to women in particular.
The passage of this amendment will afford single-income families who split their superannuation the same access to tax-free thresholds and reasonable benefits limits as dual income families. The government is proposing an annual split model for the splitting of contributions—and I welcome that. After the end of the financial year, the member could request that contributions made in the previous year be split with their spouse. The annual split will mean that, at the end of the financial year and at the request of a member, a superannuation provider would split contributions received during that previous year. For members of some superannuation funds, splitting may provide the low-income or the non-working spouse with greater access to cost-effective death and disability insurance.
This legislation also reflects the government's commitment that the administrative burden of superannuation splitting will not be imposed on employers—again, something that I certainly support. Instead, it will be implemented by the superannuation funds. I recognise that the proposed amendments impose additional administrative and compliance costs on superannuation providers; however, because providers would effectively split only once a year, the costs will be kept to a minimum.
This bill will provide Australians who might not otherwise have the chance to accumulate superannuation with a fantastic opportunity to establish a nest egg for their own retirement without having to rely on income assistance from governments now and into the future. It will assist couples who cannot afford to make voluntary contributions and it will also help spouses who stay home to care for a family to accumulate their own superannuation.  
In this day and age, with many working women being the sole provider, with lots more stay-at-home dads, this measure can be utilised in both ways. It is really of benefit and assistance not only to women who are not able to work or to contribute to a superannuation fund or have interruptions in their working lives but also to a new age couple who may have a gender difference in who is the family breadwinner. This amendment also recognises the important contribution that spouses who stay at home in unpaid employment to raise a family make to our community in financial terms. It allows these spouses to have their own income in retirement. As I have indicated, in the new age workplace, this measure could be of benefit to either gender. So it certainly is a very significant step.
Traditionally, superannuation has been a means to encourage savings to replace an income for use in retirement. Historically, superannuation contributions have only been allowed for individuals in the work force. This amendment to allow the splitting of superannuation contributions continued to build on the achievements of this government and the commitment to make superannuation more accessible to all Australians. The aim of superannuation splitting is to assist families to maximise superannuation benefits and to allow spouses to share equally in those benefits, because each of them are sharing individually in the lives of the other and particularly in the raising of their families.
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that, in the year 2000, 86 per cent of women currently employed were covered by superannuation. This is extremely positive and reflects how far women have come in terms of paid employment. Yet only 20 per cent of these women made additional personal or spouse contributions to superannuation. So, while women are certainly building up their retirement savings with the money they receive from their employer, they are not contributing any additional savings. This can be attributed to a number of reasons, including a lack of additional money and the additional expenses associated with having a family. In addition, couples often choose to save for their children's education and their future and they also choose to pay off a mortgage before investing in their superannuation.
In many relationships, with the birth of a child it is the woman who leaves the work force, whether on a short- or long-term basis, and this causes a disruption to her working life. Many spouses may make the decision to contribute additional superannuation payments into a fund that is receiving regular and higher payments in the hope of greater returns. In the great majority of relationships, this larger superannuation fund currently belongs to the male, whose working life is largely uninterrupted. In addition, figures suggest that men are the main purchasers of long-term financial products. Two-thirds of men plan financially for their retirement, while for women the figures are very different. Only half of the women in full-time employment and about one-third in part-time or casual employment plan financially for their retirement. Superannuation is an asset like any other and should be treated as such. So a decision by a couple to split their super is one which this government supports.
As we all know, this legislation goes a long way to assisting working Australians save for their retirement and helping give partners who temporarily leave the work force to care for their children the capacity to be involved in equity in superannuation. All Australians work hard to provide the best for their future and their families. Superannuation is a nest egg and an investment for the future. The government continues to encourage and promote the benefits of super to ensure that, come retirement, working Australians can be financially secure and can enjoy the fruits of their hard work. Superannuation and the laws that regulate it should make this process as simple as possible, while ensuring that superannuation meets the many different needs of working Australians. As a government, this is exactly what we are doing and should continue to do. 
To accommodate changing work force patterns, social change and a growing appreciation of the need for all Australians to prepare financially for their retirement, eligibility to make superannuation contributions has been eased. While the link between paid employment and the ability to contribute to super will be maintained, this government wants to encourage more people to contribute to super and hopefully provide for higher incomes in retirement. The government has also introduced a number of measures that have increased the accessibility of super-annuation to individuals who are outside the work force. For example, indivi-duals are now allowed to make voluntary superannuation contributions on behalf of their spouse, even if their spouse has never worked. Since 1997, spouses have been eligible for a tax rebate for contributions to superannuation made on behalf of a low-income spouse. All Australians have different working lives and conditions, with years in and out of the work force. Superannuation should not be a one size fits all model, and this is what this legislation is about. To meet the needs of low-income and single income families is exactly what we should be standing for. If this is the case, then I think we should all be supporting legislation that assists working Australian families. I commend the bill.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SPLITTING) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—in reply—It was with some considerable surprise I noticed the earlier speakers finish their contributions so quickly that this bill is able to be summed up tonight. It is an important bill. I am particularly pleased to be able to, on behalf of the government, summarise the situation concerning the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2003. I thank the member for Lowe for his support of this bill and for his positive comments about this bill in relation to the situation of families. It is very reassuring to find on the opposition side of the parliament someone who is prepared to give credit where credit is due. On a number of occasions, the member for Lowe has not hesitated to do that. I hope by giving him this compliment that he well deserves I am not putting his endorsement at risk.
The government is pleased to have the support of the member for Lowe and other members opposite with respect to this particular bill, which provides the consequential tax amendments to implement the election commitment of the government to allow members to split their superannuation contributions with their spouses. It is unfortunate that the opposition does not always recognise that, when the government goes to the people with an election policy and wins the election, it has a mandate from the Australian people to implement that policy—and we have had many debates in this place where the ALP has sought to force the government to break its pledge to the Australian people. At least it is reassuring to see the member for Lowe and his colleagues offering support for the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Splitting) Bill 2003. Of course, that does not mean that all members of the opposition have, in every utterance during this debate, expressed laudatory comments concerning every element of the bill. 
When I sum up bills on behalf of the government—and I must say that I have done a considerable number of them today—I always try to treat honourable members with respect, even those on the other side. When they do make thoughtful but misguided contributions—even if most of what they say is arrant nonsense—I think they deserve a response from the government as to why they are misguided. Sometimes they are simply making statements seeking information. But I do think that everyone is entitled to the respect, where possible, of a response. Unfortunately, in a debate I handled yesterday a couple of quorums were called on me. That meant that I had to truncate the courtesies which I usually express in the direction of members of the opposition, because I did not have quite enough time to expand as much as I normally would have on the remarks that they had made during the debate on the particular bill then before the House.
The member for Kingston expressed concern about the increase in numbers of new fund accounts for spouses who have not previously had an account. I am pleased to be able to advise the member for Kingston that the government believes that all Australians should have an interest in their own retirement income. This includes low-income and non-working spouses. Naturally spouses require their own superannuation account to access this measure. However, many spouses already have a superannuation account, either from previous employment or from part-time work, and thus the government does not consider that contributions splitting will lead to a proliferation of accounts.
The member for Gellibrand referred to the fact that the splitting decision remains with the member, usually the male, and does not provide for immediate splitting of accounts for all women. The government does recognise that the decision to split remains with the member. However, the government wishes to provide couples with the opportunity to split their contributions if they wish. This option is not available to families now, and the member for Gellibrand will be interested to know that this measure will greatly benefit women in our society. The member for Kingston and the member for Gellibrand both posed the question as to whether superannuation splitting does benefit the rich. Here we find the tired old socialist approaches emerging, even from people like the member for Kingston who, on face value, on many occasions appears to be quite reasonable.
I point out to those honourable members that the government has eased eligibility to contribute to superannuation to accommodate a growing appreciation of the need for all Australians to save for retirement. This is particularly important given the fact that we have a declining birth rate and an ageing population. Contributions splitting furthers the commitment of the government to broaden the accessibility of superannuation. In particular, splitting of super contributions will assist low-income or non-working spouses to accumulate their own super, even couples who cannot afford to make voluntary contributions. Super contributions splitting also fulfils an equity objective by allowing single-income families to access the same tax treatment as dual-income families—that is, access to two RBLs and low-rate thresholds. As I said before, this measure particularly benefits women. 
The member for Riverina referred to the fact that the annual split model keeps additional administration costs to a minimum. The member for Riverina is absolutely correct. It is an important point that she makes, and all of us should carefully take note of it. While super funds will shoulder some administrative burden, the government's annual split model keeps this burden to a minimum. It also limits the administrative burden on fund members. The member for Kingston expressed a concern about lack of detail. The bill was introduced before the regulations to enable timely consideration of the issues. This is a normal legislative practice as processing the bill clearly takes time and much longer than regulations. It also ought to be recognised that regulations are disallowable instruments and that the parliament can always consider them.
The member for Kingston also claimed that high fees and charges will be incurred by those who split. Excessive fees and charges are a concern to the government, and the government has introduced two measures that will increase competition and reduce fees and charges—namely, choice and portability. The splitting measure will also allow the receiving spouse to choose a fund and an account that suits their respective needs. The government believes competition, not regulation, is the best way to reduce fees. Superannuation has traditionally been seen as a savings vehicle for those in employment. However, to accommodate a growing appreciation of the need for all Australians to prepare financially for their retirement, eligibility to make superannuation contributions has been eased. While the general link between paid employment and the ability to contribute to superannuation will be maintained, the government wishes to encourage more people to contribute to superannuation and provide for higher incomes in retirement.
The government has introduced a number of measures that have broadened the accessibility of superannuation to individuals outside of the work force. Contributions splitting furthers the government's commitment to broaden the accessibility of superannuation. The splitting of superannuation contributions will assist many families. In particular it will allow low-income or non-working spouses to have superannuation assets under their own control and to have their own income in retirement. This measure is expected to particularly benefit women. In particular, the ability to split employer superannuation contributions will assist couples that cannot afford to make voluntary contributions. It will also provide single-income couples, including those not able to make voluntary contributions, with access to two ETP low-rate thresholds and two RBL limits in the same way as dual-income families. Superannuation contributions splitting will therefore fulfil an equity objective by providing single-income couples with an equivalent tax treatment to dual-income families.
The government has consulted widely on this measure. As a result of those consultations, the government is proposing an annual split model for the splitting of contributions—that is, after the end of the financial year the member could request that contributions made in the previous year be split with their spouse. The details of the mechanics of contributions splitting will be specified in regulations. The government expects to release an exposure draft of the regulations shortly. I thank honourable members for their contributions and their support and I commend this bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Sending our nation's young men and women to fight—perhaps to die—is the most serious decision a government may ever have to make. Obviously it is not a decision that should be taken lightly, and obviously it should never be a decision a government make just to ratchet up the jingoism to camouflage their failings with the flag. This government have done just that. This government have put Australia's young men and women in harm's way because it suited their domestic political agenda and because they are so used to sucking up to the Americans that they know no other way. Our Prime Minister told the public that we had to go to war with Iraq to reduce the threat of terrorism to Australia and to reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We now know that a Joint Intelligence Committee report, which was received by our government one month before we were committed to war, said just the opposite—that this war would increase the likelihood of terrorism and increase the likelihood that weapons of mass destruction would be used.
It is now almost five months since President Bush claimed victory in Iraq—and what a victory it is. Casualties in this post-combat period now outnumber those who died during the combat. In total, more than 280 US soldiers and non-combatants have died in and out of combat—149 of them since the end of the war—as well as 50 Britons. Those figures are from a Reuters report earlier this month. Almost 10,000 Iraqis have died, including about 2,320 military personnel and 6,000 to 8,000 civilian casualties. That is also reported by Reuters.
Iraq is in a state of increasing civil unrest. We have seen the assassination of Ayatollah Hakim and the terrible bombing of the UN headquarters, with the tragic deaths of around 40 UN workers, including Sergio de Mello, who was well known to so many members of our Australian parliament. The cost has been great in human lives and there will continue to be a great financial drain on the United States and the United Nations. President Bush, who is now silent on the issues of weapons of mass destruction and US casualties, has just requested another $US87 billion—$A131 billion—from congress to rebuild Iraq. This is on top of the $US78 billion that was approved by congress not so long ago. Now the US is trying to shift responsibility back to the United Nations, asking that the international community provide soldiers and cash to fix up the mess in Iraq—as long as those soldiers are under US control. It will be interesting to learn more over time about the US companies that have profited from monopolistic contracts relating to Iraq's reconstruction and about their political and economic relationship with the current US administration. 
We went to war with Iraq because they had weapons of mass destruction that were a threat to the free world and could be launched within 45 minutes. It is curious that those weapons have not yet been found. It is still possible, of course, that some weapons will be found. If that is the case, they could also have been found by UN inspectors, had they been given the extra time they asked for. They could have been destroyed under that UN inspection regime. What is made plain by the fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been found yet is that, if any stocks are found, they will be small. Will that really justify the loss of 10,000 lives or more? I do not think so.
Now the argument has changed, and it is all about Saddam Hussein and his appalling human rights record. Of course he has an appalling human rights record. In that case, I hope our soldiers have not packed their combat gear away, because undoubtedly we will be off to Zimbabwe next, or perhaps we will be off to Iran.
—We should.
—We should be sending our soldiers to Zimbabwe, should we? Is that how you deal with every conflict and human rights abuse—by sending in the troops?
—Are you sticking up for Zimbabwe?
—I don't think so.
—The member for Canning! Do you want to remain in the chamber? The member for Sydney will address her remarks through the chair.
—If our soldiers are off to Iran, they will be able to see how the Iranians that we are forcibly deporting are making out under this brutal regime that you want to invade.
—The member for Sydney was specifically asked to address her remarks through the chair.
—I am sorry, but the member for Canning wishes to invade. It reminds me of a similar situation in Afghanistan. We go in there, we send our soldiers in, we send the troops in, and the real difference to the lives of the people in Afghanistan is almost non-existent. The Prime Minister has to tell us whether he is planning a series of pre-emptive strikes on countries he does not like. He has to tell us what information he had when he sent our young men and women to fight in Iraq, and he has to tell us what Australia will do to assist the people of Iraq now.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The people in my electorate of Banks have sent a very clear message to this House. They want to save Medicare. They have sent their message in the form of a petition containing more than 2,400 signatures. This petition shows that thousands of locals in my seat are worried about the future of Medicare. They are worried that they will be locked out of health care. They are worried that their children and their grandchildren will be denied access to universal health care—and they are right to be worried. We know that the government's planned changes to Medicare mean that families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk-billing. Hospitals are being put under greater pressure because people who cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills are going to hospitals for treatment.
For thousands of people in my electorate who signed the petition to save Medicare, these are very real concerns. The future of Medicare is something they take very seriously. That is why so many locals took the time to sign this petition. They took the opportunity to come to talk to me about Medicare when I spent several Saturday mornings collecting signatures at shopping centres in Riverwood and Penshurst. A lot of the people who spoke to me about their concerns were parents. They said they were worried that if their kids were sick they might not be able to afford a doctor.
In presenting this petition today, I give my commitment to the people of Banks that I will work to deliver on Labor's campaign to save Medicare. Under John Howard, Australia is moving rapidly towards the Americanisation of our health system. In the United States, 45 million people do not have any health cover. If they get sick or injured they either go without treatment or face financial ruin. Labor will not tolerate that sort of health system in Australia. Labor will save Medicare for all Australian families.
I present a petition from 2,481 citizens, drawing to the attention of the House that under the proposed changes to Medicare families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk-billing and doctors will increase their fees for visits that are no longer bulk-billed; that the rate of bulk-billing by GPs has plummeted by 11 per cent under John Howard; that more than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk-billed this year compared to when John Howard came to office; that the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk-bill has gone up by 55 per cent since 1996—to $12.78 today; and that public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk-billing doctors. The petitioners pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk-billing by general practitioners and rejects John Howard's plan to end universal bulk-billing. These signatures have been certified by the Deputy Clerk as required by the standing orders. 
The petition read as follows—
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:
The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
	That under proposed changes to Medicare, families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk billing, and doctors will increase their fees for visits that are no longer bulk billed; 
	That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has plummeted by 11% under John Howard;
	That's more than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed this year compared to when John Howard came to office;
	That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by 55% since 1996 to $12.78 today;
	That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors.
We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing so all Australians have access to the health care they need and deserve.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 is almost entirely non-controversial and I will be brief in talking about it. It contains seven schedules and Labor will support all of them. The first schedule deals with the franking of non-share dividends. Non-share dividends are returns made on interests characterised under the debt-equity rules of division 974 as equity interests that are not in the form of shares. An example of these is reset preference shares.
Under existing law, dividends on shares have to be paid out of realised profits to be frankable. To ensure non-share dividends were treated in a similar manner, the imputation rules required franking of non-share dividends to be made out of available frankable profits. Available frankable profits were intended to be defined as both profits on hand and expected profits minus committed share dividends. However, expected profits were not included in the calculation. Schedule 1 would allow a company to use expected profits to fund frankable non-share dividends.
The second schedule is a set of consolidation measures dealing with cost-setting rules and franking deficit tax offsets. Parts 1 to 6 of schedule 2 amend the cost-setting rules for consolidating groups. The head company will be required to choose an effective life for certain depreciating assets brought into a consolidated group where the prime cost method was used to determine the decline in value just before the joining time. The cost base for a pre capital gains tax asset that is rolled over will be the same as the cost applicable to the originator of the rollover for the purposes of the cost-splitting rules. A new capital gains tax event—L8—will apply where there is an excess allocable cost amount on joining that cannot be allocated to reset cost based assets. An asset's entitlement to accelerated depreciation will be reserved in certain circumstances—that is, if it has been held continuously since a particular date. Unfranked dividends will be required to be paid in working out the adjustment to the cost for certain overdepreciated assets where unfranked profits are included in working out the allocable cost amount during the transitional period. Finally, an anomaly will be corrected that bases penalties for errors in cost setting on the error and not the tax associated with the error. 
Part 7 of schedule 2 corrects an error in the existing consolidation regime that allowed certain tax requirements that applied to head companies not to apply to MEC groups. This measure is retrospective to 1 July 2002 to cover a gap in liability caused by that drafting error. Treasury maintain that MECs would have recognised that the requirements for Australian head companies were meant to apply to them. If anyone recognised the gap and tried to exploit it, they would be caught by this provision. Treasury know of no instances where that is the case. Senators may want to ask the Tax Commissioner a question in estimates to confirm that.
Part 8 of schedule 2 contains rules for franking deficit tax. Any joining company's excess or unapplied franking deficit tax offset will be transferred to the head company. The head company will be allowed to apply the franking deficit tax offset in accordance with the provisions of the simplified imputation system. A joining subsidiary will be prevented from applying any franking deficit tax offset whilst a member of a consolidated group, and any franking deficit tax offsets will remain with the head company upon the departure of any subsidiary from the group.
Schedule 3 provides an income tax deduction for taxpayers entering into conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state, a territory or a local government body. The amount of the deduction will be determined by the commissioner through the Australian Valuation Office and will be equal to the fall in the market value of the land as a result of the conservation covenant. That tax benefit may be spread over five years at the taxpayer's discretion, as is the case with gifts of property to deductible gift recipients.
Schedule 4 deals with fringe benefits tax depreciation rates for cars. The commissioner announced on 20 June 2002 that, for cars acquired after 30 June 2002, the effective life would be increased from six years and eight months to eight years for income tax depreciation purposes. Schedule 4 realigns the deemed depreciation rate used under the operating cost method for valuing car fringe benefits with the new effective life determination. The amendment applies in respect of cars acquired after 30 June 2002. The amendment will only affect car fringe benefits valued using the operating cost method, which is beneficial for taxpayers with a very high proportion of business use. It does not affect the value of fringe benefits on cars using the statutory formula, which is used by most taxpayers. If this was going to cause the car industry any grief, I am sure that as the member for Mitsubishi I would have heard about it by now. 
Schedule 5 will permit statutory bodies that are established in perpetuity by the Commonwealth parliament to be endorsed by the commissioner as deductible gift recipients, despite not having a winding-up clause. These organisations are probably collecting institutions like the War Memorial. Winding-up clauses require the assets of a deductible gift recipient to be transferred to an organisation of like purpose. Obviously, if the organisation is going to be there in perpetuity, like the War Memorial, the assets are not going to need to be transferred to an organisation of like purpose.
Schedule 6 will make it easier for primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue them with farm management deposits, by replacing references to prudential supervision or regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory with the requirement that the entity be an authorised deposit-taking institution under the Banking Act 1959. I just reflect that at times it has been difficult for some states to know what financial institutions they are supposed to be supervising prudentially, let alone for some poor farmer who is looking to purchase a farm management deposit to know whether an organisation is being prudentially supervised by anybody rational or competent.
Schedule 7 will provide rules under the simplified imputation system to allow entities that have incurred a franking deficit tax liability to offset this amount against an income tax liability. Special rules are provided for life insurance companies to ensure that a franking deficit tax liability can only be offset against that part of the company's income tax liability that is attributable to its shareholders. I hope the bill will be dealt with in an equally expeditious manner by the Senate.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—If brevity is the talisman for the member for Kingston, he is certainly keeping up with that ideal. I rise today to add to the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003. As I have said previously in the House, all too often taxation amendment legislation passes through both chambers without too much attention because, more often than not, the amendments concern what we like to call housekeeping issues and are designed to tidy up our taxation system. As the previous opposition speaker, the member for Kingston, said, this legislation is not controversial. However, I take great interest in the amendments that we make to our taxation system, as every little change is one step further in a streamlined, smooth-running and efficient system.
At all times this government is listening to the Australian people and trying, wherever possible, to provide them with what they want. In fact, many of the amendments in this legislation are the result of listening to what various sectors think about the taxation laws and keeping an open mind as to how to improve the system. For example, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 seeks to amend farm management deposits. I have taken a particular interest in this amendment because, as I am sure you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent an electorate which is very much a rural one and which is home to thousands of primary producers. The purpose of this amendment is to make it easier for these primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue farm management deposits. Currently the law requires farm management deposits to be made with a financial institution as defined by the current law.
This amendment clarifies which entities are authorised deposit-taking institutions and therefore eligible to issue farm management deposits, thus ensuring that primary producers can benefit from the scheme as designed rather than unwittingly placing funds in an unauthorised entity. This amendment also seeks to protect the tax status of certain pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers that were made in good faith with noncomplying entities offering products described as farm management deposits. Currently, if deposits are made with an entity that is not a financial institution—that is, an unauthorised, noncompliant entity—then the deposits are not considered as farm management deposits. 
This amendment seeks to treat certain noncomplying entities as financial institutions in relation to pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers. This means that those deposits and transfers will be treated as farm management deposits, provided the other requirements of the scheme are met. These amendments will complement recent changes to the farm management regulations that require entities to declare their financial institution status. The clarification of the term `financial institution' will take effect from 1 July 2003 and ensure that the primary producers that make deposits with or transfer the deposit to a noncomplying entity before 1 July 2003 will have the tax status of their deposits protected.
 All in all, these amendments introduce some positive changes to the scheme and work for the benefit of the primary producer. The government is very conscious of just what a tough year primary producers across the nation have had. We are doing all we can to ensure that they have every opportunity available to them to help them plan for their future. That was also the case at the end of last year when the government legislated to enable farmers to make a rough estimate of the amount they wanted to put into farm management deposits by 30 June each year. 
I am particularly proud of this legislative change, as it was drafted as a direct result of a query from one of my constituents in the seat of Barker. That proves that this government does listen to and act on the concerns, statements and ideas of the Australian population. I must add that my colleague Senator Grant Chapman played a strong role in getting this legislation drafted, and his hard work has certainly benefited the many primary producers in my electorate of Barker and all around Australia. Prior to the introduction of this piece of legislation, farmers could not, before accurately finalising their financial statements and knowing their net income, put more money into a farm management deposit in a particular year than they may wish to have in the farm management deposit when their income position for tax purposes is finalised and then withdraw the surplus in less than 12 months without it detrimentally affecting the validity of the remainder as a farm management deposit. 
However, as a result of this concern being raised with the government, the federal government legislated just prior to the Christmas recess. The change enabled greater flexibility in making farm management deposits and has increased their usefulness. Farmers can now make a rough estimate of the amount they want to put into farm management deposits by 30 June each year and, if the subsequent calculations show this to be more than they needed to put in for sensible financial management or for income tax purposes, they can then withdraw—as long as it is less than 12 months of depositing—a portion of the amount, with the balance remaining as a legitimate farm management deposit. This amount then becomes income for taxation purposes; however, prior to this, any amounts withdrawn meant the farm management deposit was invalid and the entire income of the deposit would have been considered a taxable income.  
This is a very sensible amendment, as I am sure you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. As someone with quite a bit of experience in the agricultural field, you would know that often in the month of June farmers are still putting in crops, and that is their priority—not knowing the exact amount in their books so that they can organise their farm management deposits. Like the legislation that we are considering today, this amendment is a result of the government interacting with the Australian people and making decisions with them to benefit them. 
The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 also seeks to implement changes as requested by the Australian taxpayer. A measure to amend the imputation rules contained in the income tax laws that deal with the franking of non-share dividends is contained in this legislation. This is yet another example of listening to what Australians want and working with them to govern the country. Prior to this amendment, a company could only frank non-share dividends with available profits after amounts required to secure future dividends were taken into account. The trouble with this scenario is that, while it acknowledges that future dividends reduce the amount of available profits, it does not take into account expected future income and profits that will be available to frank non-share dividends at the required time. That is why this amendment has been sought—to ensure that any future profits a company expects to generate can be taken into account, so that future dividends do not bear so much of an impact on current profits available for franking non-share dividends. This amendment will apply to non-share dividends paid on or after 1 July 2001, the date when the debt/equity rules first applied. 
This legislation also seeks to amend laws relating to consolidated groups. To enhance the consolidation regime, this legislation allows for wholly owned groups to be treated as single entities for income tax purposes. With the introduction of the consolidation regime, a number of enhancements will help to further clarify the consolidation cost setting rules and ensure that the income tax law that applies to head companies of consolidated groups also applies to head companies of multiple entity consolidated groups. These amendments have a retrospective effect to 1 July 2002, which is when the consolidation regime commenced. 
There are many issues that this amendment seeks to address. It will remove the unintended outcomes in relation to depreciating assets where the prime cost method is used. It will ensure that the cost base for a pre CGT asset that is rolled over is the same as the originator's cost base for the purpose of the consolidation cost setting rules. It will also ensure that accelerated depreciation is available for an asset of an entity that joins a consolidated group, provided that there has not been a disposal for which rollover relief was not provided, and ensure that the requirement that unfranked dividends have been paid is met where unfranked profits are included in working out the allocable cost amount during the transitional period. It will base penalties on the amount of tax associated with any error, rather than on the amount of the error, and apply the income tax law concerning CGT and the measures to address unintended tax benefits to head companies of MEC groups in the same way that they apply to consolidated groups. It also seeks to pool the FDT offset entitlements in the company at the time of formation of the group when a subsidiary joins the group and allow the head company to apply the offsets against the group's income tax liability, consistent with the application of the franking deficit tax offset provisions of the simplified imputation system. 
Currently, FDT is payable where a company franks dividends to shareholders without sufficient franking credits to do so. Companies that have incurred an FDT liability can offset this amount against an income tax liability, and special rules are provided for life insurance companies to ensure that an FDT liability can only be offset against that part of the company's income tax liability that is attributable to shareholders. The amendments in this legislation will mean that companies will continue to be entitled to allow FDT to be offset against company tax by inserting rules into the SIS. Generally, the rules remain the same, with the exception that the former franking additional tax provisions have been replaced with a simplified penalty for excess over-franking. In fact, under the rewritten provisions where there is excess over-franking, a company's FDT offset against future company tax liabilities will reduce by 30 per cent.  
In addition, the FDT offset will be treated as a tax offset and thus part of a taxpayer's assessment. The SIS gives companies more flexibility in franking dividends and reduces their compliance costs, and it is another of this government's business tax reform measures. The FDT offset rules will generally apply to events arising on or after 1 July 2002, when the SIS rules commenced. The reduction of a company's FDT offset against future company tax, where over-franking occurs, will generally apply to FDT liabilities arising at the end of 2002-03 and later income years. The legislation also includes measures to provide an income tax deduction for taxpayers entering into certain types of conservation covenants with government entities. This amendment will extend the deduction to taxpayers entering into certain types of conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state or a territory.
This legislation is particularly poignant for many rural electorates as the amendment will provide landholders with a greater incentive to protect and manage their land for conservation purposes. As I travel around my rural electorate of Barker, I do see some cases where land degradation is apparent. Being a farmer myself, I understand the conflict that primary producers feel when deciding what the best method for land regeneration is without impacting too heavily on their survival. I know that many farmers would like to enter into conservation covenants, but the fact of the matter is they just cannot afford to do that. Farmers have workers to pay, stock to feed and crops to tend to and it all costs money. Some farmers just cannot afford to enter into conservation covenants. Currently, some landholders may claim an income tax deduction subject to certain conditions when they enter into conservation covenants with certain deductible gift recipients and prescribed private funds. Eligible conservation covenants are those that restrict or prohibit activities that degrade the environmental value of the land and are approved by the minister. Deductions will be limited to covenants with more than $5,000 or covenants over land purchased within the 12 months. It is important to note that the amount of the deduction is determined by the Commissioner of Taxation and is generally equal to the fall in the market value of the land as a result of a conservation covenant.
In some regions of my electorate of Barker we are greatly affected by dryland salinity. With many years of clearing natural growth to make way for land which can be farmed, the watertable has risen and there is increased salinity in the region. In the upper south-east and lower Murray areas, we are now having to undertake some serious work to try to restore and repair the land affected by this problem. With the dropping levels of the Murray River and the drought we all suffered through last year, land conservation and environmental damage are certainly in the forefront of the minds of many regional development board members and the local community. If this amendment goes even just a little way toward encouraging landholders, big and small, to rejuvenate some of their land, then it is certainly a worthwhile amendment. 
While multifaceted, this legislation seeks to amend our taxation laws to remove anomalies which up until now have existed. I have to say that I am proud to be speaking to recommend this bill and to outline the importance of such housekeeping bills as this. There are two vital amendments contained in this legislation, which I know will be very beneficial to my constituents in Barker. For this reason, I commend the bill to the House, and I am sure that the opposition will do so as well.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—in reply—The member for Barker of course is an outstanding representative of his part of South Australia, and the fact that he gets up in the parliament and speaks so strongly in favour of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 indicates that he is very much aware of what is good for his constituents and he continues that sound representation. At the outset, I would also like to thank the member for Kingston. He actually urged strong support for this bill. He mentioned that he rather hoped that the other place would give this bill speedy passage. Naturally, both the government and I share that important aspiration on the part of the member for Kingston.
The member for Barker referred to farm management deposits, which are really important as far as many rural people are concerned. I thank the member for Barker for highlighting the important role of farm management deposits and the role that farm management deposits play in supporting primary producers to plan for their good and bad years. The amendment in this bill will give farmers greater certainty about those entities eligible to accept farm management deposits—and I can see the member for Barker is nodding about this important initiative.
The bill generally makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures. Each of the measures will refine the operation of the current law, improving the fairness and equity of the tax system. Schedule 1 to this bill amends the imputation rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure non-share dividends can be franked in the manner intended by parliament. The amendments will ensure that entities can take into account expected profits when calculating if sufficient profits are available to frank a non-share dividend. Non-share dividends are intended to be frankable in the same way that dividends on shares are frankable.
This measure will amend the rules that apply to non-share dividends to ensure they work fairly and equitably. The amendments in schedule 2 provide a number of further enhancements to the consolidation regime which will further clarify the cost setting rules and ensure the income tax law that applies to head companies of consolidated groups also applies to head companies of multiple entry consolidated groups. In addition, this bill introduces rules to permit the transfer of any unapplied excess franking deficits tax offset from joining entities to the head company. These amendments have retrospective effect to 1 July last year, which is the date of commencement of the consolidation regime. The amendments are beneficial to taxpayers or correct unintended outcomes. The amendments to address unintended outcomes are consistent with the original policy intent for the consolidation regime and therefore have the same commencement date as the consolidation regime.
Schedule 3 will provide an income tax deduction for taxpayers entering into certain types of conservation covenants with government entities. This is in addition to the existing deduction for taxpayers entering into eligible conservation covenants with deductible gift recipients and prescribed private funds. The deduction is generally equal to the fall in the market value of the land as a result of the conservation covenant. This amendment will extend the deduction to taxpayers entering into certain conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. The amendment will provide landholders with greater incentives to protect and manage their land for conservation purposes. I know the member for Cunningham, who is in the chamber, will strongly support this initiative of the government. I see that he is nodding and I thank him for his backing. 
Schedule 4 of this bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to maintain alignment between the deemed appreciation rate used under the operating cost method for valuing a car fringe benefit and the rate used for depreciation purposes under the income tax provisions. This amendment will ensure that employees who take a car as a fringe benefit are not disadvantaged compared with those who purchase a car out of after-tax income. The amendments in schedule 5 amend the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to remove the requirement to have a winding-up clause as part of the endorsement provisions for statutory bodies that are established by the Commonwealth parliament in perpetuity. The amendments are part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations.
Schedule 6 of this bill will make it easier for primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue farm management deposits. The amendments also protect the tax status of certain pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers that were made in good faith with noncomplying entities offering products described as farm management deposits. The approach will give farmers a transitional period of up to four years to move their funds into an appropriate institution while preserving the tax benefits.
Schedule 7 will amend the imputation rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow companies to offset a franking deficit tax liability against any future income tax liabilities. There are rules for both ordinary companies and life companies. These amendments are a further component of the simplified imputation system that commenced on 1 July last year. The rules will generally operate in a similar manner to the former franking deficit tax offsetting rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. However, a change, as previously announced by the government, is the replacement of the franking additional tax with the simplified penalty for over-franking. This penalty will apply to reduce a company's franking deficit tax offset entitlement against future income tax liabilities by 30 per cent where there is over-franking. I thank the opposition for its support, and I commend the bill to the chamber.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003 makes amendments to the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964. The 1964 act provides that certain criminal laws applying in the Jervis Bay territory apply to Australian citizens and residents serving overseas under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations. This bill would amend the 1964 act to ensure that these same laws also apply to Australian non-military personnel working under a variety of agreements and in a variety of roles in any jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth of Australia. As the opposition does not oppose the bill, I will not be taking up more of the Committee's time than necessary in making some brief comments on issues raised by the amendments. 
The amendments contained in the bill intend to extend the operation of the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 to cover two categories of Australian non-military personnel working outside the Commonwealth of Australia. It is not necessary for the bill to cover military personnel, because members of the Australian Defence Force are already covered by the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, which establishes a regime of extra-territoriality along the same lines as the jurisdictional regime outlined in these amendments.
The first category of personnel covered by the proposed amendments are personnel working under multilateral or bilateral agreements signed by Australia and the relevant host state which specifically grant immunity for criminal offences to Australian personnel operating in these jurisdictions. These amendments are uncontroversial and they are supported by the opposition. Essentially, where that immunity is granted, these laws would come in behind the Australian personnel and, if you like, would apply a matrix of criminal laws that currently apply to people in the area of the territory of Jervis Bay, holding them accountable to that framework of laws. As I say, these amendments are uncontroversial and they are supported.
The opposition recognises that these amendments are necessary to ensure that Australian personnel operating with immunity overseas are nonetheless held responsible for criminal acts that may be committed while they are covered by the immunity agreements. The opposition supports these amendments because such an extension of jurisdiction—that is, the jurisdiction of the criminal law of the territory of Jervis Bay—is necessary to close the jurisdictional gap that currently exists for Australian non-military personnel operating with such immunity granted by those host states.
Although the overwhelming majority of Australian personnel who undertake roles associated with the Commonwealth government overseas do so professionally and with nothing but the highest regard for the laws and customs of the nations in which they operate, it is unfortunate but possible, given human nature, that some individuals might break local laws while serving under an immunity agreement. It is therefore necessary for Australian courts to have the ability to apply Australian criminal jurisdiction to individuals accused of offences that are covered by immunity agreements.
This extension was expressly recommended by a unanimous report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade handed down in 1999. This report recommended that the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 be amended to extend its jurisdiction to Australian civilians serving overseas in situations not covered by the agreement with the United Nations. Just as the opposition supported this recommendation in 1999, we continue to support amendments to the 1964 act that close the jurisdictional gap and ensure that no Australians are above the law.
The opposition believes that, rather than being a condemnation of the great service of the vast majority of fine and distinguished Australians who have represented Australia overseas in dangerous and challenging roles, these amendments affirm the integrity of those Australians by holding them to the vigorous test of the rule of law—and they have not only passed that test with flying colours; in many cases, they have actually been instrumental in upholding and strengthening the rule of law in the nations in which they have honourably served. 
The second category of personnel covered by the amendments contained in the bill are Australian non-military personnel who are serving overseas in jurisdictions under agreements that do not specifically grant immunity or who are operating in countries without any agreement involving the host nation and Australia at all. In these circumstances, the Attorney-General has the power to declare an agreement under which Australians are serving or a country in which Australians are serving a declared agreement or a declared country. This prescription by regulation, at the discretion of the Attorney-General, automatically activates the jurisdictional provisions of the act. They would be so activated, for instance, if the criminal law framework in such a host country were inadequate, insufficient or in some other way corrupted or ineffective in enforcing and implementing the rule of law.
Once again, this amendment implements a recommendation of the unanimous report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, handed down in 1999. It recommended replacing `under agreement between the United Nations and the government of that country' with `a prescribed arrangement'. The opposition supported the recommendation handed down by the joint committee then and continues to support an amendment that now implements that recommendation to enable such a prescribed arrangement to be made by a declaration of the Attorney-General.
The use of the principle of extraterritoriality in criminal law matters is not without precedent in either Australian law or the laws of other nations. The opposition believes that this instance is one of the occasions where the utilisation of what is quite a novel jurisdictional strategy is not only legitimate but, in the circumstances, demanded by the principles of justice. Australian law already utilises the principle of extraterritoriality in the prosecution and punishment of child sex offenders who commit offences outside the criminal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Australia—again, in circumstances where there are some concerns as to whether they will be brought to account for their heinous actions in the countries in which they commit those acts. The requirements of justice in the case of offenders who commit such sexual offences against children in countries where they are effectively above the law demand that the principle of jurisdiction be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate their prosecution when they return to Australia under these laws that have extraterritorial operation.
The factual contingencies contemplated by the bill we are debating also demand such an interpretation of the principle of jurisdiction. However, in this case, the principle of extraterritoriality needs to be applied both offensively, in the pursuit of Australian non-military personnel who may be guilty of committing offences in countries where they enjoy immunity, and defensively, in the protection of Australian non-military personnel who are the subject of hostile or mala fide prosecutions in situations where the country of origin, or its prosecuting authorities, has sought for ulterior reasons to bring a false, sham or concocted criminal prosecution against them. In that case, the Attorney-General has the ability by declaration to grant prescribed immunity from the operation of those laws.
The opposition also cites the recent moves by the American legislature to implement a similar regime—regarding its own civilians posted overseas in connection with the United States Department of Defense—as evidence of the growing trend among nations concerned with protecting the rule of law toward implementing legislation to ensure that no-one escapes liability for unlawful acts by falling through the jurisdictional gaps opened by the increasing overseas postings of non-military personnel. In particular, the opposition draws the committee's attention to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000, enacted by the United States Congress on 22 November 2000. That act was designed to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to civilians accompanying the armed forces of the United States who commit serious offences overseas, when a host country does not exercise criminal jurisdiction. In conclusion, for the reasons it has cited, the opposition supports the amendments proposed by the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—I am very pleased to speak to the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003. As we have heard from the opposition spokesman, this is a bill to extend the operation of the Australian Criminal Code to extraterritorial operation, such that Australians who are serving overseas in various aspects and in various ways will be subject to Australia's criminal jurisdiction. In particular—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Pursuant to standing order 270, I move:
That further proceedings be conducted in the House.
 (Mr Hawker)—I had called the member for Moncrieff, who was next on the speakers list. The member for Cunningham is listed to speak following him.
—But under standing order 270, I have moved that further proceedings be conducted in the House.
—I will give the call to the member to Moncrieff, because he has started his speech. As soon as he has concluded, the member for Cunningham will be called.
—This amendment bill serves to ensure that certain criminal laws that apply currently in the Jervis Bay territory apply to Australian citizens and residents serving overseas under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations. However, this law does not extend to Australians who may serve overseas in any other capacity—for example, Australians within the AFP, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or any other government departments who may be posted overseas on other duties. 
We heard the opposition spokesman raise the fact that in September 1999 the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade presented to parliament a report that indicated that there was in fact a jurisdictional gap, a legislative lacuna, which resulted in Australian non-military personnel who were serving overseas—for example, civilian personnel in the Bougainville peace monitoring group—not being covered. As a consequence this bill operates to close that legislative lacuna so that there will be criminal laws that apply to Australian personnel overseas.
We have also sought to include the Iraq and Solomon Islands operations. The amendments aim to ensure that Australian civilians who work under an immunity understanding—for example, Australians who are currently serving in the Solomon Islands—will be protected by the extension of Australian criminal law to their activities. Without this extension, Australian personnel who are accused of crimes whilst deployed could find themselves subject to the jurisdiction of local courts in the country in which they are serving. Under the proposed amendments contained in this bill, Australia would retain primary criminal jurisdiction over its personnel. It was also decided that the legislation should be extended to include any relevant arrangements and agreements so that more informal situations would similarly be covered by the amendments. 
In essence, the bill before the Main Committee today extends Australia's criminal jurisdiction to cover those Australians serving overseas in the following situations: people who are serving overseas under arrangements or agreements between the Commonwealth and the United Nations, or indeed an organ of the United Nations; and people who may have diplomatic or consular immunities or immunities that have been granted to a person due to their relationship with an international organisation, to the extent of the immunities that have been granted. It also will exist between the Commonwealth and a foreign state where immunities have been granted to those persons, again to the extent of the immunities that have been granted. The bill also serves to capture those persons serving overseas under prescribed arrangements or agreements between the Commonwealth and the United Nations, or indeed an organ of the United Nations, or between the Commonwealth and a foreign state. Finally, it also serves to capture those persons serving overseas in a prescribed foreign country or a prescribed part of a foreign country.
There is contained as part of this bill a regulation-making power. The regulations that are provided for may be regulations that prescribe an agreement or arrangement, or a foreign country or a part of a foreign country and can serve to limit the extension of Australian criminal jurisdiction to a category or indeed to a category of persons. This type of exception is important to take into account the fact that there may be particular activities that serve to be excluded from such jurisdictional extension of the Criminal Code.
The bill also excludes acts or omissions done by members of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate, for example. There is no particular cloak-and-dagger reason for this exclusion. Rather, it is simply because those people serving in either DSD or ASIS who are serving in the proper performance of their functions in the operation of the act are in fact already covered by the Intelligence Services Act 2001. So I would not like there to be a scare campaign put forward by certain members because there is an exception, an exclusion, for acts done in the ordinary course of the operations of ASIS or DSD. It should be noted that those particular acts, provided they comply with the proper performance of their functions, as I said, are already captured by the Intelligence Services Act 2001. Indeed, further to that, the operation of the act also does not apply to members of the Australian Defence Force. Again, in a similar vein, this is because Australian criminal jurisdiction already applies to those personnel under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982.
So in essence this bill provides for the protection of Australian personnel who serve in mainly humanitarian and security operations overseas. It provides a clear basis for Australia to claim jurisdiction and demand the return to Australia of those personnel who may be accused of serious crimes overseas—thus saving Australians from being dealt with by foreign criminal justice and prison systems. I cannot emphasise this point enough. The fact is that Australians serving overseas should enjoy the rights and responsibilities that apply to Australians who remain within the bounds of Australia. We certainly recognise that there are unfortunately many countries that are subject to questionable regimes with questionable criminal law jurisdictions. The very last thing I and indeed the government would like to see is Australians being subjected to what may be trumped up charges, a trumped up system and a trumped up conclusion to any type of trial—or indeed a summary trial—that may occur in an overseas jurisdiction. Australia increasingly is playing an important and pivotal role in our local international community in South-East Asia. There are in fact some countries that I would say fall into this category—that is, those types of country that I have just been talking about. 
If Australia is to continue its role of providing for peace and humanitarian relief in international jurisdictions, we need to be able to do that with the full knowledge that there is safety for these Australians—that is, the safety that comes from Australians knowing that they can serve in their required capacity internationally and be subjected to the same safeguards as ordinary Australians. Of course, to a lesser extent this should then allay what I would say are unfounded fears that certain people may have about the operation of the International Criminal Court. Whilst I would highlight that I would not ever see the International Criminal Court having jurisdiction over the activities of Australians abroad, this is nonetheless a safeguard that should serve to reinforce the fact that Australia retains primary jurisdiction and retains the primary right to deal with those who may breach Australian criminal law internationally.
The final way in which the bill assures and assists Australians is by making sure that Australians will not be immune from prosecution if they operate under some form of immunity overseas and can be brought to justice in Australia. Again, this is essentially a notion of goodwill to those foreign countries in which we do operate, to say that if there is an Australian who misbehaves or in some way breaches the criminal code of this country they will be subject to prosecution back in Australia, even though they may have immunity internationally. So it serves as a poignant reminder to those Australians abroad that, at the same time as they enjoy the liberties that apply to all Australians here at home, they are also subject to those responsibilities that go with being a good and decent person when they are abroad—thus curtailing any improper thoughts or motives that may exist in the minds of less scrupulous Australians who are overseas and who may happen to enjoy immunity.
All in all, this is a very good bill. I am pleased to see that the opposition is supporting the bill. I am pleased that Australians can know that they will continue to be ambassadors for their country internationally and that they will continue to be subject to the rights and responsibilities that flow from a good, liberal democracy like Australia. In a very direct way, this bill serves as a reminder and serves to showcase that we are a very responsible international citizen and that we expect the same of Australians abroad.",REPS,<title>CRIMES (OVERSEAS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—While we have a long history of success with methadone maintenance treatment in our country, newer medications such as LAAM have to date only been trialled on a very small scale. We acknowledge that methadone programs are vitally important but we also draw attention to what has been described as the problem of `parking' on methadone maintenance and how we as a society might better deal with that issue. You will see in the body of the report that reference is made to this issue by people who have been on such programs for considerable periods of time.
The committee also dealt with another pharmacotherapy—namely, naltrexone—which, unlike other treatments for heroine addiction, is not itself an opioid substitute. While mindful of some of the potential risks associated with the use of naltrexone, the evidence contained in our report suggests that it is an effective treatment when patients are carefully selected and extensive social support is provided. In that regard, I draw attention to the work being performed by Dr Currie in the public hospital system at Westmead Hospital. His efforts are to be commended, and it will be interesting for all of us to follow the outcome of his work. I want to reiterate, though, that naltrexone is not a magic bullet. It should be seen as but one of the many forms of treatment for opioid dependency.
I am concerned that to date little is known about treatment for the misuse of psychostimulants—the commonly known expression for them is `party drugs'—which are very easily sourced and, in my judgment, appear to be a major and growing problem among young people. Trials of pharmacological treatments for amphetamine dependence have shown little or no promise to date, and the same is true for cocaine. The committee recommends that more research and funding need to go into these areas. There is also a need to provide stricter regulation on the chemical precursors for these drugs, particularly pseudoephedrine. The growing importation of these chemical precursors was highlighted in recent days by the seizure of a huge amount of imported pseudoephedrine with an estimated street value of around $1 billion.
As part of our ongoing concern to minimise harm and to save lives, urgent attention needs to be given to the escalating incidence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users. The government's response in this area has been inadequate. We have not succeeded in controlling this epidemic and, on recent estimates, it appears that it is likely that half a million Australians will be affected by this debilitating virus by 2020. It is no wonder that the Minister for Health and Ageing is sitting on an independent report which analysed the issue and came to a conclusion about the inadequacy of the response to date on this critical issue. The committee makes several recommendations that I commend to the government.
The road to recovery for people dependent on licit and illicit substances will depend on a combination of strategies within a compassionate environment that recognises addiction as a medical condition which cannot be wished away. I support the idea that more resources need to go into prevention and treatment, particularly in areas such as those in my electorate, where the lack of access to detoxification and rehabilitation places is absolutely acute. We, as a parliament and a government, need to continue harm minimisation strategies. We do have a responsibility—understanding that you cannot wish away the problems that afflict people who are dependent on licit and illicit drugs—and a moral and compassionate obligation to continue those harm minimisation strategies that have saved lives and to continue to provide support to the wonderful organisations and staff who work in this critically important area.  
My work on the committee has provided me with a greater appreciation of the complexities of substance abuse in its many manifestations. It is regrettable, I guess, that the time constraint means that I have concentrated most of my attention on issues to do with opioid dependency. I think we as a community need to remember that alcohol is the most widely used substance. Fewer than one in four Australians now smoke and, according to the most recent studies, even fewer—one in six—had used illicit drugs. So there is some encouraging data which suggest that there has been a decline in the use of illicit drugs and that that decline was significant. But the data also suggest that alcohol consumption is on the increase. Of particular concern is the occurrence of binge drinking among youth. 
I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to work with them on this inquiry, and I also thank the staff who worked very diligently to provide the report, which has been three years in the making. I guess it is not surprising that, in an area as widespread and important as this, there are differences of opinion, and that has been reflected in the report. I conclude by reaffirming what I said in my concluding comments in the report: 
Finally, in supporting a greater emphasis on harm prevention and treatment, this does not equate to a strategy of zero tolerance. 
As I said before, we cannot wish these problems away and, in my understanding, where the zero tolerance strategy has been applied, it has not produced sustainable, long-term outcomes. Further:
Addiction is a medical condition. Dependence on licit and illicit substances is not something that can be wished away. As a society we have an obligation to provide the necessary support for people seeking to break their dependency, recognising that opioid dependency is a chronic, relapsing disease. In that process saving lives and minimising harm will continue to be part of an overall compassionate strategy.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be given the opportunity to talk about the Road to recovery report, the report of the inquiry by the Family and Community Affairs Standing Committee into substance abuse in the Australian community, specifically because in the 49th parliament I was a member of that committee under the chair of Mr Barry Wakelin. I was disappointed to see him lose the chairmanship of that committee, because he had a grasp of the issues and was working very cooperatively with the committee on that issue. There are a number of issues within that report that I would like to talk about, but time constraints restrict me from doing that. What I would like to do is take people back into history.
When I was elected to the New South Wales parliament in 1988, the needle and syringe exchange program—that is what it was called in those days—had been operating for about two or three years. It was operating in an environment where pharmacists were involved, and about 600 of them in New South Wales were involved in that program. At that time there were about 1.3 million needles and syringes being distributed and exchanged through that particular system. I think there was at that time an exchange rate of around 83 to 85 per cent.
It was a very good program because it allowed those in the community, from the police down, to have the responsible exchange of needles and syringes, rather than have them lie around in the community and create other dangers to people in the way of possible needle-stick injuries. But more importantly it gave the police an indication of where the people who were dependent on illicit drugs were in the community because there was a database set up by the Pharmaceutical Guild in pharmacies right throughout New South Wales. As a member of the Greiner government, I remember only too well the decision to move the needle and syringe exchange program into the public arena through the public health system in New South Wales. I opposed that at the time because I believed that we would lose control of it. 
I have considerable files—about four or five lever arch files—on drugs in the community that I have compiled over a 15-year period, but these are the only figures I have off the top of my head. When you look at the percentage of syringes that were distributed and exchanged in the way of fit packs from that period of time, you will see that in 1994-95 just over two million needles and syringes were distributed. Of those, about 972,798 syringes were received back. In the 1995-96 period, 1.9 million syringes were distributed and the exchange was in the vicinity of 1.2 million. The reason for the drop in the figures was that, following the decision by the then government to extrapolate the scheme out into the public sector through the hospital system, a number of pharmacists opted out of the system.
I must compliment every member of the committee for the very significant contribution they made to the report, not only as members of parliament but as people who have concerns about the issue of licit and illicit drugs in the community, despite the fact that some of them may have had, from time to time, alternative views on it. In the period from 1988 to the present day, I have seen the hospital system and the community health system run programs for the distribution of needles and syringes on a no-exchange basis, and I raised concerns in the community about young people having access to those distribution programs. They had access to these programs in an environment where the individuals working for the health system took it upon themselves, because of privacy rules, not to notify the parents that some of their children were in fact using illicit drugs. That was disturbing to me, to say the least.
In 1988 I predicted that the needle and syringe exchange program would blow out and become a needle and syringe distribution program, which is what it is commonly referred to as today. It went from 1.3 million needles in 1988 to over 13 million in the last financial year in New South Wales alone. That would indicate to me that it is indeed out of control. I also predicted in those early years that the incidence of hepatitis C would increase. I note that the member for Throsby made reference to hepatitis C and to the fact that 500,000 people are infected by it around Australia. 
The needle and syringe exchange program was introduced on the basis of it being an ideal way to control HIV and hepatitis C. The reality is that the thing that controlled HIV was the very sound safe sex program that I think was introduced by the Hawke government in the late 1980s or early 1990s. That was very effective in keeping HIV under control. It is interesting to note that the increase in hepatitis C, which is a disease that is transferred by blood-to-blood contact, is at the same proportionate level as the increase in needles and syringes being distributed in the community.
I am also very conscious of the methadone program, which was first introduced, from memory, in the late 1960s. It was introduced to a small group of people with a view to treating them with methadone, reducing the dosage and trying to wean them off the habit that they had. It has now become referred to as the `methadone maintenance program' and we distribute increasing doses to people to keep them on their addiction. That, to me, is deplorable. The reason I am making these comments is that, whilst the 128 recommendations in this report are very commendable and are trying to steer governments in the right direction in terms of control, in particular, and accountability for these programs that attract government funding, if history is to be repeated, the things that I feared in the late 1980s will continue into the future. 
I agree with the member for Throsby in her concerns about the lack of treatment services for people with addictions. On numerous occasions I—like many other members of parliament—have had constituents coming into my office with their children who were dealing in illicit drugs and wanting to get off them, and we could not get them any treatment at all. It was only through the assistance, on a number of occasions, of the Salvation Army that we were able to find some treatment processes for some of those children, because in many cases there was a six-month waiting list. I think that is one issue within the report that needs to be addressed aggressively by governments. If we are going to assist people with this health issue—and it is a health issue; I did not think so in the early stages, but I do now—we have to make sure that not only is there a very sound education process in terms of the dangers of using illicit drugs and, indeed, licit drugs, but that there are appropriate rehabilitation places so that people can go into at least a detox situation in a controlled environment.
In the last couple of days I have received a copy of a critical response to the Kings Cross injecting room, from Drug Free Australia. When I read it I thought it appropriate to make some comment about a couple of the recommendations in it which are very good and which touched me. Recommendation 7 in the report says:
We recognise the compassionate and effective treatment and rehabilitation, community support programs and social worker and outreach programs and place an increased emphasis on prevention of ongoing illicit drug use rather than blind tolerance of a crime and addiction cycle that is harmful for both the addict and the wider community. While we recognise the strong community support to `get people off drugs' it should also be acknowledged that the Australian people are very compassionate and take an open arms approach to helping people get back on their feet when they have demonstrated a willingness to do so. This should be a message strongly supported by government programs.
I know that is in the general thrust of the Road to recovery report.
Recommendation 8 in the report is headed, `Compassionate not commercial' and says:
It is also of great concern to us that current proposals calling for Injecting Centres in Redfern and the A.C.T. are being supported by outspoken pro drug groups on commercial grounds rather than on drug policy reasons aimed at helping people achieve a drug free outcome. We recommend strongly that commercialisation of substance abuse, addiction or human misery be rejected. Clearly while the operators of such facilities enjoy large contributions by sponsoring governments these funds are better used in treatment and rehabilitation services aimed at helping addicts achieve a drug free status.
That particular recommendation centres around another concern of mine in the 1980s, and that was that we were creating an industry and that that industry would grow and, to justify the continuance of government funding, the distribution of things like needles and syringes would expand and more and more people would be employed.
In the brief time I have left, I want to say that the issue of drugs in the community is not an easy one. As a member of parliament travelling excessive miles in rural and regional Australia I have personally been down the track of seeing drugs being distributed by bikie gangs. I was instrumental in sending off some intelligence reports to both the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police in the early 1990s about the involvement of police officers with rebel bikie gangs—particularly in the Young area, which is part of the electorate that I represent. That culminated in a sting operation in which a number of people in the police service were caught. 
I have to say that that was done at considerable pain and penalty to my family. A lot of people do not understand that when members of parliament take these issues on, rightly or wrongly, they are subjected to a significant amount of pressure. Due to my outspoken comments on the issue of drugs and their distribution, I have received death threats. My son has received death threats. My son was had a number of spurious charges made against him, because of my activity in the drug arena. That cost us about six or seven years of pain. I am still trying to get justice. Fortunately, at great expense to us, my son was proven innocent of the charges. That is just an indication of the sorts of things to which members of parliament are subjected. It is interesting to note that whilst the community want you to stand up and be outspoken and expose these issues, there are not too many people around supporting you when you need that support.
The issue of drugs is a very significant one. It has permeated right throughout society and everybody is affected by it. I close by making this point in support of what I have just said: I can go into my old home town of Cootamundra any day of the week, talk to people I know in the community and identify people who are openly distributing drugs in the community, yet the police have not shut them down. It just makes you wonder why that is occurring and what involvement some members of the New South Wales Police have in the dreadful industry that distributes illicit drugs to our community. I thank the parliament for the opportunity of saying those few words. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,36,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Unfortunately, at the outset, I would like to say that I am very disappointed in this report. It is a sad reflection on the majority of the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that, given the period of over three years since the committee first received the terms of reference about substance abuse and the wealth of evidence that it has received in response to both its initial inquiry in 2000 and its subsequent inquiry in 2002, it has come up with a very bland report. I am disappointed because here was an opportunity for the committee to be courageous. That opportunity has been squandered. There has been a prolonged inquiry spread over two parliaments—
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.15 a.m. to 11.26 a.m.
—As I was saying before the division, there has been a prolonged inquiry spread over two parliaments. The inquiry would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In good faith, members of the public have made submissions and appeared before the committee as witnesses. For what result? The result is a report whose recommendations are more likely to take us backwards than forwards in this difficult area of substance abuse. Maybe there was some significance in the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Hume, relating to the change of committee chair in the 40th Parliament. 
No-one can deny that substance abuse is a real problem in our community. There is a problem with abuse of both legal and illegal drugs. In June 1999 in this parliament—and while I was referring to illicit drugs it holds true for substance abuse—I said: 
... there is a problem with illicit drugs in our community whether we like it or not. It is affecting all levels of our society. Potentially all of us—it may not be in our immediate family, if we are lucky, but I would be surprised if many of us were not affected—know someone in our social circle who has suffered because of drugs.    
I believe that these words still hold true today and probably always will. The phrases `all levels of our society' and `potentially all of us' are the ones I would like to emphasise today. Substance abuse is not some isolated rare occurrence or something that only happens to other people. It can happen and does happen to everyone, whether it be abuse of alcohol, tobacco, heroin or some other substance. It can and it does happen. I am aware that the committee received a great many submissions and that it also received wide-ranging evidence at its hearings. The fact that it received many submissions and that it also received a variety of evidence makes it all the more amazing to me that it could come up with some of its more narrow recommendations. 
In reaction to the flavour of these recommendations, I would like to draw attention today to the minority report of my colleagues the member for Fowler and the member for Cowan, both of whom are very empathetic human beings who are willing to open their hearts and minds to the plight of those caught up in the maelstrom of substance abuse. I will start by quoting from their report, for the benefit of everyone here and for the parliamentary record. Under `General comments', they wrote in the minority report:
As members of the committee since the inquiry began three years ago, we have no objections to the conduct of the inquiry. The range of submissions and evidence of witnesses allowed the committee the fullest opportunity to address the inquiry's terms of reference. The most valuable part of this report is in fact the submissions received by the inquiry, the volumes of testimony given by witnesses before the inquiry and in the forums conducted as part of the committee's information gathering process.
However, the consideration of evidence, the conclusions reached and the recommendations made must be seen as coloured by the personal views of committee members (including ourselves). This can be a strength of the political process. After all, elected representatives should be a sounding board for the views of the electorate. What are seen as socially acceptable recommendations can be expected to prevail.
They went on to say:
But in reaching conclusions and making recommendations which reject the findings of scientifically based studies and by using assumptions and anecdotal evidence to support its recommendations, the committee's report loses credibility.
In many ways the report is not an objective assessment of the facts but a one sided argument in favour of a predetermined outcome. Surely the lives of young Australians should be above politics. Indeed the Australian people deserve an honest and open appraisal of drug policy.
I do not think I have ever heard a more damning indictment of a committee report by members of a committee. There have been minority reports to many committee reports before, of course, but usually these reflect philosophical or personal differences with the majority, reached at the end of the process, after much soul-searching on the part of the dissenters. It seems to me that what happened here with this report is that some members embarked upon the inquiry with preconceived thoughts about the outcome. They did not listened to witnesses and they did not understand the submissions. They decided to pursue a particular outcome which seems to fly in the face of the evidence before the committee.
I have some considerable sympathy for my colleague the member for Fowler, who said in this Main Committee room last Thursday that she regretted having any part in the setting up of this inquiry. Like her, I think the bulk of the recommendations reflect backwards steps in our policy towards substance abuse. Here was an opportunity to think outside the constraints of previous policy, and all the committee has done is recommend that the policy become even more constrained. 
Substance abuse is a health issue. Substances or drugs, both legal and illegal, exist, and people use them for what they think are their own health, social or recreational purposes, or whatever. The fact is that people take drugs, and they are not going to stop taking them. Fear of punishment, death or disapproval does not stop them. It never has and it never will. That is why a policy of harm prevention is a nonsense, because it implies that a point can be reached where no-one is harmed. The only way this point could be reached would be if no-one took any substances or drugs, either legal or illegal. This is not an imaginable situation. Its logical extension is to have no alcohol, no tobacco and no medicines. I could go on, but I think I have made my point.
There is nothing to be gained by narrowing the policy in this area. In fact, the opposite is needed. We need to be open to a wider view and to different points of view. We need to embrace a variety of ways of dealing with the problems associated with substance abuse. We should not reject possible treatments or approaches without giving them a fair trial. We should not be overly anxious to see a one-size-fits-all solution, because, quite frankly, there is not one. We should also strive to be compassionate and understanding rather than judgmental. We are dealing with people who have a problem. We are not dealing with objects. Anything that has the potential to help these people should be given a chance to be tried.
I share the concern of some of my colleagues about the emphasis given in the report's recommendations to getting people off methadone as soon as possible and about the committee's decision to suggest naltrexone as appropriate for trialling with opioid dependent prisoners. I am personally appalled that such a trial should be recommended. It reminds me of past practices when people in prisons in the US were experimented on or when members of the armed forces or defeated populations in war situations were used as human guinea pigs. Prisoners are vulnerable people. Who knows what pressures might be applied to them to participate in a trial. It could be claimed by authorities that they are willing to participate, but they will be very vulnerable to inducement. More favourable treatment could be offered, for example. How many of them would fully understand the implications of their involvement in a trial, the likely risks et cetera? Imagine how we would like it if it were suggested that politicians should be used as guinea pigs for a particular experiment.
This highlights another problem that I have with the report as well. This committee seems to be looking at individual areas and making bizarre recommendations. Recommendation 95 says:
... all personnel employed in correctional facilities should be subject to mandatory random blood or urine tests.
Why not policemen, judges and juries as well? Why is the report looking at those in prisons? Prisoners are being punished for crimes they commit by being incarcerated, and rightly so. But I just find the whole idea of making them part of an experiment totally abhorrent. To suggest that they be used as guinea pigs in this way is inhumane and denies these people any remnants of dignity and basic humanity. 
I suppose predictably—I am not really surprised—the report is not keen on safe injecting rooms. Again, this reflects an attitude of putting one's head in the sand. People inject drugs. They are not going to stop injecting drugs. If safe injecting facilities are not available, they will inject in an unsafe way. It is as simple as that. They will not cease injecting drugs into themselves or each other just because there is no safe place available to do it, and when they inject, often they will die.
In saying this, I am not trying to encourage the use of injectable drugs. I am not, but I do recognise that it happens, and as long as it is happening I would like to see safe injecting rooms operating as part of a package of strategies dealing with substance abuse. The evidence seems to be that where there are safe injecting rooms the incidence of overdose or death due to dirty needles or unsafe practices declines considerably. Surely this is a desirable outcome. Would those who are not in favour of safe injecting facilities rather have these people die? That is the logical outcome of not having safe injecting rooms for those who are going to inject drugs anyway.
Unfortunately, what we have in this report is a missed opportunity. Rather than being open to a broad approach to the problems of illicit drug use, the committee's recommendations in this area reflect a particular mind-set focused on zero tolerance. It may not have used that particular terminology, but zero tolerance is harm prevention carried to its logical conclusion. It is not that easy or simple. I can well understand the anguish of my colleague, the member for Shortland, who now regrets that she was an active supporter of this inquiry when it was first being established. The results shown in this committee report are disappointing, to say the least. An opportunity to be courageous has been lost and the cost will be borne by all those who suffer now and in the future from the effects of substance abuse.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,36,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—In speaking to Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, I would say that I have come a long way on this journey. As the previous member suggested, it was a long inquiry. It has taken me not only to just about all corners of Australia but also to places like Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, to get a better appreciation of some of the issues that this difficult subject confronts the nation with. To me, the drugs issue strikes at the core of our civilised society. It tests our values. It highlights the positive and negative aspects of life and all the options and choices, right through to criminal behaviour and our jail systems. It has been just over 25 years since the last report on drugs came into the parliament. I think it was a controversial topic then, and it remains thus. But I think the nation has come a fair way, nevertheless, in that time.
I want to give a few snapshots on those issues which I thought were important in terms of the general thrust of the report. Before I go into that I want to thank and acknowledge some key people. In doing that you always leave somebody out, so I apologise to those I leave out. I want to acknowledge Wayne Hall, Professor Ian Webster, Brian Watters, Alex Wodak, Tony Trimmingham and Brian McConnell and Marion McConnell. I also want to thank all the state and territory MPs and public servants who have put so much into this, the non-government agencies such as ADCA, and the councils such as the Fairfield City Council and the Newcastle City Council. The support received by this committee, and probably by both committees, was simply outstanding. It came from all levels of government, regardless of political background, including local government. It was an outstanding cooperative effort. I need to place on the record the wonderful efforts of Shelley McGuinness, who served us so well in the previous parliament. 
I thought I would touch on those issues which probably will not get the pre-eminent focus. We know that smoking and alcohol are key issues. They are the big dollar items where we have particular issues. The issue that society tends to focus on is the illicit drugs. I can understand why that is the case. It is because they give a sharper focus and are more obvious. That is what I will focus on today. I think there are issues around the treatment of alcohol and cigarettes and there are some pretty good recommendations about that in the report.
Firstly I want to talk about cannabis. Before I do so, I should say that in the available statistics the illicit drug situation in Australia has shown significant improvement in the last three or four years. Between 1998 and 2001 we have seen a significant drop in consumption by those aged 14 years and over of cannabis, analgesics—not that these are illicit—heroin and methadone, and a slight drop in cocaine. In terms of the available statistics, we can see that there is some progress on the issues that give us some of the greatest concern. On methadone, I would like to read a brief quote and perhaps subtext it. This witness really summed up for me the issues around methadone. I think a number of speakers would have spoken about the issue of parking people on methadone and not dealing with it in a more comprehensive way. The witness said:
One of the things that I have been disappointed about in relation to my own treatment, and I know that it is an issue for others, is never having had a treatment plan developed for me. I have just continued on and I happen to have the wherewithal to be able to make my own decisions now. I certainly would not necessarily have said that when I first went on the program—
that is, the methadone program. She concludes:
It saddens me a great deal to see people turning up and going each day—
that is, to collect their methadone doses—
when no one connects with them. I think there is so much lost potential there.
I hope that the recommendations relating to methadone can be looked at and dealt with.
As far as cannabis goes, I think we have come a long way in 25 years in understanding what cannabis is about. Professor Saunders said:
One could argue that cannabis use, as practised 20 years ago, was a relatively trivial form of substance abuse—that is not the case now. We are seeing an increasing number of people with cannabis dependence and the severe health effects of cannabis.
A number of witnesses went along with this to a greater or lesser degree. But the issues that I think are relevant here are the THC content and the hydroponics which now enable people to grow cannabis as a cottage industry, if not a major industry, all over Australia. We need to be conscious of that and we need to get the best information out to people so that they understand much more accurately what they are actually dealing with. 
The changes to illicit drug laws were, of course, hotly debated. Major Brian Watters is a well-known advocate of a particular view and Dr Alex Wodak is an advocate of another view. I happen to believe that the Watters view is the one that we should be aiming for, and I think that there is significant evidence—although I know that will be debated—to say that the best way to go is to have a focus which discourages people from being involved in the illicit drug issue from the start. I accept what people say—that is, that people will take illicit drugs, whatever—but it does not mean that we do not have a responsibility to make sure that we give everybody every opportunity to know to the best of their ability what they are actually dealing with and that these laws are not there just for the hell of it. In saying that, I do not decry Alex Wodak; I respect his view, but I take a different point of view. Therefore, I support the current legislative framework, to which we need to keep constantly alert, making changes where we need to. 
In terms of treatment, the report talks about the lack of a comprehensive treatment map. Certainly, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of where individuals can go for help is something that absolutely amazed the committee over recent years. The recommendations talk about urgently completing the map of available alcohol and drug services across Australia, identifying the gaps, ensuring the data is collected accurately—and this has been a constant issue in a number of reports and is an issue around Commonwealth and state relations—and readily updating the information contained in that database. The Australian National Council on Drugs is to perform that task, and the committee was really interested to see that that was done as expeditiously as possible. It recommended that the Australian National Audit Office make an evaluation of that work, but there is a sense of urgency about it.
In conclusion, I would like to quote once more from the previous report. The area that I had a particular personal interest in is to do with the issue of violence—the mixture of substance abuse, mental health and violence. It is fair to say that Australian society has become more violent over the last 15 to 20 years. There is a lot of evidence to support that view. In the evidence we took some three years ago, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health pointed to:
... increasing evidence that the co-existence of substance abuse and serious mental disorder not only prolongs the illness and makes treatment more difficult, but also dramatically increases the likelihood of violence.
The discussion paper that the committee presented in the last parliament, referring to the Victorian research, states:
Those who had a history of substance abuse in public mental health were over seven times as likely to have acquired a conviction as those in the general population, and in convictions for violent offences it was nearly ten times as high.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the committee made the recommendation that we do a lot more research. We became a little wary of the word `research' because you can research something literally almost to death—in fact, people have been dying as we have discussed these matters, so it is very important that this research be applied, evaluated and put into the community for the community's benefit.
That is all I really want to say this morning. In conclusion, I acknowledge the remarkable contribution of hundreds of people who not only saw this issue as serious enough to come before us and literally weep and be in total discouragement but also offered great encouragement. I believe it is as serious an issue as I have had to deal with in my time in parliament. There are great opportunities to do a lot better in this country on all these issues. I have not even touched on the opportunities in the jail system, but that is more of a state issue. I could even have talked about needle exchanges but time does not permit. I simply acknowledge my fellow Australians at all levels, including my colleagues who, for all our discussion, debate, disagreement and agreement, gave themselves willingly to the task. I think that this report, 25 years on from the last one, will give reasonable service to the Australian parliament and the Australian people. Members of the public may not read it all in one hit but I trust that many of them will take time to have a look at the recommendations and then refer back to some of the basis—the reasons that the recommendations were made.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I apologise at the outset because I too am suffering from the same sort of lurgy that you are at the moment so, if I sound a little croaky or die along the way, my apologies.
One of the wonderful things about this parliament is the committee structure. I do not think we actually have enough recognition of the committee structure out there among the public or even in the parliament. I want to commend the House for having the decency to refer this report to the Main Committee so that more than two speakers with five minutes each can get to speak on what is a fairly hefty and at times worthy report. Having said that though—and having welcomed the report and all the effort that has obviously gone into producing it over two parliaments—I want to condemn the government for having politicised the committee system. We currently have before the House several committee inquiries which are heavily politicised in nature. My own committee at the moment is doing an inquiry into cost shifting to local government by state government. If that is not a political exercise, I am not quite sure what is. I would say that that is an abuse of the committee process. Also before the parliament at the moment we have an inquiry into the recent bushfires. Unfortunately this again is being used as a politicisation of the committee process. I think that detracts from and demeans the fundamentally good work that committees do.
The committee process raises us above the partisan bickering of the parliamentary executive government system. It says to the Australian public, `We as parliamentarians can actually get together and do something for the benefit of the community. We can leave aside political differences and actually say that there are community issues out there that we need to explore as a parliament, coming up with recommendations as a parliament that we can endorse.' Sadly, this report went off the rails at the end of the day—when it was being written and tabled.
A phenomenal amount of work went into receiving submissions and hearing from an absolutely broad brush range of individuals—from, on one end of the scale, people who are involved in harm minimisations or who are in Sydney trialling the heroin injection rooms to, on the other end of the scale, Fred Nile and the Festival of Light. All these people came together to present their viewpoints. Instead of distilling down those viewpoints and saying, `Here's an evidence based approach to this serious health crisis'—not somehow a moral crisis but a serious health crisis—`and a well researched report,' we had to go down the route of coming up with a politicised report; we had to go down the route of coming up with politicised recommendations.
There are 128 recommendations in this report. Some of them are fairly worthy and some of them are well researched. But, sadly, they have all been tainted by a political bias—an approach that says, `We can achieve abstinence; we can have abstinence; we will achieve a drug-free society.' I am not sure what fairies are at the bottom of your garden, but we have never had a drug-free society. We are never going to have a drug-free society. There have always been drugs in our community. Depending on what your drug of choice is, there will always be drugs in our society, because people will always abuse alcohol. 
Alcohol and tobacco abuse create some of the highest imposts upon our health care system. Still today it is tobacco abuse that causes more trouble and more cost within the health care system than any other single thing. It outrates obesity, heart disease and everything—because it causes all those things. So to sit here and say, `We are never going to have drugs, we are all going to be abstinent and all we have to do is to have parents talk to their kids,' is a joke. It is demeaning the good work that is actually going on in our community now, because it somehow says to a whole lot of parents, `Because you didn't talk to your kids right, they've become drug addicts.' I certainly know a lot of people who have family members who are drug addicts, sadly. In the area of Box Hill in my seat of Chisholm there is a prevalence of drug abuse and in my day-to-day working life I come into contact with a lot of families who have children who are dependent upon drugs. They are not bad parents. They did not fail their children. They did not fall over at some point along the way. But something happened in those children's lives and they have become addicted to drugs.
It is a health issue. It is a not a moral issue; it is a health crisis. It is an addiction; it is not some moral failure of the individual or their family that they have ended up that way. I think one of the things that this report ignores is the question of why people turn to drugs. We as a society have failed to address those systemic issues that lead somebody to say, `Life is so bad—there is no hope and I am going to turn to drugs to sustain myself.' There is a bit of a discussion about mental health but it does not sufficiently go into whether people are using drugs as a form of self-medication because there is already an underlying mental health problem or whether the drug use has created the mental health problem. Again I would say there is a bit of a political bias in how those conclusions have been reached. If we can give our young people jobs and self-esteem, they will be far more likely to stay out of the mix of drugs. That has been proven but it is not something the report goes into.
I think one of the most alarming things about this report, though, is that out of the 128 recommendations it makes there are only four that talk about hepatitis C. At the moment we have a hepatitis C epidemic in this country. Hepatitis C is linked most heavily to intravenous drug users. The Prime Minister and his health minister have been sitting on a report that they received last November that indicated that their Tough on Drugs policy was causing—it was the link to—a hepatitis C epidemic. They had that report. They have only released it in the last couple of weeks, and the health minister has graciously said that she will give us a response in June. That is fantastic. We have got this road to recovery report, which, in relation to a major epidemic in our society—hepatitis C—has four recommendations. They are actually not bad recommendations but they certainly do not go far enough.
By the end of the report, we get down to the most damning corruption and politicisation of this report: we have decided that harm minimisation has to be dumped. I love the semantics of it all: it says we have to go away from harm minimisation to harm prevention. This will only add to the hepatitis C epidemic we are currently experiencing. The report, which also gives great credence to the government's current Tough on Drugs stance and its law enforcement, again fails to mention that we have had a heroin drought for the last two years.
I will be quite frank: I have not read the whole report—I will be honest. I have read great chunks of it, but I have not read the whole lot. I apologise. If anybody gets to read everything that comes across their desk in this place, I reckon they should get the gold elephant stamp of the year! But the thing that did alarm me in the report is that there is not a great deal of mention of the abuse of prescription drugs. There has been a huge escalation in the abuse of over the counter prescription drugs. These are drugs you can get quite easily from your doctor. There is a range of benzodiazepines—that is, Valium and Serepax. They are very easily obtainable from doctors and they are currently being severely abused. There is very little mention also of the alarming rise in amphetamine use. That is a serious area of great risk in this community, because you and I can go down to the local shop, buy a whole lot of chemicals, mix them together and start selling those sorts of drugs on the street. 
On one level, while the report canvasses a range of things, there are glaring absences in what it could do. I want to concentrate on hepatitis C, because I think it is an area that people are ignoring and it is alarmingly dangerous to our community. The rise in estimated hepatitis C infections from 11,000 in 1997 to 16,000 in 2001 shows that hepatitis C infections continue to increase. The report that the government is sitting on says that a range of innovative strategies needs to be introduced if we are to reduce this level of infection. Needle and syringe programs have succeeded in slowing infections, but we need to build on that success. We need targeted prevention strategies for young people—particularly young people who inject or are at risk of injecting—before they become infected with hepatitis C. The introduction of some prevention strategies will require political courage. If this courage is not shown, hepatitis C infections will continue to increase. Clear and unambiguous support of harm reduction intervention is the key to reducing hepatitis C infection.
The review of the national strategy notes that the uptake of hepatitis C treatments is extremely low. Approximately one per cent of people with hep C have ever accessed treatment. Access to treatment is a key issue for people with hepatitis C. Factors that contribute to that are the strict eligibility criteria; the restriction of being able to access treatment only through liver clinics and major hospitals; the experience of discrimination in health care settings; social and economic issues such as homelessness, poverty, unemployment and lack of social support; and side effects. The review of the national strategy found that the strategy has not achieved its objective of increasing access to the full range of treatment and care services for people with hepatitis C. Pegylated interferon, in combination with ribavirin, is best practice treatment and is available in countries such as the US, the UK and Canada but is not yet available for hepatitis C treatment in Australia.
A partnership approach to hepatitis C is stated as being a key aspect of the national response. The partnership operates on many levels, although at a national level it operates through the National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases. The review of the strategy says that the existing ministerial advisory structure reinforces hepatitis C as the poor cousin of HIV. But there are far more people with hepatitis C than there are with HIV. The council is currently convened until 30 June 2003, and there has been no indication of a replacement structure. Each month, 13,000 people become infected with hepatitis C, and we have no partnership forum. The new ministerial advisory structure needs to address the concerns in the review of the national strategy and needs a clear mandate to advise the minister on issues relating to the hepatitis C epidemic. The partnership approach established by the National Hepatitis C Strategy has worked well, and all parties remain committed to it. However, we need specific funding for the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Strategy, not more talk. 
The community sector is underfunded, yet it continues to carry the burden of the treatment, care, and support needs of people with hepatitis C, and the discrimination against these people. Funding for organisations such as the Australian Hepatitis C Council has remained static for the past four years and in real terms has decreased. State governments need to ensure the development, implementation and funding of strategies to reduce the impact of hepatitis C within their jurisdictions. The report, entitled Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, which the government has, quite clearly states that there is a major need for reform and a major need to go forward in this crisis. Out of 128 recommendations in the report, four are about hepatitis C and none of them address the issues in the report that the Minister for Health and Ageing commissioned herself. This report stands condemned for that glaring neglect alone.
The other area I want to talk about—and I hesitate to use the term—is the `ageist' debate about the use or non-use of naltrexone. The idea seems to be that the miracle cure, naltrexone, is going to help you. You will go on a rapid detox then walk out as a drug-free person and go back to a fantastically normal life. It does not work. It has been demonstrated not to work. Naltrexone only works for those people who are ready for it to work for them. No one program alone works unless the person is ready for that addiction to be cured. Detox is only the beginning. The biggest problem is then to get people back into a structured life so that they can leave their drug related life.
You get caught up in it. You get caught up in chasing money, chasing the dragon, getting a score, getting a hit and going this way. Yes, it may sound nice for parents to have a drug-free kid, but if that drug-free kid suddenly goes and scores again after being on naltrexone, that kid will die. It has been proven time and time again that the body cannot cope with a hit again so soon after being on the naltrexone program. I am not sure whether anybody has ever seen people withdraw from methadone, but it is actually scarier than seeing someone withdraw from heroin. It is a fairly violent thing. Methadone is a maintenance program and that is what it has always been; however, some people may need to be maintained for life. If alcoholics who join AA do not turn up to the meetings each month, they will probably go back to drinking. There is no one quick fix. If the government thinks it can say, `Just say no,' and be tough on drugs and take a zero tolerance approach, it is kidding itself and destroying our society. It is not putting the money where it should be put. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,36,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I commend my colleagues on their contributions to this debate. It is absolutely vital that we disentangle the good from the bad in the Road to recovery report. There is much that builds on the previous work of this parliament and on previous government programs. Some of the recommendations that go to matters such as continuing evidence based responses are valuable. Regrettably there appears to be a dissonance between what is recommended in the report, which is to proceed on an evidence based approach to drug law programs and to drug strategy, and a recommendation that we should substitute harm prevention for harm minimisation and have, as the last contributor said, the language of, `Just say no.' It is impossible to align those two contradictory elements of a single report.
Let us consider an example of where harm minimisation has been particularly effective in Australia, and that is in our response to the AIDS epidemic. Australia is probably the leading country globally in terms of the success of its response on a government level. When the epidemic first presented itself in Australia, the then government had possible options in front of it. Like a number of other countries, it could have turned a blind eye and buried its head in the sand in response to a growing medical problem. As a number of other countries have done, it could have tried to change people's behaviours to `just say no' to male-to-male sex and to intravenous drug use. It could have advocated that as the government's response. The countries that did that have had blow-outs in HIV infection rates and they have failed to communicate effectively to those in the at-risk groups. They have proved completely unable to put in place programs that are effective in reducing the harm that goes with AIDS. 
By contrast, Australia did something quite brave. It recognised that there were people in the community who practised male-to-male sex, and it recognised that there were people in the community who were IV drug users. It spoke directly to those people and to the Australian community. It used simple language and simple methods of communication, and it involved leading Australians in a communications strategy that was blunt but also well focused and well directed. It urged people in those at-risk categories not to abstain, not to `just say no'—recognising that that was an unrealistic prospect—but to change the manner of their behaviour so that they would not subject themselves to infection. Thus, where male-to-male sex or other sexual conduct between multiple partners was involved, recommendations to use condoms were put forward. In instances where people were using intravenous drugs, there were recommendations on how to ensure that you never used the same needle and that blood products were not transferred. If you only had one needle and needed to share it, there were recommendations on how to disinfect it through bleaching and various other methods so that it could not transmit HIV. As a result, we have had the world's lowest rate of infection.
What we learnt from that was that you can have a program which speaks directly to those who choose certain forms of behaviour which we as a mainstream society may either regard with tolerance or oppose but which we still recognise as existing within our ranks. IV drug use has never been approved of in this society, but the campaign was very explicit in that it recognised that, because there were people who were IV drug users, you had to speak to them directly about their manner of administration. So it did apply a harm minimisation strategy, not a harm prevention strategy. We did not pursue a `just say no' strategy, knowing that that would have been ineffective in reducing the rate of infections in the community and would not have had the desired health and social outcomes.
By contrast, we are now seeing real blow-outs in various blood-borne diseases—we have just had a very powerful contribution about forms of hepatitis and the very substantial rates of increase—because we have shifted some of the rhetoric and the approach subtly and slowly over time away from harm minimisation to the `just say no' or the `war on drugs' approach or an approach which essentially marginalises those whom we really need to communicate with. You cannot expect to have effective communication with people in high-risk groups unless you have an honest mode of communication and do not treat them in a way which forces them into further marginalisation. 
Unfortunately, despite the focus of this report on one level—and on saying that our responses need to be evidence based—what we are actually seeing is the triumph of an underlying ideological framework which is based on prohibition, abstinence and the idea that, at the end of the day, success can only be measured if you persuade or compel people never to take drugs. Of course, when societies have sought to do this they have always failed. The most illuminating example is Prohibition in the United States. There, the forces in the community that had seen drink as an evil to be suppressed eventually triumphed and, through legislation which was ultimately passed in a majority of the states of the United States, a constitutional amendment was effected which saw alcohol prohibited. The natural consequence of that was that, instead of the harm being suppressed, the harm was intensified.  
The harm was intensified for two reasons. Firstly, it was because the trade fell into the hands of those who could make substantial profits by reason of the market being left to only those who were prepared to take the risk of criminal behaviour—that is, the market became a criminal market with very high profits. This created the crime wave that infected the United States and it led to the growth of organised crime in that country. Secondly, it was because the things people were drinking became dangerous. When alcohol was unavailable and was not sold in a transparent, safe way, people were producing wood alcohol and various other forms of alcohol that actually caused death. So not only did it create a damaged society, it also produced deaths. Alcohol produced more deaths, directly because of that consequence. Are we to follow that kind of stupidity in this country? Are we to follow down the US path again? Almost everywhere around the world there are growing strands of approaches coming together along the harm minimisation stream. The path that Australia led on in our response to AIDS is being picked up in different ways in drug strategies all around the world.
Recently I travelled to Europe, and I went to Spain and Portugal where there are some very innovative approaches where personal possession of small amounts of drugs is not treated as an offence at all. I went to the Netherlands where there is a system of tolerated availability of cannabis. I have recently seen reports out of Canada, recommending a similar approach in that country. I have seen recent parliamentary reports from New Zealand, again recommending a re-examination of legislative approaches to drug laws in that country, particularly around cannabis. The whole drift of policy in Europe is very much towards the Spanish and Portuguese framework. By contrast, we seem to be drifting much more to the United States model.
Whilst there is much in the United States that I admire, one of the things that I find impossible to swallow is the way in which they deal with drugs. They have something in the order of a million Americans in jail for drug offences—exclusively for drug offences. Most of those people of course are black and poor. Does that mean that there is not widespread drug use in the United States amongst white middle-class kids? Of course not—they just do not get prosecuted and put in jail. Law enforcement tends to focus on those who are lower down the food chain. Does it mean that the United States is a place where harm prevention has actually succeeded? Of course it does not. Drugs are more available in that country than they are in the main streets of most of our cities—perhaps with the exception of a couple of our major cities. Does it mean that the United States has found some way of rehabilitating people who have serious drug dependency problems? Of course not. Notwithstanding all the drug courts, notwithstanding all the money, notwithstanding all the social, political and legal pressure and the policing and the like, the United States has no answers.
In this country we actually do have answers. We have better answers. Our programs are more effective, not just in relation to the AIDS strategy but also in relation to our approach towards warning regimes for minor drug use—for example, some of the strategies that have been developed in states like South Australia and the ACT, which deal with providing warnings for possession of small amounts and small numbers of cannabis plants. All these things suggest that there are smarter, more intelligent and less socially destructive ways of doing our business. We do not want to fall backwards into failed strategies. 
I want to conclude with a couple of specific comments about the so-called heroin drought. I think there is no doubt that many of the claimed reductions do relate to the reduced availability of heroin over the last couple of years. The problem if a government chooses to claim credit for that is the same as the problem you have if you claim the credit for a good summer—you are likely to be blamed for a bad winter. We are now seeing the end of the heroin drought. Recently I received a briefing regarding the successes of the injecting room in Sydney. It was quite illuminating to see that over a period of time patterns of drug use have changed substantially. When there was a heroin drought, there was a predominance of or growth in the use of cocaine and other injectable substances of that kind. That has changed. Drugs are now freely available in Sydney again—perhaps not to respectable citizens such as yourself, Madam Deputy Chair Corcoran—and I am certain that if you walked through the streets of any major city and sought heroin you could find it now. The heroin drought, I am told, is over.
That will mean that there will be a lot more convictions and statistics will start to change. Does that mean that law enforcement is failing? Of course it doesn't. It did not mean that law enforcement was solving the problem before and it does not mean that it is failing now. But a government that has claimed credit, on the basis that the lack of availability of heroin over the last couple of years was due to law enforcement, is going to get punished in the future, because these drugs are now readily available.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Before I get into the substance of what I want to say, I would just like to compliment the member for Denison on what he has had to say in this place. He is very accurate in his assessment of treatment and the needs of people who are drug dependent. As time caught up with him, he was very specifically accurate in the sorts of things that he said about law enforcement and the reduced availability of heroin. This government and this committee, in my view, made a major blue when they started to take credit for what they saw as a reduction in the use of heroin.
There were a lot of reasons for that reduction, but if a government takes credit for a situation that occurs simply as a result of reduced availability—if it goes to the public, thumps its chest and says, `Look how successful we've been'—it is committing the community and itself to the creation of greater problems through false claims of success. We have to look at policies that address substance abuse at its worst—because that is always the bottom of the trough or the pit, and that is where needs are greatest—rather than simply thumping our chests and claiming that things like zero tolerance are the answer. They are not. Indeed, one of the things that this committee found out is that there is no such thing as one simple answer. A range of answers, responses and policies are required to address the issue of substance abuse, particularly when the heroin availability flow begins again, as it apparently has.
I must say that I was one of those who fought strongly for the establishment of this reference. In the early stages, when it was first raised, one of the reasons I raised the need for us to have a look at these areas was the number of parents, carers and grandparents that were coming to my office and telling me that they had just discovered that their son or daughter or another loved one within the family was caught up in substance abuse. They would say, `We don't know who to turn to or where to go.' Indeed, in looking to give them advice, I found that there were many gaps in the services, advice, support and assistance available to these families. In talking to others amongst my colleagues in this federal scene, I found that we all shared the same sort of experience. 
There was very strong support for this reference from both sides of the political spectrum. I remember Brendan Nelson, for instance, being very angry at the fact that the previous minister for health had refused our reference in this area. He, I and others insisted that we send the matter back to the minister because we believed that it needed to be addressed by our committee. I must say that, in the end, the minister saw good sense, saw the need and, I think, saw that the committee could go out and do some good work in the community in addressing this very vexatious issue. 
That first committee worked very well. Under the chairmanship of the member for Grey, Barry Wakelin, we met a lot of people, we covered a lot of ground and we listened to a lot of heart-wrenching stories from parents, grandparents and carers, and from family members who had seen their loved ones die or suffer or indeed seen their families ripped apart as a result of substance abuse and the lies, the distress and the trauma that go hand-in-hand with it. In my view, that committee worked very well, on a balanced and bipartisan basis, as we endeavoured to come to grips with what was basically an emerging story of horror. It did not matter where we went or what part of Australia we were in, the stories and the depth of the problems were the same. That gave us a measure of what we were up against and it gave us a challenge that we were able to pull together and work together on.
Unfortunately that all changed with the election and this parliament coming in, and there was a change in the people who came onto the committee. As far as I am concerned, the conservatives who came onto the committee came onto it with a narrow political focus, with predetermined outcomes and with an arrogant and belligerent attitude. They made the task of the committee difficult. At times it was impossible for the chair to hide her exasperation at what I saw as offensive and loutish behaviour by people whose only response to this massive problem was to cry that the answer was zero tolerance. Of course that is rubbish. I compliment Julia Irwin, the deputy chair of the committee, on her work and on the way in which she persevered in the face of a number of personal attacks by those opposite who should have been, but were not, part of an attempt to find a bipartisan answer to this incredible problem which confronts Australians, particularly young Australians.
The member for Grey said that he felt this report would challenge people. To some degree he is right but, unfortunately, in the main this report will not challenge people as much as it will categorise them; nor will it challenge people as much as it will marginalise them. That is a sad outcome from a report which could have been well and truly worth while. I look at the years of work and the amount of time that was put into it and I am very disappointed with the outcome. I am disappointed not just with the outcome but also with the way in which the importance of the committee system has been diminished. I like to think that members of committees should have independent approaches and independent attitudes to committees. I hate to think that committees are going to be dominated by the executive in the future as this committee has been, and dominated in the way in which the parliament has become dominated by the executive. If those opposite are prepared to let that happen, in my view the parliament, the committee system and we as members are diminished in our capacity to independently, vigorously and intellectually go about resolving some of the issues that we put a lot of work into as committee members. That is the disappointing side of the report. 
We put in a dissenting report, and I am pleased that we did. When I look at the response to this report from important organisations in our community and when I talk to some of the people who are involved in trying to address the issues of substance abuse in Australia and see their disappointment, I am pleased that I was part of a dissenting report. I will quote, for instance, what the AMA had to say about our report. Under the heading `AMA challenges substance abuse report's illicit drugs recommendations' they had this to say:
“According to ADCA (Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia) methadone maintenance treatment has been clearly demonstrated to reduce illicit opiate use. It has been more successful than other options including: no-treatment; drug-free treatment; placebo medication; or detoxification in clinically controlled trials. It is the most cost-effective treatment for opioid dependence available in Australia.
“The Report focuses strongly on abstinence. Evidence shows this is not a reasonable outcome for conditions like opioid dependency, which tend to follow a chronic relapse pattern. 
“The AMA supports the discussion of abstinence within the spectrum of treatment options.
“The report seems to replace harm minimisation with harm prevention but there is little explanation as to what is meant by this change in direction. 
“The AMA is concerned that this change in direction is a push towards the concept of zero tolerance.
“The public health implications of such a dramatic shift in national policy would be catastrophic.  
“Under this philosophy we will see ... the spread of blood borne diseases and an increase in drug related crime and drug related deaths. 
“Zero tolerance or it neo-euphemism “harm prevention” is something the AMA believes the Australian community should be very wary of embracing as the sole answer to illicit drug use in the community. 
“The zero tolerance option will never be the panacea for all the community's drug problems,” Dr Yong said. 
Dr Yong is a psychiatrist who specialises in adolescent health issues.
I thought it was worth recording what the AMA, through Dr Yong, had to say. Just as the community should be wary of adopting zero tolerance as the answer to substance abuse, so too should those in the community who have an interest in this whole issue be wary of adopting this report as a panacea.
If nothing else, I hope that the report will at least create and generate some discussion within the community. There are a number of recommendations which we agreed on and which others, like the AMA, support. I hope that this committee report will find some value in some sections of the community, but my fear is that this report will quickly drop into obscurity—that is probably where it belongs. It is a disappointment. I am sorry that we could not give leadership to the people who looked to us for some greater leadership, and I am sorry that we could not use the opportunities that we had to perhaps better pave the way in the future for us as a community to address the issues in a way which comes up with a range of options, not just one narrow political focus of zero tolerance as the answer to all of the issues.
In conclusion, I want to say that I take a strong interest in these issues. I am the patron of a group in Perth called Cyrenian House who do tremendous work in providing support to drug dependent people. They have some live-in programs and they have extended programs. They do tremendous work. Over the last few years, I have come to admire the tremendous commitment of some of the people in the non-government area who work in these areas to provide support, sustenance and advice, and who nurture not just those who have become involved in the issues of substance abuse but also their families who often feel deserted and do not know who to turn to or where to go. The non-government sector in this nation does a tremendously valuable job as they work with people who have become caught up in substance abuse. I pay them a great deal of respect in terms of the work they do. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,36,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the report, Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. I am pleased to follow the member for Cowan who, as a member of the committee, had a great insight into the submissions and the general approach that the committee took. I was very interested in his comments.
I would like to relate a rather sad story about a family who used to live in my electorate, and I do so under the section of the report entitled `Strengthening families and communities'. I make these comments as a backdrop to my general comments on the report. For the information of the House, the letter I will refer to relates to a mother who lost her son through a drug overdose. She wrote to me in 2001, possibly only a couple of weeks after her son died. As I was touched by this letter, I put it aside to use it at an appropriate time. In view of the committee's inquiry, I think this is the appropriate time to refer to her letter. I rang the woman at the time and I spoke to her yesterday to tell her what I intended to do. She indicated that she fully supports my intention to refer to her correspondence.
The story is that on 20 December 1999 Gail's son Brett told his mother that he was using drugs, mainly speed, and that he wanted to stop. His mother indicated that she would support her son's attempt to kick the drug habit. Brett went to live with his mother for a short while and then went off to live with his girlfriend. On Brett's birthday on 20 July 2000, his mother called in to see him but was so shocked and upset by his condition that she was unable to speak to him. She called again a few days later and just sat and talked about drug addiction and what it was doing to her son. Brett said to his mother, `Don't worry, mum, we will go and find out about rehabilitation.' Brett was sent to a specialty clinic and was advised about the great methadone program that was available. There was counselling each week at the clinic and blood and urine samples were taken to make sure no other drugs were used during the rehabilitation course. The doctor advised Brett that each week the amount of methadone would go down so that eventually he would not require any more and would be drug free. This advice sounded great so both Brett and his mother agreed that the methadone program would get him off drugs. Each week when he went to see his doctor, no counselling took place, there were no check-ups and no urine or blood samples were taken. Brett was simply given a prescription for methadone to be taken to a clinic to get his dose. Brett was never examined or counselled. His mother considered that this particular doctor and this part of the methadone program was a failure. While Brett was on methadone he got into trouble through shoplifting and in a two-week period was arrested five times on 17 charges. 
Brett's mother said that she witnessed the selling of drugs near both the doctor's surgery and the methadone clinic. Brett was on the methadone program for three months. He begged his mother to find a place that could help him. His mother phoned all the rehab places, counsellors and doctors, but no-one could help because he was on methadone and would have to get his dose down first. After five months of phone calls and rejections Brett's mother finally found a doctor who could help. An appointment was made and the doctor agreed that Brett was a good candidate for rapid detox, but he would have to get off methadone and back onto heroin for three weeks before detox could start. The cost was $2,700, which his mother was quite happy to pay. Brett went down to get his last dose of methadone and told them that this was his last dose as he was going into detox. The nurse at the clinic said, `You'll be back.' 
Everything went well leading to the detox. Brett was on morphine tablets for three weeks, but his mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On 1 March 2001 detox commenced. It was the worst thing Brett's mother had ever had to do, watching him go into withdrawal while he slept, taking him to the toilet and bathing him. Brett was put on half a tablet a day of naltrexone, and he had weekly visits to the doctor for a check-up and counselling. His mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On 2 May, Brett's mother received a phone call from his girlfriend to say that he was acting strangely and had disappeared. After a number of frantic phone calls Brett's mother received the call she had dreaded, a phone call that will no doubt live in her memory forever. Her 20-year-old son, who had not touched drugs for three months, was dead. Brett's mother blamed a lot of people, including herself, but she mainly blamed the system. In her view, methadone was a nail in his coffin. In her letter to me she said:
I have read the book that the government has issued and found it to be totally untrue, written by people who have not been there, they say the methadone program is great for rehab, this is a lie, they say the naltrexone is free, this is a lie.
She continued:
Why my son started taking drugs and why he took this last shot that killed him no one knows except for Brett. I will forever ask the question WHY? 
The reason for my letter is for the government to listen to people who have gone through this heartache and to spend more time, money and effort on rehabilitation. 
That is her message. I am sure that many members have heard this tale in some form or other from broken parents and grieving loved ones in their own electorates. I am also sure that members of the committee who sat through the many hearings and read the hundreds of submissions that they received have heard similar tales of distress and heartbreak. 
This is an important report about an incredibly important subject. There are many reasons why people become addicted to drugs, and therefore many solutions are required to solve the problems associated with drug addiction. There is no magic bullet, no single cure. Methadone works for some but it does not work for all. It did not work for Brett. Similarly, naltrexone is a really good treatment for those it works for, but for others it simply does not work and alternatives must be found. The next wonder drug to be invented will be really good for helping some addicts, while it too will not work for others. What is needed above all else in this field are options. The more options available to addicts and to their families, the more people will be saved. Options do not come cheap. The constant investigation into new treatment and new programs will be expensive. Many people who advocate a zero tolerance approach will be unhappy with whatever trials take place and whatever programs are funded, but we must not be deterred by these nay-sayers. 
Drug addiction must be treated as a health issue as much as a law and order issue, simply because to do otherwise would be to fly in the face of reality. Drug addiction is a health problem. Study after study and medical expert after medical expert tell us this, yet for some the information does not sink in and they wish only to punish addicts not treat them. Some people say, `Just say no and everything will be all right.' Unfortunately it does not work that way. We must have programs in place to treat those on drugs.  
The hardest thing in many cases is not simply getting somebody off drugs but keeping them alive long enough for them to want to give up drugs. That is the nature of addiction. Unless somebody wants to get off drugs, then the chances of them achieving this are minimal. There is a cycle associated with addiction. How many times have you heard that a friend, neighbour or family member has given up cigarettes at least five times in the past couple of years? They have tried patches, gum or cold turkey, but they are smoking again. Hard drugs are exactly the same. Unless the mind is in the right frame, regression will occur and the addiction will not be conquered.
I am concerned by this report's preoccupation with the new phrase `harm prevention' as opposed to the current terminology `harm minimisation'. It might not sound like much, but it does signal a shift in policy away from the sorts of programs designed to keep addicts alive long enough for them to want to kick the habit. An example of this is that the report is opposed to any extension of the heroin injection room trial that is currently taking place in New South Wales. I would be hesitant to support such a recommendation, not because I necessarily agree with heroin injection rooms but because I believe in options being available. I believe in studies being done to see what works and what does not. The heroin injection room may work for some and, if it keeps someone alive, it is a positive outcome and should be considered.
As I said, there is no single solution. We need to be taking note of studies and trials being done overseas and we need to be conducting studies and trials of our own. What works in Sydney may not work in Brisbane or in country Australia, but then again it may. We must keep our minds open. To quote Henry Miller:
Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. 
We must keep an open mind. We have to address the underlying social issues that lead to drug taking. We have to tackle the issues of poverty, broken homes, unemployment and crime. Not only that, but we must also tackle problems such as corporate stress and job insecurity, which lead to people who are not otherwise socially or economically disadvantaged taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
As I have said, there are an indefinite number of reasons why somebody takes drugs or commits a crime to support their habit. The mistake is in assuming that only the socially disadvantaged are drug addicts. This is an issue that affects all levels of our society, and the people who pay the ultimate price are the families who have to live with the aftermath. This is an important report and it is detailed and well considered, but it cannot be allowed to be the end. It must be a step on the road, because there will always be other things that we can do.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,36,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I am delighted to be able to speak on Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. Having spent three years travelling the length and breadth of Australia during the committee inquiry, it is very difficult for me to try and do this report justice in less than 15 minutes. Road to recovery is an apt title, as the honourable member for Grey said. Those of us who have been on this committee inquiry over two parliaments have wandered down this road and, as we have wandered, we have realised that this is an issue that is so complicated for many people in our society. Many of the committee members have had first-hand experience of these issues. Others have had no experience apart from the constituents who rock up to their offices and present them with a problem. I am proud to have been involved in this committee inquiry from day one, and I can tell you it has been a traumatic but very revealing and rewarding experience for me as a human being. Hopefully I can and will contribute to the betterment of many Australians by trying to implement many of the recommendations of this report. 
It is a good report in that it provides all Australians with a snapshot of what is happening in this area. It is an area that, unless we are intimately involved with it, we do not want to know about and do not want to get involved in. It is a bit like cancer and AIDS: if it does not affect us, it is all too hard. It is out there and as long as it does not come to our neck of the woods we do not want to know about it. As I said in my five-minute statement when this report was introduced into the House, substance abuse has no respect for people, families or social status. It can strike anywhere and at any time. As I said at that time: there but for the grace of God go I. I do not know why my two daughters never took it up—I am glad they did not—but I have seen lots of young people battling addiction, whether to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs.
It really disappoints me that there are some skewed, politically driven recommendations in this report. We worked tirelessly for three years to come up with a report that, if people read it, will give a great snapshot of what is happening in Australia. That snapshot says that there are huge social costs to Australians who abuse legal and illegal drugs. Collins and Lapsley's report from 1998-99 said that this cost is $34.4 billion. That is a huge amount of money. Of that, 61.2 per cent is due to tobacco, 22 per cent is due to alcohol and 17.6 per cent is due to illicit drugs. The report said that the highest tangible costs associated with the misuse of drugs were borne in the home—$7.6 billion—followed by the workplace, with $5.5 billion. Costs relating to crime were $4.3 billion. Road accident costs were $2.3 billion and health care costs were $1.4 billion. We are talking about huge amounts of money.
In the brief time available to me in this debate, I want to give a small snapshot of some of the areas that I am interested in. One issue that is close to my heart is the way that schools deal with substance abuse. Lots of antisocial behaviour is manifest in schools. As a teacher I witnessed that over 23 years. But it bears a relationship not to the school but to the whole society. Recommendations 4 to 8 of the committee's report encourage state and Commonwealth government departments and agencies not only to put in place a school structure where teachers are trained in counselling and strategic options for children who are at risk but also to expand that into the community, so that everybody in the community is involved when kids break the rules, fall over and are in need of someone to pick them up.
A couple of weeks ago a young bloke—whom I will not name and who has a very close relationship with the family—was caught smoking marijuana in the school grounds. He was given 10 days. He was on his own, with no support. Not only was he at risk but the family was under stress. Where do you go? Recommendations 4 to 8, if implemented—and I hope and pray they will be—will address one of those areas. We are forming young people's opinion of where they fit into society, and they do take up this challenge. I think most of us in our teenage years enter that dangerous period when we take up the peer group challenge and smoke this, try that and pop this pill. Most of us grow out of it, but there is that small group of people that become addicted. Having a community response, as the committee recommends, will go a long way to addressing that issue.
One of the things that impacted on me was hearing evidence over the three years of the impact on families. I would like to thank publicly all the families who have come before us. There were parents who said, `I had to go and buy heroin for my daughter and my son because I did not want them to prostitute themselves for the cost of a fix of heroin.' We have been to jails and we have seen the tragedy there. We have seen young homeless people in Melbourne and Sydney who are destitute and at a loss as to where to go. We have also seen wonderful places such as the Woolshed in South Australia, which is involved in detox and rehabilitation. It is not funded by any government agency. It is out there in the public domain, asking for public support and doing a fantastic job. We have been to Odyssey House to see the wonderful work there. 
As I have said before, this is a very complex issue. It not only affects us white Anglo-Saxons but also is having an enormous impact on our Indigenous population. In the grievance debate in the House on Monday I spoke about its impact on Mornington Island. I have visited hundreds of Aboriginal communities and seen the impact of legal and illegal drugs. In recommendations 27, 28 and 29 we have come up with workable, bipartisan solutions, if implemented. If we are not cost-sharing and duckshoving and we have cooperation between all tiers of government we can address some of these things.
It is interesting that, by the time you finalise the report, get it printed and introduce it into the parliament, some governments have thought beyond the square. I publicly congratulate the Victorian government on taking the lead in lots of issues to do with substance abuse for a long time. They were the first to introduce the 0.05 blood alcohol limit and random breath tests, and the rest of the states were dragged kicking and screaming after them, so that we now have a national approach. In a news statement on 14 September Andre Haermeyer, the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services announced:
Victoria could be the first jurisdiction in the world to conduct random roadside drug testing ... 
This testing may begin by mid-2004. The news release went on to state:
`Victoria Police is considering this device for roadside drug testing. It has the capacity to test for as many as 15 drugs, including cannabis and methamphetamines.'
The testing device has a disposable test cartridge ... which will evaluate a saliva sample for the presence of drugs.
Drivers will be asked to chew on the test cartridge for one to three minutes to generate saliva to be analysed.
In our reports we suggested that that be done nationally—not just state by state with a rail gauge by rail gauge mentality. I congratulate Mr Haermeyer, who also said:
... almost 30 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents tested positive to some level of drugs other than alcohol. Last year, 211 drivers tested positive to drugs under the existing drug impairment-testing regime introduced by the Government in 2000. 
That regime needs to be implemented straightaway. I think it can be, and, hopefully, it will be.
This is a good report but it has some weaknesses, and those weaknesses are principally the result of its having been driven by a particular ideological angle. Whilst I respect Major Brian Watters and his role as the Prime Minister's head man on this issue, I do not believe that his blinkered view of life—where you can say no—will work for everybody. It is totally unrealistic. We are human beings with many foibles and weaknesses. We—as a society and as members of parliament—must put in place a whole range of regimes, treatment programs and options, because no one person fits just one solution to this problem. 
I have been on this committee for 11 years, and the beauty of it is that it is a bipartisan committee and all the members work tirelessly. But unfortunately in this last report, Road to recovery, we had some dissenting reports. I can publicly say that I did not agree with all the dissentions and that I disagree with some of my Labor colleagues, but, hopefully, the government will see the need to have a holistic approach to this, rather than a narrow, blinkered approach. We have not had many of the 150 members speak on this. Hopefully, it will be on every member's shelf and they will all read it when they have the opportunity and encourage people in their communities to get copies not only from their local members but also from the Net. It is a good report. I am proud to be a contributor to it. I thank the House for the opportunity today to speak to it.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—While we have a long history of success with methadone maintenance treatment in our country, newer medications such as LAAM have to date only been trialled on a very small scale. We acknowledge that methadone programs are vitally important but we also draw attention to what has been described as the problem of `parking' on methadone maintenance and how we as a society might better deal with that issue. You will see in the body of the report that reference is made to this issue by people who have been on such programs for considerable periods of time.
The committee also dealt with another pharmacotherapy—namely, naltrexone—which, unlike other treatments for heroine addiction, is not itself an opioid substitute. While mindful of some of the potential risks associated with the use of naltrexone, the evidence contained in our report suggests that it is an effective treatment when patients are carefully selected and extensive social support is provided. In that regard, I draw attention to the work being performed by Dr Currie in the public hospital system at Westmead Hospital. His efforts are to be commended, and it will be interesting for all of us to follow the outcome of his work. I want to reiterate, though, that naltrexone is not a magic bullet. It should be seen as but one of the many forms of treatment for opioid dependency.
I am concerned that to date little is known about treatment for the misuse of psychostimulants—the commonly known expression for them is `party drugs'—which are very easily sourced and, in my judgment, appear to be a major and growing problem among young people. Trials of pharmacological treatments for amphetamine dependence have shown little or no promise to date, and the same is true for cocaine. The committee recommends that more research and funding need to go into these areas. There is also a need to provide stricter regulation on the chemical precursors for these drugs, particularly pseudoephedrine. The growing importation of these chemical precursors was highlighted in recent days by the seizure of a huge amount of imported pseudoephedrine with an estimated street value of around $1 billion.
As part of our ongoing concern to minimise harm and to save lives, urgent attention needs to be given to the escalating incidence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users. The government's response in this area has been inadequate. We have not succeeded in controlling this epidemic and, on recent estimates, it appears that it is likely that half a million Australians will be affected by this debilitating virus by 2020. It is no wonder that the Minister for Health and Ageing is sitting on an independent report which analysed the issue and came to a conclusion about the inadequacy of the response to date on this critical issue. The committee makes several recommendations that I commend to the government.
The road to recovery for people dependent on licit and illicit substances will depend on a combination of strategies within a compassionate environment that recognises addiction as a medical condition which cannot be wished away. I support the idea that more resources need to go into prevention and treatment, particularly in areas such as those in my electorate, where the lack of access to detoxification and rehabilitation places is absolutely acute. We, as a parliament and a government, need to continue harm minimisation strategies. We do have a responsibility—understanding that you cannot wish away the problems that afflict people who are dependent on licit and illicit drugs—and a moral and compassionate obligation to continue those harm minimisation strategies that have saved lives and to continue to provide support to the wonderful organisations and staff who work in this critically important area.  
My work on the committee has provided me with a greater appreciation of the complexities of substance abuse in its many manifestations. It is regrettable, I guess, that the time constraint means that I have concentrated most of my attention on issues to do with opioid dependency. I think we as a community need to remember that alcohol is the most widely used substance. Fewer than one in four Australians now smoke and, according to the most recent studies, even fewer—one in six—had used illicit drugs. So there is some encouraging data which suggest that there has been a decline in the use of illicit drugs and that that decline was significant. But the data also suggest that alcohol consumption is on the increase. Of particular concern is the occurrence of binge drinking among youth. 
I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to work with them on this inquiry, and I also thank the staff who worked very diligently to provide the report, which has been three years in the making. I guess it is not surprising that, in an area as widespread and important as this, there are differences of opinion, and that has been reflected in the report. I conclude by reaffirming what I said in my concluding comments in the report: 
Finally, in supporting a greater emphasis on harm prevention and treatment, this does not equate to a strategy of zero tolerance. 
As I said before, we cannot wish these problems away and, in my understanding, where the zero tolerance strategy has been applied, it has not produced sustainable, long-term outcomes. Further:
Addiction is a medical condition. Dependence on licit and illicit substances is not something that can be wished away. As a society we have an obligation to provide the necessary support for people seeking to break their dependency, recognising that opioid dependency is a chronic, relapsing disease. In that process saving lives and minimising harm will continue to be part of an overall compassionate strategy. ",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be given the opportunity to talk about the Road to recovery report, the report of the inquiry by the Family and Community Affairs Standing Committee into substance abuse in the Australian community, specifically because in the 49th parliament I was a member of that committee under the chair of Mr Barry Wakelin. I was disappointed to see him lose the chairmanship of that committee, because he had a grasp of the issues and was working very cooperatively with the committee on that issue. There are a number of issues within that report that I would like to talk about, but time constraints restrict me from doing that. What I would like to do is take people back into history.
When I was elected to the New South Wales parliament in 1988, the needle and syringe exchange program—that is what it was called in those days—had been operating for about two or three years. It was operating in an environment where pharmacists were involved, and about 600 of them in New South Wales were involved in that program. At that time there were about 1.3 million needles and syringes being distributed and exchanged through that particular system. I think there was at that time an exchange rate of around 83 to 85 per cent.
It was a very good program because it allowed those in the community, from the police down, to have the responsible exchange of needles and syringes, rather than have them lie around in the community and create other dangers to people in the way of possible needle-stick injuries. But more importantly it gave the police an indication of where the people who were dependent on illicit drugs were in the community because there was a database set up by the Pharmaceutical Guild in pharmacies right throughout New South Wales. As a member of the Greiner government, I remember only too well the decision to move the needle and syringe exchange program into the public arena through the public health system in New South Wales. I opposed that at the time because I believed that we would lose control of it. 
I have considerable files—about four or five lever arch files—on drugs in the community that I have compiled over a 15-year period, but these are the only figures I have off the top of my head. When you look at the percentage of syringes that were distributed and exchanged in the way of fit packs from that period of time, you will see that in 1994-95 just over two million needles and syringes were distributed. Of those, about 972,798 syringes were received back. In the 1995-96 period, 1.9 million syringes were distributed and the exchange was in the vicinity of 1.2 million. The reason for the drop in the figures was that, following the decision by the then government to extrapolate the scheme out into the public sector through the hospital system, a number of pharmacists opted out of the system.
I must compliment every member of the committee for the very significant contribution they made to the report, not only as members of parliament but as people who have concerns about the issue of licit and illicit drugs in the community, despite the fact that some of them may have had, from time to time, alternative views on it. In the period from 1988 to the present day, I have seen the hospital system and the community health system run programs for the distribution of needles and syringes on a no-exchange basis, and I raised concerns in the community about young people having access to those distribution programs. They had access to these programs in an environment where the individuals working for the health system took it upon themselves, because of privacy rules, not to notify the parents that some of their children were in fact using illicit drugs. That was disturbing to me, to say the least.
In 1988 I predicted that the needle and syringe exchange program would blow out and become a needle and syringe distribution program, which is what it is commonly referred to as today. It went from 1.3 million needles in 1988 to over 13 million in the last financial year in New South Wales alone. That would indicate to me that it is indeed out of control. I also predicted in those early years that the incidence of hepatitis C would increase. I note that the member for Throsby made reference to hepatitis C and to the fact that 500,000 people are infected by it around Australia. 
The needle and syringe exchange program was introduced on the basis of it being an ideal way to control HIV and hepatitis C. The reality is that the thing that controlled HIV was the very sound safe sex program that I think was introduced by the Hawke government in the late 1980s or early 1990s. That was very effective in keeping HIV under control. It is interesting to note that the increase in hepatitis C, which is a disease that is transferred by blood-to-blood contact, is at the same proportionate level as the increase in needles and syringes being distributed in the community.
I am also very conscious of the methadone program, which was first introduced, from memory, in the late 1960s. It was introduced to a small group of people with a view to treating them with methadone, reducing the dosage and trying to wean them off the habit that they had. It has now become referred to as the `methadone maintenance program' and we distribute increasing doses to people to keep them on their addiction. That, to me, is deplorable. The reason I am making these comments is that, whilst the 128 recommendations in this report are very commendable and are trying to steer governments in the right direction in terms of control, in particular, and accountability for these programs that attract government funding, if history is to be repeated, the things that I feared in the late 1980s will continue into the future. 
I agree with the member for Throsby in her concerns about the lack of treatment services for people with addictions. On numerous occasions I—like many other members of parliament—have had constituents coming into my office with their children who were dealing in illicit drugs and wanting to get off them, and we could not get them any treatment at all. It was only through the assistance, on a number of occasions, of the Salvation Army that we were able to find some treatment processes for some of those children, because in many cases there was a six-month waiting list. I think that is one issue within the report that needs to be addressed aggressively by governments. If we are going to assist people with this health issue—and it is a health issue; I did not think so in the early stages, but I do now—we have to make sure that not only is there a very sound education process in terms of the dangers of using illicit drugs and, indeed, licit drugs, but that there are appropriate rehabilitation places so that people can go into at least a detox situation in a controlled environment.
In the last couple of days I have received a copy of a critical response to the Kings Cross injecting room, from Drug Free Australia. When I read it I thought it appropriate to make some comment about a couple of the recommendations in it which are very good and which touched me. Recommendation 7 in the report says:
We recognise the compassionate and effective treatment and rehabilitation, community support programs and social worker and outreach programs and place an increased emphasis on prevention of ongoing illicit drug use rather than blind tolerance of a crime and addiction cycle that is harmful for both the addict and the wider community. While we recognise the strong community support to `get people off drugs' it should also be acknowledged that the Australian people are very compassionate and take an open arms approach to helping people get back on their feet when they have demonstrated a willingness to do so. This should be a message strongly supported by government programs.
I know that is in the general thrust of the Road to recovery report.
Recommendation 8 in the report is headed, `Compassionate not commercial' and says:
It is also of great concern to us that current proposals calling for Injecting Centres in Redfern and the A.C.T. are being supported by outspoken pro drug groups on commercial grounds rather than on drug policy reasons aimed at helping people achieve a drug free outcome. We recommend strongly that commercialisation of substance abuse, addiction or human misery be rejected. Clearly while the operators of such facilities enjoy large contributions by sponsoring governments these funds are better used in treatment and rehabilitation services aimed at helping addicts achieve a drug free status.
That particular recommendation centres around another concern of mine in the 1980s, and that was that we were creating an industry and that that industry would grow and, to justify the continuance of government funding, the distribution of things like needles and syringes would expand and more and more people would be employed.
In the brief time I have left, I want to say that the issue of drugs in the community is not an easy one. As a member of parliament travelling excessive miles in rural and regional Australia I have personally been down the track of seeing drugs being distributed by bikie gangs. I was instrumental in sending off some intelligence reports to both the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police in the early 1990s about the involvement of police officers with rebel bikie gangs—particularly in the Young area, which is part of the electorate that I represent. That culminated in a sting operation in which a number of people in the police service were caught. 
I have to say that that was done at considerable pain and penalty to my family. A lot of people do not understand that when members of parliament take these issues on, rightly or wrongly, they are subjected to a significant amount of pressure. Due to my outspoken comments on the issue of drugs and their distribution, I have received death threats. My son has received death threats. My son was had a number of spurious charges made against him, because of my activity in the drug arena. That cost us about six or seven years of pain. I am still trying to get justice. Fortunately, at great expense to us, my son was proven innocent of the charges. That is just an indication of the sorts of things to which members of parliament are subjected. It is interesting to note that whilst the community want you to stand up and be outspoken and expose these issues, there are not too many people around supporting you when you need that support.
The issue of drugs is a very significant one. It has permeated right throughout society and everybody is affected by it. I close by making this point in support of what I have just said: I can go into my old home town of Cootamundra any day of the week, talk to people I know in the community and identify people who are openly distributing drugs in the community, yet the police have not shut them down. It just makes you wonder why that is occurring and what involvement some members of the New South Wales Police have in the dreadful industry that distributes illicit drugs to our community. I thank the parliament for the opportunity of saying those few words. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Unfortunately, at the outset, I would like to say that I am very disappointed in this report. It is a sad reflection on the majority of the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that, given the period of over three years since the committee first received the terms of reference about substance abuse and the wealth of evidence that it has received in response to both its initial inquiry in 2000 and its subsequent inquiry in 2002, it has come up with a very bland report. I am disappointed because here was an opportunity for the committee to be courageous. That opportunity has been squandered. There has been a prolonged inquiry spread over two parliaments—
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.15 a.m. to 11.26 a.m.
—As I was saying before the division, there has been a prolonged inquiry spread over two parliaments. The inquiry would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In good faith, members of the public have made submissions and appeared before the committee as witnesses. For what result? The result is a report whose recommendations are more likely to take us backwards than forwards in this difficult area of substance abuse. Maybe there was some significance in the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Hume, relating to the change of committee chair in the 40th Parliament. 
No-one can deny that substance abuse is a real problem in our community. There is a problem with abuse of both legal and illegal drugs. In June 1999 in this parliament—and while I was referring to illicit drugs it holds true for substance abuse—I said: 
... there is a problem with illicit drugs in our community whether we like it or not. It is affecting all levels of our society. Potentially all of us—it may not be in our immediate family, if we are lucky, but I would be surprised if many of us were not affected—know someone in our social circle who has suffered because of drugs.    
I believe that these words still hold true today and probably always will. The phrases `all levels of our society' and `potentially all of us' are the ones I would like to emphasise today. Substance abuse is not some isolated rare occurrence or something that only happens to other people. It can happen and does happen to everyone, whether it be abuse of alcohol, tobacco, heroin or some other substance. It can and it does happen. I am aware that the committee received a great many submissions and that it also received wide-ranging evidence at its hearings. The fact that it received many submissions and that it also received a variety of evidence makes it all the more amazing to me that it could come up with some of its more narrow recommendations. 
In reaction to the flavour of these recommendations, I would like to draw attention today to the minority report of my colleagues the member for Fowler and the member for Cowan, both of whom are very empathetic human beings who are willing to open their hearts and minds to the plight of those caught up in the maelstrom of substance abuse. I will start by quoting from their report, for the benefit of everyone here and for the parliamentary record. Under `General comments', they wrote in the minority report:
As members of the committee since the inquiry began three years ago, we have no objections to the conduct of the inquiry. The range of submissions and evidence of witnesses allowed the committee the fullest opportunity to address the inquiry's terms of reference. The most valuable part of this report is in fact the submissions received by the inquiry, the volumes of testimony given by witnesses before the inquiry and in the forums conducted as part of the committee's information gathering process.
However, the consideration of evidence, the conclusions reached and the recommendations made must be seen as coloured by the personal views of committee members (including ourselves). This can be a strength of the political process. After all, elected representatives should be a sounding board for the views of the electorate. What are seen as socially acceptable recommendations can be expected to prevail.
They went on to say:
But in reaching conclusions and making recommendations which reject the findings of scientifically based studies and by using assumptions and anecdotal evidence to support its recommendations, the committee's report loses credibility.
In many ways the report is not an objective assessment of the facts but a one sided argument in favour of a predetermined outcome. Surely the lives of young Australians should be above politics. Indeed the Australian people deserve an honest and open appraisal of drug policy.
I do not think I have ever heard a more damning indictment of a committee report by members of a committee. There have been minority reports to many committee reports before, of course, but usually these reflect philosophical or personal differences with the majority, reached at the end of the process, after much soul-searching on the part of the dissenters. It seems to me that what happened here with this report is that some members embarked upon the inquiry with preconceived thoughts about the outcome. They did not listened to witnesses and they did not understand the submissions. They decided to pursue a particular outcome which seems to fly in the face of the evidence before the committee.
I have some considerable sympathy for my colleague the member for Fowler, who said in this Main Committee room last Thursday that she regretted having any part in the setting up of this inquiry. Like her, I think the bulk of the recommendations reflect backwards steps in our policy towards substance abuse. Here was an opportunity to think outside the constraints of previous policy, and all the committee has done is recommend that the policy become even more constrained. 
Substance abuse is a health issue. Substances or drugs, both legal and illegal, exist, and people use them for what they think are their own health, social or recreational purposes, or whatever. The fact is that people take drugs, and they are not going to stop taking them. Fear of punishment, death or disapproval does not stop them. It never has and it never will. That is why a policy of harm prevention is a nonsense, because it implies that a point can be reached where no-one is harmed. The only way this point could be reached would be if no-one took any substances or drugs, either legal or illegal. This is not an imaginable situation. Its logical extension is to have no alcohol, no tobacco and no medicines. I could go on, but I think I have made my point.
There is nothing to be gained by narrowing the policy in this area. In fact, the opposite is needed. We need to be open to a wider view and to different points of view. We need to embrace a variety of ways of dealing with the problems associated with substance abuse. We should not reject possible treatments or approaches without giving them a fair trial. We should not be overly anxious to see a one-size-fits-all solution, because, quite frankly, there is not one. We should also strive to be compassionate and understanding rather than judgmental. We are dealing with people who have a problem. We are not dealing with objects. Anything that has the potential to help these people should be given a chance to be tried.
I share the concern of some of my colleagues about the emphasis given in the report's recommendations to getting people off methadone as soon as possible and about the committee's decision to suggest naltrexone as appropriate for trialling with opioid dependent prisoners. I am personally appalled that such a trial should be recommended. It reminds me of past practices when people in prisons in the US were experimented on or when members of the armed forces or defeated populations in war situations were used as human guinea pigs. Prisoners are vulnerable people. Who knows what pressures might be applied to them to participate in a trial. It could be claimed by authorities that they are willing to participate, but they will be very vulnerable to inducement. More favourable treatment could be offered, for example. How many of them would fully understand the implications of their involvement in a trial, the likely risks et cetera? Imagine how we would like it if it were suggested that politicians should be used as guinea pigs for a particular experiment.
This highlights another problem that I have with the report as well. This committee seems to be looking at individual areas and making bizarre recommendations. Recommendation 95 says:
... all personnel employed in correctional facilities should be subject to mandatory random blood or urine tests.
Why not policemen, judges and juries as well? Why is the report looking at those in prisons? Prisoners are being punished for crimes they commit by being incarcerated, and rightly so. But I just find the whole idea of making them part of an experiment totally abhorrent. To suggest that they be used as guinea pigs in this way is inhumane and denies these people any remnants of dignity and basic humanity. 
I suppose predictably—I am not really surprised—the report is not keen on safe injecting rooms. Again, this reflects an attitude of putting one's head in the sand. People inject drugs. They are not going to stop injecting drugs. If safe injecting facilities are not available, they will inject in an unsafe way. It is as simple as that. They will not cease injecting drugs into themselves or each other just because there is no safe place available to do it, and when they inject, often they will die.
In saying this, I am not trying to encourage the use of injectable drugs. I am not, but I do recognise that it happens, and as long as it is happening I would like to see safe injecting rooms operating as part of a package of strategies dealing with substance abuse. The evidence seems to be that where there are safe injecting rooms the incidence of overdose or death due to dirty needles or unsafe practices declines considerably. Surely this is a desirable outcome. Would those who are not in favour of safe injecting facilities rather have these people die? That is the logical outcome of not having safe injecting rooms for those who are going to inject drugs anyway.
Unfortunately, what we have in this report is a missed opportunity. Rather than being open to a broad approach to the problems of illicit drug use, the committee's recommendations in this area reflect a particular mind-set focused on zero tolerance. It may not have used that particular terminology, but zero tolerance is harm prevention carried to its logical conclusion. It is not that easy or simple. I can well understand the anguish of my colleague, the member for Shortland, who now regrets that she was an active supporter of this inquiry when it was first being established. The results shown in this committee report are disappointing, to say the least. An opportunity to be courageous has been lost and the cost will be borne by all those who suffer now and in the future from the effects of substance abuse.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—In speaking to Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, I would say that I have come a long way on this journey. As the previous member suggested, it was a long inquiry. It has taken me not only to just about all corners of Australia but also to places like Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, to get a better appreciation of some of the issues that this difficult subject confronts the nation with. To me, the drugs issue strikes at the core of our civilised society. It tests our values. It highlights the positive and negative aspects of life and all the options and choices, right through to criminal behaviour and our jail systems. It has been just over 25 years since the last report on drugs came into the parliament. I think it was a controversial topic then, and it remains thus. But I think the nation has come a fair way, nevertheless, in that time.
I want to give a few snapshots on those issues which I thought were important in terms of the general thrust of the report. Before I go into that I want to thank and acknowledge some key people. In doing that you always leave somebody out, so I apologise to those I leave out. I want to acknowledge Wayne Hall, Professor Ian Webster, Brian Watters, Alex Wodak, Tony Trimmingham and Brian McConnell and Marion McConnell. I also want to thank all the state and territory MPs and public servants who have put so much into this, the non-government agencies such as ADCA, and the councils such as the Fairfield City Council and the Newcastle City Council. The support received by this committee, and probably by both committees, was simply outstanding. It came from all levels of government, regardless of political background, including local government. It was an outstanding cooperative effort. I need to place on the record the wonderful efforts of Shelley McGuinness, who served us so well in the previous parliament. 
I thought I would touch on those issues which probably will not get the pre-eminent focus. We know that smoking and alcohol are key issues. They are the big dollar items where we have particular issues. The issue that society tends to focus on is the illicit drugs. I can understand why that is the case. It is because they give a sharper focus and are more obvious. That is what I will focus on today. I think there are issues around the treatment of alcohol and cigarettes and there are some pretty good recommendations about that in the report.
Firstly I want to talk about cannabis. Before I do so, I should say that in the available statistics the illicit drug situation in Australia has shown significant improvement in the last three or four years. Between 1998 and 2001 we have seen a significant drop in consumption by those aged 14 years and over of cannabis, analgesics—not that these are illicit—heroin and methadone, and a slight drop in cocaine. In terms of the available statistics, we can see that there is some progress on the issues that give us some of the greatest concern. On methadone, I would like to read a brief quote and perhaps subtext it. This witness really summed up for me the issues around methadone. I think a number of speakers would have spoken about the issue of parking people on methadone and not dealing with it in a more comprehensive way. The witness said:
One of the things that I have been disappointed about in relation to my own treatment, and I know that it is an issue for others, is never having had a treatment plan developed for me. I have just continued on and I happen to have the wherewithal to be able to make my own decisions now. I certainly would not necessarily have said that when I first went on the program—
that is, the methadone program. She concludes:
It saddens me a great deal to see people turning up and going each day—
that is, to collect their methadone doses—
when no one connects with them. I think there is so much lost potential there.
I hope that the recommendations relating to methadone can be looked at and dealt with.
As far as cannabis goes, I think we have come a long way in 25 years in understanding what cannabis is about. Professor Saunders said:
One could argue that cannabis use, as practised 20 years ago, was a relatively trivial form of substance abuse—that is not the case now. We are seeing an increasing number of people with cannabis dependence and the severe health effects of cannabis.
A number of witnesses went along with this to a greater or lesser degree. But the issues that I think are relevant here are the THC content and the hydroponics which now enable people to grow cannabis as a cottage industry, if not a major industry, all over Australia. We need to be conscious of that and we need to get the best information out to people so that they understand much more accurately what they are actually dealing with. 
The changes to illicit drug laws were, of course, hotly debated. Major Brian Watters is a well-known advocate of a particular view and Dr Alex Wodak is an advocate of another view. I happen to believe that the Watters view is the one that we should be aiming for, and I think that there is significant evidence—although I know that will be debated—to say that the best way to go is to have a focus which discourages people from being involved in the illicit drug issue from the start. I accept what people say—that is, that people will take illicit drugs, whatever—but it does not mean that we do not have a responsibility to make sure that we give everybody every opportunity to know to the best of their ability what they are actually dealing with and that these laws are not there just for the hell of it. In saying that, I do not decry Alex Wodak; I respect his view, but I take a different point of view. Therefore, I support the current legislative framework, to which we need to keep constantly alert, making changes where we need to. 
In terms of treatment, the report talks about the lack of a comprehensive treatment map. Certainly, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of where individuals can go for help is something that absolutely amazed the committee over recent years. The recommendations talk about urgently completing the map of available alcohol and drug services across Australia, identifying the gaps, ensuring the data is collected accurately—and this has been a constant issue in a number of reports and is an issue around Commonwealth and state relations—and readily updating the information contained in that database. The Australian National Council on Drugs is to perform that task, and the committee was really interested to see that that was done as expeditiously as possible. It recommended that the Australian National Audit Office make an evaluation of that work, but there is a sense of urgency about it.
In conclusion, I would like to quote once more from the previous report. The area that I had a particular personal interest in is to do with the issue of violence—the mixture of substance abuse, mental health and violence. It is fair to say that Australian society has become more violent over the last 15 to 20 years. There is a lot of evidence to support that view. In the evidence we took some three years ago, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health pointed to:
... increasing evidence that the co-existence of substance abuse and serious mental disorder not only prolongs the illness and makes treatment more difficult, but also dramatically increases the likelihood of violence.
The discussion paper that the committee presented in the last parliament, referring to the Victorian research, states:
Those who had a history of substance abuse in public mental health were over seven times as likely to have acquired a conviction as those in the general population, and in convictions for violent offences it was nearly ten times as high.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the committee made the recommendation that we do a lot more research. We became a little wary of the word `research' because you can research something literally almost to death—in fact, people have been dying as we have discussed these matters, so it is very important that this research be applied, evaluated and put into the community for the community's benefit.
That is all I really want to say this morning. In conclusion, I acknowledge the remarkable contribution of hundreds of people who not only saw this issue as serious enough to come before us and literally weep and be in total discouragement but also offered great encouragement. I believe it is as serious an issue as I have had to deal with in my time in parliament. There are great opportunities to do a lot better in this country on all these issues. I have not even touched on the opportunities in the jail system, but that is more of a state issue. I could even have talked about needle exchanges but time does not permit. I simply acknowledge my fellow Australians at all levels, including my colleagues who, for all our discussion, debate, disagreement and agreement, gave themselves willingly to the task. I think that this report, 25 years on from the last one, will give reasonable service to the Australian parliament and the Australian people. Members of the public may not read it all in one hit but I trust that many of them will take time to have a look at the recommendations and then refer back to some of the basis—the reasons that the recommendations were made.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I apologise at the outset because I too am suffering from the same sort of lurgy that you are at the moment so, if I sound a little croaky or die along the way, my apologies.
One of the wonderful things about this parliament is the committee structure. I do not think we actually have enough recognition of the committee structure out there among the public or even in the parliament. I want to commend the House for having the decency to refer this report to the Main Committee so that more than two speakers with five minutes each can get to speak on what is a fairly hefty and at times worthy report. Having said that though—and having welcomed the report and all the effort that has obviously gone into producing it over two parliaments—I want to condemn the government for having politicised the committee system. We currently have before the House several committee inquiries which are heavily politicised in nature. My own committee at the moment is doing an inquiry into cost shifting to local government by state government. If that is not a political exercise, I am not quite sure what is. I would say that that is an abuse of the committee process. Also before the parliament at the moment we have an inquiry into the recent bushfires. Unfortunately this again is being used as a politicisation of the committee process. I think that detracts from and demeans the fundamentally good work that committees do.
The committee process raises us above the partisan bickering of the parliamentary executive government system. It says to the Australian public, `We as parliamentarians can actually get together and do something for the benefit of the community. We can leave aside political differences and actually say that there are community issues out there that we need to explore as a parliament, coming up with recommendations as a parliament that we can endorse.' Sadly, this report went off the rails at the end of the day—when it was being written and tabled.
A phenomenal amount of work went into receiving submissions and hearing from an absolutely broad brush range of individuals—from, on one end of the scale, people who are involved in harm minimisations or who are in Sydney trialling the heroin injection rooms to, on the other end of the scale, Fred Nile and the Festival of Light. All these people came together to present their viewpoints. Instead of distilling down those viewpoints and saying, `Here's an evidence based approach to this serious health crisis'—not somehow a moral crisis but a serious health crisis—`and a well researched report,' we had to go down the route of coming up with a politicised report; we had to go down the route of coming up with politicised recommendations.
There are 128 recommendations in this report. Some of them are fairly worthy and some of them are well researched. But, sadly, they have all been tainted by a political bias—an approach that says, `We can achieve abstinence; we can have abstinence; we will achieve a drug-free society.' I am not sure what fairies are at the bottom of your garden, but we have never had a drug-free society. We are never going to have a drug-free society. There have always been drugs in our community. Depending on what your drug of choice is, there will always be drugs in our society, because people will always abuse alcohol. 
Alcohol and tobacco abuse create some of the highest imposts upon our health care system. Still today it is tobacco abuse that causes more trouble and more cost within the health care system than any other single thing. It outrates obesity, heart disease and everything—because it causes all those things. So to sit here and say, `We are never going to have drugs, we are all going to be abstinent and all we have to do is to have parents talk to their kids,' is a joke. It is demeaning the good work that is actually going on in our community now, because it somehow says to a whole lot of parents, `Because you didn't talk to your kids right, they've become drug addicts.' I certainly know a lot of people who have family members who are drug addicts, sadly. In the area of Box Hill in my seat of Chisholm there is a prevalence of drug abuse and in my day-to-day working life I come into contact with a lot of families who have children who are dependent upon drugs. They are not bad parents. They did not fail their children. They did not fall over at some point along the way. But something happened in those children's lives and they have become addicted to drugs.
It is a health issue. It is a not a moral issue; it is a health crisis. It is an addiction; it is not some moral failure of the individual or their family that they have ended up that way. I think one of the things that this report ignores is the question of why people turn to drugs. We as a society have failed to address those systemic issues that lead somebody to say, `Life is so bad—there is no hope and I am going to turn to drugs to sustain myself.' There is a bit of a discussion about mental health but it does not sufficiently go into whether people are using drugs as a form of self-medication because there is already an underlying mental health problem or whether the drug use has created the mental health problem. Again I would say there is a bit of a political bias in how those conclusions have been reached. If we can give our young people jobs and self-esteem, they will be far more likely to stay out of the mix of drugs. That has been proven but it is not something the report goes into.
I think one of the most alarming things about this report, though, is that out of the 128 recommendations it makes there are only four that talk about hepatitis C. At the moment we have a hepatitis C epidemic in this country. Hepatitis C is linked most heavily to intravenous drug users. The Prime Minister and his health minister have been sitting on a report that they received last November that indicated that their Tough on Drugs policy was causing—it was the link to—a hepatitis C epidemic. They had that report. They have only released it in the last couple of weeks, and the health minister has graciously said that she will give us a response in June. That is fantastic. We have got this road to recovery report, which, in relation to a major epidemic in our society—hepatitis C—has four recommendations. They are actually not bad recommendations but they certainly do not go far enough.
By the end of the report, we get down to the most damning corruption and politicisation of this report: we have decided that harm minimisation has to be dumped. I love the semantics of it all: it says we have to go away from harm minimisation to harm prevention. This will only add to the hepatitis C epidemic we are currently experiencing. The report, which also gives great credence to the government's current Tough on Drugs stance and its law enforcement, again fails to mention that we have had a heroin drought for the last two years.
I will be quite frank: I have not read the whole report—I will be honest. I have read great chunks of it, but I have not read the whole lot. I apologise. If anybody gets to read everything that comes across their desk in this place, I reckon they should get the gold elephant stamp of the year! But the thing that did alarm me in the report is that there is not a great deal of mention of the abuse of prescription drugs. There has been a huge escalation in the abuse of over the counter prescription drugs. These are drugs you can get quite easily from your doctor. There is a range of benzodiazepines—that is, Valium and Serepax. They are very easily obtainable from doctors and they are currently being severely abused. There is very little mention also of the alarming rise in amphetamine use. That is a serious area of great risk in this community, because you and I can go down to the local shop, buy a whole lot of chemicals, mix them together and start selling those sorts of drugs on the street. 
On one level, while the report canvasses a range of things, there are glaring absences in what it could do. I want to concentrate on hepatitis C, because I think it is an area that people are ignoring and it is alarmingly dangerous to our community. The rise in estimated hepatitis C infections from 11,000 in 1997 to 16,000 in 2001 shows that hepatitis C infections continue to increase. The report that the government is sitting on says that a range of innovative strategies needs to be introduced if we are to reduce this level of infection. Needle and syringe programs have succeeded in slowing infections, but we need to build on that success. We need targeted prevention strategies for young people—particularly young people who inject or are at risk of injecting—before they become infected with hepatitis C. The introduction of some prevention strategies will require political courage. If this courage is not shown, hepatitis C infections will continue to increase. Clear and unambiguous support of harm reduction intervention is the key to reducing hepatitis C infection.
The review of the national strategy notes that the uptake of hepatitis C treatments is extremely low. Approximately one per cent of people with hep C have ever accessed treatment. Access to treatment is a key issue for people with hepatitis C. Factors that contribute to that are the strict eligibility criteria; the restriction of being able to access treatment only through liver clinics and major hospitals; the experience of discrimination in health care settings; social and economic issues such as homelessness, poverty, unemployment and lack of social support; and side effects. The review of the national strategy found that the strategy has not achieved its objective of increasing access to the full range of treatment and care services for people with hepatitis C. Pegylated interferon, in combination with ribavirin, is best practice treatment and is available in countries such as the US, the UK and Canada but is not yet available for hepatitis C treatment in Australia.
A partnership approach to hepatitis C is stated as being a key aspect of the national response. The partnership operates on many levels, although at a national level it operates through the National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases. The review of the strategy says that the existing ministerial advisory structure reinforces hepatitis C as the poor cousin of HIV. But there are far more people with hepatitis C than there are with HIV. The council is currently convened until 30 June 2003, and there has been no indication of a replacement structure. Each month, 13,000 people become infected with hepatitis C, and we have no partnership forum. The new ministerial advisory structure needs to address the concerns in the review of the national strategy and needs a clear mandate to advise the minister on issues relating to the hepatitis C epidemic. The partnership approach established by the National Hepatitis C Strategy has worked well, and all parties remain committed to it. However, we need specific funding for the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Strategy, not more talk. 
The community sector is underfunded, yet it continues to carry the burden of the treatment, care, and support needs of people with hepatitis C, and the discrimination against these people. Funding for organisations such as the Australian Hepatitis C Council has remained static for the past four years and in real terms has decreased. State governments need to ensure the development, implementation and funding of strategies to reduce the impact of hepatitis C within their jurisdictions. The report, entitled Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, which the government has, quite clearly states that there is a major need for reform and a major need to go forward in this crisis. Out of 128 recommendations in the report, four are about hepatitis C and none of them address the issues in the report that the Minister for Health and Ageing commissioned herself. This report stands condemned for that glaring neglect alone.
The other area I want to talk about—and I hesitate to use the term—is the `ageist' debate about the use or non-use of naltrexone. The idea seems to be that the miracle cure, naltrexone, is going to help you. You will go on a rapid detox then walk out as a drug-free person and go back to a fantastically normal life. It does not work. It has been demonstrated not to work. Naltrexone only works for those people who are ready for it to work for them. No one program alone works unless the person is ready for that addiction to be cured. Detox is only the beginning. The biggest problem is then to get people back into a structured life so that they can leave their drug related life.
You get caught up in it. You get caught up in chasing money, chasing the dragon, getting a score, getting a hit and going this way. Yes, it may sound nice for parents to have a drug-free kid, but if that drug-free kid suddenly goes and scores again after being on naltrexone, that kid will die. It has been proven time and time again that the body cannot cope with a hit again so soon after being on the naltrexone program. I am not sure whether anybody has ever seen people withdraw from methadone, but it is actually scarier than seeing someone withdraw from heroin. It is a fairly violent thing. Methadone is a maintenance program and that is what it has always been; however, some people may need to be maintained for life. If alcoholics who join AA do not turn up to the meetings each month, they will probably go back to drinking. There is no one quick fix. If the government thinks it can say, `Just say no,' and be tough on drugs and take a zero tolerance approach, it is kidding itself and destroying our society. It is not putting the money where it should be put. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I commend my colleagues on their contributions to this debate. It is absolutely vital that we disentangle the good from the bad in the Road to recovery report. There is much that builds on the previous work of this parliament and on previous government programs. Some of the recommendations that go to matters such as continuing evidence based responses are valuable. Regrettably there appears to be a dissonance between what is recommended in the report, which is to proceed on an evidence based approach to drug law programs and to drug strategy, and a recommendation that we should substitute harm prevention for harm minimisation and have, as the last contributor said, the language of, `Just say no.' It is impossible to align those two contradictory elements of a single report.
Let us consider an example of where harm minimisation has been particularly effective in Australia, and that is in our response to the AIDS epidemic. Australia is probably the leading country globally in terms of the success of its response on a government level. When the epidemic first presented itself in Australia, the then government had possible options in front of it. Like a number of other countries, it could have turned a blind eye and buried its head in the sand in response to a growing medical problem. As a number of other countries have done, it could have tried to change people's behaviours to `just say no' to male-to-male sex and to intravenous drug use. It could have advocated that as the government's response. The countries that did that have had blow-outs in HIV infection rates and they have failed to communicate effectively to those in the at-risk groups. They have proved completely unable to put in place programs that are effective in reducing the harm that goes with AIDS. 
By contrast, Australia did something quite brave. It recognised that there were people in the community who practised male-to-male sex, and it recognised that there were people in the community who were IV drug users. It spoke directly to those people and to the Australian community. It used simple language and simple methods of communication, and it involved leading Australians in a communications strategy that was blunt but also well focused and well directed. It urged people in those at-risk categories not to abstain, not to `just say no'—recognising that that was an unrealistic prospect—but to change the manner of their behaviour so that they would not subject themselves to infection. Thus, where male-to-male sex or other sexual conduct between multiple partners was involved, recommendations to use condoms were put forward. In instances where people were using intravenous drugs, there were recommendations on how to ensure that you never used the same needle and that blood products were not transferred. If you only had one needle and needed to share it, there were recommendations on how to disinfect it through bleaching and various other methods so that it could not transmit HIV. As a result, we have had the world's lowest rate of infection.
What we learnt from that was that you can have a program which speaks directly to those who choose certain forms of behaviour which we as a mainstream society may either regard with tolerance or oppose but which we still recognise as existing within our ranks. IV drug use has never been approved of in this society, but the campaign was very explicit in that it recognised that, because there were people who were IV drug users, you had to speak to them directly about their manner of administration. So it did apply a harm minimisation strategy, not a harm prevention strategy. We did not pursue a `just say no' strategy, knowing that that would have been ineffective in reducing the rate of infections in the community and would not have had the desired health and social outcomes.
By contrast, we are now seeing real blow-outs in various blood-borne diseases—we have just had a very powerful contribution about forms of hepatitis and the very substantial rates of increase—because we have shifted some of the rhetoric and the approach subtly and slowly over time away from harm minimisation to the `just say no' or the `war on drugs' approach or an approach which essentially marginalises those whom we really need to communicate with. You cannot expect to have effective communication with people in high-risk groups unless you have an honest mode of communication and do not treat them in a way which forces them into further marginalisation. 
Unfortunately, despite the focus of this report on one level—and on saying that our responses need to be evidence based—what we are actually seeing is the triumph of an underlying ideological framework which is based on prohibition, abstinence and the idea that, at the end of the day, success can only be measured if you persuade or compel people never to take drugs. Of course, when societies have sought to do this they have always failed. The most illuminating example is Prohibition in the United States. There, the forces in the community that had seen drink as an evil to be suppressed eventually triumphed and, through legislation which was ultimately passed in a majority of the states of the United States, a constitutional amendment was effected which saw alcohol prohibited. The natural consequence of that was that, instead of the harm being suppressed, the harm was intensified.  
The harm was intensified for two reasons. Firstly, it was because the trade fell into the hands of those who could make substantial profits by reason of the market being left to only those who were prepared to take the risk of criminal behaviour—that is, the market became a criminal market with very high profits. This created the crime wave that infected the United States and it led to the growth of organised crime in that country. Secondly, it was because the things people were drinking became dangerous. When alcohol was unavailable and was not sold in a transparent, safe way, people were producing wood alcohol and various other forms of alcohol that actually caused death. So not only did it create a damaged society, it also produced deaths. Alcohol produced more deaths, directly because of that consequence. Are we to follow that kind of stupidity in this country? Are we to follow down the US path again? Almost everywhere around the world there are growing strands of approaches coming together along the harm minimisation stream. The path that Australia led on in our response to AIDS is being picked up in different ways in drug strategies all around the world.
Recently I travelled to Europe, and I went to Spain and Portugal where there are some very innovative approaches where personal possession of small amounts of drugs is not treated as an offence at all. I went to the Netherlands where there is a system of tolerated availability of cannabis. I have recently seen reports out of Canada, recommending a similar approach in that country. I have seen recent parliamentary reports from New Zealand, again recommending a re-examination of legislative approaches to drug laws in that country, particularly around cannabis. The whole drift of policy in Europe is very much towards the Spanish and Portuguese framework. By contrast, we seem to be drifting much more to the United States model.
Whilst there is much in the United States that I admire, one of the things that I find impossible to swallow is the way in which they deal with drugs. They have something in the order of a million Americans in jail for drug offences—exclusively for drug offences. Most of those people of course are black and poor. Does that mean that there is not widespread drug use in the United States amongst white middle-class kids? Of course not—they just do not get prosecuted and put in jail. Law enforcement tends to focus on those who are lower down the food chain. Does it mean that the United States is a place where harm prevention has actually succeeded? Of course it does not. Drugs are more available in that country than they are in the main streets of most of our cities—perhaps with the exception of a couple of our major cities. Does it mean that the United States has found some way of rehabilitating people who have serious drug dependency problems? Of course not. Notwithstanding all the drug courts, notwithstanding all the money, notwithstanding all the social, political and legal pressure and the policing and the like, the United States has no answers.
In this country we actually do have answers. We have better answers. Our programs are more effective, not just in relation to the AIDS strategy but also in relation to our approach towards warning regimes for minor drug use—for example, some of the strategies that have been developed in states like South Australia and the ACT, which deal with providing warnings for possession of small amounts and small numbers of cannabis plants. All these things suggest that there are smarter, more intelligent and less socially destructive ways of doing our business. We do not want to fall backwards into failed strategies. 
I want to conclude with a couple of specific comments about the so-called heroin drought. I think there is no doubt that many of the claimed reductions do relate to the reduced availability of heroin over the last couple of years. The problem if a government chooses to claim credit for that is the same as the problem you have if you claim the credit for a good summer—you are likely to be blamed for a bad winter. We are now seeing the end of the heroin drought. Recently I received a briefing regarding the successes of the injecting room in Sydney. It was quite illuminating to see that over a period of time patterns of drug use have changed substantially. When there was a heroin drought, there was a predominance of or growth in the use of cocaine and other injectable substances of that kind. That has changed. Drugs are now freely available in Sydney again—perhaps not to respectable citizens such as yourself, Madam Deputy Chair Corcoran—and I am certain that if you walked through the streets of any major city and sought heroin you could find it now. The heroin drought, I am told, is over.
That will mean that there will be a lot more convictions and statistics will start to change. Does that mean that law enforcement is failing? Of course it doesn't. It did not mean that law enforcement was solving the problem before and it does not mean that it is failing now. But a government that has claimed credit, on the basis that the lack of availability of heroin over the last couple of years was due to law enforcement, is going to get punished in the future, because these drugs are now readily available.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—Before I get into the substance of what I want to say, I would just like to compliment the member for Denison on what he has had to say in this place. He is very accurate in his assessment of treatment and the needs of people who are drug dependent. As time caught up with him, he was very specifically accurate in the sorts of things that he said about law enforcement and the reduced availability of heroin. This government and this committee, in my view, made a major blue when they started to take credit for what they saw as a reduction in the use of heroin.
There were a lot of reasons for that reduction, but if a government takes credit for a situation that occurs simply as a result of reduced availability—if it goes to the public, thumps its chest and says, `Look how successful we've been'—it is committing the community and itself to the creation of greater problems through false claims of success. We have to look at policies that address substance abuse at its worst—because that is always the bottom of the trough or the pit, and that is where needs are greatest—rather than simply thumping our chests and claiming that things like zero tolerance are the answer. They are not. Indeed, one of the things that this committee found out is that there is no such thing as one simple answer. A range of answers, responses and policies are required to address the issue of substance abuse, particularly when the heroin availability flow begins again, as it apparently has.
I must say that I was one of those who fought strongly for the establishment of this reference. In the early stages, when it was first raised, one of the reasons I raised the need for us to have a look at these areas was the number of parents, carers and grandparents that were coming to my office and telling me that they had just discovered that their son or daughter or another loved one within the family was caught up in substance abuse. They would say, `We don't know who to turn to or where to go.' Indeed, in looking to give them advice, I found that there were many gaps in the services, advice, support and assistance available to these families. In talking to others amongst my colleagues in this federal scene, I found that we all shared the same sort of experience. 
There was very strong support for this reference from both sides of the political spectrum. I remember Brendan Nelson, for instance, being very angry at the fact that the previous minister for health had refused our reference in this area. He, I and others insisted that we send the matter back to the minister because we believed that it needed to be addressed by our committee. I must say that, in the end, the minister saw good sense, saw the need and, I think, saw that the committee could go out and do some good work in the community in addressing this very vexatious issue. 
That first committee worked very well. Under the chairmanship of the member for Grey, Barry Wakelin, we met a lot of people, we covered a lot of ground and we listened to a lot of heart-wrenching stories from parents, grandparents and carers, and from family members who had seen their loved ones die or suffer or indeed seen their families ripped apart as a result of substance abuse and the lies, the distress and the trauma that go hand-in-hand with it. In my view, that committee worked very well, on a balanced and bipartisan basis, as we endeavoured to come to grips with what was basically an emerging story of horror. It did not matter where we went or what part of Australia we were in, the stories and the depth of the problems were the same. That gave us a measure of what we were up against and it gave us a challenge that we were able to pull together and work together on.
Unfortunately that all changed with the election and this parliament coming in, and there was a change in the people who came onto the committee. As far as I am concerned, the conservatives who came onto the committee came onto it with a narrow political focus, with predetermined outcomes and with an arrogant and belligerent attitude. They made the task of the committee difficult. At times it was impossible for the chair to hide her exasperation at what I saw as offensive and loutish behaviour by people whose only response to this massive problem was to cry that the answer was zero tolerance. Of course that is rubbish. I compliment Julia Irwin, the deputy chair of the committee, on her work and on the way in which she persevered in the face of a number of personal attacks by those opposite who should have been, but were not, part of an attempt to find a bipartisan answer to this incredible problem which confronts Australians, particularly young Australians.
The member for Grey said that he felt this report would challenge people. To some degree he is right but, unfortunately, in the main this report will not challenge people as much as it will categorise them; nor will it challenge people as much as it will marginalise them. That is a sad outcome from a report which could have been well and truly worth while. I look at the years of work and the amount of time that was put into it and I am very disappointed with the outcome. I am disappointed not just with the outcome but also with the way in which the importance of the committee system has been diminished. I like to think that members of committees should have independent approaches and independent attitudes to committees. I hate to think that committees are going to be dominated by the executive in the future as this committee has been, and dominated in the way in which the parliament has become dominated by the executive. If those opposite are prepared to let that happen, in my view the parliament, the committee system and we as members are diminished in our capacity to independently, vigorously and intellectually go about resolving some of the issues that we put a lot of work into as committee members. That is the disappointing side of the report. 
We put in a dissenting report, and I am pleased that we did. When I look at the response to this report from important organisations in our community and when I talk to some of the people who are involved in trying to address the issues of substance abuse in Australia and see their disappointment, I am pleased that I was part of a dissenting report. I will quote, for instance, what the AMA had to say about our report. Under the heading `AMA challenges substance abuse report's illicit drugs recommendations' they had this to say:
“According to ADCA (Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia) methadone maintenance treatment has been clearly demonstrated to reduce illicit opiate use. It has been more successful than other options including: no-treatment; drug-free treatment; placebo medication; or detoxification in clinically controlled trials. It is the most cost-effective treatment for opioid dependence available in Australia.
“The Report focuses strongly on abstinence. Evidence shows this is not a reasonable outcome for conditions like opioid dependency, which tend to follow a chronic relapse pattern. 
“The AMA supports the discussion of abstinence within the spectrum of treatment options.
“The report seems to replace harm minimisation with harm prevention but there is little explanation as to what is meant by this change in direction. 
“The AMA is concerned that this change in direction is a push towards the concept of zero tolerance.
“The public health implications of such a dramatic shift in national policy would be catastrophic.  
“Under this philosophy we will see ... the spread of blood borne diseases and an increase in drug related crime and drug related deaths. 
“Zero tolerance or it neo-euphemism “harm prevention” is something the AMA believes the Australian community should be very wary of embracing as the sole answer to illicit drug use in the community. 
“The zero tolerance option will never be the panacea for all the community's drug problems,” Dr Yong said. 
Dr Yong is a psychiatrist who specialises in adolescent health issues.
I thought it was worth recording what the AMA, through Dr Yong, had to say. Just as the community should be wary of adopting zero tolerance as the answer to substance abuse, so too should those in the community who have an interest in this whole issue be wary of adopting this report as a panacea.
If nothing else, I hope that the report will at least create and generate some discussion within the community. There are a number of recommendations which we agreed on and which others, like the AMA, support. I hope that this committee report will find some value in some sections of the community, but my fear is that this report will quickly drop into obscurity—that is probably where it belongs. It is a disappointment. I am sorry that we could not give leadership to the people who looked to us for some greater leadership, and I am sorry that we could not use the opportunities that we had to perhaps better pave the way in the future for us as a community to address the issues in a way which comes up with a range of options, not just one narrow political focus of zero tolerance as the answer to all of the issues.
In conclusion, I want to say that I take a strong interest in these issues. I am the patron of a group in Perth called Cyrenian House who do tremendous work in providing support to drug dependent people. They have some live-in programs and they have extended programs. They do tremendous work. Over the last few years, I have come to admire the tremendous commitment of some of the people in the non-government area who work in these areas to provide support, sustenance and advice, and who nurture not just those who have become involved in the issues of substance abuse but also their families who often feel deserted and do not know who to turn to or where to go. The non-government sector in this nation does a tremendously valuable job as they work with people who have become caught up in substance abuse. I pay them a great deal of respect in terms of the work they do. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the report, Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. I am pleased to follow the member for Cowan who, as a member of the committee, had a great insight into the submissions and the general approach that the committee took. I was very interested in his comments.
I would like to relate a rather sad story about a family who used to live in my electorate, and I do so under the section of the report entitled `Strengthening families and communities'. I make these comments as a backdrop to my general comments on the report. For the information of the House, the letter I will refer to relates to a mother who lost her son through a drug overdose. She wrote to me in 2001, possibly only a couple of weeks after her son died. As I was touched by this letter, I put it aside to use it at an appropriate time. In view of the committee's inquiry, I think this is the appropriate time to refer to her letter. I rang the woman at the time and I spoke to her yesterday to tell her what I intended to do. She indicated that she fully supports my intention to refer to her correspondence.
The story is that on 20 December 1999 Gail's son Brett told his mother that he was using drugs, mainly speed, and that he wanted to stop. His mother indicated that she would support her son's attempt to kick the drug habit. Brett went to live with his mother for a short while and then went off to live with his girlfriend. On Brett's birthday on 20 July 2000, his mother called in to see him but was so shocked and upset by his condition that she was unable to speak to him. She called again a few days later and just sat and talked about drug addiction and what it was doing to her son. Brett said to his mother, `Don't worry, mum, we will go and find out about rehabilitation.' Brett was sent to a specialty clinic and was advised about the great methadone program that was available. There was counselling each week at the clinic and blood and urine samples were taken to make sure no other drugs were used during the rehabilitation course. The doctor advised Brett that each week the amount of methadone would go down so that eventually he would not require any more and would be drug free. This advice sounded great so both Brett and his mother agreed that the methadone program would get him off drugs. Each week when he went to see his doctor, no counselling took place, there were no check-ups and no urine or blood samples were taken. Brett was simply given a prescription for methadone to be taken to a clinic to get his dose. Brett was never examined or counselled. His mother considered that this particular doctor and this part of the methadone program was a failure. While Brett was on methadone he got into trouble through shoplifting and in a two-week period was arrested five times on 17 charges. 
Brett's mother said that she witnessed the selling of drugs near both the doctor's surgery and the methadone clinic. Brett was on the methadone program for three months. He begged his mother to find a place that could help him. His mother phoned all the rehab places, counsellors and doctors, but no-one could help because he was on methadone and would have to get his dose down first. After five months of phone calls and rejections Brett's mother finally found a doctor who could help. An appointment was made and the doctor agreed that Brett was a good candidate for rapid detox, but he would have to get off methadone and back onto heroin for three weeks before detox could start. The cost was $2,700, which his mother was quite happy to pay. Brett went down to get his last dose of methadone and told them that this was his last dose as he was going into detox. The nurse at the clinic said, `You'll be back.' 
Everything went well leading to the detox. Brett was on morphine tablets for three weeks, but his mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On 1 March 2001 detox commenced. It was the worst thing Brett's mother had ever had to do, watching him go into withdrawal while he slept, taking him to the toilet and bathing him. Brett was put on half a tablet a day of naltrexone, and he had weekly visits to the doctor for a check-up and counselling. His mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On 2 May, Brett's mother received a phone call from his girlfriend to say that he was acting strangely and had disappeared. After a number of frantic phone calls Brett's mother received the call she had dreaded, a phone call that will no doubt live in her memory forever. Her 20-year-old son, who had not touched drugs for three months, was dead. Brett's mother blamed a lot of people, including herself, but she mainly blamed the system. In her view, methadone was a nail in his coffin. In her letter to me she said:
I have read the book that the government has issued and found it to be totally untrue, written by people who have not been there, they say the methadone program is great for rehab, this is a lie, they say the naltrexone is free, this is a lie.
She continued:
Why my son started taking drugs and why he took this last shot that killed him no one knows except for Brett. I will forever ask the question WHY? 
The reason for my letter is for the government to listen to people who have gone through this heartache and to spend more time, money and effort on rehabilitation. 
That is her message. I am sure that many members have heard this tale in some form or other from broken parents and grieving loved ones in their own electorates. I am also sure that members of the committee who sat through the many hearings and read the hundreds of submissions that they received have heard similar tales of distress and heartbreak. 
This is an important report about an incredibly important subject. There are many reasons why people become addicted to drugs, and therefore many solutions are required to solve the problems associated with drug addiction. There is no magic bullet, no single cure. Methadone works for some but it does not work for all. It did not work for Brett. Similarly, naltrexone is a really good treatment for those it works for, but for others it simply does not work and alternatives must be found. The next wonder drug to be invented will be really good for helping some addicts, while it too will not work for others. What is needed above all else in this field are options. The more options available to addicts and to their families, the more people will be saved. Options do not come cheap. The constant investigation into new treatment and new programs will be expensive. Many people who advocate a zero tolerance approach will be unhappy with whatever trials take place and whatever programs are funded, but we must not be deterred by these nay-sayers. 
Drug addiction must be treated as a health issue as much as a law and order issue, simply because to do otherwise would be to fly in the face of reality. Drug addiction is a health problem. Study after study and medical expert after medical expert tell us this, yet for some the information does not sink in and they wish only to punish addicts not treat them. Some people say, `Just say no and everything will be all right.' Unfortunately it does not work that way. We must have programs in place to treat those on drugs.  
The hardest thing in many cases is not simply getting somebody off drugs but keeping them alive long enough for them to want to give up drugs. That is the nature of addiction. Unless somebody wants to get off drugs, then the chances of them achieving this are minimal. There is a cycle associated with addiction. How many times have you heard that a friend, neighbour or family member has given up cigarettes at least five times in the past couple of years? They have tried patches, gum or cold turkey, but they are smoking again. Hard drugs are exactly the same. Unless the mind is in the right frame, regression will occur and the addiction will not be conquered.
I am concerned by this report's preoccupation with the new phrase `harm prevention' as opposed to the current terminology `harm minimisation'. It might not sound like much, but it does signal a shift in policy away from the sorts of programs designed to keep addicts alive long enough for them to want to kick the habit. An example of this is that the report is opposed to any extension of the heroin injection room trial that is currently taking place in New South Wales. I would be hesitant to support such a recommendation, not because I necessarily agree with heroin injection rooms but because I believe in options being available. I believe in studies being done to see what works and what does not. The heroin injection room may work for some and, if it keeps someone alive, it is a positive outcome and should be considered.
As I said, there is no single solution. We need to be taking note of studies and trials being done overseas and we need to be conducting studies and trials of our own. What works in Sydney may not work in Brisbane or in country Australia, but then again it may. We must keep our minds open. To quote Henry Miller:
Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. 
We must keep an open mind. We have to address the underlying social issues that lead to drug taking. We have to tackle the issues of poverty, broken homes, unemployment and crime. Not only that, but we must also tackle problems such as corporate stress and job insecurity, which lead to people who are not otherwise socially or economically disadvantaged taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin.
As I have said, there are an indefinite number of reasons why somebody takes drugs or commits a crime to support their habit. The mistake is in assuming that only the socially disadvantaged are drug addicts. This is an issue that affects all levels of our society, and the people who pay the ultimate price are the families who have to live with the aftermath. This is an important report and it is detailed and well considered, but it cannot be allowed to be the end. It must be a step on the road, because there will always be other things that we can do.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,36,2,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-09-17,"—I am delighted to be able to speak on Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. Having spent three years travelling the length and breadth of Australia during the committee inquiry, it is very difficult for me to try and do this report justice in less than 15 minutes. Road to recovery is an apt title, as the honourable member for Grey said. Those of us who have been on this committee inquiry over two parliaments have wandered down this road and, as we have wandered, we have realised that this is an issue that is so complicated for many people in our society. Many of the committee members have had first-hand experience of these issues. Others have had no experience apart from the constituents who rock up to their offices and present them with a problem. I am proud to have been involved in this committee inquiry from day one, and I can tell you it has been a traumatic but very revealing and rewarding experience for me as a human being. Hopefully I can and will contribute to the betterment of many Australians by trying to implement many of the recommendations of this report. 
It is a good report in that it provides all Australians with a snapshot of what is happening in this area. It is an area that, unless we are intimately involved with it, we do not want to know about and do not want to get involved in. It is a bit like cancer and AIDS: if it does not affect us, it is all too hard. It is out there and as long as it does not come to our neck of the woods we do not want to know about it. As I said in my five-minute statement when this report was introduced into the House, substance abuse has no respect for people, families or social status. It can strike anywhere and at any time. As I said at that time: there but for the grace of God go I. I do not know why my two daughters never took it up—I am glad they did not—but I have seen lots of young people battling addiction, whether to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs.
It really disappoints me that there are some skewed, politically driven recommendations in this report. We worked tirelessly for three years to come up with a report that, if people read it, will give a great snapshot of what is happening in Australia. That snapshot says that there are huge social costs to Australians who abuse legal and illegal drugs. Collins and Lapsley's report from 1998-99 said that this cost is $34.4 billion. That is a huge amount of money. Of that, 61.2 per cent is due to tobacco, 22 per cent is due to alcohol and 17.6 per cent is due to illicit drugs. The report said that the highest tangible costs associated with the misuse of drugs were borne in the home—$7.6 billion—followed by the workplace, with $5.5 billion. Costs relating to crime were $4.3 billion. Road accident costs were $2.3 billion and health care costs were $1.4 billion. We are talking about huge amounts of money.
In the brief time available to me in this debate, I want to give a small snapshot of some of the areas that I am interested in. One issue that is close to my heart is the way that schools deal with substance abuse. Lots of antisocial behaviour is manifest in schools. As a teacher I witnessed that over 23 years. But it bears a relationship not to the school but to the whole society. Recommendations 4 to 8 of the committee's report encourage state and Commonwealth government departments and agencies not only to put in place a school structure where teachers are trained in counselling and strategic options for children who are at risk but also to expand that into the community, so that everybody in the community is involved when kids break the rules, fall over and are in need of someone to pick them up.
A couple of weeks ago a young bloke—whom I will not name and who has a very close relationship with the family—was caught smoking marijuana in the school grounds. He was given 10 days. He was on his own, with no support. Not only was he at risk but the family was under stress. Where do you go? Recommendations 4 to 8, if implemented—and I hope and pray they will be—will address one of those areas. We are forming young people's opinion of where they fit into society, and they do take up this challenge. I think most of us in our teenage years enter that dangerous period when we take up the peer group challenge and smoke this, try that and pop this pill. Most of us grow out of it, but there is that small group of people that become addicted. Having a community response, as the committee recommends, will go a long way to addressing that issue.
One of the things that impacted on me was hearing evidence over the three years of the impact on families. I would like to thank publicly all the families who have come before us. There were parents who said, `I had to go and buy heroin for my daughter and my son because I did not want them to prostitute themselves for the cost of a fix of heroin.' We have been to jails and we have seen the tragedy there. We have seen young homeless people in Melbourne and Sydney who are destitute and at a loss as to where to go. We have also seen wonderful places such as the Woolshed in South Australia, which is involved in detox and rehabilitation. It is not funded by any government agency. It is out there in the public domain, asking for public support and doing a fantastic job. We have been to Odyssey House to see the wonderful work there. 
As I have said before, this is a very complex issue. It not only affects us white Anglo-Saxons but also is having an enormous impact on our Indigenous population. In the grievance debate in the House on Monday I spoke about its impact on Mornington Island. I have visited hundreds of Aboriginal communities and seen the impact of legal and illegal drugs. In recommendations 27, 28 and 29 we have come up with workable, bipartisan solutions, if implemented. If we are not cost-sharing and duckshoving and we have cooperation between all tiers of government we can address some of these things.
It is interesting that, by the time you finalise the report, get it printed and introduce it into the parliament, some governments have thought beyond the square. I publicly congratulate the Victorian government on taking the lead in lots of issues to do with substance abuse for a long time. They were the first to introduce the 0.05 blood alcohol limit and random breath tests, and the rest of the states were dragged kicking and screaming after them, so that we now have a national approach. In a news statement on 14 September Andre Haermeyer, the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services announced:
Victoria could be the first jurisdiction in the world to conduct random roadside drug testing ... 
This testing may begin by mid-2004. The news release went on to state:
`Victoria Police is considering this device for roadside drug testing. It has the capacity to test for as many as 15 drugs, including cannabis and methamphetamines.'
The testing device has a disposable test cartridge ... which will evaluate a saliva sample for the presence of drugs.
Drivers will be asked to chew on the test cartridge for one to three minutes to generate saliva to be analysed.
In our reports we suggested that that be done nationally—not just state by state with a rail gauge by rail gauge mentality. I congratulate Mr Haermeyer, who also said:
... almost 30 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents tested positive to some level of drugs other than alcohol. Last year, 211 drivers tested positive to drugs under the existing drug impairment-testing regime introduced by the Government in 2000. 
That regime needs to be implemented straightaway. I think it can be, and, hopefully, it will be.
This is a good report but it has some weaknesses, and those weaknesses are principally the result of its having been driven by a particular ideological angle. Whilst I respect Major Brian Watters and his role as the Prime Minister's head man on this issue, I do not believe that his blinkered view of life—where you can say no—will work for everybody. It is totally unrealistic. We are human beings with many foibles and weaknesses. We—as a society and as members of parliament—must put in place a whole range of regimes, treatment programs and options, because no one person fits just one solution to this problem. 
I have been on this committee for 11 years, and the beauty of it is that it is a bipartisan committee and all the members work tirelessly. But unfortunately in this last report, Road to recovery, we had some dissenting reports. I can publicly say that I did not agree with all the dissentions and that I disagree with some of my Labor colleagues, but, hopefully, the government will see the need to have a holistic approach to this, rather than a narrow, blinkered approach. We have not had many of the 150 members speak on this. Hopefully, it will be on every member's shelf and they will all read it when they have the opportunity and encourage people in their communities to get copies not only from their local members but also from the Net. It is a good report. I am proud to be a contributor to it. I thank the House for the opportunity today to speak to it.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-09-17," asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 August 2002
(1)	Is the Treasurer aware of reforms announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which identifies an estimated $350 million of profiteering by banks and credit card companies.
(2)	Has the Government accepted the recommended reforms; if so, what action will the Government take with respect to these recommendations; if not, why not.
(3)	What powers will the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) be given in order to ensure that benefits flow through to retailers and consumers across Australia.
(4)	What specific powers will the ACCC be given with respect to ensuring that credit card participants do not seek to recoup any reduction in revenue resulting from a lower interchange fee by increasing other fees and charges.
(5)	What powers will the Australian Securities and Investments Commission be given in order to ensure that consumer protection from foreshadowed changes to the credit card schemes is preserved.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Reserve Bank of Australia: Reforms</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,37,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-17,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	I am aware of the reforms announced by the RBA in relation to credit cards that will ensure that normal market mechanisms work in a more transparent and effective way to the benefit of the Australian community as a whole. 
(2)	The Parliament provided the RBA with powers, under the Payment System Regulation Act 1998, to regulate the payments sector to control risk and promote stability, efficiency and competition. This allows the RBA to introduce the standards on credit cards. These standards are not disallowable instruments and do not require any Government action to implement them.  In answer to a question without notice from the honourable Member for Cook on 27 August 2002, I indicated the Government's support for the RBA's proposed reforms.
(3)	The ACCC already has responsibility for ensuring that banks and retailers do not engage in anti-competitive behaviour in setting prices in relation to credit cards. 
(4)	The ACCC already has significant powers to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition, as set out in the Trade Practices Act 1974. 
(5)	ASIC already has responsibility for ensuring adequate disclosure of price changes by financial institutions and merchants. ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Reserve Bank of Australia: Reforms</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,37,1,answer
