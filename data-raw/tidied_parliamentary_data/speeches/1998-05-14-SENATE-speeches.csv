That the Senate take note of the documents.
In doing so, I draw to the Senate's attention that on 6 March I asked some 56 questions on notice regarding consultancies in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. These were questions that related to various matters following up specific consultancies and some contracts of service and matters that had been raised in previous estimates hearings. Also, there was a series of new questions relating to consultancies engaged in the 1997-98, 1996-97, and 1995-96 financial years. The department advised me that such answers could not be provided by the due date of 1 April. It went on to—
—Madam President, I have a point of order. What I have done is presented additional information. Is it appropriate for Senator Carr to now be spending a lot of time debating the additional information?
—Senator Carr is entitled under the standing orders—standing order 62, I think—to move to take note of the report and speak to that motion.
—Further to the point of order, I have just presented additional information; it is not necessarily a report.
—That is correct.
—What is the time limit for Senator Carr?
—Senator Carr has 10 minutes to speak if he wishes to do so. He probably does not need that much time.
—No, I do not, but I am being persuaded to take my full allocation of time with these gratuitous interventions from the chairman of this committee, who ought to be doing his job in ensuring that the department answers legitimate questions put to it by members of this Senate—

—The chairman of this particular committee seeks to defend the actions of this government and this department in the way in which the department has let consultancies and the way in which it has sought to avoid answering the legitimate questions of the estimates committee. What I would like to do is draw to the Senate's attention that the department, in a letter sent to me dated 23 March, indicated that those questions would be answered, although it was not able to meet the deadline of 1 April. It said that the answers would require investigation from various aspects of the department and the answers would be available in early May. That date has now also expired.
I would like to, once again, draw to the Senate's attention the failure of the department to answer these questions and indicate to the Senate that I will be pursuing these matters. I trust that the officers will find it within their resources to answer these questions forthwith.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-14,"—When we adjourned the debate yesterday, Senator Vanstone had indicated that the government was prepared to accept a certain batch of amendments, which included amendments that I had moved and amendments that had been proposed by the Australian Democrats. We were going to further refine those amendments and come back with a package of amendments which would be acceptable to the government.
In essence, the issue we were covering was that of the use of gender specific language in legislation. The committee was of a will to ensure a provision that protected against the use of gender specific language in legislation. By way of definition, we are talking about language that expresses bias in favour of one sex.
In terms of the amendments that were before the committee at the time, the opposition had amendments, as circulated, Nos 1, 3, 20, 22 and 29. I withdrew amendment No. 20 in preference for Australian Democrats amendment No. 4, so we were proceeding with amendments 1, 3, 22 and 29. The Australian Democrats were proposing amendments Nos 4 and 5, but the government had proposed a rider to those amendments which would have ensured that the provisions would not have struck out any legislative instrument proposal if there had been an inadvertent use of gender specific language. Democrat amend 
 ment No. 2 also ensured a reporting system to the parliament in cases where the principle had been transgressed.
Senator Vanstone is not present at the moment. We are waiting for her before we continue with the substantive part of the debate. I think that is a summary of where we were  yesterday afternoon. I am also informed that the Australian Democrats wish to pursue their amendment No. 3 which, from recollection, was very close to opposition amendment No. 22. I do not know whether the Australian Democrats still want to pursue that; from what I could see, there was not really much difference. There was a bit of a difference in language use but in terms of technical effect there was no difference between Democrat amendment No. 3 and opposition No. 22.
That is basically where we were yesterday afternoon when the bill was adjourned. Maybe Senator Murray can now give us an update on how he has gone with further refining his amendments to meet the wishes of the government.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—I will deal with the last matter first. Senator Bolkus, I would give your amendment No. 22 precedence, as it is similar to our No. 3. If that gets up, ours will just fall away. I think that is the appropriate way to deal with it.
The clerks and the persons participating in the debate were a little inconvenienced yesterday. I think it should go much more smoothly now that we have got a revised running sheet and now that the negotiations between the government and ourselves on these gender specific matters have concluded. You will see before you sheet No. 968 revised, in which the revised amendments agreed with the government are noted. Those are R2, R4 and R5 on the revised sheet. The government has accepted R4 and R5 and has accepted our belief that R2 should accompany them. When the minister arrives, we will seek to deal with the first item on the issue sheet.
—The question is that opposition amendments 1, 3, 22 and 29 be agreed to.
Amendments agreed to.

(R4)	 Clause 42, page 43 (after line 24), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (4)	 Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the Principal Legislative Counsel must not knowingly register a legislative instrument that, but for this subsection, would be required to be registered under section 41, if the instrument contains any gender-specific language unless that language is necessary to identify persons by their sex.
	 (5)	 The registration of an instrument that contains gender-specific language is nonetheless a valid registration.

—I am advised that it is. If it is, then we do not need No. 6 and we do not need to proceed. We need to clarify that.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-14,—That amendment is not necessary because it is the same as opposition amendment No. 29. I think it is fair to say that Democrat amendment No. 6 is not the same as my amendment 22. The problem that Senator Vanstone raises really goes to my amendment 29 and Democrat amendment No. 10. We can look at Democrat amendment No. 6 and my amendment 22 and work out whether the government is right about whether they both achieve the same purpose.,SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—I have had a chance to look at this revised running sheet and its guidance is there.

Since amendments 1 and 29 have already been passed, it would therefore be appropriate for Democrat amendments 1 and 10 to be withdrawn. Accordingly, I withdraw amendments 1 and 10.

This particular set of amendments—amendment No. 2 from the opposition, and other amendments from the Greens (WA) and Senator Colston—goes to the issue of the Attorney-General's certificate and the reviewability of such a certificate. The parliament has grappled with a number of different mechanisms for reviewing an Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate to the 
 effect that an instrument is not legislative in character.
In the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, the previous Labor government provided for parliamentary review and disallowance of such certificates. However, the 1994 bill did exclude judicial review, including review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977. The  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  removes the ability of parliament to review this decision but takes a different course of action in that it provides for decisions to be reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.
The 1994 bill was actually assessed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee, the membership of which included the Attorney-General, unanimously recommended that parliamentary review should be maintained. That view was not held just by the previous government and the current Attorney-General but even most recently it was supported by some government backbenchers, including Senator O'Chee, who did so in his capacity as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.
It has to be said that the Attorney-General has never tried to justify the government's rejection of the 1994 proposal. In terms of any justification at all, he has now come up with the argument that the government rejects his and the opposition's previous position because he now regards the function as essentially judicial in nature. So we have an admin officer, the Attorney-General, claiming that a function that he is performing is essentially judicial in nature.
It has to be placed on the record that this view was rejected unanimously by the House of Representatives committee of which he was a member. It needs to be put on the record what the committee, including the Attorney, thought about this matter. In its report, the committee said in paragraph 3.13.4:
The Committee is inclined to the view that the power of the Attorney-General is administrative in character and not judicial. The Attorney-General is certifying whether an instrument is legislative, that is whether the provisions of the Act apply or not. 
 The Attorney-General is not determining an issue of law between litigants.
The committee went on, at paragraphs 3.13.5 to 3.13.8:
The Committee notes that the proposed government amendments will provide for the decisions of the Attorney-General to be made subject to disallowance by Parliament. The Committee is concerned whether this is the best form of scrutiny of these decisions. It notes that the Bill excludes review under the AD(JR) Act.
Mr Morgan told the Committee that the Attorney-General's Department expects clause 7 to be used only in a `very few cases'.
Professor Pearce—
well known to the committee process—
told the Committee that the approach proposed by the Government (to rely on Parliamentary scrutiny) is a pragmatic effort to keep the courts out of the legislative arena and has some attraction as an alternative measure to judicial intervention. Mr Morgan indicated that it was simply a means whereby the Parliament could scrutinise whether the power it gave to the Executive (the Attorney-General) was being exercised correctly. Professor Pearce agreed with this assessment.
Ms Davies told the Committee that judicial scrutiny was costly to the individual and likely to occasion considerable delay compared to the parliamentary scrutiny.
Can I emphasise that this is the argument that appeals to me most. The committee therefore agreed that the decisions of the Attorney-General under clause 7 should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. As I say, the committee also went on to unanimously recommend that a decision by the Attorney to grant a certificate should also be reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.
So a House of Representatives committee, consisting of a number of members of all parties, including the current Attorney-General, recommended both courses of action—both parliamentary scrutiny and reviewability under the AD(JR) Act. The committee made this point by rightly pointing out the fact that the proposal to exclude judicial review under the AD(JR) Act did not exclude judicial review pursuant to the original jurisdiction of the High Court, or section 39B of the Judiciary Act.
In terms of our current position, it is this obvious anomaly as well as the working of 
 the committee that has led the Labor Party now to accept the committee's recommendations.
We have been persuaded by the committee. The government, in opposition, were persuaded by the position that we are now putting. Senator O'Chee, even recently, has still been persuaded by the position that the opposition, the Greens (WA) and Senator Colston are now putting.
It is not good enough for the Attorney-General to argue that black is white or white is black, as he seems to have done in this particular instance. We are talking here of a decision making process which has been characterised by both the current Attorney and a parliamentary committee—I think correctly—as being executive in nature. For the Attorney now to say that we are talking about a judicial function rather than an executive one, without really explaining how he has come to that conclusion and without any substantive evidence to support it, is, I think, totally unacceptable.
So the opposition is pursuing this particular amendment. We think it is a reasonable one that the government could quite reasonably accept. We hope that through the process we are involved in this morning in the Senate the government may, in fact, be persuaded by both the current and previous arguments put to this parliament.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-14,"—It is a pleasure to see you in the chair, Madam Temporary Chairman. We are debating opposition amendment No. 2 which is seeking to make certificates issued by the Attorney scrutinisable by parliament. Those certificates say whether something is a legislative instrument or not. If it is, then it would have to go through these processes that this whole bill is about—legislative instruments legislation. Senator Bolkus, the shadow Attorney-General, makes a contribution and says, `The Attorney is claiming that this decision on his part is a judicial process.' I have not heard the Attorney say that.
—I have read the report.
—They are certainly not my instructions from the Attorney whatsoever. I do not say you are being deliberately misleading, Senator Bolkus, but they are not my instructions at all.
—That is not good enough.
—It may not be good enough, Senator Bolkus, for you, but I have not finished yet. I am just indicating to you first up that those are not my instructions. Secondly, I am indicating that the bill, since the report that you were talking about, has now changed. The bill, in its original form, did not allow for administrative decisions judicial review. So you would have a situation that if the Attorney were to say, `No, I am not going to have parliament review my decision' and you could not have an administrative review, then you would have a non-reviewable decision. But, as you well know, Senator Bolkus, the bill has been changed from its original form and a decision by the Attorney would now provide for review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and that review would be by the Federal Court—quite the opposite from the impression one might get if one was an unsuspecting person reading the Hansard  late at night and read Senator Bolkus's speech.
There are a couple of things you would not realise. You would not realise that this bill is not the original bill from years ago. This bill is different. It does allow for administrative decisions judicial review by the Federal Court of a decision taken by the Attorney. You would not appreciate that from what Senator Bolkus says.
—That is also not true. Weren't you listening? I put that on the record. What were you doing, Amanda?
—Minister, you have the call.
—Thank you for indicating I have the call, Madam Temporary Chairman. I had thought I had but I was a little bit confused with Senator Bolkus interjecting all the time and trying to hold things up. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which got some mention in Senator Bolkus's speech, has taken 
 up the issue of parliamentary scrutiny of section 8 certificates on a number of occasions. The Attorney has made it clear to the chair of that committee that he does not accept the view that parliament should be reviewing the Attorney's decisions in this respect and that the AD(JR) Act review by the Federal Court is satisfactory. That is the Attorney's position and the government's position.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Let me repeat this for the record, and maybe this time the minister will listen. I did make the point, in referring not only to the Senate committee but also to the House of Representatives committee, that that committee actually canvassed the question of reviewability under the ADJR. As I said, it is on the basis of the recommendations and work of that committee that the opposition now is persuaded to accept the ADJR reviewability aspect as well as parliamentary review. That is a point I made clear. So anyone reading the debate late at night will probably wonder where Senator Vanstone was when I was making my initial contribution.
The point is that the Attorney-General as a member of that committee was persuaded not just by reviewability under the ADJR but also by the concept of parliamentary scrutiny which was embodied in the 1994 legislation. That committee recommended both avenues of accountability. As I said, we are persuaded by that committee's recommendation. So, Senator Vanstone, maybe if you tuned in a bit more often you might obviate the need for protracted debate.

I just wonder whether we can bypass opposition No. 8 and move on to another one. Senator Murray is trying to get the Greens (WA) here, and he may be able to assist us. Opposition 21 goes to clause 22 on page 53 and omits the words `or 66'.
—Excuse me, for clarification, can you advise which amendment you are now moving?
—I am not. I am still on the one that you called, clause 21. I think what we are concerned about here is whether a legislative instrument proposal should take into account and recognise environmental matters. In respect of this amendment, I point out that the 1966 bill does generally widen the information that must be included in a legislative instrument proposal. The legislative instrument proposal will now cover a more complete analysis of the options available to achieve the purpose underlying a legislative instrument, and it will also canvass the relative merits of alternative approaches. A LIP is required to take into account the indirect social and economic costs and benefits of a particular proposal.
The only problem with the government's proposal here is that in detailing its inclusive list of matters to be taken into account the government has deliberately excluded environmental matters. Environmental matters were in fact listed in the 1994 bill. I note that, as the government has agreed, this change does not prevent environmental concerns being considered. So we have a government which has deliberately dropped environmental matters from consideration in a legislative instrument proposal, though it has not precluded them from being taken into account.
There is no real reason given for the government's rejection of the previous government's position. As I say, the previous list included environmental matters as a matter of relevant consideration. The Attorney has now stated that under Commonwealth environmental legislation there is a detailed consultation process on proposals affecting environmental issues where costs and benefits are relevant factors. It is the view of the government that it is not necessary to duplicate those requirements. However, as the Attorney well knows—or should know—the requirements for environmental impact assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act do not apply to the vast majority of legislative instruments that will come within the terms of this legislation.
So once again the Attorney is trying to gloss over the truth, trying to conceal the fact that this legislation has a broader range of 
 impact than the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. As a consequence of the government's measure here, as a consequence of the government's omission, environmental matters will not be taken into consideration in a wide body of legislative instruments proposed by government.
So we believe it is important that these matters continue to be considered and consequently we are pursuing this amendment. It has to be put on the record that it is extremely important that the environmental effect of these instruments be considered and that they should be considered in a process which is not as rigorous as the one provided under the environment protection act, as I mentioned earlier. Clearly, if the provisions of the environment protection act are complied with, the terms of the bill will be met, but where they are not complied with this amendment by the opposition and the Greens (WA) will ensure that these considerations are taken into account.
The government has been at odds with itself in terms of trying to work out why it is opposing this provision. In the debate last time Senator Vanstone indicated, on the Attorney's behalf, that the removal of the word `environmental' would not prevent environmental considerations being taken into account but, as I said earlier, that is really not good enough.
They are some of the reasons the opposition is pursuing this amendment. It will be interesting to see why the government opposes it. I move:

			 (i)	 the instrument is required for reasons of urgency including, but not limiting the generality of the foregoing, reasons related to the prudential supervision of insurance, banking or superannuation or the regulation of financial markets; or

Madam Temporary Chair, this is one of the important areas of the debate. I am suggesting that amendments 15 and 16 be taken cognately with 17. In speaking to amendment 17, can I say that the opposition has put an alternative 17 in an attempt to try to reach some accommodation with the government's concerns. We are talking here about exemption from consultation and the extent of exemption from consultation. Amendments 15, 16 and 17 deal 
 with this principle. As I say, in moving the alternative, we are trying to meet some of the government's concerns. Can it be placed on the record—
—Can I just ask for clarification, Senator Bolkus? On this running sheet, we have opposition amendments to clauses 28 and 27 listed as 15 and 11. I wonder if you could direct us to 16 to assist us.
—It is on page 3.
—Thank you, Senator Murray.
—We are talking about clause 31, non-compliance with consultation procedures. At the top of page 2 we have opposition amendment No. 17, and the second item on page 3 is opposition amendment No. 16. There is a batch of other consequential amendments as well. So it does appear twice on the running sheet, and that is why I am suggesting we handle it here now.
As I was about to say, there are a number of changes between the 1994 bill and the 1996 bill on the range of matters for which consultation may be granted. The 1996 bill does not provide exemptions where, firstly, the legislative instrument is required urgently—for example, for reasons related to the prudential supervision of insurance, banking and superannuation or the regulation of financial markets; or, secondly, where there is significant or comparable public consultation on the legislation already taking place; or, thirdly, notice of the legislative instrument would give an unfair advantage to particular individuals; or, fourthly, the Attorney certifies that public consultation would not be in the public interest.
Instead, the 1996 bill does provide exemptions where, firstly, the instrument is required in the interests of national security but no process for certification by the Attorney-General is required; secondly, the instrument is an airworthiness directive; thirdly, the instrument is a commencement proclamation; fourthly, the decision maker proposes to make a 12-month temporary legislative instrument; or, finally, the regulatory review body certifies that the legislative instrument proposal is 
 adequate and otherwise waives part 3, consultation requirements, where no such consultation is required by the enabling legislation, the agreement is comparable or the costs of complying with part 3 outweigh the benefits to be obtained by the instrument.
As I said in the earlier debate, we believe that the 1996 bill is too restrictive and, in a sense, we are trying to help the government here to ensure that its objectives are met. So our amendments here modify the government's regime by accepting some of the government's changes and rejecting others.
Let me place on the record that we believe that an exemption should be available where the instrument is urgently required or where notice would give an unfair advantage to individuals. However, we believe that in those circumstances the instrument should have only a 12-month temporary operation and should be certified by the regulatory review body as being so necessary. We think that is a fair balance.
Secondly, we believe that the exemptions for significant or comparable public consultation should be retained, but that there should be a requirement that the regulatory review body certify that such consultation has indeed taken place. This provides an independent checking mechanism that will prevent over-enthusiastic departments from using this provision to get around the consultation requirement set out in the bill.
Thirdly, we believe that the public interest test should be retained, thus eliminating the need for some of the more specific exemptions. However, in our amendments we retain a number of specific exemptions such as national security and airworthiness directives. We believe that these particular areas fall within the broader public interest test, and we have specifically mentioned these to avoid any doubt in relation to these matters. We believe that the failure to state a broader public interest test could in fact prejudice matters which should be excluded from the operation of the consultation requirements but which have not been specifically listed in the bill.  
I think the Senate will be able to note that we have actually changed the form of some 
 of our amendments from that originally proposed. We still seek the same objectives, but, in doing so, I think we also take into account some of the government's wording in their proposals. Can I also say that we support the exemption of commencement proclamations.
Fifthly, given the exemptions already granted, we do not support the exemption of all 12-month temporary instruments from the operation of the consultation requirement. I must say that this may in fact be the substantive issue in dispute between us and the government. We do not believe that there should be exemption of all 12-month temporary instruments from the operation of the consultation requirement. These provisions are merely a means for the government of the day to avoid the operation of essential consultation processes, and we also believe that they can be open to abuse.
Finally, in terms of the areas before the Senate, the powers of the regulatory review body to limit the consultation requirement should, we believe, be retained, as set out in the bill.
As a result of deliberations here last time, and the considerations that we have taken since the debate here just a few months ago, we will pursue amendment 15 in precisely the same form as we proposed last time. We pursue amendment 14 in a modified form. Amendment 16 that we moved last time will not be proceeded with. We have included the old form of amendments 14 and 16 in our original list of amendments so that senators can see how they differ, but we do not intend to pursue them.
I note also that our amendment proposal should address the majority of concerns expressed by the Attorney in his speech on 17 November 1997. As I said during the debate, the only substantial area of disagreement between us now is in relation to the 12-month temporary instrument. That still stands between us for the reasons I have already stated.
Whilst I have been putting this explanation on the record, I hope that other senators have been able to work out whether we will proceed at this particular stage with 15, 16 or 17, or whether it is desired that we proceed just 
 with 17. Can I say that we are talking about exemption from the consultation process, and I believe the three amendments can be handled cognately at this stage.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—I have sat quietly because these discussions were broadly canvassed in the previous debate. I think Senator Bolkus has put the proposition quite appropriately. In all these discussions, it is not the intention to interfere with the government's desire to get on with the business of government. It is merely the intention of those proposing and supporting these amendments, which we do, to determine that the parliament has its appropriate place and that the appropriate protections are there for it.
As we have said before, by and large the bill has excellent features. I think these are helpful amendments rather than amendments which are aggressive to the government's intention.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Whilst Senator Colston is finding his notes, I note that opposition amendment No. 24, which I am not pursuing, is identical to the amendment which I gather Senator Colston intends to move. It seeks to remove the exclusion of intergovernmental schemes from the operation of the bill. The government opposes this provision on the basis that it would necessitate a revisitation of this issue by COAG and that an alternate regime for dealing with this matter is currently being considered by the chairs of the review committees of the states and territories. The government also notes that this matter is specifically listed in clause 72 as a matter which will be part of the scheduled review of legislation.
I was not going to move this particular amendment as I was going to wait on the deliberations in the Senate on the ambit of the legislation before us. The government's proposal is that the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  cover only business regulation. There is an amendment which will extend the operation to other matters as well. We will not be supporting the extension, unlike on the previous occasion. We believe that this time, in the interests of trying to achieve some compromise, we can limit it to business regulation, but we put the rider to it that we will ensure that the bill is kept under close scrutiny and that, in government, we would give further consideration to an extension.
With that modification of the ambit of the legislation, as opposed to the legislation that went through last time, I see no problem in including intergovernmental schemes as part of the accountability mechanism in this legislation so, if Senator Colston does not proceed with his amendment, I can then proceed with mine if necessary.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Colston, Sen Malcolm",IND,1998-05-14,"—I am sorry—I missed part of that. This amendment was passed the last time the bill was before the chamber. At that time, I was in another place—in hospital—and I was not able to participate. I am told that the Senate 
 agreed to this particular amendment and that it was agreed to by the House of Representatives but was not included in the No. 2 bill. The notice that I have is that the bill excludes from parliamentary disallowance instruments which provide for national schemes of legislation such as the Corporations Law, the competition code, road transport reform and occupational health and safety.
These schemes are likely to become more important and it is inappropriate that the parliament should not be able to scrutinise this legislation. Parliament should have the same option of disallowance of the instruments as it has over other legislative instruments, many of which are of far less consequence than national schemes. It is incongruous that the national parliament should not have control over national legislation.
My amendment No. 2 provides for national legislative scheme instruments to be disallowable by either House. I am sorry that I did not quite catch Senator Bolkus's comments. Is it your suggestion that I not move this amendment and that you have a similar amendment to move if this one did not go?
—Go ahead with yours.
—I formally move:
(2)	 Clause 61, page 64 (line 29) to page 65 (line 7), omit subclause (7).
—The question is that amendment No. 2 moved by Senator Colston be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-14,"—The government acknowledges that intergovernmental schemes are becoming increasingly important to regulate particular forms of conduct or activity across jurisdictional boundaries. These schemes require legislation in each of the jurisdictions involved, and that legislation is obviously a compromise in terms of the interests of all parties in the scheme. The effects of a disallowance of instruments under those schemes, giving this parliament the opportunity to do that in any of the participating jurisdictions, would significantly impair the operation of such schemes. 
The government is aware of work being undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Chairs of Review Committees of the States and Territories to develop a proper basis for scrutiny of those schemes. The government's position is not that these schemes should be entered into or be allowed to be entered into and not have some scrutiny, but that this proposal for scrutiny is inappropriate because it allows the parliament of one party to bring the whole scheme apart by pulling one party, effectively, out of the scheme.
One proposal that I am advised is under current consideration is that the parties to an agreement will pick one party to undertake the proper scrutiny function of that scheme on behalf of all the jurisdictions that are in it. That is not settled, but that is one scheme that is there. I understand that the development is not yet at a sufficiently advanced stage to formulate specific proposals by governments.
This government's view is that, until that occurs, it is inappropriate to enter into this particular arrangement. In other words, the particular exemption which is provided for these schemes to prevent the disallowance of a Commonwealth government's participation, which it could effectively do, is inappropriate at this time. We need that exemption. It should stay until a proper process of scrutiny is worked out between all the parties that might be a party to these agreements.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—I am partly guided in this by the precedent that I have seen established in this parliament, and that is the party which represents the opposition—that has been in government previously and I guess hopes to be in government again—is very mindful of the relationships between the Commonwealth and the states and how they operate. I think you have made the leap that schemes and agreements made between the Commonwealth government of whichever flavour of the day, and the states might be knocked over by the Commonwealth parliament. But, given the precedents that I have seen in this place, the likelihood is that the two major parties will most often agree. It is only where fundamental principles, rights or issues are affected that 
 the intentions of the government of the day might be under some threat.
I would assume that, in most cases, the negotiations you have with the states and consequent outcomes would tend to get support from those who have the experience in government and that the threat you outline, whilst it exists, could be overstated because it would not occur every time. It might only occur occasionally. And when it does occur, in our view, it would probably be justified. Do you have a response to that?",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-14,"—I will very briefly make two points. My first point is your argument is working on the basis that this is an appropriate mechanism. However, you are silent on the issue of when there was an intergovernmental scheme that had three or four parliaments in it and any one parliament could just pull that government out for the time being. I think it is appropriate that these sorts of schemes do have proper scrutiny. We have the states, territories and the Commonwealth working on a proper system of scrutiny that can be agreed to all around Australia.
It is egotistical and folly in the extreme in both cases for us to proceed to set up a system without waiting for the outcome of those sensible negotiations. Every other day on the radio you will hear people saying, `Why cannot these people work together?' I am indicating that, apparently somewhere, we have officers from the states, territories and the Commonwealth working together on getting a sensible scrutiny mechanism. We are saying that, until we do have that mechanism in place, these schemes should be exempt.
We are not denying the need for scrutiny; we are at one on that. We are saying do not assume that we here in this chamber now—with all the knowledge that I am sure is here in the Democrats, in the opposition and in the government—know best. Let people have a go at working it out together sensibly, and that is what I hear from the men and women in the streets all the time.
 As to your second point, which is fed by a paranoia—paranoia is seen as a negative word—or something approaching a paranoia 
 in the parties with smaller numbers that the two big parties will always get together to defeat them, you think it is only on the occasions when great principle comes into play that a major party would support other parties such as your own and defeat the government of the day in relation to one of these schemes.
I make two small points on that argument. Firstly, the principle is principle—whether it is great or small does not matter. The principle is what distinguishes it from a mere viewpoint. Secondly, you have over there the former Labor government that said, `We would never sell the Commonwealth Bank.' They got into government and did. They said, `We won't sell the rest of it,' but then, after an election, came back and sold the rest of it. What else did they sell?  Australian National Line and Qantas. Privatisation was in principle a bad thing before an election and in principle a good thing after an election. When they were in government, their practice was it was a good thing. Now they are in opposition, for no other reason than political opportunism, it is seen as a bad thing.
While I disagree with the Democrats' general views on contracting out and privatisation, at least you are consistent. They are not. I have given you one classic example of where you cannot say where those opposite stand—a classic example of where political opportunism will be taken by them and used. Frankly, I do not see that you can say that the experience of government will encourage the Labor opposition as it now stands to vote according to principle in any way at all.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—Minister, as you know in debates, sometimes your best points are made by the other side. I think you have made the point that, quite frequently, governments and oppositions vote together on issues in which they have agreement, such as the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Whilst we disagree, that is a fact and that is the precedent.
I have a second question for the minister: is it your view that, when you sit with the states government as the Commonwealth government, you sit as equals or that you sit as the pre-eminent parliament and the pre- 
 eminent government of this country?  The country is not run by the states; the country is run by the Commonwealth government. This is not a parliament which is acting just as one of nine; this is a parliament with a particular constitutional weight and authority, and acts accordingly.
I would also point out that it is open to any parliament to pass similar amendments to the ones which we are passing, which would give that parliament the power to withdraw from such a scheme. So it is not necessarily just in your hands.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-14,"—Very simply, Senator Murray, of course all senators would say this is the pre-eminent chamber in the pre-eminent parliament. I suppose the members of the House of Representatives, who have all got batons in their back pockets thinking one day they will be prime minister, would say that the House of Representatives is the pre-eminent house in the pre-eminent parliament. But to specifically answer your question, it depends on what the scheme is. If it is a scheme where the constitutional power lies entirely with the states and the Commonwealth is there by virtue of using its spending power to be a part of that scheme, I think it would be somewhat audacious for the Commonwealth to regard itself as being the superior member of such a scheme. It depends on what the scheme is. Everybody has their place and moment in the sun. We can all kid ourselves that we are the pre-eminent parliament or the pre-eminent chamber, but everybody has their place.

	 (5)	 If the requirements of subsection (1) have not been complied with in respect of an instrument or provision, that instrument or provision continues to be in force for a further 5 years after the time when it would have been taken to cease to be in force because of the operation of section 66.
For the Democrats this is probably the most important amendment we will consider in this debate. We have consistently said throughout the series of debates on the Legislative Instruments Bill that we congratulate the government on bringing this bill forward. We have consistently said that in most of its parts it is a real advance in the legislative armoury that the government and the parliament provide themselves. We have made the analogy before that for us it is like a good athlete with a hole in the heart. The danger we see is that the sunset provisions, with which we agree, could result in throwing good regulations out with the bad.
We said in our negotiations with the government—and I will repeat my remarks of yesterday; I thank both the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General for the manner in which they tried to approach discussions on this, but we could not agree—that we believe that it is the place of parliament to have the opportunity to reject the intention of government to sunset a particular regulation. All regulations of this type are delegated. They are powers delegated by the parliament to the executive. The parliament that gives can take away. Our view is that either house of parliament should have the opportunity to recommend that, in any particular list proposing sunset legislative instruments, say, one or two should not be done away with or alternatively should be remade.
That retains the authority and responsibility of parliament. It is an issue we all understand. It is not a difficult issue to understand, but it is the most fundamental  principle of democracy—that is, that the representatives of the people have the power to deal with legislation 
 of both the primary kind and the delegated kind.
This process would add a further burden on both houses. We would need to provide the relevant committee—probably the Regulations and Ordinances Committee—with the resources to deal with the lists that come before them. My experience as an observer of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee both past and present is that they are a non-partisan, very effective and very professional body, well serviced by the secretariat they enjoy.
We have tried to develop here a process whereby this could be undertaken. We are aware of the government's need for speed of response and we have therefore given a time frame of six months within which matters can be considered. In the event of a resolution of either house of parliament that a legislative instrument is kept alive, it would be kept alive for a further five years until the sunset provision comes up again.
As I see it, it would happen as follows. A list of 100 legislative instruments would come to either house of parliament, the appropriate committee would look at it and they would recommend that three should be retained or remade and the appropriate house would pass the appropriate resolution. The government might disagree with one or two of those resolutions, in which case they would then bring a repealing motion before the house and that would be decided upon.
We think it is a perfectly reasonable approach. It retains the government's ability to review the list. It retains the government's ability to get rid of old, outdated and unnecessary regulations but it also retains the parliament's right to have an overview and reflect on the powers and activities of the executive of the day. Quite frankly, if this got up and per chance you are not the government next time or the time after you might welcome the fact that this sort of provision was retained in the legislation.",SENATE,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

(33)	 Schedule 1, page 85 (table item 15), at the end of the item, add ""with the exception of instruments made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 "".
All these amendments relate to a particularly insidious part of this legislation. The government is trying to double dip in the legislative process here. The issue before the parliament is whether Public Service terms and conditions can continue to be disallowable.
—Senator Bolkus, you are talking about amendments 30, 32 and 33. Amendment 31 needs to be put separately because it is a clause to be opposed. We are dealing with amendments 30, 32 and 33.
—I will deal with amendment 31 later. The government, as part of its proposals for public sector reform, is also seeking to exclude various legislative instruments relating to public sector terms and conditions from amongst those instruments which are disallowable. Those instruments are currently disallowable. The government knows that its reforms are not acceptable to the Senate. They know that because the 
 Senate has twice rejected the Public Service Bill 1997. They know that they are not acceptable to the Senate because those Public Service reforms, euphemistically known as structural changes in the workplace, mean nothing other than reduction of terms and conditions for the Australian public sector.
I will digress for a moment. In the wash up after the budget this week, we had both domestic and international commentators talking about the need for structural reforms in the workplace. I say to them, whether they are domestic or representatives of Zurich Insurance—and David Hale finds himself on Australian television often these days—`Why don't you just come clean and tell the people what you are talking about? When you talk about structural reforms in the workplace you are talking about reduction in wages and conditions. You are talking about, at the least, reduction of protection in terms and conditions of employment. That is what you are talking about. That is what this government is on about.
If the government wants a workplace like they have in the United States where people have to rely on tips, by way of charity, to ensure that they have accommodation and food to sustain themselves and their families, why isn't it brave enough and honest enough to say so? Sitting in Zegna suits on international television telling Australian workers that they do not need protection against avaricious employers and business is a bit rich for me. This is what this part of the legislation is about. It is about ensuring that government can remove terms and conditions of employment, and remove them in a non-accountable way.
If you want to make this legislation a trigger for a double dissolution, then the focus of that trigger will not be the legislative instruments proposals and all the technical details we have spent canvassing this morning and yesterday; it will be the public sector. Our message to the public sector will be: this legislation takes away reviewability and the Senate's capacity to protect you against governments removing your terms and conditions. That is the message from this legislation. If you are going to be foolhardy enough 
 in your ideological zealotry to go out there and use this as a trigger for a double dissolution, we will make sure that the public sector knows that this bill, together with the Public Service Bill 1997, is geared towards removing their protection against government unlawful and unfair interference with well and long fought for terms and conditions of employment.
We say to the government: if you want to reform the public sector, if you want to reform the public sector terms and conditions of employment, do it honestly and do it through the Public Service Bill. We will not let you do it through this particular piece of legislation. We will not let you change legislation to an extent that the Senate's role is removed from the process. Until such time as the Public Service Act is changed, then arrangements relating to disallowance of instruments arising under it should not be changed either. That is the basic position here.
As I said, it is incredible that the government is pursuing a non-negotiation approach in this legislation and pursuing it to the extent that it may be used as a trigger for a double dissolution. But in the circumstances that it may—maybe the government does want a double dissolution—I point out to other government senators who may be listening from their offices that some of them should enjoy those offices for the moment because a good half a dozen at least will not be back here. If the government does embark upon a double dissolution, then the likelihood, in fact the probability, is that six or seven of government backbenchers and maybe the odd frontbencher will not see themselves back in this place.
 With the Prime Minister's hell-bent intention of using Wik and other legislation as a trigger for a double dissolution, you have to ask yourselves: what is the rationale? What is the prospect of a conservative government, for instance, with a reduction of numbers in the Senate being able to get through legislation that it wants to not only during the next three years if it is successful but also at a joint sitting? That is the other point that needs to be taken into account by governments that 
 want to pursue a double dissolution at the moment. The way the polls are, what is most likely is a very close result. To actually get a majority in a joint sitting, this government would need to get a majority of at least seven or eight, if not 10, in the House of Representatives. The likelihood of that happening, according to the polls at the moment, is not all that strong.
 I say to anyone who might be listening, and I hope this message does get through to Senator Vanstone at least: this legislation should not be used as a trigger for a double dissolution. The government should be showing some flexibility here. We are on this side. We are not pursuing quite a number of our amendments, but an amendment we will pursue is one that protects the wages and conditions of the public sector.

These two amendments refer to clause 66 on page 70 and relate to the sunsetting recommendations. If you look at clause 66, page 70 at line 6 and line 8, you will find that, in terms of the sunsetting of legislative instruments, it says:

(b) any legislative instrument that confers heads of power on a self-governing Territory; or

It is our view that the government has an appropriate case that this should be made, but we recognise the dangers of it, and those are the dangers, no doubt, that the opposition sees in it. I think it is said that something like 2,000 treaties affect Australia and there are numerous conventions and so on that we are signatories to. Although we understand the government's purpose, we sought to make it clear that the international obligation could not just be a side issue within a larger regulation but that it had to refer to the sole or principal purpose which is to give effect to an international obligation, because otherwise you might have a regulation or an instrument of which only one small part might be an international obligation.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  is a bill which contains a large number of unrelated but nonetheless significant tax matters. It includes the introduction of the new government dissavings rebate scheme, together with the major proposed change to the superannuation system, known as the `choice regime'. This debate takes place against the background of the so-called tax reform debate taking place in Australia at the moment. I say `so-called' because there is no debate really taking place and that is for the reason that the government—specifically the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello—refuse to participate in a debate.
It is a fair question as to why the government will not come clean on this issue. Why has the promised discussion paper on the taxation of trusts been suppressed, for example? Is it because so many coalition frontbenchers—19 in all—have trusts, the most notorious being the trust arrangements of Senator Parer? Is it because so many coalition backbenchers have trusts and this government is more interested in protecting the financial 
 interests of its members—exemplified by Senator Parer—than it is about doing something effective about tax avoidance in this area?
We have the ludicrous situation where these two leaders of the government—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—are constantly denigrating Australia's tax system generally through false claims and wild exaggerations of the scale of particular problems, yet they absolutely refuse to tell us what they are planning to do. There is no doubt there is an electoral ambush in the making.
What they are engaged in is a concerted effort to falsely worry Australian business people and families into thinking that the Australian taxation system is broken. We know, and we have certainly argued, that that is patently untrue. The truth of the matter is that the tax system is in very much better shape than it was when Labor came into power in the early 1980s. Then it was fair to say that the tax system really was broken, and it was broken because of the negligent stewardship of the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister. It was broken because paying tax was made optional for those with access to specialist taxation advice. The then Treasurer, Mr Howard, refused to act for years on the taxation advice provided by Taxation Commissioner O'Reilly. He was deliberately protecting a small minority of the community, as is demonstrated by the protection and total support he has now given to Senator Parer.
Looking at the specific provisions of the bill, I wish to focus on superannuation choice provisions, the savings rebate provisions, dividend streaming and the changes to private company shareholder loans. Schedule 5 of the bill implements the government's policy on choice of superannuation fund. The introduction of this policy is arguably one of the most significant changes to superannuation since Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee in 1992 and will change the entire nature of the superannuation industry.
Public debate on choice of superannuation funds has highlighted the unsatisfactory attempts by other countries to introduce choice of superannuation fund, particularly the United Kingdom and Chile, and the impact 
 which the failure of choice of fund has had on the retirement incomes of people in those countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, some 570,000 people were sold inappropriate retirement income products as a result of the introduction of the Thatcher government's superannuation choice model, which this government has adopted. The compensation bill for those people is currently $10 billion and climbing. If that were to happen in Australia, it would be the end of superannuation.
What those experiences of other countries suggest is that any choice of fund proposal should be carefully scrutinised by the parliament before it is introduced. To that end, Labor supports a Senate inquiry into the choice of fund, with Labor and Democrat senators recommending that the government's bill not be passed without substantial amendment. The government has got it wrong on the choice of fund issue.
The government claims that its choice model will benefit consumers through increased competition in the superannuation industry, leading to lower fees and charges and thus resulting in better retirement incomes. However, the evidence suggests otherwise. A recent survey of 354 superannuation funds by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes reported that the government's choice of fund model will lead to increased costs to fund members. The survey stated that 87 per cent of funds believe that choice of fund will increase fund administration costs, with the cost increasing by some 10 per cent.
Alarmingly, around 10 per cent of the funds surveyed believed that costs would increase by up to 50 per cent. A cost increase of that order would have a disastrous effect on the retirement incomes of thousands of Australians. And that is before anyone has even made a choice of fund that could see uninformed people end up in inappropriate funds with high fees and charges and comparatively low returns.
In addition, the government's choice of fund proposal is certain to disadvantage employers through increased administrative costs of up to $21 million initially and recurrent costs of up to $15 million per year. 
 These figures are provided by the government in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that introduces its choice model—the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997.
There is also a strong likelihood that employers may be legally liable under its choice model in a number of ways, despite attempts to legislate away employers' potential legal liability in clause 32V of the same bill. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received evidence suggesting that it is impossible to legislate away the common law duty of care that employers must exercise towards their employees. Higher fees and charges and uninformed choices will result in lower returns to fund members and lower retirement income to Australians, which is inconsistent with broader retirement income policy.
Unfortunately, time does not allow me to further highlight the failures of the government's choice model, but I am sure that other speakers on my side of the parliament will do that.	Needless to say, I will pursue this matter in more detail in the committee stage of this debate.
I now turn to Labor's model. Labor believes we need a phased two-stage model which educates employers and employees about investment options and offers genuine employee choice. Stage 1 would be investment choice. Stage 1 requires superannuation funds with more than 50 fund members to offer a minimum of three investment choice options to fund members—that is, choice within existing funds. It would not be compulsory for members in a fund to exercise an investment choice if they chose not to do so, but a default fund arrangement could apply based on age-risk profiles. Due to their unique nature, defined benefit funds would be exempt from having to offer investment choice.
We recommend member investment choice as a first step forward for several reasons. Firstly, the option for funds to offer choice of investment already exists. It is set out in subsection 52(4) of the SIS Act. Secondly, investment choice within funds is a good way to begin to educate fund members about their retirement income options and control of their superannuation savings.
Thirdly, investment choice provides real options for choice as opposed to the government's model which could see consumers faced with identical choice options, just from different service providers. The clear example here is that we now have three commercial television channels in Australia. I remember when we had only two. We thought the addition of a third one would offer more choice. We have a third commercial television channel, but the programs are essentially all the same. Finally, an added feature of investment choice is a default investment option based on age-risk profiles. This would ensure that fund members do not find themselves in inappropriate investment products which are not suitable to maximising fund members' final retirement income.
Stage 2 of Labor's proposal concerns genuine employee choice of fund. Stage 2 of our proposal offers choice to those who should exercise it—employees. It would begin only after an extensive education and consumer protection campaign. I will now outline the key features of our genuine employee choice model. If an industrial award requires an employer to pay superannuation contributions to a specified superannuation fund on behalf of an employee, employees can nominate and, if employers agree, have superannuation contributions paid into a complying fund other than that set out in an industrial award. The nomination must be made in writing and must be signed by the employee. Employers and employees who negotiate a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement would be taken to have exercised choice.
Regulations would be drafted governing standard disclosure provisions applying to key feature statements offered by funds directly to employees, particularly to enable simple comparison of fees, charges and fund earnings—a most important issue. In the event of a dispute between employer and employee, the Industrial Relations Commission would act as the independent arbitrator. Finally, where a workplace is not covered by an industrial award or agreement, the default fund would be that to which the majority of employees at that workplace belong. In the 
 event of a new business which is not covered by an industrial award or agreement, the fund specified in the designated award would apply.
Labor believes that this offers genuine choice of fund to employees. It more accurately reflects the demand for choice of superannuation fund from workers, rather than choice driven by government or by vested interests. It is simple to administer and avoids the complications of the government's model. It is broadly consistent with the choice of fund models which presently operate in the New South Wales and Queensland state jurisdictions, therefore leading to less confusion and creating greater national consistency between state and federal choice of fund models.
Employers and employees would have the protection of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in settling disputes. It limits employer liability compared with what the government is putting forward, it would avoid the default fund problems that the government model has, and it would also avoid some of the transitional problems in the two models that the government's bill contains.
If unsuccessful, Labor proposes to move a range of amendments on the choice legislation in the Senate. Briefly, they include: exemption of funds which already offer member investment choice within funds; excision of clause 32U, which overrides federal award provisions and inclusion of award contributions; an intention to ban or severely limit the sale of products where a financial adviser derives income through the use of trailing commissions—this was a major problem with the UK choice fiasco; minimum standards for default funds, including insurance and investment options based on age-risk profiles; a redefinition of industry based funds to exclude funds with high fees and charges; inclusion of third-line forcing provisions which prevent employers from gaining a financial benefit at the expense of their employees; and an amendment which may require funds to be year 2000 compliant before they can accept superannuation guarantee contributions under the new choice arrangements.  
Labor's amendments will make the bill much fairer and simpler to administer, while still allowing employees the opportunity to choose a superannuation fund, not have one forced on them unnecessarily by their employer.
Turning now to the other provisions of the bill, schedule 8 deals with the problem of dividend streaming. Dividend streaming, in its simplest form, is where a company streams franked dividends to its shareholders who are best placed to take advantage of the attached franking rebate and hence minimise tax. More likely than not, such shareholders are Australian residents, as foreign shareholders or exempt bodies either have no use for or can make no use of the attached franking rebates. Hence a foreign shareholder may be paid unfranked dividends and Australian residents a disproportionate amount of franked dividends in order to maximise the tax advantage which franked dividends provide.
This schedule will introduce general anti-avoidance rules to such schemes that are used to obtain a tax advantage in relation to the imputation credits. These general anti-avoidance rules will supplement the specific provisions for anti-streaming and the announced but as yet not introduced provisions aimed at countering trading in imputation credits. The opposition supports these changes.
One would hope that these changes will also put an end to the blatant dividend streaming arrangements entered into, supervised and implemented, for example, in the tax dodging case of Senator Parer. As we know, Senator Parer has a dividend streaming arrangement through the AQRM trust which holds one H class share in Senator Parer's coal company QCMM Pty Ltd. From the writ lodged by Senator Parer's former business associate, Mr Adams, we know that the AQRM trust was established for the sole purpose of creating a pool of fully franked dividends from which bonuses to key directors and employees would be paid. Given that Senator Parer was Chairman of QCMM Pty Ltd, one would safely assume that he was a beneficiary of this blatant dividend streaming arrangement.  
As we know, Senator Parer has a penchant for tax avoidance schemes, having participated in no less than three of them, including the AQRM dividend streaming trust. I would therefore ask the minister—he is not in the chamber at the moment, but when he does appear—whether he can advise on the status of Senator Parer's dividend streaming arrangements facilitated by the AQRM trust under these amendments, and whether or not it will become void. If he cannot answer that question in his second reading speech, then I put the minister on notice that we will have a very long and interesting committee stage of this debate.
Schedule 9 of the bill seeks to ensure that all forms of advances by way of loans or other credits made by private companies to shareholders are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that such payments are made out of company profits in the form of tax-free distributions. This has been a fairly common practice in order to disguise the real form of the payments being made so as to avoid tax.
Evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee from the Australian Taxation Office was such that the current section 108 of the tax act has been shown to be ineffective due to relevant AAT and subsequent court cases. Consequently, a tightening up of the provisions is called for. The Labor opposition supports these changes and notes the plethora of amendments the government has subsequently introduced to clean up its original farcical drafting, which included payments such as SGC obligations under the original definition of benefit and hence were deemed to be dividends and therefore taxable.
Once again, this amendment strikes right at the heart, one would hope, of another tax avoidance scheme, no doubt masterminded and implemented in the form of Senator Parer's schemes. It is becoming a sad state of affairs, but Senator Parer seems totally unable to keep his hands out of the public till. As an artful tax dodger, it is like a child—
—Order! Senator Cook, I think you should withdraw that.
—I withdraw that.
—That is going a bit too far.
—Let us look at the scheme engineered by Senator Parer regarding the disguising of company dividends paid by QCMM Pty Ltd as non-taxable company loans. Once again, the writ lodged by Mr Adams is very illuminating about the operation of this scheme. According to the writ, which is available from the Queensland Supreme Court Registry, Mr Adams states in his affidavit:
There was a delay of almost two years in the issuing of the shares. During that time, payments were made to the proposed shareholders notionally on account of dividends on such shareholdings. The payments were calculated according to the approved value of the shareholdings and were processed in the books as loans.
What can be plainer than that? Notional dividends declared on shares that have not yet been issued but are disguised as non-taxable loans. And who has their hands in that arrangement? That is Senator Parer.
I am also concerned that during the committee hearings into this bill, I asked the Australian Taxation Office specifically how it could be possible to declare notional dividends on shares that do not exist and then to show them as loans in company accounts. The ATO's response was that they did not understand the concept of what notional dividends were.

The Australian Democrats are very mindful that this bill contains a number of important, if unrelated, measures—it is really an omnibus bill. Most of these measures flow from the 1997 budget and are, therefore, way overdue for consideration—indeed, the savings tax rebate was the centrepiece of the government's 1997 budget announcements.
The Australian Democrats acknowledge that—everything else being equal—there is virtue in moving towards budget balance and 
 a moderate surplus. But surpluses are only warranted if they are achieved without causing hardship in the community. And hardship has been the cost of the deregulatory policies and the economic rationalist policies of both treasurers Keating and Costello, particularly from the cost-cutting policies of the current government.
We believe the increasing division of Australian society under these policies is ripping the fabric of Australian society. Governments are not just here to provide a level playing field for business. In a liberal democratic society—and that is a small `l'- governments have roles in nation building, in supporting the development of a sense of community, and in providing the forms which give effect to cultural and social development and national self-definition. Governments also have a responsibility to provide services and to ensure that we provide opportunities and support for those in difficulties, whilst improving our standard of living and our national wealth.
A different route is required to achieve budget balance and surplus. Rather than slashing expenditure, the aim of balancing the budget can be achieved—in part—by closing tax loopholes and by eliminating other measures which reduce revenue without serving worthwhile social or industry development goals. We need to bear in mind that Australia can cope with additional taxes, as it is one of the lowest taxing countries in the OECD. Against that background, several of the measures in the bill are laudable, and the Democrats will not impede their signing into law.
However, the bill, as submitted into the House of Representatives, was sloppy in many respects. The government conceded this in developing its 83 amendments, which have now been incorporated into the revised bill. But problems remain, and while we will be moving amendments to address some of these, we consider it the responsibility of the government—not our own—to fix most of the glitches.  
I have to say, too, that the government has been its own enemy with regard to this bill. It is the government which determines its 
 legislative program and the government had strongly stated that it intended to deal with the bill last year and, then, well prior to Easter. On this basis the Australian Democrats agreed to the rapid consideration of this bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and to an early reporting date. Mr Chairman, you were intimately involved in this matter and you suffered some stress as a result.
In the event, the bill has not been considered until now. The rushed reporting date meant that the committee had totally inadequate time to deal with a number of very complex, detailed and important tax issues. We had the farcical situation of witnesses before the committee hearing being unable to discuss the bill confidently, since they had not had time to assess whether the government's 83 amendments to the bill had met their concerns. The other consequence of misleading the Senate and senators as to the timing of bringing on of the bill is to make us less inclined to believe the government again, and that is regrettable.
The Australian Democrats again place on record our objection to the government's practice of squeezing the legitimate deliberations of committees to meet unrealistic projections for Senate consideration of government legislation. It is not the government's practice with regard to every bill, but in a number of bills recently it has been the case, and it is to be deeply regretted.
I now want to deal with the substantial elements of the bill. One of the major elements is superannuation and the choice that exists within superannuation. I will leave that area to my colleague, Senator Allison, who will speak separately on that matter.
Turning to the remainder of the bill, I will address, firstly, the payment of reportable payment systems, known as RPSs; prescribed payment systems, known as PPSs; and pay-as-you-earn deductions, known as PAYEs. In general, we have no problem with the schedule, which allows for the more efficient payment of these deductions, reducing considerably the		expenses of the Australian Taxation Office.
We do, however, question whether it is reasonable to make it effectively	compulsory for large remitters to do so electronically rather than by otherwise valid forms of payment. It is clear that the Taxation Office has	an interest in encouraging remitters to do so electronically. However, a penalty of $500 each time for not using electronic means can come to an annual penalty of $26,000.
The Australian Democrats will consider whether the Australian Taxation Office should be obliged not to apply the $500 penalty without consideration of individual	circumstances and to discuss with individual remitters their particular situations and their abilities to remit cheaply in this way. We also suggest that the government—or the next government—re-assess this measure after a year of operation and consider whether there should be any amendment.
In terms of the franking of dividends and other distributions, considerable concern was raised in the Senate hearings about these provisions. A principal criticism is that the test for catching an action is that gaining a franking credit benefit is `an other than incidental' rather than `a dominant' purpose. Several witnesses expressed concern that this would catch franking arrangements which are otherwise legitimate in their intent and operation. Witnesses also criticised the lack of a definition of `dividend streaming' and its retrospectivity.
The Australian Democrats consider there may be problems with the drafting of this schedule. However, within the limitations of the committee considerations, we had inadequate time to explore the provisions and to refine improvements. In any case, we consider that it is the responsibility of the government with its extensive executive resources to ensure that the drafting of a bill is satisfactory. This schedule is one which could be flagged for reconsideration when there is the inevitable rewrite of taxation law next year following the election. Having said this, the Australian Democrats support the intention of this schedule to minimise taxation loss in this area and will not oppose its passage through the Senate. Distributions from private companies are dealt with in  schedule 9. What a 
 mess that has been. Again, there were major drafting problems with this schedule. While it is essential that a democratic state have community watchdogs out there who help us by alerting us to the dangers of any particular legislation, we should not need to rely on them as much as we were forced to here. Fortunately, those watchdogs did growl loudly. It also suggests that the Australian Taxation Office or the Treasury—or both—may need to review their consultation processes and listen more carefully to the concerns raised by special groups in the industry before submitting legislation.
To the government's credit, though, they did change their own legislation with a truckload of amendments and they did respond to well expressed community concern. And we thank them for that. In large measure, concerns with the schedule seem to have been addressed as a consequence but, in the Senate committee, witnesses indicated that there some outstanding technical problems. Again, we consider that it is for the government to address these problems rather than for non-government parties to be devoting their limited resources to trying to do so. The schedule is nonetheless very important in clawing back an estimated $110 million over three years in what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) likes to refer to as tax rorts.
There is one important area we do want to address, and that is in relation to employee share ownership schemes. The Democrats, as the Senate knows—and many senators agree with us on this—are great supporters of employee share ownership schemes and would like to see as many employees as possible participating in the enterprises which they work for. 	The coalition's 1996 pre-election policy on employee share ownership plans emphasised the importance of such plans improving national savings. The coalition promised to widen the taxation incentives for employee share ownership plans. We will be moving to ensure that such plans are indeed not caught up by this schedule and continue to be given preferential treatment.
Finally, I will speak to the last schedule of this bill, which relates to the savings rebate. We recognise that this was a key feature of 
 the 1997 budget. The Australian Democrats support measures to increase Australian private savings as a means of reducing overseas borrowing requirements, as a means of financing Australian business development, and as a means of advancing Australia's national wealth. To this end, the rapid growth of Australian superannuation funds to $326 billion is extremely pleasing—and we believe that the Labor government that preceded the present government should take credit for much of that effort. I should say though that the Democrats would discourage the investment of too much of those funds overseas, because that does not necessarily benefit Australia as much as it otherwise could.
The current amount invested overseas is $52 billion—or some 16 per cent. I recognise it is a moot point as to how much is how much, but it is an area on which we are alert to dangers. Unfortunately, we believe that the savings rebate will not achieve that aim of increasing savings. Let us be honest. Since last year's budget the measure has not had a happy stay in the anteroom of the parliamentary doctor. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) renouncing his personal claim to the rebate pretty well immediately—which was not exactly a clever way to say that he thought it was a good idea—before it became clear that the rebate would be provided automatically by the Australian Taxation Office. That also indicated that it was a fruitless gesture. But, worse, we had Treasury revealing that the rebate would actually reduce net national savings.
—`A big risk', in Mr Evans's words.
—Yes. It is that which is the fatal problem with this schedule. The reason that it reduces net savings is that it will not adequately change individual investor behaviour. High income earners will be rewarded for doing what they are already doing. The wealthy do not need encouragement to save. Regrettably, low income workers will be limited in their ability to take advantage of the measure because their incomes are already committed to the day-to-day expenditures which keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. If you want the 
 lower income members of our society to save, you need to progress policies which actually advance their standard of living, advance their income, and allow them to become more productive members of the community. But it is those who are better off in society that we must look to at present for savings.
With three to four per cent for cash interest rates, the taxpayer needs to have $75,000 to $100,000 in bank savings to earn the top rebate. The rebate in this case is capped at too high a level, in our view. The reward for superannuation is more easily achieved, as only $3,000 is required to achieve the same maximum benefit of $450.
This bill moves the rebate part of the way in the right direction. It should be targeted towards medium-term and long-term savings. One of the most important initiatives governments have taken over the last decade is to address the issues of lengthening life expectancies, consequent longer periods spent in retirement, and the projected increase in the ratio of those who are retired to those still in the work force. We have had to find ways to support people in providing for themselves in their retirement so they can retain a decent lifestyle when it will be impossible for the state to provide adequate pensions from year to year revenue. Both the preceding government and this government have been alert to that problem.
With this in mind, the Australian Council of Social Service, known as ACOSS, suggested four principles for making the rebate more effective and equitable. Firstly, the rebate should be restricted to long-term financial savings such as those through superannuation and financial institution accounts maintained for at least five years. Secondly, the rebate should be linked to contributions and deposits rather than interest so as to make savings of smaller amounts worthwhile. Thirdly, the rebate should be added to the account rather than paid to the taxpayer directly. Fourthly, the rebate should extend to compulsory superannuation so that low and middle income wage earners can significantly benefit or, at the very least, be restricted to longer term financial savings other than superannuation and to be strictly income tested.
The Australian Democrats, before the 1996 election, said that the savings rebate should be targeted towards longer term savings and be means tested. The coalition has changed its own pre-election views on the savings initiative. Specifically, it has changed from a concessional tax rate to a rebate. But, more importantly, the coalition government has removed the income threshold at the same time as scrapping the superannuation employer contributions. The income threshold is vital if we are to achieve equity in the taxation system, for this is a very expensive measure, and it is a very expensive measure which will result—to repeat what I said earlier—in a net reduction in savings.
Last year's budget projected losses in revenue of $350 million, then of $1.4 billion and a massive $2 billion over the next three financial years—totalling nearly $4 billion. It makes little sense to be enacting this measure so shortly before an election for which the central issue, the government tells us, will be taxation reform. Two billion dollars per year of rebates is a significant mass in the overall scheme of taxation revenues. Certainly, such an ad hoc measure would be reshaped within a sensible, comprehensive overhaul of the Australian taxation system.
The Australian Democrats, therefore, suggest that this close to an election the measure should be delayed until savings measures have been comprehensively debated within the broader context of producing an equitable, effective tax system which advances national wealth. I suspect the government might prefer to do this as well, and I would be surprised if their tax reform committee is not looking at this very issue. Nevertheless, if the government does proceed with this measure so as to keep its commitments from before the election and the last budget, we will move an amendment. Consistent with the government's 1996 pre-election commitment, we will move to phase out the rebate between $35,000 and $39,000.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  that the Senate is considering deals with a range of very important provisions. The issue that I intend to make a contribution 
 on today relates to the so-called introduction of choice of superannuation products. There are a range of other matters relating, for example, to the rebate. I have made a contribution on previous occasions on that issue. There are a range of other pieces of legislation with respect to superannuation choice in the industrial relations area and the public sector area, and I will make a contribution when that legislation comes before the Senate.
Firstly, let me give a brief overview of current superannuation arrangements in Australia. Superannuation has been compulsory for employees in Australia since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge by the then Keating Labor government. At the time, it was controversial, but it is now hailed as a universally necessary measure in order to boost both national savings and individual retirement incomes. It is currently six per cent of wages, rising to nine per cent by the year 2001-02.
These contributions are made by the employer, but they are moneys that belong to the employee and, in part, they are superannuation contributions in lieu of a wage increase. These funds are administered by the private sector, and they are administered and managed, in the main, by independent, non-profit trusts, either through a company or industry fund structure. In both these cases, there are joint employer and employee trustees. The trustees, who exercise management decisions, tender in a competitive way for the administration, investment and insurance products for the funds that they manage. Trustees, using their economy of scale, bargain very successfully on behalf of their individual members. They are cost efficient, reliable and safe, and enjoy a good long-term average return.
Another product in the superannuation market is personal superannuation. It is often sold by agents. We have also recently had the entry of banks into the superannuation market with retirement savings accounts, commonly known as RSAs. In respect of personal superannuation products they have often been criticised, I think justifiably, for their high administrative charges. In respect to RSAs, they are certainly delivered at a reasonable 
 cost in terms of administration, but they are a low return product.
What does superannuation choice mean? If we look at the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Miles, it is interesting to note, initially, that the government's explanation for superannuation choice is only five paragraphs long. This is interesting because the measure we are considering is one of the most radical and far-reaching changes that will affect millions of Australians. It will have a very significant implication. I find it disturbing that there is only a five-paragraph contribution in the second reading speech on this issue.
What does superannuation choice mean in reality? In reality, it is the deregulation of the retail market for superannuation in this country where the employer agrees. The effective choice is largely left to the employer.	That is a significant change to the government's original budget announcement. The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, made significant changes to effectively give the employer the right of veto over the choice made by employees. The Assistant Treasurer refers to the changes as `enhancements'. Effectively, it was a backdown in the face of employer pressure to ensure that the employer had the right of veto.
We are not considering legislation that gives the employee the right of choice. But, in reality, what does choice mean? Effectively, as I have said, it is the deregulation of the retail end of the market. Before I make some comments about the implications of that, I should emphasise that there is a form of choice in respect of the superannuation market at the present time. There is choice of investment within a significant number of superannuation funds that currently exist. In many of the funds that offer the product, a member can indicate the sort of investment area they want their moneys invested in. That is a feature that is emerging more and more in the range of superannuation funds that exist in this country.
It is also interesting that this government has identified choice as an issue since the advent of the superannuation guarantee and of industry superannuation funds. It is interesting 
 to note that it never regarded choice as an issue when superannuation was confined to a minority of the work force in this country and confined, largely, to in-house employer funds.
I would like to make a few comments about the theory of competition. Assurances are given in Mr Miles's speech and by Senator Kemp and others. Mr Miles said:
The choice of fund arrangements are designed to give employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn give them greater sense of ownership of these savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.
Let me emphasise that last sentence again:
The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.
That is the claim by the government. Let me deal with the theory of competition, because it is very important when considering the issue of choice. The theory of competition relies on a number of important criteria. The two relevant criteria here are, firstly, that superannuation should be delivered by a significant number of players. We should not have an oligopoly or a monopoly; there should be a considerable range of products from which to make a choice. That criterion certainly exists in the superannuation industry.
The second important criterion for competition is product knowledge and understanding. This will be very important in respect of the individual Australians, the individual consumers, who will be compulsorily required to make a choice as a consequence of this legislation.
I am very sceptical. In fact, I am sure that there is a very limited product knowledge held by the millions of Australian consumers who will be required to make this choice. Interestingly, at the hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, there was considerable evidence about the lack of knowledge of Australian consumers in this area.
I note that Mr Ken Lockery, who is the principal of Towers Perrin, noted that the majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds would not receive any 
 benefit and that they might, instead, suffer a net economic loss as a result of the introduction of choice, simply because their individual knowledge of making a choice about a superannuation product is very limited and, in many cases, non-existent.
If there is to be a choice, it is important that it is an informed choice. The Australian consumer should be able to sit down and make a valid comparison between various superannuation products and the costs and returns associated with the range of products on offer. In that regard, education is very important and it is critical to Australians making an informed choice. Education is a great deal more than a well- planned advertising and, I would argue, propaganda campaign by funds as to the different products they offer. Of course, there also needs to be a sufficient time period in which to conduct an education campaign.
Even with a properly presented education campaign directed at the Australian community, I am very sceptical about us being able to adequately inform Australians as to making an informed choice of superannuation product. Let us assume that we can educate millions of Australians to the level of financial literacy required to make an informed choice. What about the 2.5 million Australians who are either illiterate or functionally illiterate? What hope is there of educating those 2.5 million Australians adequately in order for them to make an informed choice.
Choice has been introduced in two countries, and disturbing evidence of the significant problems which have arisen has come from both those countries—the United Kingdom and Chile. Firstly, let me deal with the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the Thatcher conservative government decided to allow employees to opt out of their company pension fund and set up a personal pension arrangement instead—indeed, they were forced to.

—Order! It being 12.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted.   ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment Bill 1998  amends part 4A of the Student Youth Assistance Act 1973, which deals with Austudy and Abstudy financial supplements. The financial supplement is a loan scheme under which students can obtain $2 on loan for every $1 of Austudy or Abstudy entitlement, up to a maximum of $3,500. This scheme, which was one of the innovations of the former Labor government, is designed to benefit students and to provide them with greater flexibility in income support. This is in stark contrast to the harsh treatment that students have received under the coalition.
The financial supplement loans are repaid through the tax system, but not for the first five years after they have been made available. On 1 July of this year, the first loan recipients, those from 1993, will be required to start repayments if their taxable income exceeds the minimum threshold. The minimum level at which repayments begin—$29,307—is set at the annual equivalent of average weekly earnings and requires payments at the rate of two per cent of annual income. At an income level of $33,305, three per cent repayments apply, rising to four per cent at the income level of $46,629.
These thresholds are the same, after indexation, as those that applied under Labor's HECS scheme. Under the coalition government, the HECS repayment threshold is set at the ridiculously low level of less than $21,000. We are pleased to note that the government has at least recognised in this bill that to pile further repayment obligations on students earning only $21,000 would be totally unreasonable. It is an extraordinary contrast that this particular measure has been maintained while the broader aspects of the HECS changes have forced students to undertake such unreasonable burdens.
The financial supplement scheme provided loans for around 44,000 students in 1993, its first year of operation. While the vast majority of these still have some outstanding debt, it is not known how many will be required to commence repayments in the 1998-99 tax year because their income levels are also unknown. By 1996, around 13 per cent of Austudy and Abstudy recipients, or 68,000 students, were taking out loans under this scheme.
This bill also introduces a 14-day cooling-off period for financial supplement applications. This means that students can have a full two weeks to consider their financial options and whether to proceed with trading their Austudy entitlements for twice as much in the form of a loan. If they wish, students can choose to have earlier access to loan funds, thus waiving the cooling-off period. The opposition supports this refinement.
With the passage of the youth allowance legislation, students currently receiving Austudy will be dealt with by the Department of Social Security, although Abstudy recipients will remain with DEETYA. It is disappointing to note that the full details of the financial supplement scheme are not spelt out in legislation setting up the youth allowance or the Austudy payment to apply to students aged 25 years and over. Under the amendments to the Social Security Act passed by the Senate this week, the financial supplement scheme is referred to only in general terms, raising concerns that the government plans to make the Labor initiative less generous to students.
The opposition has been assured by Senator Newman that administrative difficulties have been the cause of this omission. As I indicated in the debate earlier this week, I am concerned at the resources of the department not being made available to ensure that these measures were fully spelt out in the legislation currently before the parliament. We have been given to believe that the government will rectify this situation by the end of the year if at all possible. I look forward to that assurance being met and to seeing legislation put down to ensure that these provisions are reflected in a legislative framework. In terms 
 of the bill before us, the opposition supports the legislation.",SENATE,<title>STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-14,"—The Democrats support the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment Bill 1998 . We support the various technical and administrative amendments to this bill, including clarifying percentage amounts where there should be dollar amounts in relation to the discounts available to people paying back their loans. We also support the 14-day cooling-off period for people who are applying for the supplement. We think it is appropriate that people should be given the opportunity to reconsider their supplement request.
I place on record the concerns that the Democrats have had with the operation of a loans or a supplement scheme. I was reading through comments by former senator and Democrat education spokeswoman Karen Sowada who debated this legislation on behalf of my party in 1992. The concerns that she stated in the chamber then are the same concerns that the Democrats have today with a system that, instead of providing for an adequate system of student financial support in the form of grants, relies on supplementation in the form of loans. It should be resourced in a way that enables people to have a livable income. In that debate, Karen Sowada said the her concerns were that:
Instead of redressing the blatant inequities in Austudy, this scheme is what the Government is actually offering the struggling students of this country. Loans will be available to those students eligible for Austudy and Abstudy—those students who are, by definition, the hardest hit and the poorest in our community.
She thought it was inappropriate that those people who were already struggling to participate or to enter into the higher education system should be slugged further with incurring a debt.
While the Democrats are the first to suggest that students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, should have access to some form of student assistance, we believe it should be available in a grants form because the loans scheme only ensures that students are saddled with increasing amounts 
 of debt. I should note that, in light of the recent changes to the higher education contribution scheme and also the possibility of up-front fees and charges under the current government, it is not unrealistic to believe that many students in Australia will have debts at least the equivalent of the cost of their parents' house.
Various research studies have indicated that, for example, a student studying a law degree over four or perhaps even five years at the rate of at least $5,500 per annum in HECS debt, not to mention comparable loans that they may incur, will have huge amounts to repay at the end of their degree or when the threshold kicks in. As Senator Carr said, that threshold is at an inappropriate and unrealistic level these days at just over $21,000. That is something again that the Democrats do not support.
I urge the government today to do something about ensuring that there is an adequate level of support and financial assistance to students in this country. We know that Austudy or the loan supplement by no means provides a livable income for many young people and for students. I draw the attention of the chamber and in particular the minister to the National Union of Students' Commonwealth budget submission for this year which points out how you could ensure that students were on a livable income—that is, one that is over the poverty level—not the current levels of student assistance which we know are at best around 60 per cent of the poverty line and on average around 35 per cent of the poverty line. Perhaps the government could take some clues from that submission as to how we can ensure that students are assisted with their studies and are resourced in a way that not only enables them to buy study materials but also to have such basic things as shelter and food.
The Democrats have long called for the reform of student financial assistance in relation to the eligibility criteria and in relation to the amounts paid and we will continue that campaign. I also acknowledge that elements of the bill before us are contingent on the passage of the common youth allowance legislation.   
While I will not discuss the bill that is specifically before the parliament, I note there is considerable community debate on to some of its negative aspects, specifically how 16- and 17-year-olds will survive without benefits if they are not in employment, education and training. There is also the long debated issue of how we define `independence'; that is, the age at which young people and in particular students qualify for the independent rate of Austudy and other financial assistance. That is not assisted by the government's proposal that students should be dependent upon their family until the age of 25 in the common youth allowance bill. That is an issue we have raised not only during the loans debate in 1992 but also before that.
I bring to the attention of the chamber once again the fact that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—I do not know at whose request—organised a media strategy document to counter some of these negative criticisms and concerns.
—No, Social Security.
—Sorry, the Department of Social Security.
—DEETYA is not that bad.
—DEETYA hardly exists any more, Senator Carr, they have cut it back so much. I wonder whether it is an unprecedented move to target individuals in the parliament, me in particular and a member in the other house. Rather than criticising those people who might raise concerns about how families are going to support their students—I will not say `children' because it implies that they are very young and, in fact, I do not consider someone the age of 25 to be a child as such—and coming up with strategies to target those people who may air those concerns, perhaps the government could look at ways to assist those families and reorganise the student financial assistance in a way that actually provides people with a livable income so they can enter into, and participate in, higher and other levels of education.",SENATE,<title>STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

The speech read as follows—
CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1997
Madam President,
I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this Bill.
The Crimes Amendment (Forensic) Procedures Bill 1997 represents the fulfilment of yet another commitment made by the previous Labor Government. In the much heralded Justice Statement , launched in May 1995, the previous Labor Government committed itself to the introduction of, and I quote:
""a Forensic Procedures Bill to allow police to apply for court orders to take samples from suspected criminals for identification.""
As the Justice Statement  went on to state:
""The use of forensic samples is a very important tool in crime investigation. The compulsory taking of samples is necessary for effective law enforcement. A lack of such powers might advantage criminals. The Commonwealth legislation will build in substantial civil liberty safeguards.""
As the Justice Statement  promised, so the previous Labor Government delivered. Unlike some, we keep our promises. Later in 1995, the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 was introduced and passed through the House.
That bill was based on the Model Forensic Procedures Bill developed by the Model Criminal Code of fixers' Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.
In turn, the Model Bill drew on the recommendations of the Report on Body Samples and Examinations published by the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation.
The 1995 bill found its way to the Senate and, following consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported in October 1995, the bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued for the 1996 Federal election.
The bill currently before the House relies heavily on the 1995 Bill, although amendments have been made adopting most of the twenty unanimous recommendation of the Senate Committee. 

Only three of those recommendations have not been adopted in full.
Recommendations 1 and 3 sought to limit the power to take body samples and conduct examinations, particularly of breast swabs in the case of recommendation 3, to circumstances in which the offence was punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. The Government has applied this recommendation save that it has reduced the scope of the exception to apply it to indictable offences only.
It also appears, on the basis of further consideration, that the Senate Committee, in agreeing to recommendation 3, failed to fully appreciate the nature of the procedures contemplated by the relevant provisions.
Accordingly, the Labor Party believes that these amendments are appropriate.
Recommendation 2 prevented the taking of dental impressions. This recommendation was based on the state of forensic deontology as it was in 1995. I am advised that technological developments made since that time now mean that low-invasive techniques for the taking of dental impressions are now available.
Accordingly, the Labor Party also believes that this amendment is appropriate.
The bill was further referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional legislation Committee which reported back in December 1997. The majority on that Committee, which members of both the Government and the Opposition suggested only one further minor amendment.
More substantively, Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats made a number of recommendations the substance of which are now contained in the amendments moved on his behalf.
With the exception of amendment 14 which establishes a formal review of the operation of the Bill, the Labor Party will be opposing these amendments.
I have no doubt that they are born out of a genuine concern from the Australian Democrats that some of the provisions in this Bill may be abused. I believe, however, that they are misguided in that view. The Bill currently places very tight, often judicial control, on the undertaking on non-consensual intimate forensic procedures. Accordingly, we believe that these protections are sufficient.
The Democrats amendments make further limitations by, for example, defining as a ""suspect"" certain persons but not persons whom the ordinary members of the public would believe to be a suspect, in other words a person reasonably suspected of having committed a criminal offence. Such an amendment does not assist ordinary 
 Australians to understand the effect of the legislation nor is the amendment advisable.
The Democrats amendments would also prevent ordinary police officers from taking hair samples (other than pubic hair samples), samples of nails or from material under nails, handprints, fingerprints, footprints and toe prints. These are all activities regularly carried out by police officers and I can see no logical reason for preventing police officers from performing these actions in the future.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it follows that this Bill remains, in essence, and largely in substance, Labor's 1995 bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14,"—The model bill for forensic procedures circulated by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee is now before the parliament, and it raises some significant concerns. The bill gives the Australian Federal Police broad powers to conduct forensic procedures, ranging from finger and foot prints to taking samples of hair, and to initiate forensic procedures by having appropriately qualified persons taking genital swabs and other intimate samples. The bill distinguishes between intimate and non-intimate procedures, but there is no clear distinction between the two since the procedures are on a continuum from least intimate and intrusive to most intimate and intrusive.
There are conflicting views as to the need for the bill. On the one hand, the bill is presented as necessary to advance the protection of human rights, as it is clear that forensic procedures are not only in widespread use in police work but are also not properly managed at this time. On the other hand, the bill introduces new powers to take samples from persons who have not been charged with an offence and to force them to give these samples. At common law, there is no power presently to compel a suspect to provide a sample of his or her blood, hair, saliva or other bodily matter. Undoubtedly, the bill significantly erodes conventional civil liberties by altering this common law constraint. The question is whether the bill significantly advances the public good in so doing.
One way to measure this is to establish whether significantly advanced criminal detection rates will result from the bill. It is 
 readily apparent from the evidence put to the hearings that no such case is made by the proponents of the bill. There has been no quantification of an expected detection and conviction rate improvement. I would remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the question of quantifying the benefits of bills are well established in financial bills, and I would have thought a bill which alters our civil rights accordingly would have had its effect quantified. One inescapable issue dominates any consideration of the bill. The bill gives the police powers to detain and take samples from persons who have not been arrested or charged.
The development of the modern law of evidence has its origins in the 17th and 18th centuries. By and large, it is a collection of exclusionary rules, rules declaring that certain matters which might well be accepted as evidence of fact by other inquirers will not be accepted by the courts—rules declaring, in other words, what is not judicial evidence.
The evidence of a fact is that which tends to prove it—something which may satisfy an inquirer of the fact's existence. Courts of law usually have to find that certain facts exist before pronouncing on the rights, duties and liabilities of parties, and such evidence as they will receive in furtherance of this task is described as `judicial evidence'. Judicial evidence consists of testimony, hearsay, documents, things and facts which a court will accept as evidence of the facts to be debated in any given case. The main facts in issue are all those facts which the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt to succeed.
The main point is obviously relevance, and the main general rule governing the entire subject is that all evidence which is sufficiently relevant to an issue before the court is admissible and all that is irrelevant, or insufficiently relevant, should be excluded. It has been said that the first rule of evidence is relevance. It should perhaps be added that the first rule of collecting evidence should also be relevance. In legal terms, if the prosecution cannot prove that a piece of evidence is relevant to the case at hand, the judge will exclude it from the consideration of the jury.
In my view, and in the view of the Australian Democrats, the collection of evidence by any investigatory body should be relevant to a criminal investigation and admissible as evidence before a court of law. There is a general exclusionary ability in this bill. It enables the Australian Federal Police to detain, force a sample from and then exclude from any further inquiries any suspect they think is reasonable to deal with. The question of relevance is determined in these instances by the police, not by the courts.
Evidence of a fact is that which tends to prove it—something which may satisfy an inquirer of the fact's existence. That is not to say that all evidence is admissible. For instance, a telephone tap may tend conclusively to prove that someone is dealing in drugs. However, if the tap is not lawfully obtained, it may be ruled inadmissible by the court. In contrast to the United States where the courts are firmly of the opinion that illegally obtained evidence should be automatically excluded, Australian courts will admit illegally obtained evidence if, on a balanced analysis, the public good sufficiently outweighs the infringement of the legal protection.
As a society, we include as democratic principles the adherence to the rule of law—that is, citizens are ruled by laws and those administering them. Democratic dictates also require the respect for human rights and the protection of minorities against the possible coercive and oppressive power of the majority—thus the arguments for a bill of rights and constitutional protection against the tyranny of any given majority. It must be said that wide, unfettered discretion of this kind is, therefore, contrary to the concept of the rule of law as we have known it.
Contrary to popular belief, the police do not have any greater power to arrest than the average citizen. Lawful arrest is the only circumstance in which a citizen's personal liberty can be deprived, and then only according to the rule of law. The check against the abuse of this power lies in the civil law protection against unlawful imprisonment. This action is taken by the citizen against the arresting officer personally. The police officer must, therefore, be very clear that the action 
 of arrest is reasonable in all the circumstances.
Despite this apparent civil law protection, there have been cases where citizens have been unlawfully arrested. There are strict limits on the amount of time someone can be held under arrest before being charged, released or bailed, and we are all familiar with the writ of habeas corpus. In the present environment of legal aid cuts and increased court fees, it is questionable as to whether a citizen could now prosecute a successful civil law claim. In this bill, it is significant that the onus would be on the victim to assert their rights in the event of the powers being abused.
Fundamental to the criminal justice system is the presumption that someone is innocent until proven guilty. The onus is, therefore, placed upon the prosecution to rebut this presumption. The prosecution must provide evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused. This bill significantly alters the presumption by allowing the police to obtain evidence not only to prove guilt but also to now prove innocence. This represents a fundamental departure from what is commonly considered should be the role of law enforcement bodies in the criminal justice system.
The bill clearly intends that someone could have a body sample taken to prove that they were not an offender. This distorts the nexus of both relevance and probative value of evidence, which is fundamental to presumption of innocence and, we suggest, to the rule of law itself. If everyone is assumed innocent until proven guilty, there is no need to accumulate evidence to support a proposition that the law is already compelled to accept.
Although significantly altered in recent years, there is still a significant component of the presumption of innocence that says a person should not have to do the prosecution's job for them. The presumption of innocence dictates that the prosecution, not the accused, must prove the guilt. It must be stated that the bill significantly departs from this privilege because of the coercive nature of collecting the evidence. There is some weight in the argument that states, if you can 
 not be compelled to answer questions, the more significant removal of bodily matter, by requirement, should be at least on a par with that prohibition. The bill will make lawful activities by law enforcement agencies which are not presently lawful in any state or in the Commonwealth, except in Victoria. It actually extends police powers.
The point of contact of police with a citizen is the point where the state and its coercive powers are at their most significant. Some farmers, of course, maintain that the same applies when you have Customs officers knocking on your door. The intercession of the rule of law is what distinguishes democratic and just societies from despotic and oppressive regimes.
The nature of police work is unusual in so far as power and discretion is inverse to that of seniority and rank. In police work, young constables are the persons who engage the public the most and are authorised to carry arms and, in certain circumstances, use deadly force. In this bill, senior constables are authorised persons, and at the hearings the committee was given evidence that these persons would typically not be younger than 26 years old. By any number of criteria, the nature of police work includes a wide range of discretion.
At almost every point of contact with the citizen, the police officer makes decisions and value judgments about that citizen. While it is acknowledged that most policing necessarily involves the use of discretion, it is also true that the rule of law requires that this is limited to the absolute minimum. The Australian Democrats are not convinced of the necessity for all the bill's coercive and intrusive powers. We do accept, and we do support, the regularisation of current forensic procedures, the regularisation of data usage, and procedures for the storage and destruction of forensic samples.
It is quite clear that in our society and with modern technology this is an area which deserves the legislative attention of the Commonwealth. It is quite clear that the AFP do need guiding legislative principles. So we are not opposed to those elements of the bill, but we do think that the bill goes too far. 
 Accordingly, we have introduced a number of amendments, which I have circulated, on amendment sheet No. 840. Those amendments will seek to: restrict the use of coercive and pre-emptive police powers where not appropriate, limit the applications of sample procurement, require the police to provide training in forensic procedures policing and provide for appropriate review and reporting on the use of these powers.
We do think that this is a very important bill in terms of human rights, in terms of Australian civil rights and in terms of civil liberties. We do think it is important that the parliament considers the extreme possibilities that may arise out of the provisions of the bill. Therefore, we hope the amendments we have put forward to moderate it will be acceptable to the Senate.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-05-14,"—My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, Senator Herron. Can the minister confirm that expenditure on child-care assistance in 1997-98 was about $100 million less than anticipated in last year's budget? Does the government admit that this is because parents cannot afford formal care and instead are leaving paid work or putting their children into backyard care?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Madam President, maybe you could refer the minister to budget paper No. 4 this year. Can the minister confirm that the estimates of spending on child-care assistance for the outyears imply a further cut to child-care budgets of nearly $300 million in the next three years in addition to the $800 million already cut?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-05-14,"—I thank Senator Gibbs for her question because once again she raises the same Labor misinformation program. No, Senator Gibbs, I do not believe the statement that you have just made. The government has allocated $4.9 billion over four years to child care. There will be an extra 83,000 places over four years.
It is interesting that you sit next to Senator Crowley. She was the minister responsible for the unbridled overdevelopment of private day care centres which got totally out of control. They were built in the wrong places. Evidence was given before a Senate inquiry that 
 there were 16 child-care centres within one kilometre of each other. That occurred under the Labor government. So I dispute that statement, Senator Gibbs. As I have said, there will be an extra 83,000 places over four years. Currently, there are 493,880 families using formal child care—that is, 599,920 children.
Some $1.2 billion has been allocated to child care this year—an increase of 18 per cent since Labor's last year in office. We get this bleating—these complaints—from Labor that we are forcing women out. That is not true. The ABS Labor force figures show that the total participation rate for females with dependent children under 15 years of age has remained relatively stable since January 1996 at around 59 per cent.
Where are these women who are being chased out of the work force? They are not. The same percentage are in work now as under Labor. It has been the same figure since January 1996. In seasonally adjusted terms, participation rates for women with children have remained at a constant level of 59 per cent over the same period. The same misinformation program is going on. The Labor Party is running a scare campaign.
They have nothing else to go on after the tremendous budget that was delivered the other day. Inflation is the lowest it has been for 30 years. Housing interest rates are the lowest they have been in 28 years. Small business interest rates are the lowest they have been in 30 years. The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for eight years. Senator Cook was talking about the current account deficit. I looked it up. Under the Labor Party it averaged 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product. In our first year in government it was 3.5 per cent.
They are getting back to the old scare campaign about child-care centres because they have not got a feather to fly with in relation to the budget. You will remember, Madam President, the scare campaign and the misinformation campaign conducted by the Labor Party before the budget was brought down. They are going back to it because they have nothing else to talk about. They are dredging up the old stories about child-care 
 centres which are completely untrue. Senator Gibbs knows that they are completely untrue. If she does not she should talk to Senator Crowley. I will drag out the Crowley file. Let us have the Crowley file and we will produce the statements that Senator Crowley made.
—`Senator Crowley file' to you.
—The `Senator Crowley file', as Senator Faulkner says. My apologies. She should talk to the senator sitting next to her and she will get the truth of the matter.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-05-14,"—At times I start getting concerned about the ability of the Labor Party to read budget papers. I am sure my colleague Senator Kemp would be happy to explain the budget papers to Senator Gibbs. It is obvious that Senator Gibbs has not got the faintest idea about those budget papers. I have already stated in answer to her previous question that an extra $4.9 billion will be spent over the next four years. That means an extra 83,000 places over the next four years.
They make these allegations about various cuts. I know they have difficulty with the budget, as I have said before. I can understand why they had a $10.3 billion deficit in their last year in office. They cannot add up. They can subtract. They know how to spend. That is why we faced the debacle of a $10.3 billion deficit when we took over government.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), to questions without notice asked by Senators Schacht and Bourne and the Leader of the National Party (Senator Boswell) today, relating to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Radio Australia and the broadcasting of horse racing on television.
We saw here today, again, an example of the inability of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) to handle his portfolio in relation to the ABC. What we have seen is his persistent ideological attack on the ABC.
Today I asked Senator Alston a question about his most recent attack on the ABC and his claim of alleged bias over the way the ABC has handled its coverage of the waterfront dispute in recent weeks. From my reading of the record and various press clippings, around 27 and 28 April Senator Alston accused the ABC of biased coverage of the waterfront dispute and, in particular, an associated matter that they would not give publicity to a farmers rally in New South 
 Wales. He said that this was a clear case of bias and attacked the ABC.
This minister launched that attack, apparently without any discussion with the ABC. Some days later, after he launched that attack accusing them of bias and, therefore, of breaking their charter, et cetera, he sent a letter to the ABC. I made it clear that I thought the minister did have the right to send a letter to the ABC seeking clarification about matters he was concerned with, but not after he had already abused them and found them guilty by making a statement alleging bias. I think it would have been a much more appropriate process for this minister to have written to the ABC—in this case, to the Chairman of the ABC—seeking clarification on matters with which he was concerned. If he was not satisfied after he had the answer, it would have been quite appropriate for the minister to express a view. But he did it around the other way: he condemned them first, found them guilty and then wrote the letter asking for an explanation of why they were guilty.
This minister cannot get the process right. He cannot get right his understanding of what his responsibility is as the minister for this statutory authority, this great national institution, the ABC. When I asked him my supplementary question today, he acknowledged that, yes, he had sent a letter; he was not satisfied with the reply given by Mr Johns and the chairman, Mr McDonald. Of course, Mr McDonald was appointed by this government as chairman and he is a close friend, apparently, of the Prime Minister. They both wrote back to Senator Alston explaining that they were satisfied with the ABC's coverage of the waterfront dispute and related matters.
Today, Senator Alston said that he had five points in his letter. He gave some bumbling explanation about what one of those points was, but gave no more. But when I asked him in a supplementary question to table the letter, he fudged; he went weak at the knees. He did not know whether he should table it or whether he should not. If you are going to get up and bag the ABC, if you are going to demand responses to claims of bias, it is only reasonable that you have a process whereby the public can judge whether the minister's 
 accusations are valid and relevant to the ABC's charter. But this minister ran away from the opportunity today in the Senate to table his letter. Minister, I still ask you to have the courage—table your letter and let the public judge whether you have treated the ABC fairly or unfairly.
This minister is into intimidation; he is into thuggery against the ABC. In the history of the ABC, there has been no minister who has more consistently attacked it than this minister. There has been no Prime Minister who has attacked it more often than the present Prime Minister. It is part of this coalition government's agenda to intimidate the ABC and put the heat on in the lead-up to the next election. They always claim that there is bias in the ABC, but they never make the same accusation against any other journalist from the private media. It is always the ABC that is in the gun as far as they are concerned, yet they have never demonstrated factually systemic bias in the ABC. If they were going to do that, you would think that the minister would have tabled the letter today. This minister is a gutless minister when he will not table the letter containing his criticism.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-05-14,"—I do not think Senator Schacht actually established his case in that tirade. It is a pretty difficult case he is trying to establish if he is trying to say that the media—any media, let alone the ABC—is even-handed in its treatment in this country.
I think it has been very obvious over the last two years not only how biased the media has been against this government but, in particular, how biased the ABC has been. This came home very clearly to me, Senator Schacht, in this particular case of the waterfront and the treatment of it by the ABC and by other media.
Let me give you two examples from my own area which I actually eye witnessed. John Howard, our Prime Minister, came to Maitland about five weeks ago. We really had a great day. He was out in the community; he was out in the rural areas. There were some great stories to report. He spoke to a huge public gathering in the Maitland Town Hall. 
 But was there any evidence of this on the media that night, on the ABC or anywhere else? No.
What did they report? They reported that the waterside workers were out the front of Maitland Town Hall and, as John Howard swept in, they took that particular footage, which was about one minute out of a full day. What appeared on that night's news broadcasts—the ABC included—was that footage. None of the good news was reported. The reporting was biased against the government, particularly on this waterfront issue.
To move on one week: Tim Fischer came to the Hunter Valley to launch a new ship at ADI in Carrington. This was showpiece technology for this country. It was a great story. A huge crowd was there in the pouring rain to help launch this great ship. Outside the entrance to the shipyards was a very small band of protesters—a little under 30 people. Some of them were protesting about educational issues, but the great majority of those 30 were waterside workers protesting against the Prime Minister. This very small group was in a tent, in the rain, outside the shipyard.
What did the media—and the ABC in particular—report on that night? They reported on the small group of protesters. They took very sharp-angled shots of the protesters so they looked like a crowd, but there was not a crowd there at all. There was a really good news story there, but they did not report it, they reported on this small group of protesters. The ABC is not the only one that does that; all the media does that.
To try to establish a case for one branch of the media like the ABC and say that it is even-handed is nonsense. None of the media is even-handed, particularly the ABC. We see it time and time again in the reporting on this government. The ABC takes minor points, distorts them and blows them up. Probably the worst example in two years was the reporting of the waterfront dispute. The ABC reported it in such a way as to try make the government look bad. This government is trying to reform the waterfront. The previous government wasted $480 million and did not achieve any real workplace reform.
We have started. We have had the guts to do it. The ABC should be reporting in an even-handed way that this government has had the courage to reform the waterfront, which is one of the main ways in which we will get the economy in this country back on track. We have to do it, but it must be reported properly. We have not seen proper reporting from the media generally, and we certainly have not seen it from the ABC.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation </title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The answers today of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, reflect his frustration on behalf of this government at the failure of this government to succeed in its illegal attempt to remove the MUA from the Australian waterfront. This minister is thrashing about trying to find a scapegoat for what is fundamentally flawed government policy. This policy is based upon the government's deep-seated hatred of working people and of the MUA in particular. That deep-seated hatred is perhaps only exceeded by its deep-seated hatred of the ABC itself.
What we heard today was quite an amazing proposition from this minister, a minister who delivered his answer in his classic manner of guile, evasion, double-speak and deceit. He tries to cover up in a classically weak and sneaky manner his attempt to bully and intimidate the ABC into submission. This attempt was exposed by Errol Simper, who had a leak directly from the minister on 4 May. Details of the letter the minister had sent to Brian Johns were published in the Australian. He had written to Johns rather than putting his complaints to the board of the ABC.
That reflected the minister's deep-seated hatred of the ABC which has been demonstrated again and again in this place. It has been demonstrated on behalf of the coalition by other coalition members over many years. In 1991, the coalition members on their expenditure review committee proposed deep and savage cuts to the ABC. The ABC inquiry was set up by this minister, through Senator Chamarette at the time, in which he sought to arm himself with a series of quite hideous and scandalous terms of reference. 
 Those terms of reference were predicated on the assumption of the ABC's fault, the ABC's guilt.
Those terms of reference were highlighted by such terms as `the failure of the ABC'. The assumption of failure of the ABC is constantly written into their very thought processes. Words like `controversy', `conflict', `dysfunction', and `deep-seated problems' were put into those terms of reference. So biased were those terms of reference that they had to be amended because they were totally inappropriate for any Senate committee let alone one such as this. This minister, who was chair of that particular committee, undertook what effectively amounted to an inquisitional equivalent of a guttercrawl. He went right through the ABC seeking to find every piece of dirt he could in an attempt to discredit the ABC.
Last year, the attack on the ABC was continued, based upon the budget cuts of what now amounts to $192 million from the ABC. Claims were made by the minister in 1996 that the ABC budget was bloated. He said, `It is all very well for the ABC to win awards, but no-one is watching and we have to ask ourselves if we should really be producing these programs.' Again, he was setting himself up as the arbiter of high quality and integrity in the ABC. What a person to make such a claim.
I recall that the Prime Minister also embarked upon this attack. He said that the ABC was politically correct to a fault and that it tended to concentrate on one particular point of view. I remember that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, following the audit commission's criticism of the ABC as he saw it, said that the ABC needed to be more accountable. By accountability they mean that the ABC should ape the answers given by this minister—it should follow the directions of this government. That is their notion of editorial independence. It is a notion that says that if you raise issues or concerns and things do not go the way this government thinks they would, it has to find a scapegoat—and how easy it is to blame the ABC.
How appropriate it is that the ABC should be defending its integrity, should be defending 
 its independence and should be ensuring a quality service that all Australians can enjoy, and not just the sycophancy and criminal acts that this government has been involved in in regard to the waterfront. How can you object to being exposed in the courts for the actions that you have undertaken—actions which some 10 judges across this country have now highlighted as being totally inappropriate to the way that industrial relations should be conducted in this country—and for the conspiracy that this government is so deeply involved in?

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-05-14,"—I listened to Senator Carr with his statements and emotive words such as `deep-seated hatred of working-class people', `scapegoats' and `sycophants'. He is one of these people from the very problem of the union movement that uses words like this that have no reconciliation about them at all. It is impossible to find any common ground with him. At times, it is also impossible to find any common ground with the ABC.
There is no question in the fair and reasonable minds of people in Australia that the ABC has a bias. When you analyse the organisation and find that the peak union of the ABC is part of the ACTU movement—the same as the Maritime Union of Australia—you can see where that influence comes from. 	It is not in the best interests of the ABC, because it is partly unionised and significantly so, for it to portray anything other than a bias towards the union movement. That is the very nub of the problem. The problem is that the union movement in Australia must be based on a volunteer organisation and not be a closed shop, whether you use coercion or whether you are up-front with it like the MUA.
If one goes back to the charge of bias against the ABC, one only has to see, as has been mentioned before, the cameras down there on the wharf—predominantly from the ABC—showing wharfies going to a church service. It is a wonder the roof did not fall in on the place they were attending. It ought to have been a salutary experience because not many of them would have ever been to church in their life before. When I was a 
 young man I belonged to the Waterside Workers Federation and, strangely, three of us on this side belonged to the Waterside Workers Federation—so we know what we are talking about. For Senator Carr to say that we have a `deep-seated hatred of working-class people' is completely erroneous. Not only erroneous, it is about as far wrong as you could possibly get. For some reason, Senator Carr gets it wrong most often—more often than other people on that side of the chamber.
This is the comparison. I have never heard the ABC be strident in its criticism of the waterfront, yet you have other media outlets that are doing just that. The Australian Financial Review in early April said:
At last, Australia appears to be reaching a big bang end-game to its decades- long quest to remove the shame on its waterfront. Today's farmer-inspired battle on the docks will define whether the country can work out how to earn a quid in the globalised economy.
There was nothing of that nature from the ABC. The Sydney Morning Herald  in early April said:
A union monopoly is being broken: the waterfront is being opened to genuine reform, and the results, by degrees, will benefit the entire economy. Instead of being part of a necessary and long-overdue reform process on the waterfront, the MUA stood outside the effort and tried to undermine it with tactics like strikes, picket lines and class-war rhetoric—
the same type of rhetoric that Senator Carr uses in this chamber—
that were dusted off from the 1950s. The point of all this was not to protect workers' rights in any general sense, but to protect waterfront workers in a specific sense. . . 
The ABC never came out with anything approaching that sort of criticism of one of the most corrupt unions and one of the greatest collections of thugs in any union—apart from the painters and dockers—that this nation has ever seen. Again, in later April, the Sydney Morning Herald  said:
The forces of change on the waterfront are not directed against unions and unionists. They are against waste, greed and inefficiency. They are for the good of all Australians. And they are unstoppable.
That is what has to get through hardline leftists—old leftover communists like Senator 
 Carr—that the union movement on the wharf is finished, that the movement created by the National Farmers Federation is unstoppable and that the waterfront will never be the same again. You have in Mr John Coombs the Arthur Scargill of Australia. He should take a lesson out of Arthur Scargill's book. It will never be the same. You cannot and you will not return to what was one of the greatest rorts in Australia. It was not simply that it was a rort; it was simply that it was affecting everyone in Australia—it was affecting our lifestyle. That simply has to stop, and it is stopping.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-05-14,"—Senator Alston answered three questions today on the ABC. He answered one from me about Radio Australia, one from Senator Boswell about diminished ABC services in the bush and one from Senator Schacht about bias. I do not know if I can call them answers—I suppose that is being a bit generous to Senator Alston—but I will discuss what he said when replying to these three questions.
First of all in relation to Radio Australia, the minister said that it was recommended by Mr Mansfield in the Mansfield report that Radio Australia be closed. Yes, it was recommended by Mr Mansfield. But, if you have a look at the terms of reference that Mr Mansfield was given, they did not include Radio Australia, they did not include ATV—they did not include international broadcasting by the ABC of any sort. Because they did not include those organisations, nobody made submissions on them.
The millions of people in Indonesia and in Asia and the tens of thousands who wrote to the ABC saying, `What's going on?' and `What's this I hear that you might be closing RA and that you might be closing ATV?' and the heads of state who wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) saying, `Please don't do this'—all of those people would have made submissions. I would have made a submission. A great many 
 thousands of people around the world would have made submissions.
I do not know that that would have made any difference to this government, because what this government wants to do is punish the ABC. That is its prime objective in life. Sometimes I feel as though what this government really wants to achieve out of its period in office is to punish the ABC and, if possible, to destroy the ABC. Even though there was nothing in the terms of reference whatsoever—absolutely nothing—one recommendation of the Mansfield report was that Radio Australia should be closed and that ATV should be closed. That was plan A. Plan A was incredibly stupid and everybody realised that was the case.
Then we went on to plan B. Plan B was to send out Radio Australia only by satellite. If you are a rich Asian person—and there are not an awful lot of rich people in Asia; most of them are not—then you will be able to hear a reasonable, fair, unbiased news service and current affairs and so on. If you are poor, `Sorry, to bad.' Plan B died a hideous death as well, which was excellent.
Then we have plan C, which is where we are at the moment. Plan C is that Radio Australia is sent out into Asia. Most people are desperately in need of good news and current affairs which they do not get on as regular a basis from America, Britain or anywhere else in the world as they would from Radio Australia if we were transmitting. It would be sent out on satellite via short wave to the Pacific. This is totally ludicrous and inadequate.
Secondly, I will talk a bit about Senator Alston's answer to Senator Boswell about diminished ABC services in the bush. I can tell Senator Boswell that it is only going to get worse. Until the ABC is properly funded—and the ABC is not properly funded at the moment; it is appallingly funded at the moment, it is vastly under-funded at the moment—the bush is going to suffer. The rest of us are going to suffer. Everybody in Asia is going to suffer.
Thirdly, let me talk about Senator Alston's answer to Senator Schacht about bias. A couple of days ago the ABC released a report 
 that found that 79 per cent of all respondents believe that the ABC does a great job and is balanced and even-handed in politics. Some 95 per cent stated that the ABC does a good job in providing reliable and accurate news and current affairs programs. I take it the Liberal Party comes in that other five per cent. Certainly the ministers come in the other five per cent.
The ABC board requires reports on accuracy, impartiality and objectivity. Those reports do not demonstrate bias. Issues included in the current report are some of the most volatile. Bias was not demonstrated. It is interesting to note who some of the most strident complainants are. They are members of the Liberal Party—the federal director, one of the Prime Minister's advisers and the minister, who is a very strident complainant.
Mr Johns does not have to respond to the minister and his incredibly ridiculous and long letter. The minister knows that jurisdictional difference. He should be writing to the board and I do not why he is not. Has he not read the act?
—Because it is written for Errol Simper's benefit.
—You wonder. Rather than considering the ABC biased, the government should rejoice in the diversity and the creativity of the ABC. Look at Roy and HG , Good News Week , Garden Australia , Lateline , Landline , 7.30 Report , Compass , Recovery , Radio National, Radio Australia and award winning programs like Wildside  and Play School . We will not be seeing these if we do not get better funding for the ABC in the future. Let the ABC get on with doing the job it does best. It is the best in Australia at informing and entertaining the Australian public. Let them do it. Give them the money to do it. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-05-14,"—I present the government's 
 response to the seventh report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Government Response to the 7th Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties
The Government thanks the Committee for its thorough and timely consideration of another disparate yet significant set of treaty actions. The Report covers two new treaties, one subsidiary instrument, and withdrawal from three obsolete treaties—and the Government would draw attention to this as evidence of its determination to keep Australia's international legal obligations transparent, appropriate, and current. The status of the treaty actions in question is as follows:
.	 Denunciation of the Constitution of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
-	 Instrument deposited on 23 December 1996, with effect from 31 December 1997.
.	 Agreement to amend the Agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income
-	 Entered into force on 23 July 1997, after exchange of Notes on 6 March  and  23 July 1997.
.	 Agreement with Hong Kong concerning Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
-	 Signed on 23 September 1996; continued applicability after 30 June  1997 confirmed by exchange of Notes with People's Republic of China on 9 and 26 June 1997; will enter into force thirty days after exchange of Notes with Hong Kong, which awaits Hong Kong implementing legislation.
.	 Trade & Investment Agreement with the United Mexican States
-	 Signed on 13 November 1994; entered into force on exchange of Notes on 3 April 1997.
.	 Denunciation of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage
-	 Instrument deposited on 7 April 1997, with effect from 15 May 1998.
.	 Denunciation of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage
-	 Deemed to be denounced with the Liability Convention, with effect from 15 May 1998.
These treaty actions reflect the Committee's tacit or explicit support for Government proposals, as recorded in the Report at Paragraphs 2.40, 3.64, 
 4.15, 4.27, and 4.37. The Report contains only two formal recommendations, concerning the withdrawal from UNIDO and the Tax Sparing Agreement with Vietnam. It also contains an extensive discussion of consultation, with reference especially to tax treaties; and the establishment through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of appropriate consultative mechanisms to respond to the Committee's concerns has delayed the preparation of this response.
2.39  The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that savings achieved from Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization be redirected to other areas of the aid program where they can be more effectively utilised.
The Government notes and endorses the approach reflected in this recommendation. In doing so, the Government welcomes the Committee's conclusion (Paragraph 2.38) that `more effective utilisation of Australia's aid budget may be obtained through the funding of other aid programs.'  The Government notes, however, that the anticipated savings are part of managing the Australian Agency for International Development's (AusAID) global budget rather than a discrete sum that might be identifiably re-allocated. With reference to Paragraph 2.36, it notes that, at the time the decision to withdraw was made, AusAID wrote to all parties affected by the decision to advise them of the withdrawal and the rationale behind it.
3.63  The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade and the Australian Taxation Office keep the exclusion of accounting and audit services from tax sparing incentives in the 1992 Double Taxation Agreement with Vietnam under review and, if Vietnamese legislation is amended, commence negotiations to remove that exclusion.
The Government is pleased that the Committee supported early ratification of the amendments to the Double Taxation Agreement with Vietnam and has given effect to that ratification following the passage of the enabling legislation.
However, the Government is not in a position at this time to provide a positive response to the recommendation in Paragraph 3.63 of the Report. The possible removal of the exclusion of accounting and audit services from the scope of the tax sparing provisions in the Agreement with Vietnam would be a matter for decision by the Government, in the context of its overall policy on the grant of tax sparing, if and when the relevant Vietnamese legislation should be amended.
Trade & Investment Agreement with Mexico
With reference to Paragraph 4.23 and to clarify its final sentence, the International Wool Secretariat 
 has entered into a Co-operation Agreement with the Mexican development bank Nacional Financiera and launched a development plan aimed at developing Mexico's wool textiles industry, with a view to gaining access to North American markets under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Consultation
Paragraphs 3.46-58 of the Report provide the Committee's views on aspects of the treaty-making process. The Government endorses the importance of National Interest Analyses tabled in Parliament being both comprehensive (3.48-50) and comprehensible (3.51-3) and welcomes the Committee's continuing guidance as to the styles of document most helpful for the Parliamentary consideration of proposed treaty actions.
The Government has provided some comment on the issues of consultation in the concluding of bilateral treaties, in its response to the Committee's 4th Report. The onus remains on line Departments and agencies to identify and consult all significant stakeholders as early as possible in the negotiating and treaty-making processes. In the specific matter of tax treaties, the ATO has been exploring issues related to the establishment of a Tax Treaties Advisory Panel to include tax professionals and representatives of business organisations—notably the management of industry involvement while respecting international practice that bilateral treaties are confidential to the parties (governments) until signature. The Government reiterates its readiness at a mutually convenient opportunity to provide the Committee with a full briefing on the principles of tax treaties in general, so as to facilitate its consideration of the merits of specific instruments in future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,25,1,speech

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-05-14,"—One of the newspaper cartoonists yesterday gave us the ultimate `I'd like to see that' of Australian politics: the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in pigtails and a blue dress, skipping off down the yellow brick road to the sunny land of Oz, where worries melt, I am told, like lemon drops, and every resident munchkin is relaxed and comfortable, and raking in shares in AMP.
But Madam President, there are always messages between the lines. Because who can think of Dorothy without her supporting cast? I look across at this government and I find the audition hall overflowing for the parts of the lion without courage, the tin man without a heart, and perhaps most oversubscribed of all, the scarecrow without a brain. So somewhere over the rainbow, there you'll find the Treasurer, far up and away, and off with the bluebirds on his technicolour journey, skipping and singing, singing and skipping.
We all have our sustaining fantasies, Madam President, and listening to this budget on Tuesday night I realised that we're not in Kansas any more.	Because only in the Treasurer's fantasies can there be good in this 
 budget surplus built on a million small deficits in the lives of ordinary people. The teeth are not fixed. The pills are not bought. The kids in backyard care, or the mother out of work. The apprenticeships not found. The holiday not taken because of the cost of a mother's nursing home. The university degree out of reach, and the fulfilling career therefore not had. The shame of the young school leaver's hundredth unsuccessful job interview. The corroding despair of the long-term jobless, and the alarm of their families. The grief of the parent farewelling a child leaving town for good. The factory closed. The trauma of selling-up and moving. The hundred unspoken small goodbyes of ordinary people to their ordinary lives.
These are the human losses on which this accountants' surplus was built by a government that has long ceased—or has never learned—to care. And these indeed are the hard yards. The long haul. The shouldered burden of battling Australians that somehow fuels the happiness of a Treasurer long unacquainted with the ordinary needs of his fellow Australians. The griefs and consolations, and the quiet unprotested sufferings which underpin the triumph of his numbers and the failure of his government's decency.
The government will have you believe that all the pain was essential. It was not. If it was essential, why did Tuesday's budget contain spending increases of $10 billion over the next four years? If it was essential, why is it that when we look at the effect on financial year 1998-99 of the three Costello budgets, we find that in net terms he cut $6 billion in the first budget, $1 billion in the second, and then put back $2 billion in the third? Why didn't the Treasurer explain here on Tuesday why he has effectively run down two flights of stairs, and back up one on fiscal policy? He didn't, because the admission would be too great.
In the first two budgets, we had selective leaking and pre-announcement of the bad news. This one has been selective leaking, and admission of failure in small instalments, the only instalments a battered, unpopular and fundamentally untrustworthy political outfit 
 can afford. He was wrong, and he can't admit it.
But the net effect of this government's policy changes on financial year 1998-99—the net effect of going down two flights of stairs and up one—was $5.4 billion. Subtracting that $5.4 billion from the surplus announced by the Treasurer leaves us with an underlying `no policy change' deficit of $2.7 billion—no cuts, no surcharges, no fees, no pain.
Now let me tell you something that Gareth Evans said about an alternative budget strategy for Australia—not this week, not last year, but two years ago, after the coalition's first budget, and I quote:
. . . we say we can get to budget balance within a reasonable time—in fact, within the lifetime of this parliament, by 1998-99—with a much less savage budget strategy. . . . We can get to that by targeting savings of no more than $3 billion by that third year.
In other words, $1 billion of new savings each year in three budgets would have produced a starting point surplus this year of at least $300 million. On top of this, the higher economic growth, which Labor's budget strategy would have allowed, would have seen a 1998-99 budget surplus of similar dimensions to the one announced on Tuesday.
Our argument was then, as it is today, that fiscal consolidation in the economic climate this government faced in 1996 was necessary but did not need to be nearly as harsh as what they immediately embarked upon. We need surpluses, of the kind that Labor delivered four years in a row not long after inheriting a $25 billion deficit from the then Treasurer, John Howard—surpluses built on jobs and growth. We need to retire public debt, but we must keep that issue in perspective too. Despite what the Jeremiahs might say, Australia's fiscal position was very good by international standards when this government came into office.
That is not to say that we should become complacent. We should not. But it does seriously question why you would sell Telstra to reduce what, in our last year in government, was the third lowest public sector debt in the industrialised world. That debt, as a 
 percentage of GDP, was less than half of Canada's, and two-thirds the proportion of France, Germany, the United States, and even Britain after a decade of Maggie Thatcher's budget cutting and privatisations.
Why, then, should we allow up to $20 billion worth of Telstra, this great national asset, to go to foreigners? After only four years, we will lose more in Telstra dividends than we will save on our interest bill—dividends that would otherwise be there for generations to pay for hospitals and schools, railways and roads.
This budget puts aside $580 million for the financial managers as costs and commissions for the Telstra float. That is more than half a billion dollars we could save tomorrow, and keep a great national asset into the bargain.
In any budget that spends money like this one, there are things to be welcomed, and you should offer praise where it is due. Two praiseworthy ideas are the extension of the gold card to all World War II veterans, and the extension of the health care card to more self-funded retirees. Labor was proud to establish both cards in our time in government.
It is unfortunate, however, that benefits for a small number of our retirees should accompany reductions for the vast majority. Twenty times as many have experienced those reductions as have received benefits now. Had those self-funded retirees obtained their card under Labor, they would have had access to free dental care, lower-priced prescriptions and free hearing aids. Two hundred and twenty thousand benefit; four million Australians lose.
But all of them now confront a massive expense on entry to essential care in nursing homes. Our specific policies will be announced closer to the election—but I can say two things: we will restore capital funds cut from nursing homes in full, and none of our retirees—or any Australian for that matter—will have to pay a GST on any of their goods or services.
But even though this budget has spent some money, it leaves too many questions unanswered. It cannot answer the people who 
 ask themselves what all the pain was for in the first place, or why someone else's pain was more worthy of being reversed than theirs was.
How precisely did the government make the decision not to restore Commonwealth dental funding? How did it decide it was relaxed about the situation of one woman whose letter to the member for Gilmore was submitted to a recent Senate inquiry, a woman who has been informed that all her teeth need to be extracted and, despite living in constant pain, it will be 18 months before she can be treated? Even then she will have to wait for each individual tooth to cause her pain before she is entitled to have that tooth extracted. What thought processes, what overarching philosophy, what quality of mercy goes into that kind of decision?
And how did the government decide it was relaxed about elderly Australians, in their hour of greatest fragility, still having to sell the family home to pay for entry into a nursing home—and that, after all the backflips and all the reversals—some 14 of them—the fees remain, and the government still circles the family home. How did it decide that it could go right ahead and spend that money elsewhere?
How did it decide there was no relief for women forced out of the work force by spiralling child care fees? How did it decide instead to factor their despair into its employment projections? The bad employment estimates in this budget are still heroic. At a minimum, they only stand up because of the thousands of women driven out of the work force by this government's decisions on child care. The Prime Minister thinks this is about family values. It is not. It is simply a collapse in the living standards of low-income working families.
And how, after all its claims, can there be not one single dollar more for public hospitals in this budget than was on the table when the Premiers walked out on the Commonwealth's last offer in disgust?
Let me say that John Hewson, who seems to have picked the impact of the Asian crisis far better than this government, was absolutely right in saying that this health offer is 
 nothing like 15 per cent over five years. The Premiers walked out on that, because they knew that to sign on would be a wholesale betrayal of their public hospital patients. That inadequacy this budget happily endorses.
But there is one large group of Australians which suffers most from these three budgets. I am speaking, of course, of the unemployed. To see why, we need to remember the level of economic growth before John Howard came into power. In the financial year 1993-94, economic growth in Australia was 4.6 per cent. In 1994-95, it was 4.4 per cent. In 1995-96, it was 4.1 per cent. Australia's economic growth rate for John Howard's first full financial year in office was just 2.7 per cent.
Four percent growth plus under Labor. Not even two-thirds of that in the first year under the coalition. And we are meant to accept that this had nothing to do with the entire government frontbench preaching economic doom for a full five months before the first budget in 1996. Nothing to do with that budget which took $27 billion out of the economy over four years.
Growth got above the parapet of three per cent last year, and now it is forecast to flatline back at three per cent, with unemployment stuck around eight per cent.
But when the Treasurer was asked on Tuesday night about the unemployment rate, this is what he said:
No it bounces around a bit. You know, it's 7.9, it's 8, it's 8.1. We think it's around the 8 mark at the moment, but it will bounce. It's been bouncing for a year.
I am sick of that kind of talk. I am sick of people like the Treasurer with a screen full of teeth making glib analogies about real lives. These are real people, Mr Treasurer, not footballs, not Dr Kemp's rubbery statistics. They are real mums and dads, with real children dependent on them, trying to get a start in life. You were not elected to bounce unemployment around. You were elected to get it down.
Before March 1996, the unemployment rate had been falling for three years. This government came in and worsened the unemployment position immediately. In our last two years in government, Labor created 550,000 
 jobs. In his first two years, John Howard created not half as many. The difference was 315,000 people—three MCGs jam-packed full of people who would now be in work, and not on the dole queue, if the coalition had just managed to keep up the pace we set.
And anything it has managed to do on unemployment, or might manage, has to be judged against another MCG crowd of nearly 100,000 people who have simply given up looking for work since this government came into office. And what of those left on the dole queue longer than they ever feared, because of the growth this government put on hold? The number of people unemployed for a year or more fell by over a third during Labor's last term in office.
So far, during this government's term, it has actually risen. When you started cutting into skillshare and other labour market programs in May 1996, there were 206,000 long-term unemployed Australians. Figures released this morning show that their ranks have now increased by 33,000 people as a result of your policies. Long-term unemployed used to be a quarter of all unemployed. Today, they are a third.
And they have been ill-served by a government which has wrecked the support systems putting long-term unemployed people into work—exemplary programs emulated around the world put on the scrap heap. Or worse: some of them have been put into the hands of people with no office, no staff, no experience—some of them without even a telephone!
This is where we count the cost of this budget. Having counted the beans, the government has closed the book on Australian families. It is not going to redress the pain of the last two years; it is not going to tell them where it wants to take them next century. As far as the government is concerned, there are only two more stops in the journey—the GST and an election.
So let me talk about their GST—the dead heart of the hidden tax package. John Howard has built a career avoiding the unequivocal, but three years ago this month, he was absolutely unequivocal. These are his words, and we remember them well:
No, there's no way a GST will ever be part of our policy. Never ever. It's dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election.'
Peter Costello has built a career avoiding being quiet, but his budget speech was silent on the issue of a GST. He was like Basil Fawlty, you know—`Don't mention the war!' The budget papers on Tuesday included $20 million for the administration of this tax package, so we are now in the farcical situation where the coalition will tell us what it will cost to implement the tax package, but it will not tell us what is in it.
But one thing is for sure: the GST has come back when no-one thought it would. This tax on jobs, this tax on the poor, this tax on families is back. And as we prepare for its stealthy arrival, we need to remember that it comes back with none of the integrity that was there in its initial presentation when John Hewson put out his fully-costed package, openly and frankly, more than a year out from an election.
John Howard told his party two days ago that we could be in the last parliamentary session before the election. Just weeks to go, but the voters are not going to see the tax package yet. It is something to be dropped, and then scuttled away from, to the polls, before anyone can get the wrapping off and find out what is underneath.
That changes where we stand as a party. Those of us who oppose a GST now have only one course of action. I want to make it clear tonight that the Labor Party believes that John Howard has forfeited any right ever to claim a legitimate mandate for his GST. And our opposition will be there whether we win or lose the next election. A vote for Labor is a guaranteed vote against the GST. If we are elected, you will not get one, and if we are in opposition, we will oppose it in the Senate.
We do this because the lateness of the hour means we are expected to take this Prime Minister on trust. But we see nothing in this government's record to trust that the package will be fair or equitable. The Treasurer has explicitly refused in this place to rule out a GST on the following items: doctors bills; dentists bills; school fees; university fees; 
 power bills; food; nursing home fees; local government and water rates; and even rent.
 We see nothing in this government's record to trust that its awesome complexity will become, in their hands, anything other than a complete disaster—a disaster for businesses, workers and all consumers, implemented in the usual manner—with all the grace and poise of Inspector Clouseau in a ball bearing factory. We refuse to help John Howard get his agenda into place, and we will not inflict his tax on the Australian people.
 Modern government, as we approach a new century, is about skills, innovation, infrastructure and exports. It is not simply about bean counting. It is not simply about achieving a surplus by any means. It is about achieving a surplus in periods of moderate economic growth, at the same time as creating a modern, successful state which rewards, advances and enhances excellence.
For Australians, this means recognising something about our own country. It means recognising that many other countries have advantages we do not. We are a nation in nobody's trading bloc. We make our way in a region where the big countries are growing by an amount equivalent to our entire population every single year, while we occupy a great proportion of that region's real estate.
It also means recognising what makes us proud to be Australians—our history of innovation, our scientific endeavour and our national courage. Too often, as we have approached issues of reform over the last 15 years or so, we have been critical of Australians' willingness to work hard, innovate and change based on their own convictions rather than on some official view. Too often, we have underestimated how much Australians pride and value their own work and their achievements. Too few Australians, too few members of this parliament know that Victoria and South Australia combined have won more Nobel Prizes in the sciences than the whole country of Japan.
Government must value and enhance those great Australian characteristics. Micro-economic reform is not about depriving people of wages, depriving people of leisure 
 and depriving people of things which make for a constructive family life. We must be about enhancing skills, building on our record of innovation and developing our outward-looking attitude to opportunities in our region. Just try to find anything substantial in these three budgets from this government which builds on these strengths.
Instead, the vast bulk of savings made in the three budgets have been at the expense of this Australia. They have come from our universities, from the labour market programs helping to keep our population permanently skilled, from research and development incentives and from assistance to exporters to gain a foothold in international markets.
The effects are clearly documented in the budget. It forecasts a drop in net export growth. It shows business investment growth slowing throughout the year. Recent figures show growth in business spending on research and development, which reached an all-time record of $4.3 billion in Labor's last year, has stopped dead for the first time in a decade, following the swingeing cuts to R&D support in the first coalition budget.
This is why there is no point in delivering a surplus ringed by deficits. It is a surplus bought from the million deficits in family budgets, a surplus sitting alongside a level of foreign debt which has worsened by $28 billion since the coalition came into power and a current account deficit forecast to grow by another $31 billion over the coming year—and nearly every single independent analyst thinking that is an understatement.
 This is why we need a government with a broader vision,  why we need to restore the balance, why we need a government that sees where it can forge a partnership with the Australian people: a partnership supporting family life, supporting unemployed, supporting industry, supporting investment and supporting exporters. We need partnership, and we need to have their visions as well.
Two years have told us all we need to know about John Howard's ambitions for Australia. He wants an Australia with him as Prime Minister, and that is where the vision ends. He wants an Australia moulded into the shape he thinks will keep him there—a nation 
 riddled by division, neatly carved up into the few groups whose dislike of each other, encouraged by this government, he thinks will keep him in power forever.
Labor will go into this next election believing in a different Australia. We believe in a proud, confident, intelligent Australia. Labor believes in an Australia that wants security in its workplaces, peace of mind in a strong health system and opportunity flowing from an education system which gives its citizens the best chance they can get in a global economy.
We understand with absolute clarity the importance of the Asian financial crisis for the Australian economy, and the corresponding need for fiscal restraint in that environment. Kim Beazley promised back in February that Labor would deliver three underlying surpluses in our first term in government, and that promise stands as long as this government's projections for the budgetary position and economic forecasts stand.
 But Labor is going to look at priorities. We are going to look at where this government has spent money wastefully, and where the money could be used more intelligently and to greater benefit for greater numbers of Australians.
We are not going into this election year with a fistful of dollars as a grudging apology for pain rendered over the previous three years. We are going into this election year with a vision of where we want Australia to go, what Australians want in their everyday lives and how, within the means available to us, we can go in that direction. These three budgets have sacrificed the security and opportunity of the population to Liberal Party prejudices. This is a government that has forgotten its responsibility to govern for all Australians and is now prepared to experiment with an unfair, job-destroying tax in a period of uncertainty.
In the last two years, over the last three budgets, the Australian people have learnt what they were getting when they elected this government. I maintain they deserve something better than what they got. Normally, it would be hard to close the book on a government after only three budgets. Normally, it 
 would be hard to say a government is not worth considering again when it has been around for only two years. Normally, a first-term government just turns up in the queue for another term like it is waiting for dessert. But this is not a normal government. This is not the normal run of events at all.
This is John Howard's government and John Howard's Australia. We know that millions of Australians want no more to do with this government—no more of this government that loses seven ministers in just 18 months; no more of this government that puts black shirts, balaclavas and dogs on chains in our workplaces; no more of this government that defends ministers with tens of millions in their family trusts, and wants working Australians to pay a GST on their grocery bills, their clothing, their rent and their rates; and, no more of this government with a quarter of a billion for companies that want to sack workers, and nothing for those companies who want to keep them on.
These were your three budgets, and they are over. If there was a time and a place for a government as harsh and chaotic as this, it is long, long past, and in another, lesser country. If there is a place for it now to go, it is out of our lives, and out of our lives for good.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1998-99</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-05-14,"—I rise to present the response of the Australian Democrats to the 1998-99 Costello budget. In doing so, I propose to do three things. Firstly, I shall discuss the context for the budget, the policy settings and what passes for the rationale underpinning it. Secondly, I shall outline the Democrats' response in specific portfolio areas. Thirdly, I shall outline just how the Democrats propose to address the budget when the appropriation bills come into the Senate.
It is hard for me to remember a less inspiring, less stimulating budget than the one Peter Costello has just brought down. It was a singularly unimaginative document. Generally, its contents had been either leaked or announced well before the session. Virtually all the new spending initiatives were repackaged, reheated leftovers, even the size of the surplus was common knowledge to any taxi driver 
 you would like to consult. They all knew it was somewhere between $2½ billion and $3 billion.
I searched long and hard for items of some significance in the budget, and I came to the conclusion that what was really significant about this budget was not so much what was in it but what was not in it. There is nothing in this budget to address Australia's unemployment rate, which is forecast to stay stuck at around eight per cent this year. There was nothing in it to address our ballooning current account deficit—for example, no strategies to improve our export performance. There was nothing in it to repair the damage done by $7 billion of spending cuts over the last two years. There was nothing in it to boost consumer and business confidence, which is critical to maintain local demand for goods and services as well as improve export performance in what we all acknowledge will be a difficult year ahead.
Simply, this is a budget with nothing much in it. This budget may well deliver a fiscal surplus, but it suffers from a chronic imagination deficit. This government is widely acknowledged to be ungenerous and mean, and this budget is an accurate reflection of the government. It has failed to address the social and economic pressures on ordinary Australians.
Let me remind senators of the mindless economic mantra chanted morning and night by those on the treasury benches, the mantra from which this budget has been drawn. Where there is a public service, privatise it or contract it out. Where there is an industry concession, they must be rorting. Where there are financial market commentators, we bow the head and kiss the feet. Where there is a government benefit, label the recipients as cheats and bludgers. Where there are people who cannot find a job, blame them. Where there are people who desperately need a public health system, ignore them and pour money into the private health insurance industry. Where there are people who cannot afford a decent education, ignore them and pour money into the private education system. Where there are people who do not kneel in 
 homage at the foot of budgetary surpluses, mock them.
The much vaunted surplus, we are told, is a matter of greatness, a huge achievement. I am sorry to have to rain on Mr Costello's parade, but I cannot quite get excited about it, and neither can a lot of people, if letters in our national papers across the country are anything to go by. All the government has achieved is the replacement of a budget deficit with a gaping social deficit.
Let us not forget where the budget surplus came from. It was $1 billion hacked out of public health, $1 billion hacked out of industry and export programs, $1 billion hacked out of programs to help the jobless get back to work, $1 billion hacked out of Australia's education, training and research sectors, $1.6 billion hacked out of Australia's social welfare safety net and $1.5 billion in new taxes and charges that they like to keep very quiet about. These are the foundation stones on which this budget has been built. It has been the sick, the jobless, the aged, the students and those Australians on low incomes, including many small business people, and the young who have paid for these stones, who have paid for this surplus, and they are still paying.
In fact, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Science and Economic Research estimates that the government's program has left the average Australian family worse off by about $7 a week. This rises to a massive $38 a week if the breadwinner is unemployed. I cannot imagine that the people who have paid such a high price for the deficit reduction will be wanting to dance in the streets to celebrate Costello's surplus.
But, when you read the budget papers carefully, you soon discover that the budget black hole turned out to be $3 billion less than Treasury said it would be. It is now clear that $3 billion of the $7 billion of spending cuts were never necessary, and that the government could have achieved a balanced budget in 1998-99 without them—just read the budget papers.
In last year's budget, after the $7 billion of spending cuts, Treasury was forecasting a budget deficit in 1997-98 of around $3.9 
 billion and a surplus in 1998-99 of $1.6 billion. But in this year's budget papers, we find that the budget deficit for 1997-98, apart from new spending, came in $3.3 billion better and that in 1998-99 the surplus was going to be $3 billion better. The Democrats forecast this last September in our economic statement Restoring Confidence and again in my pre-budget submission released last week. We said then that there was an opportunity for government to do more to give the economy the confidence boost that it desperately needs and we say it again.
In my pre-budget submission Repairing the Damage I reiterated that the budget should give priority to the restoration of some of the cuts that should never have been made, such as the cuts to public health, to Australia's schools and to our tertiary education sector. I argued that the budget should help insulate Australia from the Asian meltdown by boosting domestic demand and business investment, particularly in the export sector and infrastructure.
The new Treasury forecasts vindicate completely what the Democrats have been saying. Both Treasury and the Reserve Bank are on the record now admitting that the spending cuts in the 1996 budget hit the economy much harder than they thought they would. It is now clear that if the cuts had been kept to a more modest level there would have been a lot more Australians in work now.
For the last five years the Democrats fiscal policy position has been constructed on three basic principles. Firstly, we recognise the need to improve the capacity for economic activity and to expand, to employ more Australians and to do this without driving up foreign debt or interest rates. Secondly, we recognise the need for this generation of Australians to meet is own commitments, at the same time ensuring that national savings and public sector assets are not squandered for future generations. Thirdly, we recognise the need to ensure that the benefits of economic activity are fairly and equitably shared and that the costs, especially the environmental costs, of economic activity are recognised and minimised.
Let me turn to history for a moment. Back in 1996, the Democrats recognised the need for deficit reduction. Importantly, however, we stressed the need to identify the causes of the budget deficit. And, however hard the Labor revisionists might like to try to rewrite history, the real reason that the budget deficit blew out was the rise in unemployment following Paul Keating's recession—the one that we had to have. What seems to have escaped the economic rationalists who framed this budget is that the best and surest way to reduce the deficit is to reduce unemployment. Every one per cent growth in employment saves the federal government $1½ billion.
The Democrats pointed to the findings by prominent economists Fred Argy, John Neville and Fred Gruen that half of the budget black hole was cyclical and that the budget cuts of only about $4 billion, which represented Labor's policy failures, were justified. The Democrats argued then that if cuts were deeper than that the economy would suffer, and on every point we were proven right. But the coalition argues that it has delivered lower interest rates. A nice line but they have only partly delivered that benefit. Let us just move on past the army of government spin doctors—no doubt up there again tonight—and get to the truth.
Of the estimated $220 billion of new debt created in Australia in the past two years only three per cent was incurred by the Commonwealth government. In fact, Australia has the second lowest level of public debt, second only to Korea, and the seventh lowest budget deficit of any industrialised country. It is not the public sector driving interest rates in this country. Interest rates are low because inflation is low and unemployment is high. It has little to do with this government's deficit reduction strategy. The fact is that interest rates are not actually as low as Peter Costello would like us to believe.
Any economist can tell you, even the tub-thumping economic rationalists that you listen to and that you are eager to impress, that it is not the nominal rate of interest that is important, rather it is the real rate of interest when you adjust for inflation. Adjusted for inflation in real terms, home loan interest rates are now 
 two per cent higher than they were when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969.
Australian businesses face the highest interest rates on business loans in the industrialised world, largely because of this government's abject failure to do anything about the banks, to regulate them properly and rein in their whopping profit margins on loans. The Netherlands, for example, which has a lower unemployment rate than Australia, a higher budget deficit and a much higher level of public sector debt, provides for its business sector loan rates five percentage points lower than Australia. What the Netherlands has that Australia hasn't is a much lower current account deficit. In fact, Australia's current account deficit is forecast to rise from $18 billion last year to $31 billion next year.
If you look in the budget to see if it addresses that, you will find there is nothing there. Instead, the budget fails to undo the $125 million cut to the export market development grants scheme, the $120 million cut to soft finance for Australian companies to invest in developing countries, the $90 million in cuts to Austrade's programs, the $400 million cut to tax breaks for research and development, and the $300 impost on business inputs through tariff concession orders.
The Democrats believe that Australia must pursue export markets more aggressively, chase business investment and generate jobs and economic growth. We also believe that foreign investment must be in Australia's interest, rather than just adding to our current account deficit as it does now through repatriated profits. This budget fails on all these counts as well as failing to repair the damage done across a wide range of community services.
 The budget contains no good news for the unemployed with the admission that the unemployment rate is expected to stay stuck around the current level of eight per cent during all of next year. The only use for the unemployed is that, if you are unemployed now, you are likely to stay that way.
—It doesn't say that at all.
—I would check your budget papers if I were you, Senator, because the forward estimates for unemployment benefits suggest that Treasury is planning for unemployment to stay stuck at at least eight per cent for the next four years. The only new news in the budget was that another 9,000 public sector jobs are to go, bringing to 32,000 the total of number of jobs slashed by this government. Compare that to the government's pre-election promise to confine public sector retrenchments to just 2,500 over three years. That is another one of those optional promises and non-core promises that we had.
The aged, we are told, are big winners from this budget. The Democrats certainly welcome the extension of the seniors health card to self-funded retirees. I do remind the government, however, though, that I first called for that five years ago, and it has been a long time coming. When you factor in the higher cost of pharmaceuticals, the fact that many doctors have given up bulk-billing, the longer waiting queues and the longer waiting lists in our public hospitals, I doubt if too many of Australia's aged can say they are better off now in terms of health than they were three years ago. What we are particularly disappointed about in this sector is that there was nothing in this budget to address the $1 billion shortfall in capital funding in nursing home facilities, particularly in regional areas.
 The other big winner was supposed to be the bush. But, like so much else in this budget, when you really look at it up close, there is nothing in it. The Democrats do welcome the small new measures for the bush such as the tax rebates for landcare projects, a bit of extra funding for regional development and a small boost to rural health. But these measures are very small beer. They do not address the steep decline in regional Australia caused by the massive public sector cuts, massive cuts to services, massive cuts to infrastructure funding for roads, local government and things like nursing homes. We all know what is happening to rural hospitals and schools. Then, of course, there is what you are doing to the ABC.
The really bad news for the bush was the inclusion of the Telstra sale proceeds into the budget papers. Telstra's service capacity in the regions has dropped significantly since the staff cuts began in preparation for the sale. In regional Australia, they know they can expect a greater decline if the rest of Telstra is sold. Regional Australia will also suffer from this government's continuing and pathetic vendetta against the ABC. Indeed, we heard more of that after question time today. Just $20.8 million is provided to fund the ABC's digital conversion, less than a quarter of that recommended as an absolute minimum by the Arthur Anderson report. This will mean that regional Australia is unlikely to get the full benefits of the ABC eventually converting over to multi-channel digital technology.
 Australia's farmers are big losers. Australia's family are particularly big losers. Cuts to child care, the continuing squeeze on public schools and the huge cuts to tertiary education remain firmly in place. In the area of health, this budget succeeds in putting back only one-third of the $1 billion of annual cuts inflicted on the public health system. I repeat: your cuts are $1 billion annually, and it is from that that we must look at the current budget. Most of the few health initiatives such as the gold card for veterans have already been announced. Other existing programs such as the influenza vaccine initiatives and funding for medical research have merely been extended. This budget does nothing to address the most important health issue facing our nation—that is, the serious underfunding of our public hospitals. All this budget has done is to repackage again the offer to the states that they have already comprehensively rejected on a number of occasions.
 The Democrats do welcome the return to the full indexation of Medicare rebates, but we add that this should not just be a one-off increase for a year. All the evidence is though that this will not be enough to get many of Australia's GPs back bulk-billing. Those who gave up are unlikely to reverse their decision. We also welcome the modest increase in funding for indigenous health, although small handouts will not address the fundamental issue of Aboriginal people's right to self- 
 determination, a right which has been continually undermined by this government.
 This budget contains very bad news for the environment, hidden in sleight of hand arithmetic which mixes core funding with funds from the Natural Heritage Trust. In other words, I think it is going to take a lot of questioning at estimates to try to unravel this particular puzzle. Funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is to be cut by 20 per cent despite an increase in its responsibilities. Indeed, I think the environmental priorities of this government are best demonstrated by Warwick Parer's win of an extra $36 million to find new fossil fuel, oil and gas deposits. Interestingly, this is exactly the amount cut from the Energy Research and Development Corporation, an organisation established to research cleaner, renewable energy sources for our future.
 On the tax side, the government has announced—if that is the correct word—that the provisional tax uplift factor will be cut from six per cent to five per cent, but that was already going to happen, Senator, because of amendments made in this chamber some two years ago. The new concessions for computer software and dealing with the millennium bug are important and generally welcome, but I have little faith that your tax crackdown on high wealth individuals will get very far—this seems to be an annual announcement—until your government gets serious about tax reform and addresses the use of trusts, personal service companies and other tax planning devices. These crackdowns will be basically ineffective. We will be back again next budget. Let us have another round of tax crackdowns.
On the revenue side, the government perversely fails to recognise the negative effects of the sale of Telstra; the effect it will have on future budgets if it is sold. Based on Telstra's 1996-97 profit performance, the sell-off of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra will cost the Australian public sector approximately $560 million a year. The failure to tell the true story of the impact of Telstra on future budgets really puts the lie to this government's much vaunted charter of budget honesty. The government does admit it will 
 be spending $580 million to sell the rest of Telstra. One piece of honesty is that which points out that the real winners of the Telstra sale will be the stockbrokers, the financiers, the lawyers and the advertising agency who will actually run your float. They have already pocketed an estimated $300 million from the sale of the first one-third.
In short, the 1998 budget will be remembered as the one with nothing much in it. There is nothing in it to start the process of repairing the damage done by the $7 billion in cuts which largely, as we have shown, have been unnecessary. There is nothing to boost the economy, business confidence and investment, employment and export performance. And of course there is nothing in it about tax reform. Your plans on what sort of a GST we are going to be having and what you intend to inflict on Australia remain hidden. These are very great failings.
On budget night I said as an ex-teacher that I would have marked the budget two out of 10 and instructed the student to repeat the exercise. Sadly, Peter Costello is unlikely to redo his budget. However, the Senate would be in error if it did not try to repair at least some of the economic damage arising from the spending cuts. The Senate is unable to touch the outlays side of the budget but we can move to modify some of the new measures on the revenue side. What the Democrats propose is to provide some incentives through the tax system to encourage business to innovate, export and employ. We propose to do this in a way that does not affect the budget bottom line but has the potential to improve the current account deficit and lower the unemployment rate.
The Democrats have already announced that we will move to means test the savings rebate announced in last year's budget, and that will save about $1 billion in the year 2000. We will also move to restore the full benefit of the export market development scheme by providing an equivalent tax rebate where an eligible firm is denied funding because of the cap imposed on the grants scheme. We will move to restore the R&D concession up to 150 per cent to encourage business. These two measures alone will provide a very 
 significant boost to Australian business, helping them to get on with the job of chasing new markets and opportunities.
We also propose to move amendments to the tax act to provide important and necessary relief to small business. Let us remember that small business has been doing it pretty tough in the last year. Mid last year, the Yellow Pages index reported that most small businesses regarded the economy as in recession or at a standstill. Bankruptcy rates have soared. Small business income rose in 1997, but just by 1.7 per cent. Yet for provisional tax purposes, under your government, you have deemed that incomes have soared by six per cent.
Budget papers forecast economic growth of three per cent and income growth of 4.25 per cent, yet we have a provisional tax uplift factor of five per cent. This means that your government will be collecting $75 million extra off small business in the year ahead. We will move to reduce the uplift factor to four per cent and provide a very welcome $75 million boost to small business cashflows. And we will move to correct the anomaly in the sales tax system that places independent retailers at a disadvantage against big retail chains like Coles and Woolworths, which own their own wholesale operations. These measures will help small business get on with the business of creating new jobs and opportunities, despite the enormous cost of finance they face because of your reluctance to tackle the banks.
In taking these actions, the Democrats are demonstrating that we are deadly serious about getting unemployment down. We are deadly serious about improving Australia's trade position, and we are deadly serious about ensuring that small business remains a vibrant and growing generator of new jobs. If these measures win the support of the rest of the Senate, it will then be up to government to accept or reject them, as they bring with them a proven record of creating jobs and opportunities.
The Democrats will be watching very closely to determine whether the government is prepared to match its rhetoric with some action. In particular, the Democrats will be 
 putting pressure back on the government to repair the damage done by the spending cuts to Australia's economic and social fabric and to get more Australians back to work.
In conclusion, the Democrats believe that, despite the government's windy rhetoric, there is nothing in this budget as it stands. This budget might have been put together by the scarecrow, the tinman and the lion from the Wizard of Oz—no brains, no heart, no courage and certainly no yellow brick road for anyone other than the high priests of the financial markets. This budget does not set out a blueprint for the sort of equitable, the sort of fair and the sort of just and compassionate society which all fair-minded Australians want. That is what we looked for when we opened the budget papers yesterday, but there was nothing much in it.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1998-99</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-14,"—I rise to respond to the budget announcement on behalf of the Greens (WA). This budget is one that produces a nice bottom line surplus, but at what cost? The government is playing up the textbook tick and sidelining the other indicators that show the manifest inequities and deficiencies of government policies. This budget is a perfect example of how imperfect these narrow and deceptive economic indicators are. These measures are clearly not providing an accurate indication of the pain being felt in the community. This budget is a perfect example of the need for genuine progress indicators to identify wellbeing in Australia.
Genuinely reflective national accounts have been suggested by the United Nations. Senator Robert Hill, as long ago as September 1996, announced that the government was committed to linking the environment to the economy through indicators and accounting systems. What has come of this commitment? Absolutely zip.
The annual funding of approximately $300 million for the environment pales into insignificance when compared with the true growing environmental debt in this country. Just one example of the true debt is the estimated annual $1.5 billion in lost production due to land degradation.
The tunnel vision focus on the surplus this year represents regression from broadening the indicators of national wellbeing. This budget, in conjunction with the last two budgets, produces and reinforces social, environmental and economic debt. All the pats on the back belie the realities of what burdens have been borne to create the surplus.
There are two main things I would like to address tonight. Firstly, I would like to examine who has borne the brunt of this budget. Secondly, I would like to examine some fundamental problems with the government's general approach to the budget process. The flippant claims by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that the burdens have been shared by all and the benefits will be shared by all are an absolute farce. The burdens of the last two budgets have been borne disproportionately by social security recipients, indigenous people, students, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick and people in rural and regional communities. The government forcibly tightened the belts of those who could least afford it, driving an ever increasing bitter wedge between the rich and the poor.
This year the Treasurer has come out swaggering with his smug smile. He has thrown a few crumbs at those who had the potential to be wooed before the election. The Australian people are not fooled by a free jab in the arm and an extension of the seniors health card. These measures are no compensation for the $3.6 billion that has been cut from pharmaceuticals, hospitals, dental care and Medicare in the last two budgets. Less than $2 billion has been put back. The fact that the states were so appalled by the federal government's offer on the Australian health care agreements that they walked out indicates how hopelessly inadequate the so-called increased funding to hospitals really is.
The government cannot pull the wool over the eyes of regional and rural Australia. They are not fooled by the balloons of hot air about the government's commitment. It is abundantly clear that the commitment to rural and regional communities is in a drought. All of the so-called `initiatives' are simply a recycling of funding. For instance, the landcare tax 
 rebate for farmers comes out of the already stretched Natural Heritage Trust.
—That is if they have an income to pay any tax.
—That is right. The tax rebate is also worthless for those struggling farmers who are earning so little income that they do not pay any tax—great minds think alike! There has been no recovery of the permanent cut in funding of $15 million per annum that local governments lost last year. Such cuts seriously undermine the ability of regional and rural councils to provide desperately needed services.
This commitment drought comes at a time when the continued quality of telecommunications and postal services is under a huge question mark with the proposed sale of Telstra and Australia Post. Australians will not forget what has happened under the coalition pursuit of the bottom line. Families will not forget the loss of $821 million from child care. Students will not forget the missing $900 million from higher education. Indigenous people will not forget the $4 billion black hole in housing and infrastructure provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
A society with a sense of justice for all will not forget the slashing of over $100 million from legal aid. Unemployed people will not forget the $1.8 billion ripped from labour market programs and workers will not forget the fact that the government is threatening job security through industrial laws and by collusion with large companies.
The Treasurer has continued to play on prejudices and target certain groups so as to create divisions in society. After slashing labour market programs by $1.8 billion in the last two budgets, the government has put in an additional $350 million to pump up the work for the dole scheme. It is a scheme that is yet to be evaluated; a scheme that mutates the concept of mutual obligation—that is something the government should be doing—beyond recognition. Mutual obligation appears to mean, from the government's point of view, conscription and forced labour. Meanwhile, the new jobs network is putting $147.6 million back into the government's pocket 
 while it abrogates its responsibility for dealing with unemployment.
Propping up programs such as work for the dole is a tactical manoeuvre by the government to shift the parameters of the problem from unemployment as a social and economic phenomenon to the unemployed as individuals.	The general catchcry is: if you are unemployed, it's your own fault and you should pay. It even goes in the song: `You've got to look for the hero inside yourself'. It plays on and promotes the imagery of the dole bludger in a deeply insidious way.
The Treasurer has also sought to play on the One Nation style prejudices against immigrants. By flexing their muscles and pumping money into tightening border controls, they promote the image of the mischievous illegal immigrant, attempting to unfairly dip into the Australian honey pot.
Now the Treasurer claims that Australia has options; options to distribute benefits in the future. He strongly hinted that a GST will pay for income tax cuts. These hints, that deliberately antagonise the welfare lobby, are an attempt to derail a constructive and positive debate on tax reform. Moreover, this simplistic notion of tax reform has very clear winners and losers. Those who pay more income tax will reap the greatest benefits. The way in which personal income tax is determined means that, even if every marginal tax rate is diminished, high income earners will get the biggest windfall. They will get a tax break at every marginal rate.
It is widely understood that a GST disproportionately affects low income earners. It is clear to see who Mr Costello is lining up to get the rewards of all the hard yards. It is not the people who have borne the brunt of the burdens; it is those who have already had many of the advantages society has to offer. The government is driving a deep wedge between the prosperous and those struggling to make a reasonable life for themselves and their families. This budget amplifies that wedge.
The government, in the last two budgets, has placed a priority on debt reduction through a cutback in public sector outlays. The aim and focus has been primarily on a 
 nice, fat bottom line. The government boasts about moving towards surplus and tightening our belts. The government claims that these priorities are the so-called `fundamentals' of the economy, and once we get those fundamentals under control, there can only be prosperity for everyone.
Australians are crying out for the government to understand the economy in the context of the `fundamentals' of society, the `fundamentals' of the Australian ethos—fundamental concepts such as caring, tolerance, quality of life and a fair go for all Australians. This means 100 per cent of Australians; not just the prosperous or corporate Australians, but indigenous Australians, Australians living in poverty—mind you, over 30 per cent are living below or just above the poverty line—rural Australians, disabled Australians, elderly Australians, young Australians and sick Australians.
The result of previous cutbacks has been devastating for the most disadvantaged part of Australian society. The results are becoming more and more obvious. In a relentless pursuit of efficiency, a society of the overworked and unemployed is emerging. Welfare providers on the ground are seeing a massive increase in the need for their services. Just ask them. Welfare providers have seen people come through their doors who have never had to ask for help before. Things have got to such a desperate state, however, that people have had to lower their dignity and actively appeal for help because they just cannot make ends meet.
In 1998, we have a growing working poor in Australia. Despite all the evidence on the ground, the government has not heard the cries of the Australian people. The government has closed their eyes to the impact of their relentless pursuit of debt retirement. They have been conveniently mesmerised by that nice fat bottom line. Despite any realities in Australian society, despite the blow out in the current account deficit and despite the falling exchange rate, they continue to claim that prosperity will come. Just you wait and see.
Not only does the government's approach produce social problems, but the economic 
 basis is, to say the least, questionable. In economic terms, does Mr Costello really deserve a pat on the back for the budget surplus? Is he justified in expecting the surplus to expand? The government is happy to take the accolades for the surplus and to wear the badge of economic responsibility, but is this truly an economically responsible strategy?
As pointed out by Professor Quiggin in the Australian Financial Review today, this fiscal strategy is highly questionable. The government fails to recognise that Telstra is a major contributor to public savings. Telstra uses retained earnings to finance investment and produces over $1 billion in retained earnings every year. This is obviously a huge contribution to public sector savings and it does not show up in the budget papers. Quiggin also notes that Treasury fails to take into account the fact that the government does not claim franking credits. Private shareholders, however, are sure to claim these credits. Quiggin estimates that this will be a cost to revenue of $600 million. So the projected $700 million gained in interest savings by 2001-2002 is looking rather irresponsible in light of the $1 billion in retained earnings and the $600 million lost through franking credits.
Surplus? The longevity of the surplus is a sceptical proposition. The government took bows for the recovery of the `$10 billion Labour deficit', despite the fact that nearly half was due to bracket creep—a thing that they decried Labor for on a number of occasions. Similarly, the government is taking the bows for surplus projections despite the fact that Treasury provided the government with a $5.5 billion windfall by adjusting the parameters on which the budget is based. How nice to be able to spend some of this handy windfall while being able to present an ever increasing surplus estimate for the coming years.
Many commentators, including John Hewson, have pointed out that the surplus forward estimates should be taken with a truckload of salt. The impact of the Asian crisis has been underestimated, and the surplus projections have been bolstered by unrealistic spending projections and artificial 
 ly low spending projections. What we should be doing is looking at structuring the Australian economy to better weather the external storms. Bottom lines provide no real projections. If we have in this country a situation where every time there is an increased consumer confidence we have a blow-out in imports, somebody should be asking questions.
The government's suggestion that economic benefits will flow from pushing the budget to surplus is another dubious proposition. This is certainly not the case in relation to the current account deficit. The coalition's policies and claims are based on the concept of the `twin deficit theory' pushed by the International Monetary Fund. This theory is based on a link between budget deficits and surpluses and the current account deficit or surplus. As a result, the IMF continually pushes free market style structural adjustment policies—they pull it out of the drawer and they give it to every country they go into—labour market reform and substantial cuts to government spending as the best means of addressing problems such as large current account deficits.
The coalition has been a great fan of IMF style policies. Indeed, the Prime Minister was reverberating advice coming from the IMF's Mr Camdessus on page 2 of the Australian on Friday, 8 May 1998, by claiming that our recent current account blow-out meant that tight fiscal policy was needed. The idea of the twin deficit theory has never been born out in practice. This is overwhelmingly illustrated by the latest current account figures. Despite moves towards budget surplus over the last two years, our current account deficit is at its highest level ever. If anything, it appears that the more the current account deficit blows out, the more the Reserve Bank is able to produce more favourable dividends, which in turn makes the budget easier to balance.
The current account deficit, which reflects the state of the national economy, deserves serious attention. A good current account deficit can give leeway to deal with government budget deficits. A bad current account deficit can cause national economic collapse in spite of government surpluses.
The short-term focus of the budget surplus has failed Australia miserably. It has entrenched social, environmental and economic deficit. Socially, it has increased poverty and tension. Environmentally, it has ignored the real damage that is occurring and the reality that future generations will have to pay the mounting environmental debt. Economically, it will be shown to be wanting in the long term. Wipe that smug smile off your face, Mr Costello. Judge the budget truthfully. The Greens will be watching you and looking at the real indicators of Australia's well being on behalf of the forgotten community.
Debate (on motion by Senator Parer) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1998-99</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1998-05-14,"—This week, probably for the first time in Australian political history, we have seen a consensus reached between the established parties on the need for a balanced budget. This is truly an historic moment of consensus in the debate about the future of our country's finances and the direction of Australia's economic policy. This week on the Face to Face  program, Gareth Evans, Labor's shadow finance and treasury spokesman, said that the Labor Party now supports the goal of a surplus, that is, a balanced budget, one which is out of the red and into the black.
Mr Evans told Glen Milne on the Face to Face program that he agrees that we should have a balanced budget and, in fact, he claimed that Labor would try to produce a budget surplus. Do not hold your breath though, Mr Evans, that opportunity is years away.
Labor's newest graduate from the Democrats' finishing school, Mrs Kernot, also said over the weekend that a budget surplus was an `appropriate and symbolic goal'. Surely this statement begs the question: from 1990 to 1995 did she let the world's greatest treasurer know of her secret, symbolic goal? It would not appear so, because in May 1992 
 Mrs Kernot told the Senate that the Democrats did not support `the balanced budget nonsense' being pursued at that time by the coalition in opposition. So we can only conclude that this newly discovered appearance of responsibility has been collected on her way across to Mr Evans's office, from where she faxed her resignation to Democrat party headquarters. So now, former Senator Kernot and former Senator Evans have yet another new compact. But, as usual, no praise from her for this government's sensational budget surplus delivered by our Treasurer just two days ago.
Appropriate and symbolic—that is how Labor now describes the notion of a balanced budget. Of course, in the nineties, Labor often said they would have liked to have brought in a balanced budget. But, instead, they created the recession we had to have and the deficits just grew and grew like Topsy, until thousands of people woke up and gave them the sack. Even so, they left all of us with a disgraceful $10.3 billion deficit.
Meanwhile, back in the Democrats' newly reconstructed post-Kernot cottage, they also seem to be trying to improve their image and, goodness knows, they need to. Senator Meg Lees released the party's pre-budget submission last week, outlining her views and the party's views on budget policy—surely a new experience for the Democrats. She has elaborated on them in here tonight, and guess what? The Australian Democrats now also believe that, and I quote:
There is room for a modestly more expansive fiscal policy that delivers a balanced Budget and simultaneously provides a boost to the economy.
Fancy that! The budget proposals of the Democrats also represent a balancing act and also advocate a surplus as a desirable economic goal, although one a lot more modest than the one we produced just two days ago.
Despite the many shortcomings of the Democrats pre-budget submission, it is significant to take note of one important concession. That is, that the Democrats share our support for the government's determination to make a balanced budget a permanent part of Australia's economic policy making environment. This is a very commendable objective 
 from the cottage of the Democrats. This consensus between the established parties about the desirability of a balanced budget represents a historic pact in Australian politics which should not be overlooked. It is a commendable objective.
With this newly discovered consensus, the policy debate can now move steadily onwards. We have been warning that Australia can no longer live beyond its means with the profligate tax and spending policies of the former government. Isn't it now refeshing, and perhaps a little surprising, to find that both other established parties now agree? However, fundamental differences still remain, of course, especially in terms of our capacity to deliver on these economic policies. The Democrats' pronouncements reveal that they still fail to appreciate that it is the very budget surplus which is proving to be our key safeguard against the financial chaos now sweeping the Asian region.
The surplus is part of Australia's very precious insurance policy. `She'll be right, mate' may be part of the Australian idiom but it should not be part of any responsible political party. Never again should a political party in government be allowed to accumulate the massive debt that lay under the mat on 3 March 1996—never again. There should be no debt, no burden for our children, no crippling interest rate bills and, especially, no Beazley bankcard.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Adjournment,32,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-14," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1998:
With reference to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 March 1998, which reported the Minister as saying that parents migrating to Australia as part of family reunion programs come disproportionately from countries which do not have social security systems: (a) can a detailed breakdown be provided of the countries of origin of the migrants who were issued parent visas in the financial years of 1995-96, 1996-97 and to date in 1997-98; and (b) can a breakdown be provided of these countries of origin which do not have social security systems.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Family Reunion Programs</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,34,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-14,"—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has  
 provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(a) Table 1 below provides a detailed breakdown of the countries of origin (by country of birth) of the migrants who were issued subclass 103 and 804 parent visas for the financial years 1995-96 through to 30 March 1998.
A breakdown has only been provided with respect to countries which represent 1 percent or more of the total number of parent visa grants from 1995-96 to 30 March 1998. Of the 17,350 parent visas issued over the period, 14,643 or 84.5 percent came from these countries. The remaining 2,707 visas were distributed across a further 89 countries.
(b) Of the 18 major source countries, only the United Kingdom has so far been assessed by the Department of Social Security as having a social security system broadly comparable to Australia's (that is, being able to provide a reciprocal level of coverage of age or other pensions for Australians who move to those countries).
