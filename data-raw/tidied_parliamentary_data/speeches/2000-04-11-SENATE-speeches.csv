"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-04-11,"—During question time, Senator Greig asked me a question, and I have some information which may be of interest to senators. I seek leave to give the answer, although I do not have a pre-prepared answer.
Leave granted.
—Senator Greig, you asked me about incarceration rates, and I identified for you that Tasmania and the Territory have the lowest rates of indigenous incarceration versus non-indigenous incarceration, with 5.7 and 6.7. In fact, you can go further than that and say that the ratio of indigenous to non-indigenous rates of imprisonment in the Territory is lower than that of all other states and territories apart from Tasmania. The Northern Territory's ratio of indigenous to non-indigenous imprisonment is half that of New South Wales and half that of the rest of Australia.
You asked about Western Australia, and I quite agree with you: that is the state that has the greatest problem in this respect. There is information that is available, which I am sure you can get as well as I can, but I am quite happy to get more for you. The Western Australian government is aware of this and is trying to do something about it through a program called Safer WA. I am advised that, through that program, Aboriginal communities are working through the local Safer WA committees and the regional Aboriginal justice councils to try to find solutions to the very high rates of incarceration that there are for Aboriginal people in Western Australia. For example, their rate is 20.7 in the comparator—compared to the Northern Territory. There are plenty of states that have double the Territory's problem. In the debate on mandatory sentencing, which I indicated added very little to the complex problem of the impact of the criminal justice system on the indigenous community, we saw a lot of transparent huffing and puffing and a lot of pious pontificating. But bear this in mind. The people who said, `Judicial discretion is everything; we must have judicial discretion,' ignored the hundreds of ways that parliaments around Australia limit judicial discretion in the criminal law. What do those people say as to why some of the states which allegedly have all this judicial discretion have far worse comparative incarceration rates?
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Vanstone is able to provide more information in support of an answer she gave at question time. That is reasonable. She has now been on her feet for in excess of three minutes and I believe she is no longer providing additional information.
—It is very good information which is embarrassing to the Labor Party.
—It is not embarrassing. Ministers are limited to four-minute answers in question time and to one-minute answers to supplementary questions, and then the senator who asked the question does not have the capacity to ask a further supplementary question. I want to draw that to your attention, Madam Deputy President, and ensure that Senator Vanstone does not abuse the privilege she has been given in being given leave to add to an answer. 
—Senator Vanstone has indicated to me that she has one more quick point to make.
—I am pleased, Madam Deputy President, that you speak eye-contact language and understand. There is just one more point which Senator Greig raised with me and that was: what is the government doing about it? It will take some time to answer. There is an enormous number of programs on early intervention that would impact on the indigenous community and their relationship with the criminal justice system. I will get that together. I also indicate that I will be raising the matter at the Police Ministers Council because—
—That is another point now.
—Senator Greig asked what the government will do, and I am telling him that I will raise the matter at the Police Ministers Council because the judges as well as the police have a role in this. There is no one simple problem or one simple solution.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-04-11,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence's Legal Costs) Bill 1999-2000, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
APPROPRIATION (DR CARMEN LAWRENCE'S LEGAL COSTS) BILL 1999-2000
Purpose of the Bill
The Appropriation (Dr Carmen Lawrence's Legal Costs) Bill 1999-2000 will provide legislative authority for expenditure in 1999-2000 by the Attorney-General's Department in payment of a legal liability of the Commonwealth to the solicitors firm Dunhill Madden Butler, pursuant to the judgment of the Federal Court of Australia in Vass & Ors v The Commonwealth [2000] FCA 47. In the judgment, handed down on 2 February 2000, the Commonwealth was found liable to Dunhill Madden Butler for damages for breach a of contract to pay legal costs incurred by Dunhill Madden Butler in acting for Dr Carmen Lawrence MP in relation to the Marks Royal Commission and her court challenges to that Commission. The Commonwealth will also be liable to pay interest on the judgment to the date the damages are paid as well as the legal costs of Dunhill Madden Butler in pursuing its claim against the Commonwealth.
Reasons for Urgency
The Government has decided that the Commonwealth should not appeal the decision of the Federal Court and that a specific appropriation should be sought to enable the payment of the Commonwealth's liability. This followed advice from the Solicitor-General that damages could not be paid by way of the general appropriation to the Attorney-General's Department and that a specific appropriation should be sought.
On 25 February 2000, the Federal Court made final orders in Vass & Ors v The Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been ordered to pay to DMB damages, pre-judgment interest and costs. The unpaid judgment will continue to accrue interest. Therefore, introduction and passage of the Bill in the Autumn 2000 sittings is being sought.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-04-11,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move:
That the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Lamb Export to the United States of America) Amendment Order 1999 (No. 3) made under section 17 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997; and the National Television Conversion Scheme 1999 made under subclause 19(1) of Schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Lamb Export to the United States of America) Amendment Order 1999 (No. 3) made under section 17 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997
The Order permits the export of lamb to the United States beyond the amount of the quota on that trade set by the two countries.
New clause 20 grants to the Secretary to the Department the discretion to grant a “US lamb certificate” to an eligible exporter who fulfils certain conditions.  The Explanatory Statement notes that, despite the grant of this discretion, “the Secretary would in the normal course of events agree to the grant of the certificate.”  However, the Explanatory Statement does not indicate what is to happen if the Secretary does not agree to the grant of the certificate and whether the exercise of that discretion is subject to external merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
The Committee has received a response to these concerns from the Minister but wishes to seek clarification of specific issues. This notice will allow the Committee to do so.
National Television Conversion Scheme 1999 made under subclause 19(1) of Schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992
This instrument provides for the legislative scheme for the conversion of national television broadcasting services from analog to digital mode.
Division 2 of Part A, which is concerned with the requirements to be fulfilled by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in preparing and making a digital channel plan, appears to achieve an admirable level of consultation by all interested parties. Paragraph 10(b) requires the Authority to invite comments on its draft plan, and subsection 12(2) requires it to have regard, when making the plan, to any comments received.  However, section 11 permits the Authority to revise a draft digital channel plan, and gives it an unfettered discretion to decide “whether it is appropriate to invite comments” thereon.  The Authority appears to be given no guidance whatever in the Scheme in coming to a conclusion as to the appropriateness (or otherwise) of inviting comments.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-04-11,"—The opposition supports the passage of the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, with a proviso in relation to the aspects that change foreign ownership levels. That proviso goes to issuing a strong recommendation to the government to consider certain matters that fundamentally relate to Australian jobs and services in rural and regional Australia. I will come to those matters in a bit more detail when I address the opposition's amendment. I am presuming that the minister is on the way to the chamber, although with this minister one never knows.
This bill contains two schedules. Schedule 1 contains the proposed changes to liberalise the foreign ownership restrictions of Australian airlines. It also contains other minor technical amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. I will return to address this schedule later. Schedule 2 of the bill increases some of the penalties for breaching curfew legislation at Sydney airport. These amendments increase five-fold the maximum penalty for taking off or landing at Sydney airport in breach of the curfew in the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. The effect of these amendments is to increase the penalty for an individual operator from 200 penalty units to 1,000 penalty units. For a company, the increase is from 1,000 penalty units to 5,000 penalty units. In dollar terms, the new maximum penalty for an individual operating an aircraft in breach of the curfew will be $110,000 and for a company it will be $550,000. The amendments in items 3 and 4 of schedule 2 apply new maximum penalties for taking off between 10.45 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. from a runway not permitted by the act. These new maxima in section 10 of the act also represent a five-fold increase. They will now be $55,000 for an individual and $275,000 for a company.
It is interesting to note that the maximum penalty for breaching some other restrictions imposed by the act has not been changed. I am not sure where the minister is. Hopefully, he may be listening. Missing in action again, perhaps? I draw the minister's attention to the failure of the bill to increase the penalties in section 11. That section imposes a penalty for taking off or landing on a runway not permitted by the act between 6.00 a.m. and 7.00 a.m. or between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on a Saturday or a Sunday. Whilst the penalties for that section are the same as in the existing section 10, the government has not seen fit to increase these penalties. Other penalties have not changed, such as those for failing to lodge notices for landing noisy aircraft during the curfew or providing false or misleading information. I would normally call on the minister to explain these apparent anomalies. I am not sure if Senator Herron is sufficiently versed. Perhaps, if he is responding in relation to this legislation he could seek advice.
—Senator Herron is not. I would appreciate some advice from the government as to whether Senator Macdonald is going to grace the chamber with his presence or not.
I have called on the minister to explain these apparent anomalies that I have outlined. While he is on his feet explaining this apparent oversight in the policy, I also invite him to discuss the situation at Adelaide airport. At the last session of this chamber, we passed the private member's bill of the member for Hindmarsh in relation to the curfew for Adelaide airport. For the final reading of that bill, the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1999, the member for Hindmarsh declined the opposition's offer to work jointly to legislate for the provision of insulation for houses and public buildings affected by noise in the same way as for Sydney residents. The opposition calls on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services to declare a commitment to a combined effort to address that anomalous situation as well. An early indication of how much support the minister has for the new curfew at Adelaide has caused the opposition some concern, and while the minister is on his feet, he may elaborate in relation to that. In a press report in the Adelaide Sunday Mail of 26 March 2000, it was reported that the curfew was broken to assist Ansett to juggle its schedules because of a stop-work meeting. It seems to the opposition that that would not have fitted the criteria for emergencies agreed to by the parliament. But I invite the minister to explain what happened there—if he comes to the Senate.
In conclusion, I reiterate the opposition's support for the changes to schedule 2, incomplete as they are. It is not our job to tidy that up; it is the government's responsibility to do that and we call on it to do so. I appreciate there is some evidence provided to the courts that some airlines—and I stress that this is probably a very few—have seen fit or may in the future see fit to ignore the curfew as a cheaper option than delaying a take-off or arrival. It is unfortunate that some show such a lack of consideration for residents. For some, of course, only money talks and for that reason we support an increase in the penalties described. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but that the Senate, while supportive of the amendment to adjust foreign ownership rules under the Air Navigation Act 1920, considers that in examining a proposal for the sale of shares in Ansett to foreign interests, the Government should take into consideration the view that:
(a)	Ansett Australia should remain headquartered in Australia;
(b)	a fair share of future growth in routes should be through Ansett International;
(c)	high skilled, high value Ansett airlines jobs should remain in Australia;
(d)	Ansett jobs in regional and rural communities not be jeopardised by the sale; and
(e)	services to regional and rural communities should be preserved at current levels, or improved”.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-04-11,"—As has been mentioned, the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 deals with two particular issues. Firstly, it increases the maximum penalties payable for breaching the Sydney airport curfew. The penalties will increase by a factor of five. The rationale for this is that it is thought that the current level of fines does not have sufficient deterrent effect. I will refrain at this point from opening the Pandora's box of debate on airport noise other than to say that the Democrats support the increase in penalties.
The second issue with which the bill deals is foreign ownership restrictions relating to Australian international airlines. I should note that the bill does not impact on the ownership of Qantas, although presumably the amendments which we propose to give force to today may stand as some sort of precedent in respect of Qantas ownership. Currently the Air Navigation Act 1920 limits the ownership of shares in an Australian international airline to no more than 25 per cent for an individual foreign airline and to no more than 35 per cent in total for all foreign airlines. The bill proposes to remove these restrictions, replacing them with a simple requirement that no more than 49 per cent of an Australian international airline may be owned by foreign persons. These proposals come at a time when Air New Zealand is proposing to acquire News Corporation's shareholding in Ansett Holdings, giving it 100 per cent ownership of Ansett's domestic operations and 49 per cent of Ansett's international operations. The Australian Democrats do not oppose the liberalisation of the foreign ownership restrictions. They will, I believe, result in increased freedom of Australian international airlines to access global equity markets and thus expand globally and compete in the international market. For that reason we support this bill.
I would like, though, to comment on two issues arising out of this measure. The first is a procedural matter and the second is a substantive one. These amendments follow from the Productivity Commission report into international air services and the International Air Services Commission report provided to the government on 11 September 1998. It took the government some nine months—until 3 June 1999—to respond to that report and it took a further nine months to draft what appears to be a very straightforward piece of legislation. Subsequent to that, and as a clear result of the proposal by Air New Zealand to buy Ansett, this legislation takes on an incredible priority, which I do not think it can be argued that it would not have had were it not for this transaction being in the wings—pun unintended.
This bill had to be exempted from the provisions of standing order 111. That standing order was put in place, I understand, so that legislation would remain on the Notice Paper for a sufficient period to allow public scrutiny and for the public to make representations in accordance with ordinary democratic processes. This legislation was only introduced into the House of Representatives, and consequently publicly available, on 8 March 2000—just five weeks ago. The point I make is that the democratic processes of the Senate and of the parliament should not be curtailed to make up for the dilatory action of the government.
The substantive issue I raise relates to the second reading amendment that the opposition has circulated and to which Senator Mackay has spoken. I foreshadow that we will be supporting that amendment. The Australian Democrats are concerned about the potential impact that foreign ownership of our international airlines will have on employment, skills and services in this country. There is also some concern, which I share, that the head office of any Australian international airline should remain in Australia. The action by the Labor Party in circulating its second reading amendment is to be commended, but the Democrats would like to go one step further and put our concerns in the legislation. We would like to entrench in the legislation a requirement that the Treasurer be satisfied as to certain factors when making his decision as to whether or not to approve the transaction as being in the national interest.
At present the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act requires that the Treasurer's approval be obtained when a certain level of shareholding is being acquired by a foreign person. When the Treasurer is considering a transaction which involves a foreign person purchasing an airline, the Democrats believe that the Treasurer should be substantially satisfied that the following goals will be met: firstly, that the headquarters of the airline should remain in Australia; secondly, that highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry should also remain in Australia; thirdly, that jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised; and, fourthly, that services to rural and regional communities should be maintained and, if possible, improved.
I will digress for a moment and say that it would, of course, have been our preference and would perhaps have been more appropriate from a drafting perspective for these factors to have been contained in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. However, given that that act is not the subject of amendment and debate today through this legislation, these provisions will need to be enacted as part of the Air Navigation Act. I would add that they would have precisely the same effect if they formed part of the Air Navigation Act as they would have if they formed part of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. This amendment is a logical and reasonable extension of Labor's second reading amendment.
It has been indicated to me that the Labor Party will be opposing the Democrat amendment. I confess that that perplexes me a little, but I will pursue that a little later at the committee stage. I indicate again that the Democrats support the opposition amendment to the motion before the chair and will support the second reading of the bill.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-11,"—Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, I am sure you are delighted to be in the chair when we are discussing the aviation industry, given your recent experience with the aviation industry and, indeed, mine. I wish to speak to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 for a number of reasons, not the least being that air travel is the lifeblood of regional centres like Launceston in my state of Tasmania. Without regular air services, key economic activities, such as tourism, in northern Tasmania would be severely retarded. What is an already unacceptably high level of unemployment would, therefore, deteriorate even further. Since March 1996 and the period of the stewardship of this government, all services to regional Australia—not just aviation—have been under constant pressure in the name of economic efficiency. Under this government, unfortunately, terms like `economic efficiency' mean one thing only—cuts in services. I noted yesterday on the front page of the Launceston Examiner a story headed `North misses out on fares'. People have remarked on the parochial nature of the north versus south debate in Tasmania, but in this case it is not an argument based on a parochial interest in the generally under-stood sense.
According to a story in the newspaper, people flying from Melbourne to Launceston would have access to a more expensive dicount fare than people flying from Melbourne to Hobart. For those who are not aware, the flying time from Melbourne to Hobart is around 65 minutes but the flying time from Melbourne to Launceston is about 50 minutes. I understand that that would have been the first occasion that major airline fares to Launceston exceeded those to Hobart. Fortunately, I have been able to ascertain from the newspaper and from other sources that the airlines have now changed their minds. I was talking about both Southern and Ansett-Kendall in respect of that fare structure. So both airlines were at fault in that regard. They have now changed their minds and restructured these fares to ensure that people in northern Tasmania are not disadvantaged—in the sense that they will be paying the same fare—although one can mount an argument that they ought to be paying a lower fare for travelling a significantly shorter distance, given that one would expect that the cost structure of the airlines would be less to travel that shorter distance.
In coming to aspects of the legislation, I think it is important to note that the second reading amendment we are proposing—which I understand the government is accepting—is designed to ensure, at least in part, that services to regional Australia are not reduced. I will return to this point later. But going to the detail of the bill, schedule 1 relates to a liberalisation of foreign ownership rules for Australian airlines. At the nub of the opposition's support for the bill is a view that Australian companies must be able to compete on the international stage and that competition can enhance the welfare of and services to our community and economy—notwithstanding the glitch that I just referred to. Australian companies can provide that competition and our community can gain the greatest benefit from it, if they are given the latitude to operate under similar conditions to their competitors.
I must add that this argument applies equally to the Australian shipping industry. The minister, Mr Anderson, has two reports. One of these reports which has been available to the government since 1997 argues for government action to ensure that the Australian shipping fleet is able to compete equally with foreign shipping. But Mr Anderson has refused to act, and this key transport sector is being left to wither and die. But I digress.
Returning to the bill before us, these amendments seek to remove some of the current restrictions on foreign airlines' ownership and control of Australian international airlines, other than Qantas. At present the Air Navigation Act 1920 limits ownership of shares in an Australian international airline to no more than 25 per cent for an individual foreign airline and no more than 35 per cent in total for all foreign airlines. And I welcome the minister. The amendments remove these restrictions and replace them with a requirement that a foreign person can own no more than 49 per cent of an Australian international airline. This makes that provision more general and removes the distinction between restrictions on airlines and persons. I note for the record that these amendments do not apply to restrictions on the level of foreign ownership of Qantas. Those restrictions are contained in the Qantas Sale Act 1992, and there are no amendments to that act before the Senate. But I would be naïve to infer that these amendments have absolutely no bearing on Qantas. As has been borne out in recent press reports, British Airways has a keen interest in the passage of these amendments. That airline has made no secret of its desire to acquire a larger proportion of Qantas. That decision is not before this house and that debate will occur should amendments to that act be brought forward.
There has been a lot of focus on the recent negotiations between Air New Zealand and News Corporation in relation to the sale of News Corporation's share in Ansett domestic. This would give Air New Zealand 100 per cent ownership and control of Ansett domestic. As Ansett domestic owns 49 per cent of Ansett International—an Australian international airline for the purposes of the air services agreements—the amendments before the Senate are important for that deal to proceed. Soon after the announcement of that deal, the public became aware of negotiations between Qantas and Air New Zealand, or at least their significant shareholder, Brierleys, and simultaneously new talks between Ansett and Singapore Airlines seeking to finalise long-term ownership arrangements.
 It now appears that the talks between Qantas and Brierleys have been suspended, and there is an expectation that the announced deal between Air New Zealand and Ansett may proceed. The opposition has therefore considered this bill in a broad context. In fact, there are 12 airlines that have at one time or another been designated and have received allocations from the International Air Services Commission. Each of these airlines, with the exception of Qantas—for previously stated reasons—and National Jet Systems—because it is no longer an Australian company—would be beneficiaries under the new provisions of the act. Not all of these airlines are currently operating, but it shows the potential for broader application of what is before us. The limits on foreign ownership and control in the Navigation Act 1920 are derived from the provisions in the bilateral air services arrangements. These provisions allow either signatory to an air services agreement to refuse entry of airlines of the other country into their market on the grounds that they are not substantially owned and effectively controlled by nationals of that country.
The Productivity Commission inquiry report released in September 1998 provided a focus for considering and reassessing progress with Australia's approach to international air services. When the government announced its response to that report, the opposition welcomed the government's decision to reject the more extreme elements of it. The opposition supported the choice of incremental liberalisation rather than what was proposed, which was a unilateral and unfettered liberalisation favoured by some.
There is no sense in giving away rights without getting something back in return, in the opposition's view. The changes before the Senate are part of that incremental approach to liberalisation of international air services. They liberalise ownership and investment arrangements whilst staying clearly within the bilateral air services arrangements. They build on the long and strong history of aviation reform by the previous Labor government. The challenge to any government is to maintain the momentum of change while still delivering a benefit to the Australian community and Australian exporters, including tourism interests, air freight users and Australian international airlines.
So ownership and control provisions are a universal feature of an internationally applied framework of bilateral treaties. An individual country cannot progress too far in isolation. The changes put before us in these amendments will assist in airlines' alliance plans, will allow better access to capital markets and will ensure that Australia retains a healthy presence in the international market. At the same time, it sends a message that Australia is continuing to reform and is not a closed country.
My colleagues on this side of the chamber share a view that our community is best served by competition, but sensible competition that ensures that we all share in the benefits. That brings me to our second reading amendment with regard to this bill. Should the changes to the foreign ownership provisions in the Air Navigation Act 1920 proceed, it is still up to the government to consider the national interest implications of each application of foreign purchasers of Australian airlines. The government's foreign investment and sectoral guidelines, which are applied through the Foreign Investment Review Board, will also be amended to reflect changes in this bill. Under those sectoral guidelines, the Foreign Investment Review Board can presently only permit approval provided it is consistent with the national interest of acquisition of up to 25 per cent of an Australian domestic or international airline by an individual foreign airline flying to Australia, 40 per cent in aggregate of an Australian domestic airline by foreign airlines and 35 per cent in aggregate of an Australian international airline by foreign airlines.
Other foreign investors, including foreign airlines who do not fly into Australia, can acquire up to 100 per cent of an Australian domestic airline. Although the government has been prepared to consider proposals in excess of those standards for domestic airlines in special circumstances, there is no similar exception for international carriers. So, to take advantage of changes arising from this bill, the sectoral guidelines will need to be changed. The Foreign Investment Review Board is also, as I said, required to take account of the national interest. So it is in that area that the government, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, has latitude to examine closely the plans and intentions of proposed investments.
The opposition's amendment relates to the proposed investment by Air New Zealand to take over Ansett. Legitimate and expected concerns exist, held by the employees and their representatives, that the deal will not deliver on the expectations of our community. As I said before, the opposition supports globalisation of markets and opening our organisations to foreign ownership, provided there are benefits and provided those benefits are shared and enhance our community.
In relation to this proposed deal, there are a number of concerns in the community, and I will enumerate them. There is a concern that Air New Zealand is undercapitalised and that jobs will be cut to provide that injection of funds. The Australian Services Union has a concern that there will be a loss of 2,000 jobs in administration, information technology, engineering and maintenance, and reservations. There is also a concern about a loss of skills and expertise from Australia and that jobs will be transported to purported lower wage markets, particularly in New Zealand. There is a concern that the regional focus of Ansett and its subsidiaries, Kendell, Aeropelican and Skywest, must also be maintained for passenger and trade access to and from regional communities. There is also an issue of just which badged airline—for example, Air New Zealand or Ansett International—will receive what share of future growth in international business. Obviously the fear is that the growth will be through Air New Zealand and that Ansett International will not receive its fair share, with a flow on to jobs and job security.
I must say that, after a briefing from Ansett and Air New Zealand on this proposed deal, I personally was far from satisfied on a number of points, particularly on the issue of job security. That is why these amendments we have before us are so important. While it has principally been Ansett employees and their union officials who have raised and campaigned around these issues, they are echoes of the fears in the broader community. They are concerns that we are hearing continually: concerns about jobs, the maintenance of skills, job securityfor those who have jobsgrowth for the future and access for members of our community to aviation services.
In considering the decision on the effective takeover of Ansett by Air New Zealand, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the government must obtain commitments from Air New Zealand to address these concerns. Through this amendment we are calling on the government to pursue assurances from Air New Zealand that ensure the benefits of liberalisation of ownership and the opening of this airline will be shared. We seek to ensure that Ansett remains headquartered in Australia, firstly. This is to be sure that the significant presence of this Australian airline remains in Australia. The message from all is that this airline is important to our community and for jobs, and that this community wants the company to still identify with Australia and to have its main office here, with the jobs that go with it. Those headquarters must be more than just a building. If the new entity fails to honour the commitments it has given to both the government and the opposition, we believe it must be held accountable. The company must therefore have a management presence in Australia such that it can be held accountable. I seek confirmation on that point from the minister. I want to know where we go and whom we go to when and if there is such a problem. 
The second point I want to raise is that a fair share of future growth in Air New Zealand's international routes will be through Ansett International. Again, this is about aspirations for growth and to address the concern that growth will be shared between the airlines in a fair manner for their common owner. The third point I want to raise is that high skill, high value Ansett Airlines jobs remain in Australia. Again, this is about growth and about ensuring opportunities for quality of life for current and future generations. It is about getting a fair share of the benefits of growth, globalisation and competition, not just a share for the shareholders and executives.
The issue of skill shortages in the aircraft, engineering and maintenance areas has been raised in the media and in the Senate. I have been informed that Qantas is already employing skilled licensed aircraft maintenance engineers from overseas. Australian airlines must address these skill shortages in the interests of the community and the economy. Points (d) and (e) of the amendment go to the retention of jobs and services and to the potential for growth in services in regional and rural communities. These points are about ensuring that regional communities do not pay the price of cheaper airfares on popular routes. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the opposition will not decline to give this bill a second reading. But, in relation to the announced deal between News Limited and Air New Zealand, we are urging them in the strongest possible terms to exercise the powers they have to ensure, firstly, that Ansett Australia remains headquartered in Australia; secondly, that a fair share of the future growth in Air New Zealand's international routes be through Ansett International; thirdly, that high skill, high value Ansett jobs remain in Australia; fourthly, that Ansett jobs in regional and rural communities not be jeopardised by the sale; and, fifthly, that services to regional and rural communities be preserved at current or higher levels. We ask and, indeed, expect the government to support our second reading amendment. The Democrats have indicated they will support it. ",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-04-11,"—I thank Senator O'Brien for his quite clinical assessment of the legislation and of the points involved in the government's bill. Senator O'Brien has gone into it at some length, and that means that I will not have to go into it to the same length, as the senator is clearly already aware of the purpose of the bill and what it actually says. 
I apologise to Senator Mackay and Senator Greig for not being present in the chamber during their speeches on the second reading, although my advisers have been here and they have indicated a couple of specific issues that I will try to address. I would not normally absent myself from any debate in which I am involved; however, I am sure other senators will excuse me on this occasion. I was involved with members of the Youth Roundtable, who have come along to see how the parliament sometimes works. We have been waiting for this bill for several days, and it happened to come on at the very time when I did not want it to—when I was with the young people. Their timetable is very tight.
—It is Murphy's Law.
—As Senator O'Brien said, it is Murphy's Law. The government did announce in a joint statement on international air services in June 1999 that it would, among other things, reform the foreign ownership rules for Australian international airlines other than Qantas. You might recall that the arrangement up to that time was that any single foreign airline could have a 25 per cent interest in Australian flagged international airlines, or any group of foreign carriers could have a 35 per cent interest. But we announced back in June 1999 that we were going to amend that to give Australian flagged international carriers the right to get more capital and to get the expertise that international airlines could provide.
I understand that Senator Greig, in his speech on the second reading, complained that the Senate did not have enough time to consider the bill in full. However, as I said, this policy of the government has been around for more than nine months, and a lot of work has been done with it. I might say to the opposition how gratifying it is that the government and the opposition can work together in the interests of Australia's airline industry. I appreciate the work that Mr Martin Ferguson, the shadow minister in the other chamber, and his staff, have done in conjunction with Mr Anderson and his adviser in coming up with a suitable outcome for this needed legislation. The reason I think everyone supports it, including the Democrats, is that the benefits of international air travel are increasingly important to the Australian community. Tourism is now Australia's largest single export industry, with earnings of some $16.3 billion in 1998-99. Of course, the international tourism industry creates jobs for Australians, and, as I was saying to members of the Youth Roundtable earlier, it is the type of activity that will provide jobs for young Australians, particularly in rural and regional Australia where young Australians are looking for work. 
Tourism in rural and regional Australia is increasing, and I might sound a bit parochial when I keep mentioning Longreach in my state of Queensland. It was a wool community in years gone by, but it has now turned around quite substantially. While the annual income from wool in the Longreach area is about $22 million annually, from tourism it is around $45 million. It just shows how important tourism is to regional and remote Australia; and of course the airline industry brings in foreign tourists to our country.
International air services also carried some $53 billion worth of freight into Australia in the year ended December 1999. But Australian international airlines do compete in a global market, and to maintain and increase their market share they must be given the opportunity to develop attractive products for consumers, based upon their assessment of commercial demands. They do that either in their own right or in partnership with airlines of other countries.
The system of bilateral arrangement, where countries that govern international aviation impose national ownership and control restrictions to regulate entry into the international aviation market, does apply. These commonly require that international airlines be substantially owned or effectively controlled by either party to a bilateral agreement. Australia's current ownership control requirements mean that expansion of our international airlines can be assisted only to a limited degree at the present time by drawing upon foreign investment. The current arrangements encourage high levels of debt rather than obtaining equity to fund long-term expansion. In a cyclical industry like the international airline industry, this is not a very desirable method of funding expansion.
As Senator O'Brien said, this bill, if enacted, will amend the ownership and control requirements to provide for up to 49 per cent foreign ownership of Australian international carriers, other than Qantas—and I emphasise that Qantas is dealt with separately in other acts—with no distinction between foreign airlines and other foreign investors. This will set the level of foreign equity in Australian airlines at the limit that our bilateral partners are likely to accept. The amendments to the Air Navigation Act proposed in this bill do not apply to Qantas. The arrangements for Qantas are legislated for in the Qantas Sale Act. This amendment bill also contains a provision relating to the Sydney Airport Curfew Act, and there are some amendments to that. They have been debated here by other senators, and they are fairly sensible amendments that all parties to this bill actually support.
I emphasise that, whilst understandably the discussion in the Senate today has been about Ansett and Air New Zealand, and Air New Zealand's buying out of News Limited's share in Ansett, this bill does not relate only to Ansett. It relates to any airline that has a majority Australian ownership and which flies and is licensed to fly internationally. These liberalised foreign ownership restrictions—the 49 per cent—will benefit every Australian company that seeks in the future to operate international air services. I also emphasise to the Senate and to those who may have an interest in this bill that the bill does not represent government approval for the Air New Zealand takeover of Ansett. The government is considering that bid through a parallel process under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. As Senator Mackay and Senator O'Brien have said, the opposition has a second reading amendment to the bill, and I can confirm that we will be supporting that amendment. We are considering the headquarters issue and the future of Ansett International, and we are of course considering the regional implications of the bid.
I understand that Senator Greig has foreshadowed a Democrat amendment. We will not be supporting the amendment because we do not think it is necessary—in fact, we think it is redundant. We will be considering all of the issues set out in the amendment proposed by the Democrats as we work through the proposed takeover. I want to emphasise to the Senate that we are examining the proposal very closely and very rigorously, and Ansett and Air New Zealand cannot take the government's approval for granted. Mr Anderson and the government agencies that support him in these considerations will be very closely looking at the Air New Zealand takeover.
In addition to our own considerable in-house capabilities, we have commissioned outside financial advisers to provide us with additional advice about the financial sustainability of that proposal. I suppose it could be argued that the amendment is necessary because some future government might not follow the same rigorous approach that this government has adopted; however, I cannot imagine any government, current or future, that would not consider the points set out in the Democrats' amendment as a matter of course. We believe that the Democrats' amendment would simply clutter up the Air Navigation Act with an unnecessary statement of what is obvious. I also suggest that, even if we were inclined to support what the Democrats are saying in a legislative way, we would not be supporting it under the Air Navigation Act. It would seem that the place for a debate on these sorts of matters would be when parliament is considering any amendments to the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act, which is the more appropriate place for the types of amendments that the Democrats are proposing.
I understand that Senator Mackay in her address sought an explanation as to the disparity between the fine for breaches at Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney—which are a maximum of $550,000 under this bill—and the maximum fine that applies in Adelaide, which is $110,000. The current maximum fine for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is $110,000. In response to Senator Mackay, I indicate that the government have identified that there is a particular enforcement problem at Sydney airport. Without overstating the obvious, it sometimes became a paying proposition for an international airline to deliberately breach the curfew, knowing that even if the maximum fine of $110,000 were imposed, they would still be better off. The consequences sometimes of missing a flight, all of those things like not being able to take off at the right time, having to put up passengers in a hotel—and in a big aircraft there are a lot of passengers—and rescheduling can become a very expensive exercise for the airline involved. Some of them may have thought at times that they would be better off to pay the fine and to send the aircraft out in the curfew time rather than to abide by the curfew. That is the reason why we have increased the maximum fine applicable at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport.
Senator Mackay questioned why this did not apply to Adelaide. The answer to that, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, is that your state of Adelaide is not quite Sydney and Adelaide Airport is certainly not Kingsford Smith Airport, and we expect that there will not be the same sort of incentive to breach the curfew at the Adelaide Airport as there is, for the reasons I have mentioned, at Sydney airport. There have been a number of breaches at Sydney airport. There has recently been a successful prosecution. I am unaware of any breach of curfew at Adelaide airport. If there have been any, the problem is not very great. Accordingly, the fine has been set at the lower level. But if it becomes obvious—if history shows—that there is an increase in the breaches of the curfew at Adelaide airport, then the government will not hesitate to increase the penalties to bring them into a higher category. But, to this date, there has not been any factual evidence which has necessitated the government looking at that. That is why the difference has occurred.
I thank those senators who have participated in the debate and commend to the chamber the bill and the second reading amendment that has been moved by Senator Mackay on behalf of the opposition. 
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-04-11,"—I rise to speak on the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 and the associated bill and will be addressing most of my remarks to the question of the taxation treatment of charitable institutions and not-for-profit organisations and the measures that are contained in the bills. Other senators from the opposition will address some of the broader economic issues and other issues in the bills. I do not profess to be expert in those areas, and I think Senator Sherry and others will address some of those areas. I have taken an interest in this particular measure and its impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector, mainly because of my shadow ministry responsibilities and also because of the inquiry into the goods and services tax conducted by the community affairs committee last year when a range of these issues were raised constantly with us and when, to be brutally frank, a lot of organisations said that the impact of the FBT changes would be more serious for them than any of the GST changes because much of the not-for-profit area was largely GST free and the FBT changes were going to have a very serous effect on their ability to provide services.
I move a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition: 
Omit the words after “That”, substitute:
“further consideration of the bills be an order of the day for the day after the day on which a report is tabled in the Senate of an independent inquiry established by the Government, after consulting the not-for-profit sector on membership and terms of reference, to:
	(a) investigate and update the definitions of `public benevolent institution' and `charitable institution' for the purposes of tax law; and
	(b) inquire into the appropriate taxation treatment of charitable and not-for-profit organisations and the public hospital sector”.
In moving this amendment, Labor are seeking to ensure that the debate about this bill is an informed debate. I will come back to this theme later in my speech, but we are seeking to make sure that the decisions we make on the taxation treatment of the charitable and not-for-profit sector are informed decisions. Our main thesis is that we are not in the position to do that at the moment and that we do not have enough information about the impact of these changes. I think the GST community affairs committee inquiry threw a lot of light on some of those problems, but we still have not come to terms with the serious impact these changes may have on the not-for-profit sector and particularly on the services they deliver to the most disadvantaged in the community—the disabled, the poor, the aged and the Aboriginal medical sector.
These are very serious issues. Our major concern is that we do not have enough good information about the impact on those organisations and that we should not be making massive changes to their taxation treatment without that information. It is the case that Labor had supported a position prior to the last election very similar to the government's which sought to cap fringe benefits tax arrangements. We still support the need for capping, the need for transparency and the need for accountability in terms of these provisions. I do not think that there is anybody in this chamber who has an alternative view. We are arguing about the level of the cap, how it is applied and who it is applied to. I want to make it very clear that the Labor Party do support the cap. We are most dissatisfied with the current arrangements whereby informal advice from the tax office is provided to organisations. They have been basically advised that 30 per cent salary packaging is acceptable and that, provided they do not go over that limit, the tax office will not call on them or ask them to assist them with their inquiries. So it has become a bit of a benchmark in the industry. That is not a very satisfactory way of doing it, and we support the view of the government that we need to regulate that and that we need to find a much better and more transparent way of dealing with this issue.
Before I continue, I just want to say that, in terms of the second reading amendment, we are obviously looking to defer consideration of these FBT changes for not-for-profit organisations and charitable institutions. That is the impact of our amendment. We are not proposing to delay the rest of the bill and clearly we are suggesting by this measure that, if we are successful with the amendment and the government wants to continue proceeding with the rest of the bill, we will be happy to facilitate that. I understand that there are other measures in the bill about grossing up the formula for fringe benefits that are not the subject of the concern I am expressing now, and we would anticipate those going ahead. But we are concerned to deal with the issues of the impact of the FBT on the not-for-profit sector that I have just raised.
It is important that we get some certainty into this issue, because there are people currently working in not-for-profit, public hospital and charitable institutions who are unclear as to what their current conditions of employment are. Because of the government's announcement of 1 April as the operative date, people actually do not know what their current conditions of employment are. Most employers have been slow to make changes because they know that the bill has not been passed. They know there is a live debate in the parliament about the conditions that ought to be applied to the not-for-profit sector. There are people who operate under awards, under agreements and in unregulated employment conditions who have a set of employment arrangements that have been thrown up in the air. They do not know how they stand. Like other senators, my office has been getting lots of calls from people saying, `What does this mean for us? How do I arrange our affairs? Have I effectively just had a salary reduction?' and we cannot answer those questions. It is important that we get some certainty to it, that we get something that allows people to operate with a degree of certainty and allows them to plan. I am sure the government says, `Well, if we can just pass the legislation, everything will be certain,' and in a sense that is right. But there are issues we think need to be debated and resolved, and we do not think the government's approach is necessarily the correct one.
The issue was the subject of submissions to the Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the government's tax package which reported to the Senate in March last year. However, at the time the government signalled that it was unable to comprehensively examine the impact of the proposed FBT changes. In October last year, Labor called for an independent inquiry into this issue. We gave the government notice that we were concerned about the evidence arising from those inquiries, that we were concerned about the evidence being put forward by the charitable and not-for-profit sector, and that we thought an independent inquiry into this issue was warranted. The government has ignored that request. While the government may want to claim that it is a bit late to be moving this amendment, the reality is that we have had a consistent position calling for some sort of inquiry to resolve some of these important public policy issues at stake here and get some clarity as to some of the issues that are causing confusion.
—For many months.
—Yes. We have had this position since October and we thought that the government may well adopt it. We have advocated a Ralph style inquiry into the not-for-profit sector, to give them the same sort of treatment that the business community received, in terms of an overall look at the taxation treatment of the charitable sector.
—As have the Democrats.
—Yes, the Democrats have as well. I think there has been a consensus in the sector that that would be useful. As a result of this legislation being put off and the government not responding to that request, we are now in the situation where the operative date has passed, we have not got legislation in place and we have not had a resolution of those public policy issues.
In my amendment today, I try and throw the issue back to the government in the sense of them consulting with the sector about having an independent inquiry. I also have a motion on the Notice Paper about a Senate committee inquiry. Being frank and to be fair to the senators on the committee, including me, it is a second-best option. I do not think we have the same level of expertise and resources that an independent inquiry could bring to the issue. We would do a professional and reasonable job, but I think that a Ralph style inquiry would be a better and more comprehensive option and one which would take those great public policy issues a bit further. If this approach is rejected by the government, then we will pursue the Senate inquiry approach. That issue has been on the Notice Paper for some time. At the request of the Democrats, I have delayed it as we have tried to find a way through these issues. As I say, I think the independent inquiry would be the better option given the scale of the changes proposed, the number of organisations affected and the impact on the public hospital sector, which is going to be enormous. I think we are talking about $700 million over the next four years, so these are major changes to the taxation treatment. They need a proper examination.
I accept that the government has now made some changes and the bill currently before the Senate includes a higher limit of $25,000 for the cap for charitable and not-for-profit organisations. The fact that the government has increased the FBT concession limit to charitable and nonprofit organisations is an admission, I think, that the original limit was too low and would have unfairly reduced their ability to deliver services to the disadvantaged. The government has begun to recognise that problem and what it means for services to the most disadvantaged in our community. I am not clear why the government chose the $25,000 limit and how that new higher limit will avoid cuts to services, but it is a sign that the government is trying to deal with the issue. The reality is that even with a higher limit the proposed change will still raise significant amounts of revenue, which means significant cuts to the operational budgets of charitable and nonprofit organisations. An enormous impact is still going to be felt by these organisations.
The proposed limit on FBT concessions is a significant change to the taxation treatment of charitable and nonprofit organisations and the public hospitals. Yet the only thing we know for certain about this change is that it will act to reduce the range of community and public hospital services they provide. At the time of the Senate inquiry last year, the government was unable to provide any detailed information on the modelling of the impact of the measure. This lack of information was noted in the inquiry's report to the Senate. More than a year after the proposed limits were announced, the government still refuses to or is unable to provide specific information on the impact of the proposed changes. We have no information on the extent of the use of the FBT concessions. We have no information on the pattern of the use of the FBT concessions and we have no information on the value of the FBT concessions to the charitable and nonprofit organisations and public hospitals. The figures on the revenues raised by the proposed FBT limits included in the bill are rough estimates at best. On the government's own figures, I have seen a number of different figures quoted. But they all indicate that over $700 million will be cut from the budgets of charitable and nonprofit organisations and public hospitals over the next four years.
While the government has been unable to provide detailed information on the impact of the changes it is proposing, the organisations that will be affected have done so. They presented submissions to last year's Senate inquiry and they have continued to lobby and provide evidence of the very real impact on the services they provide. Just a few of the organisations that presented evidence to the Senate inquiry included: the Spastic Centre of New South Wales, which would be forced to cut services to 370 school aged children, close a respite centre and cease services to 200 families in rural communities; Deafness Forum Australia, which would be forced to cut one in three staff; and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, which has stated that all remote health services in the Northern Territory would be closed and many urban services would suffer cuts. These are very real impacts. They are impacts this parliament has to grapple with seriously. We need to come to terms with it. The Labor view is that we ought not make changes when we do not know the impact of those changes and we ought not make changes that we have been warned will seriously affect those in the community who can least protect themselves. I am sure that is a concern for all senators on all sides of the chamber.
The government has also refused to address the need for compensation to ensure that essential services to the disadvantaged are not reduced as a result of the proposed changes. Clearly, that is an alternative we could consider. It is worth remembering that the issue was examined by the 1995 Industry Commission report into charities. I note that Senator Woodley and I both spoke on it on that occasion. We are still involved in the issue. At the time the commission stated:
Given the major benefits which [charitable and non-profit organisations] as a whole currently derive from input tax exemptions, however, the Commission considers that any proposal to remove these benefits should include alternative ways of providing the same aggregate level of government assistance to the sector.
That principle was applied at a time when this was a very small issue compared with what it is today. The growth in fringe benefits tax exemption usage has been phenomenal since then, driven, in part, by a couple of state governments and by the demands placed on the charitable and not-for-profit sector for more services in difficult times. Until there is an independent inquiry into the use of the FBT concessions, we cannot know what the impact of the proposed limits are and we cannot know what reductions to services will occur as a result. We therefore cannot be sure that we can protect those services to the least disadvantaged in our community. In the short time left to me, I want to mention that there is a real need to look at the basis of many of these concessions. There is a lot of concern about the definition of `PBI' and the definition of `charities'. As I understand it, we have to refer back to an act of the British parliament from the 16th century. It is a funny way to build a new tax system for the 21st century, and it seems to me that we can do better.
I turn briefly to the role of the Democrats. I have had some very constructive discussions with them and I hope we can continue to work our way through these issues. What we are proposing is that the inquiry precede debate on this bill, that we have the information at our fingertips when we debate the bill. I urge the Democrats to adopt that approach. I am concerned that they may be looking at adopting an approach of voting for some sort of inquiry but will deal with the bill now. We do not have the information that allows us to have an intelligent public policy debate about the legislation. We are not informed by that inquiry. If we make the decision and have the inquiry afterwards, it raises the question: why have an inquiry? I know that the Democrats, like the Labor Party, are interested in a broader inquiry than—
—Senator, it is always nice to know what the results of an inquiry are before you institute one. I am sure it is a policy you pursue, and Telstra does come to mind. But I digress. I make the point to the Democrats that, while I know there are wider issues, at the heart of this is the FBT and its impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector. There is also the question of the GST. I understand the sensitivities about that. If we are serious about having a proper public policy debate about how all those taxes impact on the sector and its ability to deliver services, we have to do it in a holistic way. We need to have the inquiry and then make decisions about the taxation treatment of those institutions. If we do not have the inquiry first, we will be making these decisions tomorrow morning without the benefit of that information. I think it would be a very brave senator who made the claim that we really know what the impacts of these changes are. I do not think the government knows and I do not think the Senate knows either. I would make a plea to the Democrats to support our second reading amendment because it does allow us to have that proper and informed public policy debate, to have a Ralph type inquiry report to inform the Senate's work and to inform proper legislation in this country. We would get a much better result from such an approach.
Clearly, the Labor Party operates in a political environment where it does not have the numbers. If the amendment is defeated and the bill goes to the committee stage, we will vote on any amendments proposed and we will have to take a stand on each of the issues. We would prefer to do that with the benefit of a proper inquiry, proper modelling and proper research. We think we would get a much better public policy outcome if we dealt with it in that way. A proper inquiry would inform the Senate debate, allow us to make informed decisions and allow us to have a bit of a community debate too about the proper taxation treatment of charities before we moved to deal with the FBT limits. There are, of course, questions about the operative date and so on, but our preferred position, since October, has been to have that proper inquiry, to recognise the evidence we received from the GST inquiry that there were serious problems with the implementation of these FBT proposals—to have an inquiry to get that information—to have an informed debate and then to deal with the bill. That is our preferred option. I hope we get some support for it. If not, obviously we will move on to dealing with the substance of the bill and making decisions accordingly.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-04-11,"—First of all, I wish to address the concerns that Senator Evans has just expressed. Certainly, in intention, the Australian Democrats will support the opposition's second reading amendment. It may be that we will still want to change some of the words. We can do that by negotiation tomorrow because obviously the second reading debate of the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 will not be finished tonight and will continue for some time tomorrow. By and large we intend to support the opposition's second reading amendment, but it may be that we can negotiate a change to some of the words. Senator Evans, we will find that out when we have that conversation with you. I just give you that assurance.
I agree with just about everything you have said, in particular that we do not have the kind of information we really need in order to do justice to this debate, and certainly in order to do justice to the charity, churches and not-for-profit sector. The very fact that I have had to use an extended description points to the problem that we have in law. The basis upon which most of these matters are dealt with is a law that goes back some 400 years in English law. Someone told me today that, in fact, it goes back further than that—to the 1100s. I do not know how we can ever expect in a modern society to be basing legislation on that kind of proposition. So we need the kind of inquiry Senator Evans described. I hope that with goodwill on all sides, and maybe a further discussion about wording, we will achieve what Senator Evans has described.
In the few minutes that are left to me tonight, I want to talk about the motivation for the government introducing this legislation, because the motivation that has led to the debate and the legislation which we have before us is very clear. I would remind the Senate—and I do not know whether senators have forgotten this—that it was the Ralph report on business taxation which proposed that, in order to pay for a reduction in the company tax rate, the government should abolish the fringe benefit tax exemption to this sector. That was a proposal in the Ralph report. Quite clearly, the government were not game to do that. The roof would have fallen in, I am sure, and they realised that. But they did propose a kind of half-way measure, that is, there should be a $17,000 cap across the board on charities, on churches, on hospitals—you name it, wherever there was an exemption in the past, then a $17,000 cap should be imposed in the future. That of course was intended to raise over $200 million, which in effect would achieve what the Ralph report proposed, that is, to compensate for the loss of revenue in lowering the company tax rate.
The churches and the charities reacted very strongly to that, and for good reason. They know that the Industry Commission—or Productivity Commission as we now call it—some years ago did a major inquiry into charities. In fact, the report they produced was quite thick. It showed that some of the charities and some of the services which they provided were overusing the fringe benefits tax exemption, to such an extent in a few cases that I think one could use the word `rorting' without being unfair. That was true. When that Productivity Commission report came down, the major churches and the major charities realised that there had been some overuse of the fringe benefits tax exemption. So they went and had extensive conversations with the Australian Taxation Office. It was never put in writing, and so the Treasurer keeps on reminding us that there is no legislation and no written advice to actually underline the position I am putting—but it was very clear. I have spoken to charities across the country and all of them have reported that this is what happened: they had a conversation with the tax office; it was not written down; it was not put into legislation. That is true, but all of the charities and churches, et cetera, adopted voluntarily a 30 per cent cap on salary packaging using the fringe benefits tax exemption. That was the agreement reached. The government has totally ignored that. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-04-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a document that the Attorney-General must have prepared each year to fulfil his obligations under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The report from the Attorney-General and the act that he is in compliance with are often thought of as giving permission to policing authorities to intercept telephones, telegrams and no doubt other communications. I see Senator Alston in the chamber. The onset of technology in this area is incredible. The policing authorities find it very useful to listen in to these conversations and, indeed, to tape them in the course of gaining intelligence and evidence for prosecutions. The act allows all that.
Fundamentally, the act is about protecting our privacy. I think it is very useful to talk to a report like this to bring to our mind that the concept of privacy still has currency, that there is some protection for privacy in the legislation that comes before this chamber and that ultimately becomes law in this country. The issue of privacy is a big one. It is a big issue in Europe and elsewhere. We have laws regulating privacy for the public sector but there are no laws that protect privacy in the private sector. I know that the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, was intent on getting such legislation through when he first took over the office, and no doubt he is still intent on that happening. It would be good to see legislation brought in to protect privacy. We all want our privacy but, unfortunately, moves are not made that would enable us to have it to the extent that we would want. Indeed, the protection is so feeble that maybe it is not the protection of privacy we want but legislation that says there ought to be an equality of possession of information so that, if we are not going to have privacy, at least we will have as much information about things as everybody else does, because knowledge and what you know about others, of course, is a great strength in any relationship one might have.
Since this act was brought in, the number of authorities that have been able to tap into electronic communications between people has grown. On 28 October 1988 the Victorian police were given possession of it. I must say that is a very significant date because it is the birthday of my wife, Lillian, but that is just an aside that I put in as I go through, Mr Acting Deputy President. The New South Wales Crime Commission was given the power on 30 January 1989, and so on. And I notice that the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission got permission to use these powers on 14 July 1998. There is always a legitimate reason for giving powers to authorities, but there is always a danger that the very purpose of the act—that is, to protect our privacy—becomes damaged because of this. If you look at the number of taps that are allowed, they do not seem greatly excessive. But I think it is always wise for somebody to step up on an occasion like this simply to say, `Yes, the Attorney-General has to have this report prepared and it is proper for us to look at it.' It is proper for us to remember that, really, it is about protecting privacy and that, as the growth of these powers increases, it is always timely for somebody to at least mention that the matters put out by the Attorney-General are being taken note of. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-04-11,"—I am not one to ride on the Olympic bandwagon, but September's Olympic Games will see one of the biggest celebrations in this nation for a very long time. The attention of the world will be on Sydney and, more precisely, on Greater Western Sydney. The immediate benefits of a successful bid for the Games are obvious for the region, but what are the medium and long-term impacts for the area? The world will focus its attention on Sydney when the Olympics arrive in September and it is vital for Western Sydney to take advantage of that unprecedented attention to ensure that the region continues long into the future to feel the benefits of hosting the Games. 
Most important of those impacts is the stimulus for economic growth. As one of the main industrial, agricultural and business centres in Australia, the Greater West's economic worth is $35 billion, with over 72,000 businesses and 1.5 million people. Western Sydney has to highlight the attractive investment and business opportunities the region has to offer. One of the region's most important attributes is its well-educated, productive and highly skilled work force. International companies are bringing their business to Sydney to exploit this valuable labour force to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific region. Crucial to this is the fact that 25 per cent of Sydney's work force are from non-English speaking backgrounds. They have valuable language skills and are ideally suited for operating in both Western and Asian business environments. The impact of business confidence and investment in Sydney's Greater West will be shown by the development of new industries. The IT industry is one which will have a major economic impact. According to recent reports, there are 18,000 people currently employed in IT in Western Sydney. The Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board estimates growth in information technology of an expected 300 per cent over the next five years in some parts of the region—Wollondilly, in particular, I understand. 
There have to be strategies in place to make sure that Sydney takes advantage of the international exposure of the Olympics and realises the full economic impact of the Games—and I will touch on just a couple of those. Firstly, there is Investment 2000, an Australian business venture aimed at developing links to business and investment companies within Asia by giving Australia as broad a coverage as possible during the running of the Games. The focus will be on the labour market's strong potential, including our high education levels, skills availability, the Asian language resource and competitive salary levels. Secondly, the Australian Technology Showcase will promote the innovative qualities of New South Wales and Australian emerging technology industries to international executives in business and the media. Finally, the Olympics Business Roundtable has developed a strategy known as `Australia Open for Business' that seeks to ensure that the best features of the economy are on display when the Olympic spotlight focuses here in September.
In relation to jobs growth, industry investment and infrastructure development, the Greater West's economy is expected to grow by an average of $1 billion over the next three years and $1.5 billion over the next six after that. As a result of hosting the Games it is expected that an extra 200,000 jobs will be created by 2003. Many of those will be in the newly developed IT&T industries as well as hospitality and tourism. In fact, the immediate impact of the Olympics is seen most dramatically in the investment in infrastructure development in the Greater West—take the Olympic site itself, for example. It is an incredible feat in engineering and construction. Its on-time completion is a testament to the Australian construction industry—completed, I might note, with minimal industrial action. The Homebush Olympic site is supplemented by the Dunc Gray Velodrome in Bankstown and the Penrith Lakes Olympic rowing course. All three venues create permanent landmarks for future generations to enjoy.
Three million dollars a day was spent on construction of the facilities for the Games, including the construction of the athletes village and a new rail loop built to increase commuter access to the site. A new urban park, twice the size of Centennial Park, has been established. It is part of 440 hectares of recreational parkland that covers the site. There is a public domain area that has the capacity to hold up to half a million people. The athletes village is an important development in the Greater West and will become a new suburb at the completion of the Games and the Paralympic Games. Named Newington, it will be the world's largest solar powered suburb. At a cost of $470 million, it will be completed in 2005. There will be an estimated 5,000 residents in the new suburb when the temporary dwellings have been removed and 2,000 permanent dwellings have been constructed. A primary school and other community facilities will be established out of the Games facilities. A business park development and neighbourhood retail centre will boost services in the surrounding region.
Even the proposed Parramatta rail link is another infrastructure development in the west stimulated by the Olympic economic boom. Costing $1.4 billion, it is expected to be completed by 2006 with an estimated patronage of 18.6 million people. We will obviously also have an increase in the numbers of tourists to the region, with an important flow-on effect for the entire economy of the Greater West. The Tourism Forecasting Council predicts an influx of 8.2 million visitors to our shores over the 21 days of the Games and the Paralympics after that. In the longer term the Games are predicted to attract 1.6 million tourists in the four years after the Olympics, according to the Tourism Forecasting Council. Of these, New South Wales can expect 1.1 million, providing a $4.2 billion windfall for the state's economy, as noted in a report from KPMG Management Consulting and Griffith University on this subject.
A most prevalent and culturally important impact of the Games is the very widespread development of sporting facilities in Western Sydney, giving the Greater West a very strong right to claim to be the sporting capital of the state, if not Australia. The Stadium Australia development was completed at a cost of $690 million and provides the largest outdoor venue in modern Olympic history. At the completion of the Games it will be reconfigured to seat 80,000 people. Even IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch described the Sydney Aquatic Centre as `the best swimming pool I have seen in my life'. That 4,400-seat venue will play host to a wide range of events in the longer term, ranging from World Cup swimming to the local school swimming carnivals. The Olympic velodrome in Bankstown will provide a long-term legacy for the people of Western Sydney. Not only will it attract world and national cycling circuits but the infield can be easily reconfigured to host exhibitions and other cultural events.
The Olympic site construction is based on the principle of the Green Games. Environmentally friendly practices were adopted in the construction of all of the venues and that has had an important impact on Western Sydney with the restoration of wasteland and the establishment of parklands in particular. The major long-term effect of the Green Games on Western Sydney has been the restoration of the Homebush Bay site. It was a disused environmental wasteland, previously the site of an armaments store, a chemical company, a garbage dump and a slaughterhouse. Not surprisingly, over time it became severely degraded land. Waste Services New South Wales was given the responsibility for the removal of contaminants on the site, placing the toxic waste in consolidated pits at Homebush Bay. It also dealt with restoration of the mangrove at Homebush Bay so that waste which does run off the site is filtered out before it hits the water system. That clean-up, that mangrove management, is a major environmental achievement. 
What was a major toxic wasteland and absolute eyesore has been transformed into a sporting and recreational landmark for the nation. In fact, by September 2000 there will be five million shrubs and native grasses planted around the site, including the planting of an additional 200,000 trees—an additional important environmental legacy for Western Sydney. These parklands are a much-needed recreational resource in Sydney's Greater West and the use of green construction techniques and products in the Olympic venues will provide invaluable experience for future developments in the construction industry.
Finally, there are obviously also cultural questions attached to the staging of the Olympics and the Paralympics and, most particularly, the question of art. Twelve innovative public art projects have been commissioned for display at the Olympics. At a cost of $7.5 million, they will be on display at Homebush and in other areas of Western Sydney. Homebush Bay itself will feature nine public art projects. Some of these will be free standing and others will be worked into the surrounding environment. They will provide a creative and interesting landmark that will be appreciated by both the people of the Greater West and the visitors to the area. 
The Olympics obviously provide an extraordinary opportunity for the people of the Greater West of Sydney to showcase all the exciting prospects that we have to offer. The long-term impacts of hosting the Games are both exciting and enormously beneficial. There are trade and business opportunities for Western Sydney. They will provide jobs growth and investment into the long term. The more medium term tourism impacts of the Olympics and the Paralympics will also assist in economic growth. The environmental impacts of the Games, such as the new parklands, are significant and advantageous for the people of Sydney and beyond. Finally, we have the record of the great sporting and cultural legacies which will be enjoyed by all Australians but most particularly by the Greater West long into the future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Greater Western Sydney: Impact of Olympic Games</title>,Adjournment,19,1
