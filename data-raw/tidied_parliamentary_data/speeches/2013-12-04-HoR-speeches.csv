Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (09:01):  Congratulations, Madam Speaker, on your elevation to high office. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 continues the great tradition of the bipartisanship of this parliament in helping to develop an outstanding offshore oil and gas regulatory environment. It is an environment that, in every aspect of that word, is delicate and important for our nation, ensuring that in the offshore environment we have the ability to explore for mineral wealth and have the capacity to put in place the best possible industrial arrangements for the extraction of that mineral wealth, and then ensuring also that Australians benefit for generations to come.


In our offshore regulatory environment, not only do we do the best that we can to ensure best possible practice but, I believe, we do the best in the world. That offshore practice of course relates to how we manage property rights. It also relates to how we best ensure the best benefit for our nation from the subsurface wealth of our nation. But it must be done safely. The offshore environment is a dangerous environment. In the course of the last year or so, we have seen deaths occur in the offshore environment that were properly investigated. We have seen the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons at Montara and the explosions at Varanus Island. The deaths of the two employees on the Stena Clyde through to the explosions at Varanus and the uncontrolled release on Montara serve to demonstrate for us the great risk and danger in the offshore environment.


But what it also shows us is our great technical capability of being able to find and extract hydrocarbons—and do it well. These events underlie the need for a strong, effective and properly resourced offshore petroleum regulatory regime that does safeguard human health, safety and the marine environment. What they also show is the need for an offshore regulatory regime that allows industry to operate with great certainty and understanding.


It is the view of the Labor Party that the offshore regulatory environment is the best first opportunity for us to establish the idea of what the government has come to characterise as the 'one-stop shop'. We believe that the great capability that resides in our offshore regulators to carry out their work in a safe way is also the capability that allows those very same regulators to be accredited to carry out environmental work too, so we expect the first rapid progress in this area following decisions made by the former government in April and May this year.


Petroleum exploration in Australian waters is to be encouraged. It is to be encouraged not simply because of the great wealth that Australia has in the offshore environment; it is to be encouraged because the clean energy that is generated from our offshore hydrocarbons resource powers not just our nation but also the growing economies to our north. Just 20 years ago Australia produced less than 15 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year. By 2020 Australia will produce in excess of 100 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year. Liquefied natural gas is, in every way, the fuel of the future. Liquefied natural gas is also the fuel that is predominantly reliant upon this offshore regulatory environment—notwithstanding the rapid growth of the natural gas from coal-seam and shale developments onshore.


But that petroleum exploration environment in Australian waters extends from the hostile waters of the southern ocean, where BP and the Norwegian company Statoil will once again begin an exploration program through the Great Australian Bight—sensitively, carefully and scientifically considering the subsurface environment to see whether or not there is a large hydrocarbon field to the south of Australia. As we all understand the value to our nation over the past 40 years of the development of the Bass Strait fields, and of the great future that lies ahead for our nation as a consequence of the development of the gas fields off the northern coast of Western Australia, we now also turn our attention to where two of the world's great hydrocarbon companies, BP and Statoil, are looking for hydrocarbons in the most delicate marine environment off our southern coast.


I am a great optimist that that work can be done well; I am a great optimist that, despite the ferocious and torrid environment in which that exploration will take place, it will be done well; and I am a great believer that the growth of the hydrocarbon industry, in all of its forms in our offshore environment, is supported by the most carefully considered regulatory environment which we can put together and which also has sufficient intelligence and flexibility to allow us to openly consider hydrocarbons exploration in the most delicate marine environment.


The stable and internationally competitive offshore investment regime is important. Each year, the Commonwealth engages with stakeholders and releases offshore petroleum exploration acreage for competitive bidding by prospective explorers. Our offshore lease arrangements are made available for exploration in a number of ways. We first allow for competitive bids for work programs. Company A will bid that it will drill a certain number of wells and carry out a certain amount of seismic work and a certain amount of scientific analysis of data to give the best opportunity to find hydrocarbons.


But what we are also doing in these bills is taking the first steps back to a system of cash bidding for acreage. It is the case that, when companies bid for acreage for exploration on the basis of work programs—the drilling and the seismic work—those programs bring with them costs that are measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. That will certainly be the case, for instance, in the Southern Ocean in the Great Australian Bight. But in some areas where the subsurface is better understood it makes more sense to more to a cash bidding environment because of ease and transparency and also because it creates a better return for the Australian people. These bills create that environment once again. We did have for a short time in the 1980s and early 1990s a cash bidding environment. That was introduced in 1985 by a Labor government and then removed in 1992 by a Labor government, so we have looked at the cash bidding environment before and we believe that the particular model that is being proposed by the government is a good model and a model that deserves the support of this House.


The amendments in this legislation introduce a range of tools to achieve more efficient allocations of petroleum exploration permits. As I said, currently permits are awarded on the basis of clearly understood work programs and biding that allocates exploration acreage on the basis of the applicant that proposes the most amount of work or the greatest value of work to explore the petroleum potential of a particular release area. Companies making cash bids must have their technical and financial competence carefully assessed. It is the case that we have been blessed in our nation that the companies that have carried out work in our waters have been good companies. We should not deny the reality of the uncontrolled release at Montara. But we should also accept that, in that case, the response of industry and of government at state and territory and Commonwealth levels was rapid, ensuring firstly the protection of human life and secondly the protection of the environment. All of our studies and considerations since that event in 2009 at Montara have shown that the rapid response of all involved ensured that the Montara event was controlled as quickly as it could have been and that the impact on the environment was minimal.


The system of lease management that we have in Australia is close to world's best practice. We have a lease management system that works in three ways: an exploration lease, which is available for the exploration of the ocean bed for hydrocarbons; a retention lease process, which allows a company which, having made a discovery, can consider the best and most viable economic options for the development of a resource; and then of course, having done that, to move to a production licence.


The retention lease process is very important in the stability and certainty that is provided to explorers. Under the retention lease process, a company which has found or acquired hydrocarbons can then hold that lease and properly consider viable options for the development of the resource. This becomes most pertinent and relevant in the Australian context in the case of the Browse Basin and Commonwealth leases which were renewed just a few months ago. The renewal of those leases was purposely done in order to allow the joint-venture partners in the Browse Basin the best and broadest range of options to develop that resource. The Browse oil and gas fields remain extremely important to the economic future of our nation. They remain vital to the economic development of Western Australia and they are, in every sense, critical to the economic development of the Kimberley coast.


The new retention lease arrangements that have been provided for in the context of Browse allow for development options different to the previous retention lease, which had explicitly stated that the development of the Browse oil and gas fields had to be onshore at James Price Point. It is unfortunate, but a commercial reality, that the operator and the joint venturer have concluded that they do not see a viable economic future in the development of the James Price Point site and in the development onshore of the Browse gas resource. So at this stage the joint venture is taking advantage of the property rights that are recognised in retention leases, and the options and the flexibilities that are inherent in retention leases, to develop the idea of floating LNG production technology in the case of the Browse Basin. This is a good thing for our nation. It is a terrific thing for Western Australia and it will underwrite careers and jobs—a whole industry—in offshore hydrocarbon production for our country.


Let me explain how that will work. It will work because it may well be that, on the Browse Basin, we will see one, two or even three floating facilities. These facilities will be 400 or 500 metres long. They will be 100 metres wide. They will be the world's largest man-made floating structures. They will carry on board all of the industrial capability, all of the safety capability, that currently exists in onshore gas liquefaction technology. And it will be done with a smaller carbon footprint. It will be done in a way that means we do not have to pipe gas 400 kilometres to shore and then pipe CO2400 kilometres back out to sea for potential sequestration. It will be done in situ with the smallest possible environmental footprint. It will also be done in a way that creates capital efficiency in the LNG industry of the sort that we have not yet seen in Australia. Why is that important? It is important because we are seeing cost escalation in this most important fuel source as a consequence of the capital cost blowing out at the construction phase of our LNG plants.


The best way to address that productivity challenge is to bring in the next step-change in technology. That step-change in technology is facilitated by our retention lease system. That step-change in technology is supported by the property rights that are protected by our retention leases. That step-change in technology is what will see Australian LNG entering into north Asian markets, and continuing to dominate in north Asian markets, where currently those markets are under stress from potential gas suppliers out of East Africa and maybe even pipeline gas out of Russia. These commercial threats are important and should be understood by all people with an interest in our resources industry. If we do not keep our resources industries, which are our principal export industries, as sharp and as efficient as they can be, future generations will pay the price.


In the offshore environment our taxation structure is modern, our retention-lease management system is modern and the bill we are dealing with today will modernise how exploration takes place. All of this puts the offshore oil and gas industry of Australia in an absolutely terrific position.


In 2012, the former government announced that it would reintroduce cash bidding for selected offshore petroleum permits. Cash bidding had previously been used in Australia between 1985 and 1992. On being introduced in 1985, cash bidding was one of a range of measures introduced by the then Hawke government in order to better configure the hydrocarbons industry for the great future that all of us in this place at that time agreed that it had. Cash bidding is currently used successfully in the Gulf of Mexico, one of the world's premier hydrocarbon provinces, and it has recently been introduced in the onshore coal tenement titles management systems in Queensland.


Last year, the former government decided that cash bidding would be used from 2014 onwards to allocate offshore petroleum acreage in mature areas and in areas containing known petroleum accumulations. This is important, because we are not saying to exploration companies that you must cash bid in an environment where there is no understanding of subsurface structures. What we are saying is that there will be cash bidding in environments where companies can understand the probabilities of different kinds of discoveries. Those probabilities, and whether the target is oil or gas, whether the gas is wet gas or dry gas and whether the gas contains a higher or lower CO2 component, all become factors that companies can take into account when they make their cash bids. It is a great way of optimising for the Australian community a property right that hereto has been dealt with on the basis of the cost of carrying out further exploration drilling and further seismic work.


It should be said in this context that the great value to our nation of Geoscience Australia and its ability to capture, store, make available and interpret geological data to the great advantage of our nation cannot be underestimated. There are currently very large oil and gas fields that were discovered on the basis of the data which had been held at Geoscience Australia. Off the coast of northern Australia at Ichthys a very large oil and gas field is currently being developed and export gas will be converted through Darwin, but the discovery was made largely on the basis of the geological data which was freely available to the explorers through Geoscience Australia.


So you see in this context that the recognition of property rights through cash bidding and the retention lease management system, the intelligent interoperation of data management, world's best practice in oil and gas field management, a safe environment for workers to operate in, and a safe environment for work to be carried out in hydrocarbons in environmentally sensitive waters allow our nation to tap mineral wealth that has the capacity to supply energy to our world for thousands of years.


I read a paper last night that speculated on the potential size of Australia's current gas resources. Those potential supplies of Australia's current gas resources run to well over 1,000 trillion cubic feet of gas. Currently we export or consume around one trillion cubic feet of gas per year. We have the capacity through our in situ oil and gas resources to supply the world with hydrocarbons for in excess of 15,000 years at current rates of extraction. That allows us as a nation the great comfort of putting in place the best possible management regime to ensure environmental standards, human safety standards and a return to the Australian people for generations to come. It is one of the great realities of our nation that our export markets, which are increasingly driven by our ability to be a world-leading resources economy, are underpinned by the world-leading position that we can take in hydrocarbons technologies. That is why the completely virtuous cycle exists in how we manage exploration, how we allow companies to retain the commercial opportunity that they have discovered until they can turn it into a realisable and profitable business and then how, when that business is operating, the taxpayers of Australia now and for generations to come receive a benefit from the extraction of those hydrocarbons resources.


And we do it in a way that is both safe and efficient. We do it in a way that, frankly, should make us all proud. We do it in a way that will generate in future years hundreds of thousands of jobs. I have mentioned floating LNG. Those jobs will be of the highest possible technical calibre. The men and women who will work in the control rooms of those LNG vessels are probably still in high school. We will develop a generation of operators who will be able to dominate the global marketplace for capability and technical excellence operating in the marine hydrocarbons production environment, in an industry where only Australia currently has a foothold.


But what we must do with that industry and that technology is turn that current foothold, represented by the prelude development of Royal Dutch Shell off the northern coast of Western Australia, into a footprint that will: place Australia for generations to come in the leadership role in these technologies; give us the capacity to manage large volumes of hydrocarbons; allow us to manufacture at sea for markets that need the hydrocarbons at the most competitive price; and enable us to compete for capital in very tight capital markets with technical propositions that are right sized, secure, good business models for future investment.


Bringing all of those elements together—as these bills do—and so providing for a good, market-driven exploration system, a market-driven retention lease management system and then a pure market-driven minerals exploration system, is the way for our nation to best optimise the chances available to us in the global marketplace. It is that global marketplace, if we can win in it—and we will win in it through our technical excellence—that will underpin our living standards, the capacity of our governments to build schools, roads and hospitals and the ability of our nation to continue to be great. I commend these bills to the House. They are terrific steps in helping to modernise our retention lease, exploration lease and lease management systems in the best possible way.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House, Minister for Education) (09:57):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The key to Australia's competitiveness in providing world-leading education services to overseas students will rest on how well we promote our institutions and enhance both their quality and the experience of students who come to our shores. We must also act decisively to minimise the constraints of unnecessary regulatory burden on education providers to support a vibrant international education system into the future. The successful and efficient operation of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, or ESOS, and its associated legislative framework is an important element in enhancing international education in Australia.


Australia's reputation for quality in international education is built on the excellence of our universities, higher education institutions, schools and technical colleges, both public and private. ESOS supports the integrity of our student visa system, which is fundamental to our international education provision. It gives students who come here the assurance that their rights as consumers are respected and their needs in adjusting to life in Australia are met. It ensures they are supported to pursue an outstanding educational experience here. We warmly welcome international students, and this government will do everything we can to encourage them to choose Australia first when they are considering an international education.


There are currently around 1,000 providers of international education in Australia, from large universities and TAFEs to small private colleges and English language providers, as well as public and private schools. Under the Labor government, there was an alarming decline in income earned by Australian international education from its peak in 2009-10. This government is acting decisively and quickly to ensure a much more prosperous future for international education. 



This is why the government will respond positively to the advice of the International Education Advisory Council in its report, Australia: Educating Globally, widely known as the Chaney report, and release a draft national strategy for international education for consultation in early 2014.


In delivering on our support for international education this government has announced an approach that will encourage growth in international student numbers by allowing flexibility in Australia's approach to allocating student visas. 


The previous government limited access to streamlined visa processing to universities only, when it was introduced in late March 2012. No other higher education providers were offered access to streamlined visa processing. This government is rectifying what we consider to be a serious impediment to the growth of international education in Australia. 


On 29 October 2013, the government announced that it would extend the offer of streamlined visa processing arrangements to 22 degree-awarding non-university providers of higher education that present a low immigration risk. The government also announced the simplification of the Assessment Level Framework. Education providers who are not being offered the opportunity to participate in streamlined visa processing arrangements at this time will benefit from these significant improvements to the Assessment Level Framework.


The reforms to streamlined visa processing and the Assessment Level Framework, and the work we commence here today with the ESOS Amendment Bill, are the kinds of reforms we need to strengthen our international education system. They are integral to our plan for safeguarding and enhancing Australia's status as a world-leading provider of education services.


The ESOS Amendment Bill I introduce today will begin the essential adjustment to the regulatory settings for international education to align and simplify our current legislative framework. The amendments are necessary because of unintended consequences arising from the implementation of amendments to the ESOS Act in early 2012 under the previous government. The amendments today will increase certainty and fairness for our overseas students and are an important change to ensure the current legislative framework operates effectively. 


The amendments to the ESOS Act to be made by this bill will ensure that the refunds registered providers are required to make to their overseas students are appropriate. That is, the amendments ensure refunds encompass tuition fees paid by students both before and after the commencement of their period of study where those fees are unspent at the time a default occurs. 


These important clarifications to a core function of the ESOS Act are to be delivered through an amendment to the use of the term 'pre-paid' fees, which will be replaced with 'tuition' fees in division 2 of part 3 of the ESOS Act. This is consistent with the original intention of the amendments to the ESOS Act in 2012. Importantly, these changes are technical in nature and do not place new or extra requirements on providers. Rather, the requirements on providers and protections for students are being clarified and simplified and will benefit both. 


In addition the bill will clarify the situation relating to refunds in cases of student defaults caused by a visa refusal. This can be a complex area for providers to navigate, where often several pieces of legislation apply, and it can be difficult for overseas students too. This bill will give the minister the power to make a legislative instrument under the ESOS Act that will stipulate how a refund to a student is to be made in instances of student default for visa refusal and also in cases of student default where there is no written agreement in place between the provider and the student. This legislative instrument is intended to take effect at the time these provisions take effect. 


The bill will also amend the 'National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007' to remove reference to 'Registration Authorities'. Requirements previously imposed on registration authorities by the national code are now contained in the ESOS Act. The removal of the reference to registration authorities will ensure that the title of the national code properly reflects its content. This minor amendment precedes a more substantial review of the national code overall. The Department of Education will be consulting in the coming months with key stakeholders on ways in which the national code can be improved in the context of the government's deregulation policy, specifically its review of higher education regulation.


This bill is the first legislative step the government is taking to build a new architecture for international education so that the industry can grow and achieve its enormous potential. The government will continue to introduce more reforms to improve the competitiveness, sustainability and quality of Australia's education system into the future. 


I commend the bill to the House.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:46):  It is a matter of enormous concern that the Australian government has recently, without notice to the Australian community, changed our country's voting position in the UN General Assembly on resolutions relating to the illegality under international law of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the applicability of the Geneva conventions.


Israel does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits such population transfers by occupying powers, applies to the Palestinian territory it occupies. However, this view is overwhelmingly contradicted by the international community, including the International Court of Justice, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly and the high contracting parties to the Geneva conventions. Even Israel's closest ally, the United States, regards the settlements as illegitimate, while closer to home some of our near neighbours, including Indonesia and Malaysia, see the settlements as a great injustice.


I speak on behalf of many concerned Australian citizens in calling upon the government, when this matter comes again before the UN General Assembly next week, to respect the international rule of law and the government's own professed support for a two-state solution—a solution that is undermined and rendered increasingly unlikely by continued illegal Israeli settlement building on Palestinian land. At a time when Australia has a seat on the UN Security Council and the presidency of the G20, it behoves us to respect and promote international law and human rights.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:10):  It appears there has been something of a competition going on in the cabinet this week: who can conduct the biggest backflip? Who can create the biggest gap between pre-election rhetoric and post-election reality? It has been quite a competition. You would think, wouldn't you, Madam Speaker, that the Minister for Education had it all sewn up with his clear cast-iron commitments before the election and his backflip of this week—the Pyne gap of difference between his pre-election promise and his post-election reality. But the Treasurer is a competitive man. He is not going to be bullied out of the prize of the biggest backflip from pre-election rhetoric to post-election reality. This is a Treasurer who railed against debt before the election, who voted against increases in the debt cap, despite their denials in this place and the other place, and who told the Australian people that one of their three great priorities was to pay back the debt. What he did not tell the Australian people is that, to pay back the debt, he is going to increase it first.


Did the people of Australia, when they voted on 7 September, really think they were voting for a Liberal government that would go into an alliance with the Greens to abolish the debt cap? Is that what they thought they were getting on 7 September? We saw the Treasurer with equal measures of chutzpah and hypocrisy say, casually, that he was going to increase the debt cap by 67 per cent, a $200 billion increase. That was bad enough. That came as a great shock to Liberal voters across the country who voted for a party that said they would pay back the debt. But they are going even further; they are voting with the Greens to abolish the debt cap. The Minister for Immigration very helpfully showed us yesterday who the leader of the Greens is. Here is a picture of the Leader of the Greens, whom the Treasurer is doing a deal with to abolish the debt cap in Australia. Is that what Liberal supporters voted for on 7 September? Is that what the Australian people voted for on 7 September?


We hear a lot of rhetoric from the government about debt. Let us see what they said when they were in opposition. We have heard a lot from the Prime Minister. There is a lot to choose from, but my favourite one is when Tony Abbott, the then Leader of the Opposition, said on 2UE on 13 May 2011:


A Government which is supposedly getting debt and deficit under control is not a Government that suddenly wants to borrow an extra $50 billion. It’s like saying to your bank manager ‘look mate I’ve got my spending under control, oh but at the same time can you extend my credit card limit’. I mean, really.


Indeed! This man is now the Prime Minister. He says he is paying off the debt. But he does not want an increase in the credit card limit; he has gone to his bank manager and asked, 'Why do I need a limit at all? Please get rid of my limit.' That is the Prime Minister of Australia!


Here is another doozy, from the man who is now Treasurer. He was talking about debt limits—in this House, at this dispatch box—and pointing out that the previous government had had to increase the debt limit. He had a startling revelation to make about who was voting with the government to increase the debt limit. He pointed out that the debt limit needed to be increased. He pointed out—breathlessly, I am sure, beating his chest:


They were supported by their mates, the Independents, and the Greens. The Greens would have a trillion dollars if they could.


That is what the member for North Sydney said: 'The Greens would actually have no debt limit if they could, and the government is going to give it to them!' This party that is against debt—the Liberals—is going to give the Greens a no-debt-limit budget. This is a stark example of the Liberal Party and the National Party saying one thing before the election and doing the exact opposite after the election. 


The Treasurer had a course of action available to him. In fact, he had two potential courses of action available to him. He could have released the mid-year economic forecast. He says it is coming in the coming days. He could have released it before the parliament voted, because the Labor Party said: 'We're not going to do what you did and vote against the debt cap increases. We're going to move an amendment to say $400 billion is justified by the figures on the public record. If you want more than that, issue MYEFO.' 


But, of course, the Treasurer did not want to do that. We could not have that! It would mean the impact of his decisions would be there for all to see: the impact of his $8.8 billion transfer to the Reserve Bank, which has increased our debt cost by $1 billion over the next four years; the impact of his decision to give a tax break to people with more than $2 million in their superannuation accounts; and the impact of his decision to water down Labor's measures to improve the integrity of the tax system. He would not want to do that. He certainly did not want to say, 'All right, what we'll do is  increase the debt cap to $400 billion, which is justified by the mid-year economic statement, and when we want more, when we've released our mid-year economic forecast, we'll come back to the parliament.' He did not want to do that, because he does not want to be held responsible for the impact of his own decisions. He does not want to be held responsible for the decisions he has made. 


He wants to increase the debt cap now as part of his cunning plan. He has been going around opening cupboards, he says, and finding spiders. Well, he found a cupboard with a AAA credit rating in it. He found a cupboard where the budget situation had been outlined clearly in the pre-election economic forecast, and he does not want to come clean with the Australian people about the impact of decisions he has taken since the election. So the Treasurer had a choice. He could have done the sensible thing and released MYEFO. He could have done the sensible thing and accepted a $400 billion debt cap, a $100 billion increase—not a small amount of money—that the Labor Party was offering in a spirit of mature negotiation. Oh no, that was not good enough for the Treasurer. First, he stamped his feet and held his breath and said, 'I want half a trillion or nothing.' But to either of those two options, he has gone to chat with the Greens about abolishing the debt cap, about getting rid of any credit card limit at all.


I think the Australian people would be surprised to see the Treasurer 's actions compared to his rhetoric pre-election. When I see the Treasurer, I think about all that rhetoric we heard before the election. We have heard it from the Prime Minister and we have heard it from the Treasurer. We see this pre-election rhetoric completely unmatched by their actions post-election. The Australian people are entitled to be more than disappointed; they are entitled to be angry. They are entitled to be angry with a Treasurer who said, 'If debt is the problem, more debt is not the answer.' They are entitled to be angry with a Treasurer who said, 'It's only the coalition that is going to pay back the debt.' They are entitled to be angry with a Treasurer who said so obviously, 'The age of entitlement is coming to an end because governments are running out of money and debt is now crippling governments.' This is a Treasurer who now wants to abolish the debt cap in coalition with the Greens, whom they railed against before the election, whom they railed against in this House and in the other place and whom they railed against in the media. They told the Australian people that they could never be in a government with the Greens. But here they are entering into a coalition with the Greens to abolish the debt cap. Who would have thought it?


Have we ever before seen a Treasurer, within such a short period of time—and this is the third sitting week of the new government—being such a diminished figure? He has been bullied and shown up by the Minister for Agriculture. He is not being tough enough, not showing guts enough, to stand up for growth and investment against the antigrowth faction in his own government, the agrarian socialist Barnaby Joyce. The Treasurer comes in here and beats his chest and then sits in his office and cowers: 'Oh, I couldn't sign that foreign investment. Barnaby might resign. I couldn't do that. The Deputy Prime Minister might be beastly to me. The Deputy Prime Minister might get cranky with me. So I'm not going to stand up for growth. I'm not going to go out and argue to the Australian people that investment and jobs are good. No, I'm going to cower in my office. But I can't think of an excuse! What excuse can I come up with? Oh, vetoing GrainCorp! I know what I'll do, I'll say we need more foreign investment in Australia, so I'm going to knock this one back. That's how we are going to get more foreign investment, by knocking them back.'


With this Treasurer and this Prime Minister, never has there been such a clear case of big promises and small delivery. They were, as their promises were then, once mighty. They are now, as their performance is, nothing.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:20):  It is truly unique to come into this chamber and hear the Labor Party complaining about the level of debt. Talk about a reformist party! I found it fascinating when, a couple of hours ago, as I was flicking through the TV channels, I watched the Treasurer outline the poor state of the nation's economy and of the national accounts as a consequence of what was left behind by the Australian Labor Party. At the conclusion of that press conference, I flicked the channel and I happened to see the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, at the National Press Club. What was extraordinary about his performance was one particular line that really caught my interest. He said, 'Labor needs to be in office for a long time to cement our reforms.' He is nodding in furious agreement. They just needed a little bit more time!


This is the Australian Labor Party who inherited $60 billion of assets six years ago, presided over the five largest budget deficits in our nation's history and who, as a consequence of their policies, saw the most rapid deterioration of debt in our nation's history. Then they come into the chamber and say: 'Oh no, you should trust us on debt. We know the best way forward. Don't trust the coalition on debt.' Look at the track record. It was only the coalition that paid off $96 billion worth of debt last time. Why would you trust us? The Labor Party are the people you should trust, according to the member for McMahon. After all, the Labor Party took $60 billion and turned it into over $400 billion worth of debt!


What is also extraordinary is that the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, likes to say repeatedly—and he did just moments ago—how the coalition could have had the $500 billion debt ceiling, if only the coalition had been willing to release MYEFO, as if in some way insinuating that, once again, the coalition could not be trusted. What is fascinating about that is that this is on Labor's own numbers, not coalition numbers. Do not rely on the figures that we put forward if you do not want to. I say to the Australian Labor Party: use your own numbers. Let me educate the shadow Assistant Treasurer as to which numbers. I am talking about the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook forecasts that made it clear that you were going to reach $370 billion worth of debt. And let us not forget the tabled minute from the Australian Office of Financial Management which said that you need a $40 billion to $60 billion buffer. Let me make this easier. I wish I had a big calculator, but I will add it up: $370 billion plus $60 billion is—



Government members interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  It is $430 billion! It had to come from this side though, not from the other side. There you have it. On Labor's own numbers, there is $430 billion worth of debt. And yet the Labor Party say, 'We don't understand why you need to have more than $400 billion.' Well, it is because, on your own numbers, it will be $430 billion. The most concerning aspect of this is that the Australian Labor Party is willing to play havoc with Australia's international reputation. The Australian Labor Party is willing to put Australia's national interest behind political expediency and political opportunism. That is entirely consistent with the approach of the shadow Treasurer and members opposite, because of this key reason: when it comes to making decisions in the national interest, the Labor Party knows full well that we are within a week or so of breaching Australia's current debt ceiling of $300 billion.


So what is Labor's approach? Do they take a mature approach and say, 'Let's look at what needs to be done. We know that it has got to be $430 billion as the peak debt limit that is anticipated on Labor's own numbers'? No, they do not. They say, 'We'll give you $400 billion and then we'll go back to it in due course.' A similar approach was used by the Tea Party in the United States. So we know who they are getting their riding instructions from when it comes to political process; we know the approach the Labor Party likes to take when it comes to trying to work out what they need to do in terms of running this debate. But I have got news for you, Labor Party: that is not how we intend to govern. That is not the approach of the coalition and it is not the way in which we intend to conduct Australia's economic policy. Our focus is on providing economic certainty, and the way we send certainty and security to the financial markets is to make it clear to them that we will deal with an issue comprehensively and we will deal with it once and for all.


It stands in stark contrast to Labor's approach of, 'Let's just kick the can down the road a little bit further. Four hundred billion dollars? What does it matter? Let's just worry about it when we have to come back to it in six or 12 months time.' That is what Labor have said should be the approach. That is not our approach. Our approach is to say that we need the debt ceiling to be at $500 billion. Understandably, Labor again gets confused because they think 'debt ceiling' actually means 'debt target'. Labor thinks that if there is a $500 billion debt ceiling then that means debt is going to $500 billion. Well, I have news for the Australian Labor Party: debt is not going to $500 billion. That is the ceiling, that is the maximum, that is the amount that we do not want to reach, and it stands in stark contrast to Labor's approach. I say to the shadow Treasurer, shadow Assistant Treasurer and shadow Parliamentary Secretary that what they need to realise is that the coalition deal with the issue once and we deal with the issue finally.


The other quite interesting approach Labor have been taking as part of their literal interpretation of the term 'opposition' is that they have decided being in opposition means they must oppose absolutely everything. You can almost see them sitting around the table saying, 'What are some other fascinating opportunities that we can come up with to differentiate ourselves from the government?' 'I know,' the shadow Treasurer would have said, 'let's oppose them on some savings measures to show what a compassionate group the Australian Labor Party is and how rough and tough the coalition is. Let's oppose them on some of these mean, nasty savings measures that the coalition has come up with.' You can almost see them; they would all be nodding in furious agreement. 'And why not start with $2.3 billion of savings in the education sector?' The only problem with that is that they were Labor's savings. They were the savings that the Australian Labor Party came up with. So, when they literally interpret the term 'opposition', what they are actually doing is opposing their own announced savings measures.


The shadow Treasurer stands up and talks about hypocrisy. I have news for you, shadow Treasurer: the greatest and most glaring example of hypocrisy in the parliament today is the fact that you are willing to stand up and oppose your own savings measures. $2.3 billion worth of savings measures were announced by the Australia Labor Party, and now Labor says, 'No, we are opposed to them. We don't support them.' In addition to that, there are some $13.4 billion of savings measures that this government is trying to take to reduce the mountain load of debt that has been left behind by the Australian Labor Party—debt that we know is going to continue to accrue interest, debt that is currently running at $10 billion a year in interest repayments. That is $10 billion that could have been spent on, for example, new schools, new hospitals or new road projects—a whole raft of different approaches—but Labor says, 'No, we are opposed to those savings measures as well.'


The Labor Party want to have their cake and eat it too. They say, 'We want to make sure the debt stays lower,' yet they stand opposed to some $15 billion of savings measures. How does the Labor Party compute that? They oppose $15 billion worth of savings measures, yet claim to be concerned about keeping debt lower!


The simple, inescapable reality of this entire debate around Australia's debt ceiling is this: if you, Labor, were willing to stand up and do the right thing, to put Australia's national economic interests first, to put certainty and stability in the marketplace ahead of your own short-term political opportunism, you know that, based on the figures I outlined before, Labor Party figures, the best thing to do would be to increase Australia's debt ceiling to the $500 billion that was called for by the coalition—not to stand in the way with some silly game of $400 billion claims but to do the right thing by the Australian people and make a decision that, ultimately, is going to make a profound difference by ensuring that we can provide the certainty and stability that this nation so sorely needs after six years of mismanagement and debt-ridden rule by the Australian Labor Party.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (15:30):  Madam Speaker, you probably missed it, but I was looking at the backbench over there and I want to commend the member for Moncrieff for the first verbal administration of Mogadon! Look how excited these people are to hear about the government's position and what they want to do on debt! It was a masterful performance! They just keep giving. The other side is a gift that keeps on giving. Remember these great quotes? 'We will be a government of no surprises.' That is what they said—'no surprises'. They say one thing before the election and another thing afterwards.


We had the member for North Sydney over in London, getting his pics standing with Big Ben, talking about the age of entitlement being over. He shakes off the jet lag when he comes back and, then, what does he do? He supports the biggest, newest entitlement scheme, their paid parental leave scheme, handing over three times the amount that pensioners in the electorate I represent get in their pension, giving it to some of the wealthiest people around. That is their paid parental leave scheme. It is one thing before the election and another thing after it. Then he says, 'We won't we bullied on foreign investment.' Remember that one? 'We will not be bullied on foreign investment.' And then he has a face-off with Barnaby, with the member—I've forgotten where he is, he has moved around so often. Which seat is he in now? 




Mr McCormack:
  New England—and you had better remember!




Mr HUSIC:
  New England, okay. So he has a face-off with the member for New England, he blinks and then, suddenly, GrainCorp is approved. What is the new dictum, Member for Riverina? Is it 'Barnaby will decide on the FRB decisions I can't make and on the foreigners who can invest here'? It's Barnaby's way! It's Barnaby's way in terms of investment.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Chifley will refer to members by their seat or their title.




Mr HUSIC:
  Yes, well, you know the member for New England very well, having chased him off yourself, Deputy Speaker Scott!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, no. The member for Chifley will refer to members by their correct titles.




Mr HUSIC:
  I think that is a very good point. What else do we have? 'We are a government of no surprises.' The Treasurer says, 'We need to have a conversation about Qantas,' so they say to the Treasurer, 'Okay, over to you. What are we talking about?' 'I don't know. You want to talk about it.' 'No, you started the conversation on Qantas.' And then he does not say anything about what he wants to do. Here is the other one. The Treasurer said before the election:


… if debt is the problem, more debt is not the answer.


That is what he said.




Dr Chalmers:
  That's ringing a bell.




Mr HUSIC:
  Ringing a bell, indeed. Thank you, Member for Rankin. And what does the Treasurer propose? An increase from $300 billion to $500 billion, a 67 per cent lift in debt—67 per cent. Weak on entitlement, weak on foreign investment, weak on following through on reform, weak on the issue of debt: thank God he has starch in his shirts, because I do not think he has a spine holding him up! He cannot make a decision, he cannot follow through, on the thought bubble that starts the day and ends on—what? Nothing. He cannot even come through on it.


What we said was quite simple. We said to the government, 'If you want to increase the debt limit, then we'll certainly back the increase to $400 billion, and then you come back and actually fill in the detail if you want to go higher,' which is not unreasonable. Apparently, they will not release the incoming Treasurer's brief. But all we said was, 'Release the MYEFO,' and they will not even do that. And what is their answer on cutting debt? They hand over $9 billion to the RBA, just—bang—like that. They are talking about increasing the debt limit and then they hand over $9 billion to the RBA as a gift. It is no wonder; they are waiting for the dividend stream down the track. That is really why they have done it. Load up the budget deficit now. If they are worried about debt, why are they turning their backs on revenue measures that could have given them $3 billion? They gave a tax cut to the 16,000 wealthiest people in the country. They are worried about debt, and their answer is to come back and suddenly say they need to increase the debt limit. And, when we do not give it to them, what they do? When we will not support them just increasing the limit, what do they do? They go to the economic fringe dwellers, the people that they derided previously, the ones that they hate and they love and they hate and they love. They cannot work out—

But let us start with the federal member for McMahon, whose matter of public importance this is today.

Speaker, because of our deep commitment to jobs and growth we have taken the responsible course to delay the return to surplus, and due to a savage hit to tax receipts there will be a deficit of $18 billion in 2013-14.


It just kept going on and on, because while there might have been $18 billion earlier this year, it then became more and more and we ended up inheriting $370 billion worth of debt. That is why today we have to increase the debt ceiling—not because we want to, not because the Australian people want us to but because of the abject failure of people on that side. The member for McMahon was responsible in part. I will not say he was entirely responsible, because he got the job of Treasurer only when there was so much backstabbing on the Labor side that he ended up with the job. Nobody else wanted it. Having failed with the boats policy, they gave him a job as Treasurer and said: 'You couldn't do a worse job than the member for Lilley. You've done such a bad job with boats. Try this portfolio,' and he mucked that up, too.


The government is getting on with the business of dealing with the legacy of debt we inherited from Labor. Labor knew that the debt limit would need to be increased again but did not have the courage. Just like the member for McMahon did not have the courage with GrainCorp, they did not have the courage to do so in the lead-up to the election. The member for Lilley said on 3AW on 15 May, when he was still Treasurer, that 'Increasing the debt limit will be a matter for them.' Who was he referring to? He was referring to us, of course. He had already waved the white flag. After the election, Labor squibbed it and focused on what seemed to be their core business. What was the core business of Labor, do you think, in the last parliament? Fighting among themselves, executing prime ministers, squabbling over the scraps of who might be sitting on the front bench. Meanwhile, Australia was going down the gurgler. Meanwhile, our debt was going up and up. Uncertainty for families and for businesses mattered not to Labor. All they were interested in was just seeing who was going to knife whom.


Why is this such a big debt? We can refer to the Little Book of Big Labor Waste. We had immigration, the boats plan, with a $1.2 billion blow-out. I see the member for McMahon looking across wondering what document this is. I will table it, if you like. Building the Education Revolution, $8 billion wasted; political advertising, $100 million; national broadband blow-outs—who knows how much that is going to cost? Computers in school blew out by a massive $1.4 billion; green loans were eventually dumped after three independent reports found extensive mismanagement; the solar homes program, an $850 million blow-out; $54.25 million dollars was wasted on operational expenses in the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute; it just goes on and on. If you like, I will table the document so that the member for McMahon can read it a little later when he gets over his cowardly performance about GrainCorp. The debt ceiling does need to be increased. It is unfortunate that it needs to be increased because of the waste that you blokes racked up. (Time expired)

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:40):  The Australian people would be scratching their heads about the behaviour of those opposite when it comes to the debt cap. Wasn't this supposed to be some kind of debt emergency? Weren't they supposed to be against more debt? Didn't the now Treasurer say to the Press Club in May this year that for the good of the country we need to stop increasing debt as quickly as possible? And the year before didn't the Treasurer say that there is no justification for an increase in the credit card limit of the Commonwealth government whilst they are claiming to live within their means? Didn't the now Prime Minister say in 2011, as the shadow Treasurer said, that borrowing extra money was like saying to your bank manager: 'Look mate, I've got my spending under control. Can you extend my credit limit?' Didn't they say that they would not work with the Greens? Didn't they say that the Greens were economic fringe dwellers? Didn't they call year after year, whenever there was a policy change or some kind of development, for the government to release the books to update the Australian people on the nature of the Australian budget? All of those things are ringing a few bells. In the language of social media: WTF! That was then and this is now. The reality of their approach to the economy now is that there is a vast difference—




Mr Wyatt:
  The terminology within tweeting those three letters is inappropriate for this parliament and I ask that they be withdrawn.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I am unfamiliar with it, but I will take the member for Hasluck's comments as being relevant and I ask the member for rank and to withdraw.




Dr CHALMERS:
  I withdraw, Deputy Speaker. The reality of their approach to the economy is that there is a vast difference between what they said before the election and what they are doing now. Now they want to eliminate the debt ceiling on the national credit card, an extraordinary proposition from people who told Australians they wanted less debt and not more. They said less debt, then they said double the debt, and then they said, 'Let her rip.' They said, 'Open for business and open the books,' and now they say, 'Open the floodgates and open the throttle.' From 'Sloppy Joe' to 'Jelly-back Joe,' from Jekyll to Hyde, in record time. They said they would spend less and then the Treasurer gave away $12 billion in two weeks without explanation in the case of the RBA giveaway and without justification when it came to ripping off middle Australia to fund superannuation tax breaks for 16,000 wealthy Australians. 


Now they are in bed with the Greens on economic policy, just like they were in bed with the Greens on the Malaysian people swap. And now the debt emergency has become a credibility emergency for a new Treasurer. No wonder the member for New England is regarded as the real Treasurer on that side of the House. The member for North Sydney is unable to utter a word that is not written and authorised by the National Party or funded by Gina Reinhart. The charitable view is that the now Treasurer did not give a moment's thought to any of this before he got the job, that in four years as shadow Treasurer he did not get around to forming a view on any of the important economic and fiscal issues. We saw a bit of evidence of that today as he wandered around whingeing and whining about the national accounts, all of the excuses and political lines that we get from him in the absence of any credible analysis of the national accounts.


That is the charitable view. There is a more sinister interpretation that the Australian people need to be aware of what this is all about. Opening the spending floodgates now, shovelling money to the RBA and the wealthiest in our community, blowing out the deficit is all about one thing and one thing only: constructing a budget emergency of their own, creating an excuse for the swinging axe that will come when the 'Commission of Cuts' reports. It is an axe that will hit Middle Australia hard if their cuts to the schoolkids bonus and low-income super contributions are anything to go by—a preview of the nastiness to come.


This Treasurer comes in here all puffed up, full of self-congratulation, so proud of himself, always going for the cheap laugh over the hard yards. If those opposite think we would give a limitless credit card— (Time expired)

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (15:45):  I commend the previous speaker on what was a riveting contribution to Hansard! Well done! I was approached earlier on today to speak on this matter of public importance: 'The Government’s plan to allow itself to run up unlimited debt.'




Dr Chalmers:
  Do you want me to read the big words to you?




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  You're kidding! You talk about letting us run up unlimited debt, but what the House forgets is that there is a bill before the House that would enact the stopping of unlimited debt. It was introduced into the House—




Mr Champion:
  Half a trillion dollars!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  There you go! Let Hansard show that we just got an interjection from the other side of the House saying that it was for half a trillion dollars. May I inform the interjector that there is an enormous amount of difference between 'unlimited' and half a trillion dollars. How is it that you are struggling with the concept of 'unlimited,' which is open-ended? Let me take you back to the concept of 'unlimited'. Why is the country in such a fiscal mess? We hear comments of such absurdity from the other side, not understanding the concept of unlimited.


Who got left with the mess? Previous speakers on the other side spoke about GrainCorp, Qantas and the recapitalisation of the RBA. We understand what it is like to be on the other side. We were in opposition and we made a point of opposing—




Mr Snowdon:
  Everything!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  No, not everything. We made a point of opposing the previous government for not keeping their promises. We opposed the then government—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Let the Hansard show that comments from the other side came across that we 'opposed everything'. We opposed your broken promises. If your interpretation of everything you did was a broken promise, let the record show that. You made the point—




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Have you run out of material?




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  No, I have got much, much more. Member for Throsby, you have now fallen foul on opposing every single thing that we promised. We promised through the campaign that we would get rid of the carbon tax. That is not something that we just pulled out of our back pocket. We said we were going to oppose the carbon tax; you are opposing it. We said we were going to oppose the mining tax; you guys are opposing it. We said we were going to oppose TPVs; they are not going through. You have struggled with the education debate. 


But I want to get back to the current debt. You knew that this debt ceiling needed to be shifted. The entire government knew that it needed to be shifted. The evidence of that was in an interview with the previous Treasurer and, by all accounts, a great Treasurer! He was 'Treasurer of the Year,' and he cannot get a start on your frontbench. On Wednesday, 15 May, there was an interview with the then Treasurer, Wayne Swan, member for Lilley, with Neil Mitchell of 3AW in Melbourne. Neil Mitchell very simply asked: 


Will whoever wins the next election need to raise the debt level?


That was the question asked. The response from the then Treasurer was:


That will be a matter for them.


The government knew. I have been challenged in my own electorate. I want to get this on the record and I did it the other day on the television. I have been challenged in my electorate on the points made by the other side of the House. We said we wanted to bring down debt. Why is it then that one of our first acts in getting into government was to increase the debt ceiling? The simple fact of the matter is that the ongoing expenses are still yet to hit our MasterCard. If we liken it to a family budget, the expenses that Labor have racked up have still yet to hit. We have sat in this House for no fewer than eight days since the election. It is unthinkable to suggest that the key policy issues that we have brought before this House, which are still waiting to be ratified by the Senate, have had any budgetary impacts. The additional revenue limit is needed to substantiate the extra increase of expenditure that the opposition ran up. It is the opposition's debt, you own it and we will make sure that we pay it back.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:50):  This is a government built on contradictions, wandering around in its own parallel universe. You can see how it actually believes its rhetoric. You can see the contradictions on education. It was for Gonski and then it was against Gonski; it was for going back to the old SES model. And then, by the end of the week, it was back to Gonski. And, on boats, the same thing. 


One minute they are voting with the Greens in this House on the Malaysian transfer agreement. We had the Treasurer blubbering away at the dispatch box and, next minute, they are in here holding up pictures of Christine Milne, Leader of the Greens in the other place. On foreign investment, they say they are open for business and then, on their first major test of foreign investment, who gets to make the decision? The member for New England. The most incoherent member of the cabinet gets to make the decision! And people in boardrooms around Australia gasped—you could actually hear the breath intake of corporate Australia. Sydney just about shut down, surprised that jobs and investment in this country could be decided by the member for New England. No-one could quite believe it. And of course we have the same inherent contradiction on debt. They denied the GFC in opposition, but the justification for this debt increase is 'headwinds out of Europe'. That contradiction does not actually makes sense.


When they were in opposition we had a budget emergency—'budget emergency', it sounds very serious—and yet in government suddenly the emergency is not quite so emergent. I do not know what the word is, but it is the opposite to emergency. We had the austerity talk when they were in opposition, but that evaporated as well with this mismatch of policy. We know there are going to be cuts and nasty ones, but you can bet they will not be to the top end of town because they have given them a tax cut. One of their first acts was to give the top end of town a tax cut on their superannuation.


In opposition they decried the Greens. Even when they were voting with the Greens on the Malaysian transfer agreement, you would never have known it for their rhetoric. Yet, at this very moment, there is the Treasurer sandwiched between the member for New England and the member for Melbourne—two ends of a political horseshoe. Fortunately, he is big enough to fill that space, but it is an amazing position for a Treasurer to be in.


They told us before the election that they were going to repay the debt. How many times did we see that in direct mails around the country? 'Repay the debt. Repay the debt. Repay the debt.' If you could get them in a debate, they were not very good at telling you much beyond that. You were very good at saying it; you were not very good at actually having a debate about it.


But now, in the first sittings of this parliament, what do we have? An increase to half a trillion dollars in the debt limit. That is their first ambit claim and they are negotiating it. The member for Melbourne is not here. He is probably in Joe's office having very serious discussions or in Barnaby's office—the member for New England. They are probably talking about jobs and investment—probably not! What they are talking about is getting rid of the debt limit altogether. What we will have under this government is more debt. You can just see it coming. They are already starting to talk about good debt and bad debt. That means their debt will be good debt and our debt will be bad debt. That will be their philosophy. You can see it coming. What this Treasurer is doing, by getting into bed with the member for New England and the member for Melbourne, is jeopardising foreign investment, jeopardising jobs and pushing up our debt. This is a Treasurer that has all the characteristics of Ruth Park's muddle-headed wombat. That is what he is: a muddle-headed wombat, wandering around the place saying one thing and doing another.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (15:55):  I think I am offended on behalf of wombats. The tragedy of it all! No longer in government and no longer in their comfort zone of spin, focus groups and fantasy, the opposition have the hide to lecture the government on debt and the problems with the Australian economy. Why do they do it? Because the opposition will do anything and say anything to avoid one stark fact. That is the fact that they are no longer in government. Back in their days of government there was rarely any connection between fact and the Labor-Greens coalition public utterances. They saw themselves as the ringmasters of the 24-hour news cycle. They saw themselves as masters of spin manipulating the sad reality of their ongoing incompetence into a Pollyanna's confection of wishful thinking.


They are the party that promised there would be no carbon tax under a government that they led. They are the party that gave us the pink batts fiasco, GroceryWatch, cash for clunkers—and the list goes on. They are the party that on over 500 occasions promised the Australian people they would deliver a surplus and even printed brochures to say they had done it. They are a party that has thrived on political fantasy for so long that they would not know the truth if they ran into it. They are an opposition playing to their only strength—spin, not facts. They are an opposition that made being loose with the truth an art form. They are an opposition who forget that this is a deficit that they built.


Today's government has work to do, an economy to fix and a nation to build. This is a government with policies to implement. Why? Because that is what the people of Australia decided. Perhaps if the opposition were more interested in our nation's future and less interested in spin, and perhaps if they had been more interested in good government and less interested in media manipulation, they might have read the advice provided to them by their own Treasury. There you can find the facts—the facts of the damage of the runaway train that they called economic management.


This is a serious matter. The coalition inherited the results of Labor's frolic, and this government intends to deal with it in a careful, methodical and responsible way. We simply must have certainty about financing the budget. Good government is not determined by your mastery of the 24-hour news cycle; good government is all about prudent and proper decision making and economic management. This government has a responsibility to the Australian people to get our economy back on track.


The increase of the Commonwealth government debt limit from $300 billion to $500 billion is a critical step in this process. The opposition knew the debt limit would need to be increased again, but they did not have the courage to do it. Instead, the member for Lilley—the world's greatest Treasurer!—shirked his responsibilities and said it would be a matter for them after the 2013 election. They ignored Treasury advice, leaving it for others to clean up. It is not rocket science, just prudent economic management.


The coalition is committed to providing stability and certainty to the markets. Unlike Labor, on this side of the chamber we understand that the debt limit is not a target. In 2008, the Labor-Greens government set the debt ceiling at $75 billion. A few months later, in February 2009, the government increased the debt ceiling to $200 billion. The 2011-12 budget saw an increase to $250 billion. But that was not enough for Labor; they raised it again in 2012-13 to $300 billion. Between 2009 and 2013, in just four years, Labor increased the debt ceiling to 400 per cent of its original value. Labor owns this debt. This government has a responsibility to the Australian people to get our economy back on track.


I make one simple plea to the opposition: as much as you love the 24-hour news cycle, the people are sick of it. The Australian people want governments to get things done, not read about every confected conspiracy that conveniently lodges in the opposition's corporate brain. The people of Australian want the government to govern and that is what we are doing. It is as simple as that.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (15:59):  I will remind the House that the topic of today's MPI is the government's plan to allow itself to run up unlimited debt. That is what I intend to speak about. Every day we are reminded by this government that they have been given a mandate by the Australian public to govern on the policies they campaigned for—every day. Yet every day, we are being hit with new policies and positions that directly contradict what they took to the Australian people during the election. In opposition, members opposite insisted that they were on a unity ticket with Labor on education. In opposition, government members opposite insisted that we were in the grip of a budget crisis and needed to reduce our debt. Really? I am not sure what to believe. If that is what the government campaigned on, surely Gonski would be going ahead and we would now be taking action to reduce our debt. But that is not what is happening. Every day this government is changing its story and breaking its promises. This is not the government Australia thought they were getting.


The Treasurer went to the election promising to reduce debt and to implement deep budget cuts. He called it fiscal discipline, if I am not mistaken. But that is not what he is doing now. The government has instead embarked on a spending spree and now wants to allow itself access to unlimited credit. The Liberal Party campaigned against debt before the election yet one of their first actions in this parliament is to request an unprecedented increase to the debt limit of 67 per cent. The coalition can in no way claim a mandate to increase the debt limit by this amount to half-a-trillion dollars.


Make no mistake: the first time that the $500 billion figure was mentioned was when the Treasurer announced it on 22 October, six weeks after the election. The government was not given a mandate to increase the debt limit to half-a-trillion dollars and they certainly were not given a mandate to scrap the limit altogether. And the Treasurer has gone from promising to pay back the debt before the election to wanting to double the debt a couple of weeks ago to now wanting to run up unlimited debt. Today, we are talking about having an unlimited debt limit. This new position on removing the debt limit altogether is truly remarkable.


In this House on 12 March this year, the now Treasurer rose to speak and address the government on debt limits. He said:


The truth is that Labor do not know how to live within their means. They are like someone with a credit card who is out of control.


The thing is that credit cards do have a limit. And for good reason. That is why the debt limit exists and that is why we support the continuation of the limit and an increase in line with any evidence to support it. The Treasurer is now suggesting that we remove the limit altogether and go on a free-for-all. I shudder to think what that means for Australia based on the few weeks of crazy spending that we have already seen.


They have thrown $8.8 billion to the RBA, money that they did not want or need, a move of political means, not economic means. Then there was the $1.2 billion that came from nowhere this week and was thrown at the state governments as hush money. I would like to say that this was to address disadvantage in education, but there are no guarantees about where that money is going to. It is a no-strings handout. That is $10 billion of unbudgeted spending in this first sitting of the 44th parliament. No wonder they want to scrap the limit.


This Liberal government is now saying: 'We're happy to break promises. We don't want controls on our spending. Let's remove the debt limit altogether.' The Australian public cannot trust this government. We cannot trust anything they said during the election; we cannot trust what they said yesterday; we cannot trust what they say today. Who knows what they will be saying tomorrow? But we do know one thing about what they say: we will not be able to trust it.


The coalition called the Greens 'economic fringe dwellers' during the last parliament but now promises to deal with them on the debt after the election. Labor is not going to support removing the debt limit. We will not support removing parliamentary scrutiny of government debt. Labor's position on debt is clear and it has been consistent. The government needs to be transparent and open its books and produce the evidence required.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (16:04):  For the sake of those in the gallery, I had better explain that we are here today talking about debt and deficit because the Labor Party put this on the agenda. It was not our side; it was the Labor Party that put debt and deficit on the agenda this afternoon. What I would love to see—and maybe the member for Chifley could do this for us—is the tabling of the Einsteins on your side who decided in your tactics committee meeting to put this on the agenda for the MPI debate today. They are geniuses! Let us run through a little bit of the history.


When you came into government the budget was in surplus by $20 billion. It is now forecast to be in deficit by $30 billion. Let us have a look at what has happened with net debt. When you came into office, the government was $50 billion in the black. What are we expecting now? Net debt is going to be well and truly over $200 billion. And yet you want to debate debt and deficit in this place this afternoon. What those opposite need to do is go to the Press Club and have a look at the record there of what Brian Loughnane said in his speech after the election about what the causes were for you losing. One of them was debt and deficit. And yet here you are today talking about debt and deficit. I will say one thing: keep it coming; let us have MPIs for the next three years on debt and deficit. Make our day.


We want to clean your mess up. What we are seeing in you not allowing us to raise the debt limit is you making sure that we cannot clean your mess up. It reminds me sometimes of when you go into the city and walk around the park. You see people walk their dogs that poop. We have had five poops in the park—the five biggest budget deficits in Australia's history have just been lobbed in the park. And we want to come along with the poop scoop and clean up your mess, and you are hiding the poop scoop from us; you will not allow us to get to the poop scoop. What is that going to do?


Ultimately, the Australian people are going to say: 'They need more time in opposition to realise the damage they have done.' Give us the poop scoop, please! We want to clean up your mess. And it is an almighty mess—the five biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. As a matter of fact, it is the fastest deterioration of debt in modern history—yet those Einsteins on your tactics committee are saying, 'Let's come in here and do the MPI on debt and deficit.' Bring it on. Come on Ed, don't go. Are you going to get the list of the people who are on the tactics committee? Come on, table it for us. Or are you going away to get your poop scoop? We need the poop scoop. Come on, bring it back to us; we need your poop scoop.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon will desist from that language—and, indeed, withdraw it!




Mr TEHAN:
  What I will do now is—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: knowing you well, Madam Speaker, I know you have only a limited interest in poop scoops, and I would ask you to ask the member to refer to his remarks through the chair. 



The SPEAKER:  And I would ask you not to repeat words that I just said are unparliamentary, so you can withdraw them too.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  I withdraw, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Good. The member for Wannon has the call.




Mr TEHAN:
  I am nearly out of time, so all I will do is point to the member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, whose MPI this is. The member for McMahon said that the peak of the Labor Party debt would be nine per cent of GDP. Only two years later it peaked at 22.1 per cent, yet the shadow Treasurer has the gall to come into this place and put this MPI before us today. Debt and deficit is your record. We will clean up your mess and we will get the budget back in surplus. We will bring debt down. You should get out of the way and allow us to do it.

 (Greenway) (16:50):  I was relaying to the House some of the very important information contained in the APEC report on the economic impact of submarine cable disruption, and I was talking about how the growth in bandwidth and the increasing need for international bandwidth is one of the most potent drivers of the need for upgraded infrastructure, both in Australia and between countries. As is pointed out in this report:


The amount of data and information generated, sent and received worldwide using this global network has been experiencing unmatched growth since then and has far exceeded any kind of information transmission known before.


So it is quite clear that we could not have predicted at the time these cables were first installed, particularly cables installed to Australia, what they would, indeed, be capable of achieving. This goes back to the whole point of this bill, and the point of the opposition's amendment in this case: when you seek to try to predict the limitations of technology in the future you will fail; you will come off second best. As I have said in this place in relation to the NBN, one thing that is continually overlooked by this government, which they have never come to terms with, is that the NBN is not about the download; it is about the upload. It is about what people are capable of doing with it. That is quite clear, and you do not have to take it from me. Have a look at the coalition's own broadband plan that it released in April 2013. Do a word search and you will not find the word 'upload' once.


The total incapacity of this government to grasp the nature of the NBN is absolutely staggering. You can tell why, when the now government were in opposition, they did not want to talk about this—on 20 August, we had reports that the now Minister for Communications finally admitted his NBN upload speeds would actually be very small—negligible compared with what is capable of delivery under Labor's NBN. This is not an insignificant matter. Even the United States, as the Congressional Research Service pointed out in July this year, is seeking a number of goals under its national broadband plan. Goal No. 1 is that at least 100 million US homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second—not the 25 megabits per second that the government want to give you—and actual upload speeds of at least 50 megabits per second. On TechAU on 20 August: 'Turnbull finally admits his NBN upload speed will be 4 to 6 Mbps.' Well, I think that speaks for itself about the absolute short-sightedness of this government and about their absolute inability to grasp what every other developed country in the world is doing, particularly those in our region.


I will point to some even more recent news. In answer to questions put to him in Senate estimates, Ziggy Switkowski, the new acting chief of NBN Co., said:


Maybe I would rephrase the question: do you think for the next decade, which is probably as far as one can think reasonably, there will be a situation where a significant upgrade from FTTN to FTTP will be justified and required? There is a good chance the answer to that will be no.


And he warned against putting too much weight into arguments for higher internet speeds predicated on the assumption that speeds will be justified by as yet un-thought-of applications. Well, who would have thought even five years ago what the market for applications would be globally? It just shows, again, the short-sightedness of this government.


I am disappointed that the member for Ryan is not here, because I followed her speech where she talked about how good the government's policy is compared with Labor's NBN policy. But I am glad the member for Moreton is here, because he will be well-versed in this special that I would like to regale the House with. There is a very special chronology here involving the member for Ryan, and I am sure it typifies the views of many of those opposite on the NBN. On 9 December 2008, the Courier Mail reported: 'Brisbane to spend $500,000 on superfast broadband'. The article goes on to say that Campbell Newman has approved half a million dollars to future-proof Brisbane, and it continues:


""This is about future proofing our city to ensure we have the capacity to sustain the economic growth of which we all know we are capable"", he said.


…   …   …


Economic Development Chair Jane Prentice believes the project will help Brisbane to keep up with world leaders in broadband technology.


""During a recent trade mission to Korea with the Lord Mayor, the benefits of having high speed fibre connection became clear,"" she said.


Note: high-speed fibre—not copper, which is what the member for Ryan and those opposite want to give to the rest of us. Again in 2008: 'Brisbane to get high-speed fibre grid: High speed optical fibre network in Brisbane could provide 15,000 jobs, tip an estimated $5 billion into the local economy'. Internet speeds between 100 megabits and a gigabit per second—so she was very ready to do that for Brisbane, but not ready to do that for everyone else. But it gets better: 'she was encouraged again to push ahead for the project after visiting South Korea'. And here we have the Sydney Morning Herald on October 19, 2010: 'Will Brisbane broadband get flushed? The company charged with installing Brisbane's broadband network has recently been forced to abandon its sewer delivery method in a smaller United Kingdom project.' And it goes on: 'Sewer broadband deal sours' in the same paper on 23 February 2011. 


Brisbane council has dumped the company charged with providing Brisbane's controversial sewer broadband scheme. … Opposition Leader—


on Brisbane City Council—


Shayne Sutton has questioned why the deal was being spruiked before a contract was signed.


And rightly so. Campbell Newman said:


… he announced the i3 Asia Pacific partnership in October, because ""We thought we had a deal.""


…   …   …


“I am extremely concerned—


said Councillor Shane Sutton


about the lack of transparency surrounding this entire scheme,""…


—and rightly so. Lack of transparency appears to be becoming the order of the day on the 'fraudband' project that the government is trying to inflict on Australian people.


I do want to mention—and it was mentioned in question time today—the minister attacking Mike Quigley yet again. He has a habit of doing that, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, as I am sure you well know, having been a member of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network with me in the previous parliament. But I do not want to attack the new Executive Chairman and I will not. Instead, I will draw into question the judgement of the minister, for whom it was confirmed at estimates that the now executive chairman was approached about the role well before the election. He also confirmed that he worked at NBN Co. now for 3½ days a week . How much does 3½ days a week make per month? He is making $50,000 a month. I know that is beer money—Bollinger money—for the minister, but for the rest of us it is not an insignificant amount. And, on the topic of laughing it up in question time today on the other side, we had the member for Herbert asking about Townsville. And I have a blog post here which he wrote in March this year. He asked the question: 'My mum is 81 years old. She uses Facebook, does the occasional email and books movie tickets online. Does she really need fibre? What is all this for?' Well, if the member for Herbert would care to refresh his memory, he would know that a very important series of trials were done in Townsville on a very important issue that I am sure everyone in the House would agree needs to be dealt with, and that is diabetes—the NBN Diabetes Telehealth Trial in Townsville, which was taking advantage of high-speed, in-home, fibre-to-the-home broadband to be able to deliver a very important telehealth scheme. In Senate estimates in October last year, a question was asked on e-health and the NBN telehealth trials:


The National Broadband Network (NBN) telehealth trials are funded through the National Partnership Agreement on the Digital Regions Initiative. They comprise the:


Townsville NBN-Diabetes Enabled Telehealth Trial; and …


The trials are delivered in partnership with the …Queensland State Government and use the NBN to provide in-home telehealth services. The Townsville Telehealth trial … provide[s] in-home monitoring of key health indicators, video consultations between patients and locally based nurse coordinators and health professionals, as well as education services to promote healthier lifestyles.


One would think this is a good use of technology. 


I would like to point out, however, when talking about good uses, that what has been lost in this whole debate is the consumer, the end user. We have the minister and his mates supposedly putting out a strategic review, which is going to be unbiased, despite the fact that he is already talking as if he has decided about the form of technology he is going to use. What cannot be lost in this debate is the importance of what this delivers to the consumer. I do not care how many times the minister and those opposite need to see the dilapidated state of the copper network, but what I would like to have as a key takeaway is that you cannot do these applications of the future without focusing on the upload. You will not be capable of getting the bandwidth that is necessary if you pick and choose people who will receive fibre to the home as opposed to copper on the last mile. 


This bill is all about future-proofing ourselves and about being forward looking. I would challenge anyone to vote against the amendment that the shadow minister has put up today, because it would speak volumes of those who do.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:01):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. I particularly thank the member for Greenway for her contribution. Hers was a great victory on election day. On a day that was pretty tough for Labor, the member for Greenway was a shining light. She brings her expertise in this area to the chamber in a way that those opposite do not seem to have grasped at all. I am particularly appreciative of the fact that the member for Greenway understands the productivity boosts that will come with the NBN rollout—the fair dinkum one, not the copper-wire one, to the home—so that businesses, homes, hospitals, universities, the elderly, workers and families can get the benefits of the digital revolution. Those opposite who are sitting up in their offices tapping away on their Ataris do not seem to have grasped that we have moved on a bit. The reality is there are great benefits that can come for regional Australia. I see the member for Gippsland in the chamber and he would know of the great health benefits that come for people who cannot duck off to Melbourne every day for check-ups and the like. The digital trials will show the great benefits to our communities as these baby boomers change the shape of our population pyramid. The next 20 years—perhaps it is even the next two years—will see one in five Australians over the age of 65. The reality is that, as we age, our health needs increase. We are not a particularly healthy nation and recent data show that we are in fact the most unhealthy nation in terms of some lifestyle factors. 


We have some big issues in front of us and so we need to have a piece of infrastructure that will serve Australia in the future, not the Australia of the 1890s, when they were debating whether to replace iron with copper. This is a matter of national interest that I am proud to be associated with. I think most of those opposite do understand that no matter which side of the chamber, we are here for the national interest. There is the odd individual who is here only for their self-interest, but most of us are here to serve the nation. Australia, as a high-wages country in the middle of Asia, has particular challenges. We could go down the low-wages road. That was tried by John Howard with WorkChoices, and the Australian people said: 'No thank you. We believe in the fair go; we do believe in people having a decent wage. We don't want to be like our friends across the Pacific in the US working at Walmart who have food raising campaigns for the people who are employed.' That is not the Australian way. We believe in decent wages, whether you are a cleaner or working on a farm or a factory. We have always believed in a decent wage. 


That means that we have to do things in a more clever way. How do you do that? You accept that there is a digital age. You accept that the world has changed. The future is all about technology and the exchange of information. It is not just about downloading music, TV shows and movies. Rather, it is about an exchange of information. It is a matter of national interest. I am a bit disappointed in the Minister for Communications, because I think that he does not believe in his own policy. I know he made the front cover of the coalition's election booklet, but I do not think he has embraced their policies. We know that from the shares he has invested in. He knows that the way forward lies with the Labor NBN scheme. There are challenges with the rollout, but you do not give up on the Snowy Mountains scheme because you encounter a different form of rock. If you believe in a national piece of infrastructure and the benefits that come particularly to the bush, that is what you do. 


Business competitiveness is absolutely vital in our growing global economy, where capital moves quickly and where labour moves quickly. We must have better access to broadband both at home and in business as the divide between workplaces and home becomes more and more blurred and as permanent employment becomes a rarer beast. My four-year-old understand the benefits of superfast broadband; he understands iPads better than I do. My eight-year-old understands the fun opportunities but also the learning opportunities. 


Our small and medium businesses, the SMEs, will be able to sell their products and services to the fastest growing region in the world, Asia. Four or five hundred million Chinese are emerging from a basically peasant lifestyle and moving into the middle class. There are 700 or 800 million people in India who are on the same journey towards improving their standard of living. Australia can be a trusted brand that can reach into these areas. If the Indonesians ever speak to us again, there are 240 million of them who are prepared to buy our services. I am sure the member for Gippsland, who is at the table, will be doing his best to clean up some of that mess in the future. I wish him well in those endeavours. I know he is particularly passionate about our region.


Let us have a quick look at the difference between Labor's fibre-to-the-premises model and this government's fibre-to-the-node model. Labor's NBN connected homes and businesses to the internet via an optic fibre. The expected minimum lifetime of this fibre is 60 years. It is interesting to compare that with the comments and the bit of history given by the Minister for Communications, the member for Wentworth, in his second reading speech. The speech is good. It gives a good history of telegraph cables, noting that they have been laid for over 150 years. He makes the point that 'over time, demand has caught up with the extraordinary increase in capacity'. Who would have thought that, if you create an opportunity, businesses and people will take advantage of it? He states in his speech:


Modern submarine cables typically provide multiple terabits per second of capacity when deployed and can be further upgraded, positioning them to meet future traffic demands.


You do not build a bridge for the traffic of today. You build for the capacity, in this case, of the next 60 years. With the geometric progression in data sharing around the world, you have to be prepared. 


The member for Greenway touched on the vacillating proposals of those opposite. She particularly mentioned the member for Ryan. I remember the member for Ryan when she was a local councillor. A bit of her ward was in my patch. I remember her commitment to put optic fibre cables in the sewer. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane at the time, Campbell Newman, had a plan to run these cables through the sewer. Back then the member for Ryan was all in favour of superfast broadband—not at 25 megabytes per second but at 100 megabytes per second. She became the member for Ryan and all of a sudden she was happy to settle for second prize. She cannot see the opportunities that she saw when she went to visit South Korea, a country that has a bit of vision and is prepared to invest in infrastructure, that knows that the way of the future is not in low wages but in a high-skills business community, a well-educated workforce. That is the way forward. We cannot compete with surrounding countries on low wages—that way madness lies; that way misery lies—but we can compete by being clever and educated and by having the infrastructure that serves Australian innovation. 


We are that unique nation in which—Indigenous Australians aside—people have come from all over the world. That has created a sense of innovation from day one. For 223 years of a 225-year migration program, Britain was the No. 1 source of immigrants to Australia. Two years ago the No. 1 source was China and one year ago it was India. That reflects modern Australia. This chamber is slowly becoming aware of that. We have all these connections with Asia. It is not that we are breaking our ties with Europe but that we see the opportunities that come from emerging Asian markets.


As commendable as the copper network is—and it did serve a purpose years ago—it has been hard to maintain. Nowadays, if you ask anyone under 25 for their landline number they will say, 'What is a landline?' Things have changed. The world has moved on. We need a system that serves modern Australia, not what it was back in the 1950s. BIS Shrapnel estimates predict a reduction of up to 70 per cent of the current copper network maintenance costs, which are gradually increasing as the ageing network decays, in turn creating problems, particularly for regional areas, which will end up with second-rate internet and conductivity speeds. I see it in my electorate. When I go for my morning walk I see the Telstra pits. It can take up to eight months for them to be maintained properly. As Telstra has stood down workers over the years, it is not doing the upgrade that it needs to. 


The cost of repairing and maintaining the decaying copper network is now so high that, in many cases, Telstra opted to deploy new fibre technology to replace parts of its network damaged by floods or fires, which sadly has been the case in Queensland over the years. The BIS Shrapnel report states, 'Overall we believe the copper network has maintenance costs of up to $1 billion a year.' I have not looked at the fees to see if they are spending that, but it is obviously cheaper to do it right, to get it done properly.


On the NBN speeds that they trumpet, the reality is they are not able to match their election commitment of 100 megabits per second. That is just a reality. Upgrading the speed of the NBN under Labor's plan of fibre to the home is simply a matter of replacing the equipment at each end of the fibre, which is much simpler. Speeds exceeding 40,000 megabytes per second have already been demonstrated in research laboratories using the same type of fibre as the NBN. So there will be opportunities for the infrastructure, if we get it right, to accommodate the digital revolution that is upon us now.


I would suggest that the Minister for Communications stop refusing our nation this vital infrastructure. Why waste the money that they are prepared to commit to come up with something that is second rate? It is funny, but I have never seen a more suddenly energised and motivated group of people than the gamers in my electorate when they suddenly realised the Liberals' plan was going to come to the fore. They were suddenly motivated about politics and asked, 'Why would we do this? Why do they have such limited vision?' 


I urge people to have a look at the facts. Labor's optic fibre provides the technology to use the broadband of the 21st century, not the 19th century. Copper did serve for a time, but we have moved on. The infrastructure that we are putting in will take us to 2040 and beyond. Depending on what happens with those new experiments, it could serve us for the next 100 years.

If the Indonesians ever speak to us again, there are 240 million of them who are prepared to buy our services. I am sure the member for Gippsland, who is at the table, will be doing his best to clean up some of that mess in the future. I wish him well in those endeavours. I know he is particularly passionate about our region.


Let us have a quick look at the difference between Labor's fibre-to-the-premises model and this government's fibre-to-the-node model. Labor's NBN connected homes and businesses to the internet via an optic fibre. The expected minimum lifetime of this fibre is 60 years. It is interesting to compare that with the comments and the bit of history given by the Minister for Communications, the member for Wentworth, in his second reading speech. The speech is good. It gives a good history of telegraph cables, noting that they have been laid for over 150 years. He makes the point that 'over time, demand has caught up with the extraordinary increase in capacity'. Who would have thought that, if you create an opportunity, businesses and people will take advantage of it? He states in his speech:


Modern submarine cables typically provide multiple terabits per second of capacity when deployed and can be further upgraded, positioning them to meet future traffic demands.


You do not build a bridge for the traffic of today. You build for the capacity, in this case, of the next 60 years. With the geometric progression in data sharing around the world, you have to be prepared. 


The member for Greenway touched on the vacillating proposals of those opposite. She particularly mentioned the member for Ryan. I remember the member for Ryan when she was a local councillor. A bit of her ward was in my patch. I remember her commitment to put optic fibre cables in the sewer. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane at the time, Campbell Newman, had a plan to run these cables through the sewer. Back then the member for Ryan was all in favour of superfast broadband—not at 25 megabytes per second but at 100 megabytes per second. She became the member for Ryan and all of a sudden she was happy to settle for second prize. She cannot see the opportunities that she saw when she went to visit South Korea, a country that has a bit of vision and is prepared to invest in infrastructure, that knows that the way of the future is not in low wages but in a high-skills business community, a well-educated workforce. That is the way forward. We cannot compete with surrounding countries on low wages—that way madness lies; that way misery lies—but we can compete by being clever and educated and by having the infrastructure that serves Australian innovation. 


We are that unique nation in which—Indigenous Australians aside—people have come from all over the world. That has created a sense of innovation from day one. For 223 years of a 225-year migration program, Britain was the No. 1 source of immigrants to Australia. Two years ago the No. 1 source was China and one year ago it was India. That reflects modern Australia. This chamber is slowly becoming aware of that. We have all these connections with Asia. It is not that we are breaking our ties with Europe but that we see the opportunities that come from emerging Asian markets.


As commendable as the copper network is—and it did serve a purpose years ago—it has been hard to maintain. Nowadays, if you ask anyone under 25 for their landline number they will say, 'What is a landline?' Things have changed. The world has moved on. We need a system that serves modern Australia, not what it was back in the 1950s. BIS Shrapnel estimates predict a reduction of up to 70 per cent of the current copper network maintenance costs, which are gradually increasing as the ageing network decays, in turn creating problems, particularly for regional areas, which will end up with second-rate internet and conductivity speeds. I see it in my electorate. When I go for my morning walk I see the Telstra pits. It can take up to eight months for them to be maintained properly. As Telstra has stood down workers over the years, it is not doing the upgrade that it needs to. 


The cost of repairing and maintaining the decaying copper network is now so high that, in many cases, Telstra opted to deploy new fibre technology to replace parts of its network damaged by floods or fires, which sadly has been the case in Queensland over the years. The BIS Shrapnel report states, 'Overall we believe the copper network has maintenance costs of up to $1 billion a year.' I have not looked at the fees to see if they are spending that, but it is obviously cheaper to do it right, to get it done properly.


On the NBN speeds that they trumpet, the reality is they are not able to match their election commitment of 100 megabits per second. That is just a reality. Upgrading the speed of the NBN under Labor's plan of fibre to the home is simply a matter of replacing the equipment at each end of the fibre, which is much simpler. Speeds exceeding 40,000 megabytes per second have already been demonstrated in research laboratories using the same type of fibre as the NBN. So there will be opportunities for the infrastructure, if we get it right, to accommodate the digital revolution that is upon us now.


I would suggest that the Minister for Communications stop refusing our nation this vital infrastructure. Why waste the money that they are prepared to commit to come up with something that is second rate? It is funny, but I have never seen a more suddenly energised and motivated group of people than the gamers in my electorate when they suddenly realised the Liberals' plan was going to come to the fore. They were suddenly motivated about politics and asked, 'Why would we do this? Why do they have such limited vision?' 


I urge people to have a look at the facts. Labor's optic fibre provides the technology to use the broadband of the 21st century, not the 19th century. Copper did serve for a time, but we have moved on. The infrastructure that we are putting in will take us to 2040 and beyond. Depending on what happens with those new experiments, it could serve us for the next 100 years.

  During question time, I noted that the member for Lilley had said a few years ago that it would be 'hilarious' if Labor brought in a carbon tax. For the record, his actual words were something different. His exact words from the transcript of Meet the Press for 15 August 2010 were:

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (17:17):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. It is a privilege to follow the member for Moreton, who treated us to a discursive display of views about a range of matters only extremely peripherally related to the subject of this bill. In fact, he took us through a nest of non sequiturs, an isthmus of irrelevance.


This afternoon's bill is, in fact, about the regulatory regime dealing with submarine cabling. It is true that there is, if you draw a very, very long bow, some connection between broadband networks and submarine cables. There is a connection in this sense—a broadband network of the kind which is presently being built, a national broadband network, is principally an access network, whereas a submarine cable that extends between Australia and other places, such as the United States, is used to carry all kinds of data and voice traffic. Indeed, fascinatingly, this has occurred for more than 100 years. Submarine cables have been in existence for well over 100 years.


The member for Moreton told us about gaming. He told us about a range of other matters. Indeed, when the shadow minister spoke he was at pains to try to relate this debate to the question of the National Broadband Network. He said, for example: 'There have been problems with the construction of the National Broadband Network. That is not good enough; it needs to be fixed. But we should not stop building it.' He says that as if in some way there could be a difference drawn between the particular mode of construction which the previous government was adopting and the core construction performance. Apparently, you can sort that out, it is an easy thing to do and you should just keep doing it. The whole point is that it is not an easy thing to do. It is a very complex job. It is a job that we are now, fortunately for the people of Australia, on the case about.


I want to turn to the actual matters which are the subject of the bill before the House this afternoon. There are three specific things that this bill will do by making amendments to the submarine cable protection regime set out in schedule 3A of the Telecommunications Act. The first is to ensure consistency between the cable protection regime and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The second is to provide a clearer consultation process between the Australian Communications and Media Authority and the Attorney-General's Department on submarine cable installation permit applications. The third is to enable significant domestic submarine cables to be brought under the regime and to be suitably protected under the regime. That is what the bill does. There is, at best, an indirect connection between the matters the subject of this bill and the matters that we heard about from the member for Moreton and the member for Blaxland.


In the time available to me this afternoon, I want to make three brief points. The first is that submarine cables are of critical importance. They are of critical importance ultimately in the end-to-end voice telephony and broadband services that are delivered to end users. The second is that significant risks face the operators of submarine cables. The third is that there are important measures in this bill which will facilitate the rollout of submarine cables to make an inherently risky business slightly less risky.


Let us turn to the proposition that submarine cables are of critical importance. Madam Speaker, may I parenthetically take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to the high office that you now hold, this being the first opportunity I have had to do so.


It is no surprise that Australia, as an island nation, is extremely dependent on submarine cables. Submarine cables connect our country with the rest of the world and form an important part of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure. Modern submarine cables allow for the transfer of vast amounts of data and they carry the vast bulk of Australia's international data and voice traffic. It follows from that that if there is damage to cables—if there is service disruption to cables—it can have a very significant economic impact. It is for this reason that the Australian government in 2005 established a regime for the protection of nationally significant submarine cables connecting Australia to other countries. Indeed, that regime has been praised by organisations as diverse as the International Cable Protection Committee and APEC as a global best practice approach to the protection of submarine cables.


It is worth making the point that submarine cables have been around for a very long time. Initially, they were used for the purpose of supporting telegraph traffic. The first submarine telegraph cables were laid across the English Channel in 1851 and then across the Atlantic Ocean in 1866. Australia received its first submarine cable connection quite early, in 1872, through the Java to Port Darwin telegraph link. This in turn led to a connection to the southern capitals via the iconic Overland Telegraph Line, which was built by Charles Todd. There is another important Australian connection with submarine cables. In Australia for a number of years the No. 2 telco, Optus, was owned by the British company Cable & Wireless, which for over 100 years had been one of the world's great submarine cable owning companies, albeit its role in that field is much reduced today. The origins of Cable & Wireless date back to the 1860s. The company was founded by Sir John Pender, the Manchester cotton merchant, who was the financier of the Great Eastern, the ship which laid the successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866. The company enjoyed a near monopoly on international communications for many years, embracing over 50 telegraph, radio and telecom companies. To take one example, in 1901 the Eastern Telegraph Company, which was a predecessor of Cable & Wireless, had an international communications network of around 150,000 kilometres of undersea cables.


If we take the story forward over 100 years, around the turn of this century there was a boom in the cable construction business, with companies like Global Crossing established to build-out traditional submarine cables. Indeed, Cable & Wireless was also pursuing at that time a focus on building internet backbones around the world, including backbones running through submarine cables. There was a view around the telecommunications industry at the time that internet demand was going to expand without limit. So the business strategy of building out cables was apparently guaranteed to succeed. With so many new cables being constructed at the time it turned out that, despite the best expectations of those who were putting money into this field, the boom was not a sustainable one and many of the cable owning companies went into bankruptcy. Global Crossing went bankrupt and Cable & Wireless saw its shares drop from five pounds in early 2000 to 34 pence a couple of years later.


There is a nexus between submarine cables and the end-to-end broadband service which is delivered to Australians. It is not the matters that were being discussed by the members for Moreton and Blaxland. The submarine cable issue has nothing to do with the access network, which is the subject of the National Broadband Network, that those two members were incorrectly speaking about in their contributions on this debate. There is a connection, because it is the end-to-end connectivity which ultimately determines the customer experience of the person connected to the network. Notwithstanding all the rhetoric from the former Labor government about the National Broadband Network, they had very little to say about another potential bottleneck, which is of course the submarine cable. When so much traffic is travelling across the Pacific from Australia to the United States in particular, if there is a bottleneck at that point, the end-to-end experience is likely to be a constrained one.


Madam Speaker, I feel confident that you and my parliamentary colleagues share a strong interest in the details of the submarine cable industry. I could go on for some time, but I have been encouraged to digitally compress my remarks. I am very pleased to digitally compress my remarks by making the point that the measures in this bill will facilitate the rollout of submarine cables by, in some important ways, reducing the risk which is faced by operators in this vital industry. I am therefore very pleased to commend this bill to the House.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (17:27):  Madam Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.



The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer may proceed.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I report to the House that the government has come to an agreement with the Australian Greens about the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Amendment Bill 2013. The Greens have engaged in honest discussion with us about dealing with the debt limit that was put in place by the Labor Party in 2008. The original debt limit was $75 billion. That was broken by the government. It was increased to $200 billion, and the Labor Party broke that; then $250 billion, and they broke that; and then $300 billion, and they broke that. The Labor Party treated the debt ceiling limit as a target. It is not a target; it is in fact a way of constraining the government in the way it goes about its business. The problem was that Labor could never keep to it. We sought to increase it to $500 billion on the best advice from the Treasury, based on the legacy of debt that we have been given by the Labor Party, together with a $40 billion to $60 billion buffer to reassure the markets that Australia remained open for business.


The fact of the matter is that next week we will reach that $300 billion limit. We did not create this debt; we are now trying to fix it. Immense uncertainty surrounds this issue. The Labor Party have refused briefings from the Treasury. We offered the Leader of the Opposition briefings from the Secretary of the Treasury about this matter; he refused them. When we spoke to the Greens, they were prepared to engage in full and frank discussion. 


I table the agreement with Senator Christine Milne. This is the totality of the agreement. There are no side deals. There are no winks and nods about any other issues. The agreement comes down to greater transparency about the debt and how it is used by the government. I have no problems with that at all. We have a mandate to fix the problem and we will fix the problem. But, unfortunately, the Labor Party has consigned itself to irrelevancy in relation to these economic matters—complete irrelevancy. The fact that the Australian Greens were far more amenable to dealing with what is a major problem of the Labor Party's creation, and the fact that they were prepared to deal with us but the Labor Party was not, says everything. 


We need to move quickly in dealing with this. Now that an agreement has been struck and that the Greens will be moving amendments in the Senate, I ask the Labor Party not to delay the passage of the legislation. It is one thing to prosecute the argument about the $400 billion, but I urge the Labor Party to deal with this as soon as possible in the Senate and in the House of Representatives to avoid any uncertainty about Australia's capacity to meet its needs. It was a significant issue facing both this House and the Senate over the next few days. The matter has now been resolved. 



The SPEAKER:  The Treasurer did in fact have a question asked of him during question time relating to any deal with the Greens and any terms and conditions that related to it. He has added to his answer by tabling that agreement.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:32):  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. For many, I am sure, submarine cables may not be the most captivating topic—but it should be, particularly when we think about the important role that they play in connecting us with the rest of the world. 


Submarine cables are how Australia connects to the rest of the world. They allow us to overcome the tyranny of distance, which has so defined our past. It is probably under-appreciated, but it is submarine cables that have enabled Australia to be the vibrant, intelligent and diverse nation that we are today. Submarine cables carry the bulk of Australia's international voice and data traffic. They are quite literally what allows us to communicate and to connect with the rest of the world in real time.


In preparation for this speech, I was looking at a global map of submarine cables, and it was nothing short of a thing of beauty. The colourful lines connecting the most far flung stretches of earth could have been aeroplane or shipping routes. But the reality is that they are something far less visible that most Australians are blissfully unaware of.


Australia's geographic remoteness, the fact that we are an island nation, means that submarine cables are of vital importance to us. And in an age where communications infrastructure defines our productivity, our success and our future, submarine cables are all the more important. Damage to these cables can have a significant economic impact. Damage can easily cause service disruption. When damage occurs, it is overwhelmingly caused by something man-made. Around 70 per cent of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring in depths of less than 200 metres. In Australia, where we depend on submarine cables to connect to the global telecommunications network and engage in the global digital economy society, the risks associated with cable damage are serious and significant.


This bill, which allows for the better protection of Australia's submarine cables, is therefore a very worthy one. It streamlines some of the processes to provide protection to these cables; to include submarine cables that might only link points in Australia, such as those that cross Bass Strait; and to ensure the consistency of the laws with international obligations. When those opposite persist in speaking of the need for small government, this bill is a timely reminder that it is schemes like the submarine cable protection regime that demonstrate why government regulation is important.


This bill was originally drafted by the Gillard government, and it is pleasing to see that it has maintained its bipartisan support and has been introduced by the Abbott government. The reason the bill has bipartisan support is that both sides of this House recognise that, in the 21st century, communications infrastructure is critical. Both sides of the House recognise that it is communications infrastructure that will define our economic success in the future. Those opposite recognise the need for interconnection, the need for connection and the need for connectedness. This is why it is so puzzling, so absolutely dumbfounding, that they have chosen to significantly downgrade, cut, the most important communications infrastructure project of the 21st century, the National Broadband Network.


The amendments moved by the shadow minister point out this inconsistency, this disconnect. The government has praised the rollout of international undersea fibre optic cable for being forward-looking but is not adopting the same approach to the rollout of fibre optic cable on land. The National Broadband Network is the biggest and most important infrastructure project in Australia right now, and Labor believes it should be done right. That means fibre to the premises delivering speeds of up to 100 megabits per second to every Australian home, every Australian school and every Australian workplace where that is possible.


Those opposite agree that fibre is the endgame, that fibre to the premises is where we all need to get to eventually; they just do not want to do the necessary work to get it done now. Their plan is to build fibre to a box in the street and then use the old and failing copper network to connect to homes and businesses, delivering maximum speeds of just 25 megabits per second. If anyone wants fibre to the home badly enough, they can simply pay for it themselves—assuming they have a spare $5,000 sitting in their kitty—and then, in ten or 15 years time, when they realise that we actually need fibre to the premises, some future government can simply deal with the mammoth task of rebuilding the network. It is that simple, according to those opposite.


The NBN policy of the Abbott government is nonsensical. It may save some costs now, but the long-term costs of their plan will far outstrip those of Labor's plan. There is a saying: 'Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today.' But obviously those opposite have never heard it, because putting off until tomorrow what should be done now is their modus operandi. It is how they are responding to climate change—do nothing now and let our children deal with the consequences in the future. And it is how they are planning on building the NBN—do half the job now and let our children deal with the rest. It is simply not good enough. Labor want to do this right, and we want to do it right the first time.


I would now like to talk about the effect the coalition's dud policy is having in my electorate. Some suburbs in the neighbouring electorate of Fraser were lucky enough to be high on the NBN rollout list. Right now, Canberrans in Casey, Ngunnawal, Amaroo, Gungahlin, Palmerston and Franklin, and businesses in Mitchell, are accessing the fastest internet speeds in the country—and they love it. In fact, these northern Canberra suburbs have had the highest NBN take-up rate in the country. There are schools in the north of Canberra who have their Japanese classes taught via video link from Japan and there are Canberrans who can access a medical specialist without leaving their homes. Those lucky northern Canberrans are realising the potential of the NBN every day. 


However, just 20 kilometres south, in my electorate of Canberra, things are not so rosy. Large parts of Canberra were on the cusp of receiving the NBN prior to the election. Construction was due to begin in Kambah, Wanniassa, Mawson, Farrer and surrounding suburbs in September this year. However, when the coalition took office that construction was halted. The coalition has created a digital divide here in Canberra. While Canberrans north of the lake are already reaping the rewards that the NBN brings, those south of the lake now do not know if they ever will. By stopping the NBN mid-rollout, the coalition has created digital divides like this all over the country. Houses on one side of a road have fibre to the premises, while houses on the other side will have to pay up to $5,000 for the privilege. I wonder if the coalition has properly thought through the ramifications of these digital divides.


Why, for example, would a business choose to set up operations in the industrial suburb of Hume, in my electorate of Canberra, when they could set up in the industrial suburb of Mitchell, in the electorate of Fraser, where they will have fibre to the premises? Why would a parent send their child to the local school, which does not have fibre connected, when the school in the next suburb does? It is not so far-fetched to imagine that this digital divide could have an impact on real estate prices. Real estate ads in the future could read: 'Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, double lock-up garage and fibre to the premises.' With this digital divide, some people on one side of the road might have to pay up to $5,000 to connect fibre to their home, when a house on the other side of the road that they could potentially be looking at already has fibre to the home.


The coalition's policy is not just inferior to Labor's, it is also inequitable. It simply is not fair. Australians want a fibre to the premises NBN. As the shadow minister said today, Australians certainly did not vote for the coalition because of its NBN policy. In fact, they probably voted for the coalition in spite of its NBN policy. Just last week, a constituent of mine, Stephen Kelly, delivered a petition to me with 270,640 signatures calling for a fibre to the premises NBN. Labor is listening to Australians on this issue—why isn't the government? Japan, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are all investing in fibre to the premises—why aren't we? This government is putting Australians at a disadvantage. We are being left behind with a second-class, second-rate broadband network.


There is bipartisan support for the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013 because both sides recognise the importance of communications infrastructure and connectedness. Prime Minister Abbott has promised to be the infrastructure Prime Minister and he has promised to build the infrastructure Australia needs for the 21st century. Why then is he walking away from the most important infrastructure project of the 21st century? It is simply inexplicable.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:42):  I am pleased to stand to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013 and the amendments moved by the shadow Treasurer. Submarine cables have been around for a while, as a previous speaker said. In fact, they were first laid in the 1850s, long before we were talking about fibre. They went to fibre in the 1980s, when fibre was found to be the best, fastest, most long-lived and expandable option.


I have to say that it is probably just as well that the current minister was not the minister then, because I suspect we would have stayed with copper at that time, or perhaps gone fibre to the low watermark and copper from there. Instead of that, we have an extraordinary submarine cable network around the world that allows for the transmission of data and communications between continents at an incredibly rapid rate with the highest possible standard of technology. We heard the minister speak about the wonders of fibre when it comes to submarine cable protection, but we have also heard him in many forums talk about the fact that, once that fibre gets to Australia an old, ageing copper network is good enough.


I want to talk today about how the minister's decision not to go with fibre to the home affects some of the people and the small businesses in my electorate. I want to talk first about a young woman in my electorate called Gretta. She is an extraordinary young woman. She has cerebral palsy. She has very little movement. She is very smart. When I first met her, she had just graduated from high school and she wanted to go to university but was having trouble because she could not get there—she needed quite sophisticated transport because of the weight of her chair. We managed to fix that with some personal plans, which we introduced as a federal government. But Gretta talked at length about the dreams that she had as a young woman, and the thing that I learned from Gretta is that, for people like her, we are at a point in time which is like an alignment of the planets.


Gretta, like so many young people around the country, has an iPad. It has the brand-new swipe technology which Gretta, even with her limited movement, can use; in fact, she operates it with her nose. She has wi-fi on her chair and, when she is at various places around the city, she can actually communicate verbally through her iPad. It is quite remarkable. And I have seen four- and five-year-old children who are not verbal do the same thing with iPads. It is this new technology which the commercial world has provided which changes the ability of a person in such circumstances to communicate and puts them on a completely different playing field to the one they were on before. On top of that, there is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which provides a person like Gretta with the opportunity for flexibility in the way her support is given—and her decision to use that support to go to university is an example of that. 


And then there is the possibility of fibre to the home. For a person like Gretta, that gives her smart-house technology. It gives her back-to-base monitoring. It allows her to turn on her air-conditioning. It allows her to open her front door without having to ask her mum to do it for her. It provides a level of independence in ways that we really have not thought of yet because we are just coming to terms with the possibilities of fibre-to-the-home technology.


If those three things come together, it means the life that a person like Gretta, or a person born tomorrow in Gretta's circumstances, will live will be profoundly different from the life that Gretta has had until now. These are life-changing years that Australia faces at the moment for people like Gretta and for many, many others. The possibility of delivering speech therapy to people in regional areas, Auslan interpreters in schools in remote towns, back-to-base monitoring of medical conditions—there are an incredible range of possibilities that the NBN could provide to a whole range of people that would profoundly change their lives.


The election of the Liberal government and their extraordinary short-sightedness in believing that the copper network will do anything like this is a real blow to a whole range of people whose lives could be profoundly different if this government went along with the kinds of decisions that governments overseas are taking.


We can also see, of course, the many opportunities for business in Australia if we had fibre to the home. All over the world, in markets much bigger than ours, governments are getting ahead of us in terms of broadband speeds, and when that happens there is innovation from a whole range of people who dream—from entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers and just people in their houses. My neighbour has turned his house into a 'cloud' now, because the NBN actually reached his suburb. He has now created a cloud business in his home. The emergence of cloud style businesses and software all around the world is an indication that the rest of the world is taking on a situation where people can communicate with each other through fibre from wherever they are.


We talked about this in business 35 or 40 years ago. In fact, in the late eighties, I gave a few lectures on the possibility of fibre and I ducted my business, when we renovated, for fibre. I was ready! But we talked then about the possibility of people in one country working alongside people in another, of businesses literally crossing the oceans through fibre—under the oceans and into our homes and businesses—and allowing a form of collaboration and a level of entrepreneurial activity which we are yet to see but we are just beginning to get to. The development of this cloud based software is an indication that that is the way the world is going.


In a country the size of Australia, if we go down the Liberal path, where it is fibre to the home if you can afford it but not for the rest, we will not get the critical mass that will drive the innovation from our entrepreneurs and our businesses that will allow Australia to be part of this new world. It is not right that this government thinks it is okay that we import the best ideas from the rest of the world but do not provide circumstances in Australia where businesses can develop their own. In fact, for a government that believes it has a plan for the future and believes it is about business to turn its back on one of the biggest growth areas for business in the world is quite extraordinary.


You can see that, even dealing with businesses now. I recently drove down the highway towards Cooma, heading to a state park for a bit of a camping weekend, and I drove through a small town called Bemboka. I stopped at an art gallery not far off the main road—this is a main road between two reasonable sized centres not far from Canberra—where I decided to buy some pieces of pottery that a local potter had made, and the poor man that owned the gallery took half an hour to get his credit card machine to work by mobile. He ended up going out into the yard to get a signal that would last long enough to do a credit card transaction so that I could buy something. I stayed there for half an hour after I had decided what to buy. That is how long it took to buy it. What chance does that business have? That business, by the way, is two kilometres from the main road, so I think perhaps his connection charge would be slightly more than the $5,000 average that we are hearing about. But what chance does that business have—what chance does that community have, actually—to grow in the modern world, when you cannot easily do a credit card transaction in your small business, in a town a couple of hours from Canberra on a main road? That is an outrageous position to be in.


For a government that pretends to care about regional areas, not to have fibre to the home as its priority is quite extraordinary. People who live in regional areas a long way from the footpath, a long way from that box, will have to find thousands of dollars in order to connect to what should be a right in this country. We have an incredibly short-sighted government which does not seem to understand the possibilities of this new technology. It seems to think that all we are talking about is what we already do with our slow speeds—movies, a bit of texting, a bit of communication, a bit of skyping. That is not the world we are entering. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about making sure that entrepreneurs and businesses in this country can take advantage of who we are. We are one of the great innovative countries of the world. We produce scientific papers and inventions above our weight. We are extraordinary thinkers. We are flexible and we problem solve in an extraordinary way. We are not as good at investing in ourselves, but we come up with answers at a rate that the rest of the world does not. We are an exceptionally inventive country.


At a time when the world is becoming increasingly connected and true globalisation—which is that your inputs, labour, everything , particularly in the service economy, comes from wherever it is and is linked through modern technology into a virtual business—is beginning to happen in a real way around the world, just look at who we are. Come to my electorate, any of you, and you will see an area where there is not a single language we do not speak. We speak every language in Parramatta. There is not a country we do not know; there is not a culture we are not familiar with; there is not a city we cannot drive through without a map. We have a population in this country that can work and collaborate with people in any country in the world. The only thing that stops us from doing that to the full extent of our capacity is our slow, outdated communications technology. 


It is quite shameful that the previous Liberal government did not act on this, that in 13 years the previous Liberal government did not consider that it was important to upgrade our technology in the way we needed to. It is particularly shameful now, when the rest of the world is moving so fast in this area, that our newly elected government, which thinks it is for the future and thinks it represents small business, does not bother to make sure that we have the technology we need to benefit from who we are. 


Also, we are sitting on the edge of the fastest growing region in the world. There is no doubt that, just as our northern neighbours are starting to overtake us in their focus on education, they are also overtaking us in the speed of communications technology and the accessibility of it to their populations. In a very short period it will become apparent even to those opposite that we will have squandered the time that we need to make sure we are in the most competitive position. I would ask the government to consider seriously the approach it is taking to this incredibly important area.


I come from an arts background. For me, it is never about what you can do; it is not even about what you can imagine; it is about making sure that you strive for things you cannot yet imagine; it is about making sure that the people with the smartest minds, with the greatest ideas and with the greatest of entrepreneurial flair can use those talents for the benefit of the community. On this side of the House we know that the Grettas of the world need this technology to live a better life. We know that the entrepreneurs in this country, the small businesses in this country, the inventors, the scientists and my neighbour with his new cloud based business all need this technology in order to use who they are for their own benefit and for the benefit of this nation. 


It is great to talk about submarine cables and it is a really terrific that they are the highest technology and the best quality we can get; that takes it to our shores and connects the businesses that are big enough to afford to be near big cities where they can benefit from the high speed. There are many others in this country who have much more to offer as we move into this new age. It is about time the government opposite made sure that they are supported in those endeavours.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:57):  A number of my comments are going to be very similar to those of the member for Parramatta because I too was very interested to read the history lesson we were given by the minister on the submarine cables that join Australia with the rest of the world. I remember when coaxial cables came in. I can remember, as a kid, listening to the cricket and that swishing sound which I used to think was the sound of the waves over the cable. I now understand that that is not the case and that it was in fact in-cable amplifiers which caused that noise. As the member for Parramatta said, the minister rightly spoke of the importance of the new technology of fibre optic cable that came into being in the 1980s. Even though that was at a time well before the internet, it was felt to be very important to use the latest technology. Our economy was growing and we were growing numerically, with an increasing amount of data to transmit.


But I think we are seeing some irony here. The minister went on to pontificate about his decision. While we are going to have first-class connections to the international community, once the cables hit Australia the data is going to be zooming around on 20th-century technology. I found it interesting that the minister would not be the slightest bit embarrassed by that juxtaposition and that he would indeed use his second reading speech to promote the benefits of fibre to the node.


I am going to talk about some of the reasons I think the minister is going to find it extremely difficult to meet his commitments. We all know about the inadequacy of us being confined to download speeds of 25 megabits per second, but I think the minister faces a very profound difficulty in implementing even that vision. That difficulty is the status of the copper wire network. The government has estimated that they might have to replace something of the order of seven per cent to 10 per cent of the copper network after the node point. But that appears to be a calculation with no substance behind it. It is literally a back-of-the-envelope calculation and it does not stand up against my experience of the situation in my electorate. 


When the government says, 'We can deliver the NBN more cheaply,' that whole claim rests on the idea that in 90 to 93 per cent of cases it will be possible to use the copper network to go from the node to the premises. But that is, as I said, based on a calculation that has no support. No matter where you look to see where that calculation came from, there is absolutely no support for it. Where is the documentation? Where are the figures? Where is the support for that estimate? No matter where you look, you cannot find it. In reality, there is grave uncertainty about whether that copper network is fit for purpose. 


In 2004 Telstra themselves were prepared to acknowledge the state of their copper network. At the Senate committee inquiry into broadband competition, Dr Tony Warren, then the group manager of regulatory strategy, said:


I think it is right to suggest that ADSL is an interim technology. It is probably the last sweating, if you like, of the old copper network assets. In copper years, if you like, we are at a sort of transition—we are at five minutes to midnight. 


Telstra went on to explain that they thought, at that stage, that the copper network had perhaps another 10 years of life in it. That was 2004. Next year we come to the end of that 10-year period, yet we are now about to embark on a re-visioning of our national broadband network which relies on that copper network, a network which, in the words of its owners, is on its way out. In the words of its owners, it is reaching the very last of its life. 


The experience from my electorate confirms just that. I will focus on the suburb of Bedford, a suburb about seven or eight kilometres from the CBD that was principally built in the 1930s and 1940s. In Bedford, even for telephony the copper network is incapable, in many instances, of providing a reliable service. Breakdown of lines and the discontinuation of landline services happens with great regularity. In the vast majority of that suburb, it is not possible to even get ADSL2. You cannot subscribe to ADSL2. Resident after resident with very slow ADSL has reported that even that regularly drops out. It drops out as often as every half-hour, making it virtually impossible to work from home. 


We have had many technicians from the area come in and explain the problem with the network to us—that there is simply no redundancy left in the system. Pretty much all of the pairs have been consumed. It is just not possible to give any upgrades in speed, because there is not enough capacity on the network. This is compounded by very poor maintenance. The lines in this area—and, on the evidence, I am sure this is the case right across Perth—have been very poorly maintained. 


It is extraordinary that the minister was talking today about how he is actually going to be prioritising those areas. He is going to be doing some work on assessing the capacity of the network across Australia and prioritising for a future rollout. But there does not seem to be any information available from Telstra on exactly what the condition of the network is. I find it extraordinary that a company that has had such an asset seems to have no data on the condition of that network and is unable to identify what the capacity of that network is. The prioritisation is going to have to be based on information from retailers, carriers and mobile services which cover that area. 


But one of the themes coming through from all the people who are contacting us about the very poor level of service is that, to some extent, the companies have just given up—and, as a result, those people have given up too. Complaints go completely and utterly unattended and people have, unfortunately, just learned to live with it. They have been told by their service providers: 'Look, do not worry us. We are waiting for the NBN rollout. When the NBN rollout comes, we will be able to do something, but in the interim there is nothing we can do.'


If you have a plan that is based on using a copper network that is simply not capable of supporting in any reliable way even an eight megahertz transmission of data, how can you support  25 or 29 or whatever it is that the Minister for Communications is promising? It is simply not going to be capable of that. The cost of attempting to remediate the system is going to end up totally changing the cost differential. The minister has made so much of the fact that his project is much less costly, but it is only much less costly if you have a copper network that is capable of sustaining what he believes it can. All of the evidence that we have had to date tells us that that is extremely unlikely and that we have a five-minutes-to-midnight network. 


There is also going to be a considerable problem in timing—in designing this new system, in designing the location of the nodes. This is not something that can be done overnight. This, one would imagine, would be at least an 18-month or two-year task. There is simply no way that this system is going to be in place in 2016, as promised. It is physically not going to be possible to do the comprehensive redesign of that whole system and at the same time get it built. The promises we have been made are that it is going to be cheaper and they can get it out faster. We are going to get a second-rate product, we are going to get a 20th century product, but don't worry, it is like fast food—like going to Kentucky Fried rather than waiting around for a nice, well-cooked meal. Go and get your Kentucky Fried and be happy about that. I think we will see that even the KFC of broadband is not going to be deliverable. It is a second-class product. 




Mr Tudge:
  What have you got against KFC?




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  I do eat KFC; I quite like it. We all like rubbish from time to time, but I would not want to see us spending $35 billion on a rubbish network. 




Mr Tudge:
  You would prefer to spend $70 billion.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  The point I am making is that we were delivering a 21st century product. We were delivering a product that was going to be capable of doing what it was supposed to. You have some profound technological challenges in delivering even this very modest fraudband that you are proposing, and I think you have completely and utterly underestimated the difficulty you are going to have delivering over the copper network.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:10):  by leave—I note that the member for Perth was talking about copper, and of course the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill is about submarine cables. As I was about to say earlier, Australia's regime has been praised as a global best practice example for the protection of submarine cables by the International Cable Protection Committee and APEC. While terror attacks on submarine cables have been relatively minimal and there is no shortage of infrastructure that terrorists may attack, fibre-optic cables hold a symbolic appeal, being the vehicle that delivers cyberspace to the masses worldwide and also the conduit for global financial transactions.


While it is likely for now that cable damage will simply remain accidental and rare, the coalition recognises that it is important to remain ready and proactive to ensure that the practice does not become a serious infrastructure threat. The coalition stands ready to advance the infrastructure required for the digital age.


I understand that while I was not in the chamber the member for Greenway took the opportunity to quote statements I had made previously about the NBN. I want to place it very clearly on the record that I have always supported a national broadband network. I have never supported Labor's version of NBN Co., which is a disgrace. It is a white elephant costing the Australian people billions of dollars more than it should. I refer, as the member for Greenway did, back to my days on the Brisbane City Council. We worked for many years on a business model. We proofed up that business model; we developed a financial model. We trialled the business model and we trialled a practical example of laying fibre across the city. We went out to tender. The grand cost, the great cost of fibring the whole of the Brisbane City Council area, was going to be covered by private enterprise, not by government. We were going to offer a ubiquitous broadband network across the city at no cost to the ratepayers of Brisbane.


What did the Brisbane City Council do when we heard that the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Rudd, had had a little thought bubble? We contacted Ministers Conroy and Albanese and offered them copies of our business model and our financial model. The response was silence—they were not interested in something that had taken more than six years to develop, that had been tested and proved; they were not interested in working with us to deliver a network at no cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country. No, they preferred to spend $64 billion—plus, plus—on a project that was never going to work. I support a national broadband network; what I do not support is the absolute waste that the Labor government inflicted on the taxpayers of Australia and that future generations would have had to pay off. It is an absolute disaster and the service would be much better delivered by the private sector. Unfortunately we are too far down the track for that. I condemn the opposition for the appalling model that they developed and for their refusal to work with people like the Brisbane City Council. In fact, the minister at the time threatened to write retrospective legislation to stop us delivering our system. That was the sort of attitude this opposition had when they were in government. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-04,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (18:14):  I rise to make some brief remarks on the Telecommunications (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. The Greens generally support the principle behind this bill, but will refer it to a Senate committee for inquiry. We will do this for several reasons: first, to ensure that the results of the statutory review undertaken by ACMA five years after the 2005 legislation are adequate; second, to review the decisions taken by the government in addition to the outcomes of the review.


The Greens appreciate the extent to which Australia's connection to the world is dependent upon the security of telecommunications transmitted on submarine cables and wants them to be protected. As a May 2013 Australian Strategic Policy Institute paper noted, five main international cables, each not much thicker than a common garden hose, connect Australia to cyberspace and global voice networks, making them vital to our communications, economic prosperity and national security. The ASPI report noted that the AFP is responsible for compliance with the laws but indicated in the review process that they do not have the resources to monitor the cables in maritime zones. AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the FMA provide some surveillance, but these agencies, as well as the cable owners, indicated in the review process that monitoring arrangements were unsatisfactory. It is unclear whether these issues have been dealt with in the bill.


New Zealand apparently does better in this regard than Australia, and perhaps we have something to learn here. These cables need protection from all the inadvertent, accidental causes of disruption, such as fishing and anchoring, as well as from attack as outlined in the bill. Our cables also require protection from tapping, which could lead to indiscriminate and unlawful access to Australian telecommunications data and content. Are the mechanisms outlined in this bill, and those already in place arising from the 2005 legislation, preventing this type of interference, and will they prevent this type of interference in the future? This is a question that we hope the Senate committee will be able to resolve.


The vulnerability of submarine cables to tapping is the subject also of recent revelations. A 7 July Washington Post article analysed the ways in which surveillance of telecommunications via fibre-optic cables on the seabed could be done through:


a seemingly mundane government power: the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to approve cable licenses.


The Washington Post piece discusses the four US submarines, fitted out for special missions, that attached listening devices on the outside of a cable's housing. Apparently, cable landing stations near or upstream from them are the likely locations for electronic copying in a way that is invisible. The Washington Post article also alleges that the licensing and permit approval processes in the US were held up essentially to allow time for lawyers from the FBI and departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to broker deals with the firms wanting to lay cables that transited the United States.


The minister acknowledged in his second reading speech that he was a director of Reach. Reach would be the Telstra and PCCW joint venture company that was compelled to enter into an agreement with the FBI in 2001 to allow access to the data transmitted by undersea cable, including billing data and stored communications of Telstra customers. In the agreement, all of this was exempted from FOI and also from the privacy laws. Protecting the security of submarine cables is a very serious issue, as the minister states, but protecting the integrity of Australia's legislated privacy protections and the human right of Australian citizens to privacy and the rule of law standards are also very serious issues.


This bill includes new powers for the Attorney-General to direct ACMA to refuse a permit on security grounds. The bill provides that ACMA must, within two days of receiving an application, inform the Attorney-General, who must then get back to ACMA with a decision within 15 days. Under section 72A, the Attorney-General must consult with the Prime Minister and the minister before deciding that an action on cable permits would be prejudicial to Australia's security. Hopefully, the Senate inquiry process will clarify what criteria the Attorney-General might use to make this determination. Given that the decision is not reviewable, what the Attorney-General needs to have regard to may need further elaboration.


The Greens are committed to ensuring that Australia's submarine cables are secure, and this is inextricably linked to ensuring that the privacy of Australians' telecommunications are protected from illegal and unsupervised surveillance.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (18:20):  You have certainly got to be quick on your feet here, but I am going to see if I can take my full time and make sure that I make all the necessary points that are required in this debate. This is an important bill. It provides for the security of Australia's submarine cable and for a whole range of measures to ensure that security and a range of related issues. I know that Labor members are supportive of the important things that need to be done in this area. There is no question in my mind that the marine cable that links Australia to the rest of the world and provides that large pipe—that window to the rest of the world—to our telecommunications and to our capacity to cooperate, link, interact and do business with the rest of the world is of vital importance. It is critical importance.


This cable is not new. It has actually been underwater for quite a number of years. It was first executed in 1946. It draws your mind, and I want to take this opportunity to speak about the cable. In the second reading speech the minister not only outlined the purpose of the bill but also decided to speak about NBN Co. and talk about the NBN. He really opened the door—or, as it were, opened the pipeline—to talk about NBN and the link between the submarine cable, which is Australia's link to the rest of the world, and NBN Co. and how we link homes to the rest of the world. And I couldn't help but think—I just had this image in my mind—back to the 1940s when this was first dreamed up. That was quite a long time ago, Mr Deputy Speaker—and longer for some than others—but in 1940 they must have been sitting around and talking about the future. I am sure there was no-one, in 1940—in the Menzies government then—who could have imagined just what might be possible with an internet connection or an underwater cable. I can just imagine that, if they had had the same principles, or the same concept, as the Liberal Party does today, many decades later, they would have said: 'Look, we are going to run this cable. We are going to go to all this expense'—it must have been an enormous expense and an enormous undertaking to lay such a cable to Australia—but they would have said: 'Do you know what? We are just going to run the cable. It is going to be fibre to the coast, and that is as far as it goes. Once it gets to the coast, that is it. The rest of you are on your own. If you want to hook into it, you can rock up to the beach, bring your little connection kit, and you can find a way—dig your own trench, hook up your own little bit of copper, and you can get yourself connected to the rest of the world.' Can you imagine what would have been going through the minds of people in the government, in the parliament or around the country, back in the 1940s, if that were to have been the case? Of course, it was not the case—because back then they could see the future even if they did not know what it would look like.


Today we have the opposite. Today, we have some sense of what the future might look like, because our eyes have been opened to the vast potential that exists through our communications, through the internet and through large fibre-optic cables—but we have a government that does the exact opposite. It wants to close that loop. It wants to squeeze and strangle the optic-fibre cable and it wants—and I cannot understand this for the life of me—to make it as hard as possible for people to connect. They are not running fibre to the home, which guarantees you that right in front of your door, whether you connect today, tomorrow, next year or the year after, the connection is there—right to your home: that is where the future exists; right at your front door, when you can connect. Instead, the Liberal Party in government wants to just run fibre to the node—just to down the street to some central point, a bit like if we ran the submarine cable to the coast and just left it there. I can imagine it flopping around on the beach, like an eel, just sitting there on the coast. And then people could come along later; it would be open slather, you could get a contractor to come in and run some cable for you—connect to the coast.



Government members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  Exactly. I would find it pretty funny too, because it would be funny—if it were not true, and if it were not exactly what the Liberal Party is doing today. They are just running the fibre to the coast. If you want to come—

In the 21st century, we need to consider some of the most important things that this parliament will do, not for us, not for our kids, not even for our grandkids, but for the very far distant future—things that we can do today; things that will cost a lot today but will deal with the things that we need to do in the future. It is a bit like when I am in Brisbane and, say, driving over the Story Bridge or looking at some of the things that were built back in the 1920s. I can imagine, back in the 1920s—and it is a little bit like with the submarine cable—when they were building the eight-lane Story Bridge, that some people would have said: 'Why would you need eight lanes on this bridge?', when it was still cart-and-buggy days, and there would have been enough room to fit 20 carts across the bridge. But somebody back then had the good foresight to be able to say: 'But in the future, we will need something much bigger than we can dream of today.'


When I think of connection to the internet, I don't think dial-up 50Kbps, I don't think ADSL—I don't even think ADSL2; I think, what is the largest possible connection I can get so that I can do business with the rest of the world? And it is not so much about what I can do; I think, what are the possibilities? What can others do? I remember at a debate during the election campaign—and this demonstrates the quality of the debate on this—a Liberal party candidate who was debating and laughing at the NBN. He was laughing that it was available at his mother's home. His mother was in her 90s, and he said, 'and she can't even use a computer'. And I thought, you have really missed the point, haven't you? It is not about whether your 90-year-old-plus mother can use a computer, or whether she can have an internet connection to the rest of the world in her home. It is about what her doctors can provide in terms of medical assistance, through—what is now more commonplace—alert devices like wristbands that can alert a doctor, through a wi-fi internet connection in the home, if there is a problem with your 90-year-old-plus mother. But if you can't see that, and if you can't see the future today, how can you possibly see the future tomorrow? More than anything, that is what troubles me about where this government is taking us. They are taking us back to the future. They still dream of the white picket fence of the 50s. They still dream of an era when things were much slower and kinder—which is why we have the Prime Minister speaking at the rate that he does. But the reality is that we have bigger things to do. If we are going to be debating bills on things as important as submarine cables and about our connection to the rest of the world and what that can produce for our country and for our economy, then surely the next logical step—just one step further—is to ask: once you get it to the beach—fibre to the coast—aren't you going to take it somewhere else? 


I would say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in your electorate—and a fine electorate it is, Maranoa—there is a whole range of regional and rural people and people on farms who have got it. They have got it; they understand what it means to be able to deliver real-time weather information. They understand what it means for their kids to be able to access educational information around the world that would otherwise not be available to them. And they understand what it means for their businesses, be it farming, supply chain businesses or others, to be part of a global supply chain, to understand markets better, and to get real-time information. And it is not only real-time information to their home but also on their mobile devices while they are riding around on their ag bikes tending to their stock. This is much deeper than whether it is a Labor, Liberal, or some other ideological bent about the NBN. It is about the future of the Australian economy. The sad thing is that we have seen the member for Wentworth come into this place with a policy which is discredited—across any reputable area, by any reputable economist, by anybody in engineering terms. They don't even call it NBN-lite anymore, because it is not even on the same planet. It is NBN-to-a-few, at best. He might want to wax lyrical in this place about the numbers of take ups and where it has been rolled out, but it is about planning for the future. When this marine cable was planned in 1940, I am sure they were not waxing too lyrical about the take-up rate in 1945 or 1942, but they saw to the future again. 


I want to draw a few connections between things that are going on in this country. Low-income superannuation contribution might have nothing to do with this bill, but there is a link between it and what is happening here: National Party electorates in particular are copping the biggest hits. National Party electorates across this country have been dudded the most by the Liberal Party as to how many people will lose out on Labor's low-income superannuation contribution. And when it comes to NBN and the connection to the rest of the world, who is it that misses out the most? People in seats in Central Queensland and along the Queensland coast—seats like Herbert, Dickson, Dawson, Capricornia and Leichhardt—who are going to miss out on NBN. Those were the areas on the map for the next phase of the NBN rollout, which is going into the ground right now, but they are being ignored. Those on the other side can laugh and carry on. Their idea of the future is what they are having for lunch tomorrow, and not what might be happening to our great grandchildren or our economy in the future. This is not a debate about the election cycle; it is about an economic cycle; it is about telecommunications; it is about the industries of the future. Those industries are not horse and buggy whips—that might have been what you were considering in the run up to the election, but it is not what we are considering today.


They had more foresight in 1940 when they were laying these marine cables than this government has today, despite the greater opportunity for insight about what the future might bring. It is disappointing that in my electorate where we had maps, agreements and the next phase of rollouts in places like Bellbird Park, Augustine Heights, Ellen Grove, Gailes, Wacol, Carole Park—working-class suburbs with a large component of commercial and business operations. Those business people want this in the ground, because they want to hook in immediately and they do not want to wait for it to be at the node. They want it right at their front door. In a thriving new satellite city like greater Springfield it is not just about being a great place to live but about business and education—it already has dark optic fibre to its universities, TAFEs and schools, because the developers had foresight. They said a decade ago, 'If Telstra won't put in optic fibre, we'll take a punt with our own money and run our own cable.' And so there is dark optic fibre cable directly to the university, to the Springfield centre for commercial purposes and to some of the suburbs, because the developers understood what the future could provide and understood the value proposition of providing that to everyone's front door. That has produced incredible dividends for commerce and business. Let me tell you that the Springfield Chamber of Commerce is an absolute advocate and supporter of this technology, because they use it. People who live in Brookwater were very lucky to be able to access optic fibre to the home very early on. Those who run a home business in that suburb know the competitive advantage they have. They understand it in the same way as those who were laying the marine cable in 1940. They did not merely run it to the beach and leave it there for somebody else to do something with later. They said: 'We're going to go all the way with this, because we know what this represents. We know the next step we have to take.' 


I cannot say enough about the missed opportunity that this government has now delivered to all Australians. The time will come when there is no option but to take up the technology. Everything we do now is based on a higher need, a bigger pipe, greater access. A decade or so ago it might have been okay to be on dial-up. Some here might still remember those funny, clicky sounds when you dialled in. It was also a really frustrating sound. No-one could possibly use that today, because our systems no longer match to that. We need optic fibre to the home in the same way we need the big pipe. Whether it is infrastructure of a more technical nature like this or old-school infrastructure like bridges, roads or ports, you have to build in a bit of spare capacity. You have to look to the future. That is why we on this side will always be supporting the development of NBN to the home—it is in the national interest. While we will be supporting this bill, it does point to the failure of this government.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (18:35):  I am rising to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. It is designed to protect the integrity, operation and security of submarine cables that are critical in providing telecommunications services between our continent and the rest of the globe. There has been a longstanding regime for protecting these cables. In fact, we are one of the few countries in the world that has a regime in place to do just this. These cables have been in place for decades and the regime has been there to support their continued and efficient operation. About three years ago, the ACMA—the Australian Communications and Media Authority—reviewed aspects of the regime, and the review recommended a number of actions that the minister spoke to when he introduced the legislation to the House. Notably, it ensures consistency between our cable protection regime and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It provides a structured process for the consideration of matters within the Attorney-General's portfolio concerning submarine cable installation and permit applications. It also enables significant domestic submarine cables or cables that connect two places within our nation to be brought under the regime and to be protected. It will streamline permit processes that govern installation. Finally, the bill contains some administrative and technical amendments.


The bill takes on greater importance when we consider how businesses are starting to respond to the demand for cable capacity. It is not surprising that, as more and more people and businesses begin to move into the online world, they are effectively transferring the way in which they operate from analog to digital—digitising businesses, creating demand for data, downloading more data and producing more data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the 12 months to December 2012, in relation to fixed line internet access, download of data had grown at a rate of about 63 per cent. I have often quoted the fact that, on figures that I have seen, the amount of data that is expected to be produced globally will increase by a phenomenal 4,300 per cent. The pressure is well and truly on for us to have the ability to transmit that data. So these cables are critical, particularly in linking us into servers based in other continents, and having this protection is vital.


In his second reading speech the Minister for Communications said that this bill was important in a wider context. He broadened the scope of his contribution and focus to state:


But connectedness is not just about ensuring our submarine cables—


which are the focus of the bill—


or satellite links or even backhaul fibre are of a high standard—it is just as much about ensuring that Australian mums and dads, school kids or small business people can take advantage of the resources and opportunities of the internet. 


That then gave him a platform to broaden his discussion and, amazingly, to say that the government could claim that they are delivering a better National Broadband Network. Their definition of 'better' is not to use one of the best platforms available to deliver data, which is fibre-optic cable. Their view of a better national broadband network is to rely on copper as the platform of the future—a technology that has been used for 100 years. I heard the member for Perth in her contribution quoting Telstra executives who, some time ago, had said that they were sweating the last moments of the copper network. This is what the member for Wentworth has championed within his party as the way of the future—copper. It is not NBN-lite, it is NBN-dull, because it will slow down the ability to download data. 


More importantly, as has often been reflected when it comes to issues involving the internet and broadband in this country, it is not just about download speeds but about upload capacity. In terms of the tech sector in Australia being able to conduct its work, to innovate, this is the focus for the future. We are being condemned with a fibre-to-the-node proposal that will dull down the ability of Australians to get better speeds on both download and upload. The minister in his speech stated:


… we have committed to prioritising the NBN rollout in areas with the poorest services so that those who currently cannot connect, or have the poorest speeds, get fast broadband sooner. 


The Sydney Morning Heraldreviewed the minister's plan in an article entitled 'Turnbull's broadband plan too slow, too late'. The minister says that this is the plan that will see those who suffer with the poorest services, those who cannot connect, getting fast broadband sooner. 


The minister knows of my long-running advocacy on behalf of residents in areas of the Chifley electorate that have been condemned with poor service. When the coalition was last in government it attempted 20 times to improve broadband and failed. For instance, residents of Woodcroft in my electorate suffered for ages. They were never going to see a fibre connection established from the Blacktown exchange. They were condemned with an overloaded copper network. In this residential estate there had been no plan for a better network. These residents had been condemned with poor service.


In his second reading speech on this bill, the minister reflected on the fact that he had been to Blacktown in the Chifley electorate, and he said that this was an area where Telstra HFC and Optus HFC cable existed. Yes, it did. HFC exists in Sydney and Melbourne. It was not widely opened up for household consumers to access broadband. It was primarily used as a method of delivering Foxtel signals, but it was not opened up for people to access internet services.


As a result of advocacy undertaken by me in conjunction with residents of Woodcroft, we were able to work with Telstra to open up areas of the cable broadband network in parts of Woodcroft as an interim measure while we waited for the NBN. The NBN was able to be rolled out in Woodcroft because it fell within a fibre footprint area which, as we announced in July 2010, allowed Woodcroft—as a result of advocating on their behalf and pushing for them to get broadband—to be included in the three-year roll-out plan. Residents of Woodcroft were finally able to see a ray of light that would let them access better internet services, because they knew the NBN was rolling out. In the interim we opened up cable broadband in parts of that suburb, which improved service dramatically, as well as an investment in ADSL Top Hat, which saw capacity for ADSL, particularly ADSL2, being offered to residents. What happened? 


Again, the minister says he is looking at prioritising the rollout of broadband in areas that have had the poorest connections. When the government announced their updated maps for their NBN rollout plan a few weeks ago, one of the mostly poorly served broadband network areas, Woodcroft, was completely dropped off the revised figures. The member for Wentworth went to the election claiming that every construction contract would be honoured, but he never had the courage or the decency to say that he was going to alter that commitment and break that promise once in government.


The member for Wentworth basically manufactured a deception on people who were expecting the NBN. He changed the terms. He said he would only honour contracts where the build instruction had been issued, thereby robbing residents of Woodcroft and Doonside, who were expecting to be connected to the NBN and had been waiting for years to get better broadband. They had been denied better broadband by the Howard government and now they are being ripped off by the Abbott government. This is from a person who makes a big deal of the fact that he can catch public transport and go out to Blacktown and say, 'There's HFC out here.' He has a great sense of theatre. He does not have a lot of modesty, but there are a lot of theatrical elements to the minister, the member for Wentworth. He talked about the fact that people could access HFC. In actual fact, if you hop online and try to access HFC services in the areas he looked at, you will see that not all the providers provide HFC access to the HFC network. So, clearly, he has not even done his homework. Frankly, I would not expect much from a Minister for Communications who advocates copper as a basis for rolling out better broadband services into the future. You are not really a fair dinkum communications minister if you think that that is the thing that you need to advocate for improving broadband in this country.


The member for Wentworth has ripped off Woodcroft residents. Those residents have complained bitterly about being left off the map. They do not deserve this shabby treatment from the member for Wentworth. He came out during the federal election to try to snare votes. He then made a promise about improving broadband services. He broke his promise after manufacturing a deception on the residents of Western Sydney. Then he slunk back to Bondi, which, funnily enough, has way better connection then the residents of Western Sydney are entitled to enjoy.




Mr Tudge:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Is the member for Chifley willing to give way?




Mr HUSIC:
  No. I am not interested in playing the game with the member for Aston, who probably has better broadband services for his constituents while we are fighting to get improved services for residents in my area.



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Why don't you go and speak to the member for Macquarie, who was present when we were turning on broadband services in our part of Western Sydney. He was quite happy to see that. Maybe even go and see the member for Herbert, who was getting NBN services turned on in his electorate as well.


Woodcroft residents do not deserve this treatment. When I was fighting for better connections for Woodcroft residents, Malcolm Turnbull, speaking on the problems that were being experienced by residents I represent, said:


… the Government now cannot get its wholly-owned taxpayer-funded monopoly to prioritize the neediest areas …


This was referring to Woodcroft in a speech that he made to a Young Liberals conference. He said:


That would be a travesty of social justice from a party that so loudly claims to believe in it.


So it is good enough for him in opposition to hold up Woodcroft and say that it is a travesty of social justice for them to not get broadband. It is good enough for him to come in here and pretend that he has some sort of concern when he quotes his visits to Blacktown in his speech on this bill. Yet the minute he gets into government he makes a decision that rips off those residents, and he does not have the guts or the decency to ensure that those residents get better service.


Instead, he is a man with a plan. His plan is to just conduct a review. It is a review that he says is very objective but is being conducted by a mate with whom he owns a yacht. I am sure that this review is going to be very objective! Is a mate who he has had for some time going to have the guts to stand up to Malcolm Turnbull and tell him where he has gone wrong with his broadband plan which, as I say, has already been slammed for being too slow and too late and will result in 30 per cent less revenue because it will be providing slower speeds? Yet we are supposed to be expecting to see some sort of fair dinkum outcome from this strategic review that is already late. No doubt it will be crunched through the minister's office. I would be interested to see how the review that goes into the minister's office looks after it leaves the office.


The fact of the matter is that they have to reach—off the top of my head—nine million premises by June 2016. I read an estimate that that means they would have to pass 12,000 homes or establish 12,000 connections a day. It will be interesting to see if the minister, the member for Wentworth, makes that mark. But he should have the decency to stand up and honour the commitments and the concerns that he put when he visited Blacktown and spoke about Woodcroft residents. They do not deserve to be dudded.


Debate adjourned.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:32):  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. For many, I am sure, submarine cables may not be the most captivating topic—but it should be, particularly when we think about the important role that they play in connecting us with the rest of the world. 


Submarine cables are how Australia connects to the rest of the world. They allow us to overcome the tyranny of distance, which has so defined our past. It is probably under-appreciated, but it is submarine cables that have enabled Australia to be the vibrant, intelligent and diverse nation that we are today. Submarine cables carry the bulk of Australia's international voice and data traffic. They are quite literally what allows us to communicate and to connect with the rest of the world in real time.


In preparation for this speech, I was looking at a global map of submarine cables, and it was nothing short of a thing of beauty. The colourful lines connecting the most far flung stretches of earth could have been aeroplane or shipping routes. But the reality is that they are something far less visible that most Australians are blissfully unaware of.


Australia's geographic remoteness, the fact that we are an island nation, means that submarine cables are of vital importance to us. And in an age where communications infrastructure defines our productivity, our success and our future, submarine cables are all the more important. Damage to these cables can have a significant economic impact. Damage can easily cause service disruption. When damage occurs, it is overwhelmingly caused by something man-made. Around 70 per cent of all cable faults are caused by fishing and anchoring in depths of less than 200 metres. In Australia, where we depend on submarine cables to connect to the global telecommunications network and engage in the global digital economy society, the risks associated with cable damage are serious and significant.


This bill, which allows for the better protection of Australia's submarine cables, is therefore a very worthy one. It streamlines some of the processes to provide protection to these cables; to include submarine cables that might only link points in Australia, such as those that cross Bass Strait; and to ensure the consistency of the laws with international obligations. When those opposite persist in speaking of the need for small government, this bill is a timely reminder that it is schemes like the submarine cable protection regime that demonstrate why government regulation is important.


This bill was originally drafted by the Gillard government, and it is pleasing to see that it has maintained its bipartisan support and has been introduced by the Abbott government. The reason the bill has bipartisan support is that both sides of this House recognise that, in the 21st century, communications infrastructure is critical. Both sides of the House recognise that it is communications infrastructure that will define our economic success in the future. Those opposite recognise the need for interconnection, the need for connection and the need for connectedness. This is why it is so puzzling, so absolutely dumbfounding, that they have chosen to significantly downgrade, cut, the most important communications infrastructure project of the 21st century, the National Broadband Network.


The amendments moved by the shadow minister point out this inconsistency, this disconnect. The government has praised the rollout of international undersea fibre optic cable for being forward-looking but is not adopting the same approach to the rollout of fibre optic cable on land. The National Broadband Network is the biggest and most important infrastructure project in Australia right now, and Labor believes it should be done right. That means fibre to the premises delivering speeds of up to 100 megabits per second to every Australian home, every Australian school and every Australian workplace where that is possible.


Those opposite agree that fibre is the endgame, that fibre to the premises is where we all need to get to eventually; they just do not want to do the necessary work to get it done now. Their plan is to build fibre to a box in the street and then use the old and failing copper network to connect to homes and businesses, delivering maximum speeds of just 25 megabits per second. If anyone wants fibre to the home badly enough, they can simply pay for it themselves—assuming they have a spare $5,000 sitting in their kitty—and then, in ten or 15 years time, when they realise that we actually need fibre to the premises, some future government can simply deal with the mammoth task of rebuilding the network. It is that simple, according to those opposite.


The NBN policy of the Abbott government is nonsensical. It may save some costs now, but the long-term costs of their plan will far outstrip those of Labor's plan. There is a saying: 'Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today.' But obviously those opposite have never heard it, because putting off until tomorrow what should be done now is their modus operandi. It is how they are responding to climate change—do nothing now and let our children deal with the consequences in the future. And it is how they are planning on building the NBN—do half the job now and let our children deal with the rest. It is simply not good enough. Labor want to do this right, and we want to do it right the first time.


I would now like to talk about the effect the coalition's dud policy is having in my electorate. Some suburbs in the neighbouring electorate of Fraser were lucky enough to be high on the NBN rollout list. Right now, Canberrans in Casey, Ngunnawal, Amaroo, Gungahlin, Palmerston and Franklin, and businesses in Mitchell, are accessing the fastest internet speeds in the country—and they love it. In fact, these northern Canberra suburbs have had the highest NBN take-up rate in the country. There are schools in the north of Canberra who have their Japanese classes taught via video link from Japan and there are Canberrans who can access a medical specialist without leaving their homes. Those lucky northern Canberrans are realising the potential of the NBN every day. 


However, just 20 kilometres south, in my electorate of Canberra, things are not so rosy. Large parts of Canberra were on the cusp of receiving the NBN prior to the election. Construction was due to begin in Kambah, Wanniassa, Mawson, Farrer and surrounding suburbs in September this year. However, when the coalition took office that construction was halted. The coalition has created a digital divide here in Canberra. While Canberrans north of the lake are already reaping the rewards that the NBN brings, those south of the lake now do not know if they ever will. By stopping the NBN mid-rollout, the coalition has created digital divides like this all over the country. Houses on one side of a road have fibre to the premises, while houses on the other side will have to pay up to $5,000 for the privilege. I wonder if the coalition has properly thought through the ramifications of these digital divides.


Why, for example, would a business choose to set up operations in the industrial suburb of Hume, in my electorate of Canberra, when they could set up in the industrial suburb of Mitchell, in the electorate of Fraser, where they will have fibre to the premises? Why would a parent send their child to the local school, which does not have fibre connected, when the school in the next suburb does? It is not so far-fetched to imagine that this digital divide could have an impact on real estate prices. Real estate ads in the future could read: 'Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, double lock-up garage and fibre to the premises.' With this digital divide, some people on one side of the road might have to pay up to $5,000 to connect fibre to their home, when a house on the other side of the road that they could potentially be looking at already has fibre to the home.


The coalition's policy is not just inferior to Labor's, it is also inequitable. It simply is not fair. Australians want a fibre to the premises NBN. As the shadow minister said today, Australians certainly did not vote for the coalition because of its NBN policy. In fact, they probably voted for the coalition in spite of its NBN policy. Just last week, a constituent of mine, Stephen Kelly, delivered a petition to me with 270,640 signatures calling for a fibre to the premises NBN. Labor is listening to Australians on this issue—why isn't the government? Japan, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are all investing in fibre to the premises—why aren't we? This government is putting Australians at a disadvantage. We are being left behind with a second-class, second-rate broadband network.


There is bipartisan support for the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013 because both sides recognise the importance of communications infrastructure and connectedness. Prime Minister Abbott has promised to be the infrastructure Prime Minister and he has promised to build the infrastructure Australia needs for the 21st century. Why then is he walking away from the most important infrastructure project of the 21st century? It is simply inexplicable.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,2
"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:42):  I am pleased to stand to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013 and the amendments moved by the shadow Treasurer. Submarine cables have been around for a while, as a previous speaker said. In fact, they were first laid in the 1850s, long before we were talking about fibre. They went to fibre in the 1980s, when fibre was found to be the best, fastest, most long-lived and expandable option.


I have to say that it is probably just as well that the current minister was not the minister then, because I suspect we would have stayed with copper at that time, or perhaps gone fibre to the low watermark and copper from there. Instead of that, we have an extraordinary submarine cable network around the world that allows for the transmission of data and communications between continents at an incredibly rapid rate with the highest possible standard of technology. We heard the minister speak about the wonders of fibre when it comes to submarine cable protection, but we have also heard him in many forums talk about the fact that, once that fibre gets to Australia an old, ageing copper network is good enough.


I want to talk today about how the minister's decision not to go with fibre to the home affects some of the people and the small businesses in my electorate. I want to talk first about a young woman in my electorate called Gretta. She is an extraordinary young woman. She has cerebral palsy. She has very little movement. She is very smart. When I first met her, she had just graduated from high school and she wanted to go to university but was having trouble because she could not get there—she needed quite sophisticated transport because of the weight of her chair. We managed to fix that with some personal plans, which we introduced as a federal government. But Gretta talked at length about the dreams that she had as a young woman, and the thing that I learned from Gretta is that, for people like her, we are at a point in time which is like an alignment of the planets.


Gretta, like so many young people around the country, has an iPad. It has the brand-new swipe technology which Gretta, even with her limited movement, can use; in fact, she operates it with her nose. She has wi-fi on her chair and, when she is at various places around the city, she can actually communicate verbally through her iPad. It is quite remarkable. And I have seen four- and five-year-old children who are not verbal do the same thing with iPads. It is this new technology which the commercial world has provided which changes the ability of a person in such circumstances to communicate and puts them on a completely different playing field to the one they were on before. On top of that, there is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which provides a person like Gretta with the opportunity for flexibility in the way her support is given—and her decision to use that support to go to university is an example of that. 


And then there is the possibility of fibre to the home. For a person like Gretta, that gives her smart-house technology. It gives her back-to-base monitoring. It allows her to turn on her air-conditioning. It allows her to open her front door without having to ask her mum to do it for her. It provides a level of independence in ways that we really have not thought of yet because we are just coming to terms with the possibilities of fibre-to-the-home technology.


If those three things come together, it means the life that a person like Gretta, or a person born tomorrow in Gretta's circumstances, will live will be profoundly different from the life that Gretta has had until now. These are life-changing years that Australia faces at the moment for people like Gretta and for many, many others. The possibility of delivering speech therapy to people in regional areas, Auslan interpreters in schools in remote towns, back-to-base monitoring of medical conditions—there are an incredible range of possibilities that the NBN could provide to a whole range of people that would profoundly change their lives.


The election of the Liberal government and their extraordinary short-sightedness in believing that the copper network will do anything like this is a real blow to a whole range of people whose lives could be profoundly different if this government went along with the kinds of decisions that governments overseas are taking.


We can also see, of course, the many opportunities for business in Australia if we had fibre to the home. All over the world, in markets much bigger than ours, governments are getting ahead of us in terms of broadband speeds, and when that happens there is innovation from a whole range of people who dream—from entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers and just people in their houses. My neighbour has turned his house into a 'cloud' now, because the NBN actually reached his suburb. He has now created a cloud business in his home. The emergence of cloud style businesses and software all around the world is an indication that the rest of the world is taking on a situation where people can communicate with each other through fibre from wherever they are.


We talked about this in business 35 or 40 years ago. In fact, in the late eighties, I gave a few lectures on the possibility of fibre and I ducted my business, when we renovated, for fibre. I was ready! But we talked then about the possibility of people in one country working alongside people in another, of businesses literally crossing the oceans through fibre—under the oceans and into our homes and businesses—and allowing a form of collaboration and a level of entrepreneurial activity which we are yet to see but we are just beginning to get to. The development of this cloud based software is an indication that that is the way the world is going.


In a country the size of Australia, if we go down the Liberal path, where it is fibre to the home if you can afford it but not for the rest, we will not get the critical mass that will drive the innovation from our entrepreneurs and our businesses that will allow Australia to be part of this new world. It is not right that this government thinks it is okay that we import the best ideas from the rest of the world but do not provide circumstances in Australia where businesses can develop their own. In fact, for a government that believes it has a plan for the future and believes it is about business to turn its back on one of the biggest growth areas for business in the world is quite extraordinary.


You can see that, even dealing with businesses now. I recently drove down the highway towards Cooma, heading to a state park for a bit of a camping weekend, and I drove through a small town called Bemboka. I stopped at an art gallery not far off the main road—this is a main road between two reasonable sized centres not far from Canberra—where I decided to buy some pieces of pottery that a local potter had made, and the poor man that owned the gallery took half an hour to get his credit card machine to work by mobile. He ended up going out into the yard to get a signal that would last long enough to do a credit card transaction so that I could buy something. I stayed there for half an hour after I had decided what to buy. That is how long it took to buy it. What chance does that business have? That business, by the way, is two kilometres from the main road, so I think perhaps his connection charge would be slightly more than the $5,000 average that we are hearing about. But what chance does that business have—what chance does that community have, actually—to grow in the modern world, when you cannot easily do a credit card transaction in your small business, in a town a couple of hours from Canberra on a main road? That is an outrageous position to be in.


For a government that pretends to care about regional areas, not to have fibre to the home as its priority is quite extraordinary. People who live in regional areas a long way from the footpath, a long way from that box, will have to find thousands of dollars in order to connect to what should be a right in this country. We have an incredibly short-sighted government which does not seem to understand the possibilities of this new technology. It seems to think that all we are talking about is what we already do with our slow speeds—movies, a bit of texting, a bit of communication, a bit of skyping. That is not the world we are entering. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about making sure that entrepreneurs and businesses in this country can take advantage of who we are. We are one of the great innovative countries of the world. We produce scientific papers and inventions above our weight. We are extraordinary thinkers. We are flexible and we problem solve in an extraordinary way. We are not as good at investing in ourselves, but we come up with answers at a rate that the rest of the world does not. We are an exceptionally inventive country.


At a time when the world is becoming increasingly connected and true globalisation—which is that your inputs, labour, everything , particularly in the service economy, comes from wherever it is and is linked through modern technology into a virtual business—is beginning to happen in a real way around the world, just look at who we are. Come to my electorate, any of you, and you will see an area where there is not a single language we do not speak. We speak every language in Parramatta. There is not a country we do not know; there is not a culture we are not familiar with; there is not a city we cannot drive through without a map. We have a population in this country that can work and collaborate with people in any country in the world. The only thing that stops us from doing that to the full extent of our capacity is our slow, outdated communications technology. 


It is quite shameful that the previous Liberal government did not act on this, that in 13 years the previous Liberal government did not consider that it was important to upgrade our technology in the way we needed to. It is particularly shameful now, when the rest of the world is moving so fast in this area, that our newly elected government, which thinks it is for the future and thinks it represents small business, does not bother to make sure that we have the technology we need to benefit from who we are. 


Also, we are sitting on the edge of the fastest growing region in the world. There is no doubt that, just as our northern neighbours are starting to overtake us in their focus on education, they are also overtaking us in the speed of communications technology and the accessibility of it to their populations. In a very short period it will become apparent even to those opposite that we will have squandered the time that we need to make sure we are in the most competitive position. I would ask the government to consider seriously the approach it is taking to this incredibly important area.


I come from an arts background. For me, it is never about what you can do; it is not even about what you can imagine; it is about making sure that you strive for things you cannot yet imagine; it is about making sure that the people with the smartest minds, with the greatest ideas and with the greatest of entrepreneurial flair can use those talents for the benefit of the community. On this side of the House we know that the Grettas of the world need this technology to live a better life. We know that the entrepreneurs in this country, the small businesses in this country, the inventors, the scientists and my neighbour with his new cloud based business all need this technology in order to use who they are for their own benefit and for the benefit of this nation. 


It is great to talk about submarine cables and it is a really terrific that they are the highest technology and the best quality we can get; that takes it to our shores and connects the businesses that are big enough to afford to be near big cities where they can benefit from the high speed. There are many others in this country who have much more to offer as we move into this new age. It is about time the government opposite made sure that they are supported in those endeavours.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:57):  A number of my comments are going to be very similar to those of the member for Parramatta because I too was very interested to read the history lesson we were given by the minister on the submarine cables that join Australia with the rest of the world. I remember when coaxial cables came in. I can remember, as a kid, listening to the cricket and that swishing sound which I used to think was the sound of the waves over the cable. I now understand that that is not the case and that it was in fact in-cable amplifiers which caused that noise. As the member for Parramatta said, the minister rightly spoke of the importance of the new technology of fibre optic cable that came into being in the 1980s. Even though that was at a time well before the internet, it was felt to be very important to use the latest technology. Our economy was growing and we were growing numerically, with an increasing amount of data to transmit.


But I think we are seeing some irony here. The minister went on to pontificate about his decision. While we are going to have first-class connections to the international community, once the cables hit Australia the data is going to be zooming around on 20th-century technology. I found it interesting that the minister would not be the slightest bit embarrassed by that juxtaposition and that he would indeed use his second reading speech to promote the benefits of fibre to the node.


I am going to talk about some of the reasons I think the minister is going to find it extremely difficult to meet his commitments. We all know about the inadequacy of us being confined to download speeds of 25 megabits per second, but I think the minister faces a very profound difficulty in implementing even that vision. That difficulty is the status of the copper wire network. The government has estimated that they might have to replace something of the order of seven per cent to 10 per cent of the copper network after the node point. But that appears to be a calculation with no substance behind it. It is literally a back-of-the-envelope calculation and it does not stand up against my experience of the situation in my electorate. 


When the government says, 'We can deliver the NBN more cheaply,' that whole claim rests on the idea that in 90 to 93 per cent of cases it will be possible to use the copper network to go from the node to the premises. But that is, as I said, based on a calculation that has no support. No matter where you look to see where that calculation came from, there is absolutely no support for it. Where is the documentation? Where are the figures? Where is the support for that estimate? No matter where you look, you cannot find it. In reality, there is grave uncertainty about whether that copper network is fit for purpose. 


In 2004 Telstra themselves were prepared to acknowledge the state of their copper network. At the Senate committee inquiry into broadband competition, Dr Tony Warren, then the group manager of regulatory strategy, said:


I think it is right to suggest that ADSL is an interim technology. It is probably the last sweating, if you like, of the old copper network assets. In copper years, if you like, we are at a sort of transition—we are at five minutes to midnight. 


Telstra went on to explain that they thought, at that stage, that the copper network had perhaps another 10 years of life in it. That was 2004. Next year we come to the end of that 10-year period, yet we are now about to embark on a re-visioning of our national broadband network which relies on that copper network, a network which, in the words of its owners, is on its way out. In the words of its owners, it is reaching the very last of its life. 


The experience from my electorate confirms just that. I will focus on the suburb of Bedford, a suburb about seven or eight kilometres from the CBD that was principally built in the 1930s and 1940s. In Bedford, even for telephony the copper network is incapable, in many instances, of providing a reliable service. Breakdown of lines and the discontinuation of landline services happens with great regularity. In the vast majority of that suburb, it is not possible to even get ADSL2. You cannot subscribe to ADSL2. Resident after resident with very slow ADSL has reported that even that regularly drops out. It drops out as often as every half-hour, making it virtually impossible to work from home. 


We have had many technicians from the area come in and explain the problem with the network to us—that there is simply no redundancy left in the system. Pretty much all of the pairs have been consumed. It is just not possible to give any upgrades in speed, because there is not enough capacity on the network. This is compounded by very poor maintenance. The lines in this area—and, on the evidence, I am sure this is the case right across Perth—have been very poorly maintained. 


It is extraordinary that the minister was talking today about how he is actually going to be prioritising those areas. He is going to be doing some work on assessing the capacity of the network across Australia and prioritising for a future rollout. But there does not seem to be any information available from Telstra on exactly what the condition of the network is. I find it extraordinary that a company that has had such an asset seems to have no data on the condition of that network and is unable to identify what the capacity of that network is. The prioritisation is going to have to be based on information from retailers, carriers and mobile services which cover that area. 


But one of the themes coming through from all the people who are contacting us about the very poor level of service is that, to some extent, the companies have just given up—and, as a result, those people have given up too. Complaints go completely and utterly unattended and people have, unfortunately, just learned to live with it. They have been told by their service providers: 'Look, do not worry us. We are waiting for the NBN rollout. When the NBN rollout comes, we will be able to do something, but in the interim there is nothing we can do.'


If you have a plan that is based on using a copper network that is simply not capable of supporting in any reliable way even an eight megahertz transmission of data, how can you support  25 or 29 or whatever it is that the Minister for Communications is promising? It is simply not going to be capable of that. The cost of attempting to remediate the system is going to end up totally changing the cost differential. The minister has made so much of the fact that his project is much less costly, but it is only much less costly if you have a copper network that is capable of sustaining what he believes it can. All of the evidence that we have had to date tells us that that is extremely unlikely and that we have a five-minutes-to-midnight network. 


There is also going to be a considerable problem in timing—in designing this new system, in designing the location of the nodes. This is not something that can be done overnight. This, one would imagine, would be at least an 18-month or two-year task. There is simply no way that this system is going to be in place in 2016, as promised. It is physically not going to be possible to do the comprehensive redesign of that whole system and at the same time get it built. The promises we have been made are that it is going to be cheaper and they can get it out faster. We are going to get a second-rate product, we are going to get a 20th century product, but don't worry, it is like fast food—like going to Kentucky Fried rather than waiting around for a nice, well-cooked meal. Go and get your Kentucky Fried and be happy about that. I think we will see that even the KFC of broadband is not going to be deliverable. It is a second-class product. 




Mr Tudge:
  What have you got against KFC?




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  I do eat KFC; I quite like it. We all like rubbish from time to time, but I would not want to see us spending $35 billion on a rubbish network. 




Mr Tudge:
  You would prefer to spend $70 billion.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  The point I am making is that we were delivering a 21st century product. We were delivering a product that was going to be capable of doing what it was supposed to. You have some profound technological challenges in delivering even this very modest fraudband that you are proposing, and I think you have completely and utterly underestimated the difficulty you are going to have delivering over the copper network.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:10):  by leave—I note that the member for Perth was talking about copper, and of course the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill is about submarine cables. As I was about to say earlier, Australia's regime has been praised as a global best practice example for the protection of submarine cables by the International Cable Protection Committee and APEC. While terror attacks on submarine cables have been relatively minimal and there is no shortage of infrastructure that terrorists may attack, fibre-optic cables hold a symbolic appeal, being the vehicle that delivers cyberspace to the masses worldwide and also the conduit for global financial transactions.


While it is likely for now that cable damage will simply remain accidental and rare, the coalition recognises that it is important to remain ready and proactive to ensure that the practice does not become a serious infrastructure threat. The coalition stands ready to advance the infrastructure required for the digital age.


I understand that while I was not in the chamber the member for Greenway took the opportunity to quote statements I had made previously about the NBN. I want to place it very clearly on the record that I have always supported a national broadband network. I have never supported Labor's version of NBN Co., which is a disgrace. It is a white elephant costing the Australian people billions of dollars more than it should. I refer, as the member for Greenway did, back to my days on the Brisbane City Council. We worked for many years on a business model. We proofed up that business model; we developed a financial model. We trialled the business model and we trialled a practical example of laying fibre across the city. We went out to tender. The grand cost, the great cost of fibring the whole of the Brisbane City Council area, was going to be covered by private enterprise, not by government. We were going to offer a ubiquitous broadband network across the city at no cost to the ratepayers of Brisbane.


What did the Brisbane City Council do when we heard that the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Rudd, had had a little thought bubble? We contacted Ministers Conroy and Albanese and offered them copies of our business model and our financial model. The response was silence—they were not interested in something that had taken more than six years to develop, that had been tested and proved; they were not interested in working with us to deliver a network at no cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country. No, they preferred to spend $64 billion—plus, plus—on a project that was never going to work. I support a national broadband network; what I do not support is the absolute waste that the Labor government inflicted on the taxpayers of Australia and that future generations would have had to pay off. It is an absolute disaster and the service would be much better delivered by the private sector. Unfortunately we are too far down the track for that. I condemn the opposition for the appalling model that they developed and for their refusal to work with people like the Brisbane City Council. In fact, the minister at the time threatened to write retrospective legislation to stop us delivering our system. That was the sort of attitude this opposition had when they were in government. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-12-04,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (18:14):  I rise to make some brief remarks on the Telecommunications (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. The Greens generally support the principle behind this bill, but will refer it to a Senate committee for inquiry. We will do this for several reasons: first, to ensure that the results of the statutory review undertaken by ACMA five years after the 2005 legislation are adequate; second, to review the decisions taken by the government in addition to the outcomes of the review.


The Greens appreciate the extent to which Australia's connection to the world is dependent upon the security of telecommunications transmitted on submarine cables and wants them to be protected. As a May 2013 Australian Strategic Policy Institute paper noted, five main international cables, each not much thicker than a common garden hose, connect Australia to cyberspace and global voice networks, making them vital to our communications, economic prosperity and national security. The ASPI report noted that the AFP is responsible for compliance with the laws but indicated in the review process that they do not have the resources to monitor the cables in maritime zones. AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and the FMA provide some surveillance, but these agencies, as well as the cable owners, indicated in the review process that monitoring arrangements were unsatisfactory. It is unclear whether these issues have been dealt with in the bill.


New Zealand apparently does better in this regard than Australia, and perhaps we have something to learn here. These cables need protection from all the inadvertent, accidental causes of disruption, such as fishing and anchoring, as well as from attack as outlined in the bill. Our cables also require protection from tapping, which could lead to indiscriminate and unlawful access to Australian telecommunications data and content. Are the mechanisms outlined in this bill, and those already in place arising from the 2005 legislation, preventing this type of interference, and will they prevent this type of interference in the future? This is a question that we hope the Senate committee will be able to resolve.


The vulnerability of submarine cables to tapping is the subject also of recent revelations. A 7 July Washington Post article analysed the ways in which surveillance of telecommunications via fibre-optic cables on the seabed could be done through:


a seemingly mundane government power: the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to approve cable licenses.


The Washington Post piece discusses the four US submarines, fitted out for special missions, that attached listening devices on the outside of a cable's housing. Apparently, cable landing stations near or upstream from them are the likely locations for electronic copying in a way that is invisible. The Washington Post article also alleges that the licensing and permit approval processes in the US were held up essentially to allow time for lawyers from the FBI and departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to broker deals with the firms wanting to lay cables that transited the United States.


The minister acknowledged in his second reading speech that he was a director of Reach. Reach would be the Telstra and PCCW joint venture company that was compelled to enter into an agreement with the FBI in 2001 to allow access to the data transmitted by undersea cable, including billing data and stored communications of Telstra customers. In the agreement, all of this was exempted from FOI and also from the privacy laws. Protecting the security of submarine cables is a very serious issue, as the minister states, but protecting the integrity of Australia's legislated privacy protections and the human right of Australian citizens to privacy and the rule of law standards are also very serious issues.


This bill includes new powers for the Attorney-General to direct ACMA to refuse a permit on security grounds. The bill provides that ACMA must, within two days of receiving an application, inform the Attorney-General, who must then get back to ACMA with a decision within 15 days. Under section 72A, the Attorney-General must consult with the Prime Minister and the minister before deciding that an action on cable permits would be prejudicial to Australia's security. Hopefully, the Senate inquiry process will clarify what criteria the Attorney-General might use to make this determination. Given that the decision is not reviewable, what the Attorney-General needs to have regard to may need further elaboration.


The Greens are committed to ensuring that Australia's submarine cables are secure, and this is inextricably linked to ensuring that the privacy of Australians' telecommunications are protected from illegal and unsupervised surveillance.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (18:20):  You have certainly got to be quick on your feet here, but I am going to see if I can take my full time and make sure that I make all the necessary points that are required in this debate. This is an important bill. It provides for the security of Australia's submarine cable and for a whole range of measures to ensure that security and a range of related issues. I know that Labor members are supportive of the important things that need to be done in this area. There is no question in my mind that the marine cable that links Australia to the rest of the world and provides that large pipe—that window to the rest of the world—to our telecommunications and to our capacity to cooperate, link, interact and do business with the rest of the world is of vital importance. It is critical importance.


This cable is not new. It has actually been underwater for quite a number of years. It was first executed in 1946. It draws your mind, and I want to take this opportunity to speak about the cable. In the second reading speech the minister not only outlined the purpose of the bill but also decided to speak about NBN Co. and talk about the NBN. He really opened the door—or, as it were, opened the pipeline—to talk about NBN and the link between the submarine cable, which is Australia's link to the rest of the world, and NBN Co. and how we link homes to the rest of the world. And I couldn't help but think—I just had this image in my mind—back to the 1940s when this was first dreamed up. That was quite a long time ago, Mr Deputy Speaker—and longer for some than others—but in 1940 they must have been sitting around and talking about the future. I am sure there was no-one, in 1940—in the Menzies government then—who could have imagined just what might be possible with an internet connection or an underwater cable. I can just imagine that, if they had had the same principles, or the same concept, as the Liberal Party does today, many decades later, they would have said: 'Look, we are going to run this cable. We are going to go to all this expense'—it must have been an enormous expense and an enormous undertaking to lay such a cable to Australia—but they would have said: 'Do you know what? We are just going to run the cable. It is going to be fibre to the coast, and that is as far as it goes. Once it gets to the coast, that is it. The rest of you are on your own. If you want to hook into it, you can rock up to the beach, bring your little connection kit, and you can find a way—dig your own trench, hook up your own little bit of copper, and you can get yourself connected to the rest of the world.' Can you imagine what would have been going through the minds of people in the government, in the parliament or around the country, back in the 1940s, if that were to have been the case? Of course, it was not the case—because back then they could see the future even if they did not know what it would look like.


Today we have the opposite. Today, we have some sense of what the future might look like, because our eyes have been opened to the vast potential that exists through our communications, through the internet and through large fibre-optic cables—but we have a government that does the exact opposite. It wants to close that loop. It wants to squeeze and strangle the optic-fibre cable and it wants—and I cannot understand this for the life of me—to make it as hard as possible for people to connect. They are not running fibre to the home, which guarantees you that right in front of your door, whether you connect today, tomorrow, next year or the year after, the connection is there—right to your home: that is where the future exists; right at your front door, when you can connect. Instead, the Liberal Party in government wants to just run fibre to the node—just to down the street to some central point, a bit like if we ran the submarine cable to the coast and just left it there. I can imagine it flopping around on the beach, like an eel, just sitting there on the coast. And then people could come along later; it would be open slather, you could get a contractor to come in and run some cable for you—connect to the coast.



Government members interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  Exactly. I would find it pretty funny too, because it would be funny—if it were not true, and if it were not exactly what the Liberal Party is doing today. They are just running the fibre to the coast. If you want to come—




Mr Tudge:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. I would like to ask the member a question.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is the member for Oxley willing to give way?




Mr RIPOLL:
  I am sure it is going to be a horrible question, so the answer is no.



A government member:  Have a go!




Mr RIPOLL:
  You'll get your opportunities! In the 21st century, we need to consider some of the most important things that this parliament will do, not for us, not for our kids, not even for our grandkids, but for the very far distant future—things that we can do today; things that will cost a lot today but will deal with the things that we need to do in the future. It is a bit like when I am in Brisbane and, say, driving over the Story Bridge or looking at some of the things that were built back in the 1920s. I can imagine, back in the 1920s—and it is a little bit like with the submarine cable—when they were building the eight-lane Story Bridge, that some people would have said: 'Why would you need eight lanes on this bridge?', when it was still cart-and-buggy days, and there would have been enough room to fit 20 carts across the bridge. But somebody back then had the good foresight to be able to say: 'But in the future, we will need something much bigger than we can dream of today.'


When I think of connection to the internet, I don't think dial-up 50Kbps, I don't think ADSL—I don't even think ADSL2; I think, what is the largest possible connection I can get so that I can do business with the rest of the world? And it is not so much about what I can do; I think, what are the possibilities? What can others do? I remember at a debate during the election campaign—and this demonstrates the quality of the debate on this—a Liberal party candidate who was debating and laughing at the NBN. He was laughing that it was available at his mother's home. His mother was in her 90s, and he said, 'and she can't even use a computer'. And I thought, you have really missed the point, haven't you? It is not about whether your 90-year-old-plus mother can use a computer, or whether she can have an internet connection to the rest of the world in her home. It is about what her doctors can provide in terms of medical assistance, through—what is now more commonplace—alert devices like wristbands that can alert a doctor, through a wi-fi internet connection in the home, if there is a problem with your 90-year-old-plus mother. But if you can't see that, and if you can't see the future today, how can you possibly see the future tomorrow? More than anything, that is what troubles me about where this government is taking us. They are taking us back to the future. They still dream of the white picket fence of the 50s. They still dream of an era when things were much slower and kinder—which is why we have the Prime Minister speaking at the rate that he does. But the reality is that we have bigger things to do. If we are going to be debating bills on things as important as submarine cables and about our connection to the rest of the world and what that can produce for our country and for our economy, then surely the next logical step—just one step further—is to ask: once you get it to the beach—fibre to the coast—aren't you going to take it somewhere else? 


I would say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in your electorate—and a fine electorate it is, Maranoa—there is a whole range of regional and rural people and people on farms who have got it. They have got it; they understand what it means to be able to deliver real-time weather information. They understand what it means for their kids to be able to access educational information around the world that would otherwise not be available to them. And they understand what it means for their businesses, be it farming, supply chain businesses or others, to be part of a global supply chain, to understand markets better, and to get real-time information. And it is not only real-time information to their home but also on their mobile devices while they are riding around on their ag bikes tending to their stock. This is much deeper than whether it is a Labor, Liberal, or some other ideological bent about the NBN. It is about the future of the Australian economy. The sad thing is that we have seen the member for Wentworth come into this place with a policy which is discredited—across any reputable area, by any reputable economist, by anybody in engineering terms. They don't even call it NBN-lite anymore, because it is not even on the same planet. It is NBN-to-a-few, at best. He might want to wax lyrical in this place about the numbers of take ups and where it has been rolled out, but it is about planning for the future. When this marine cable was planned in 1940, I am sure they were not waxing too lyrical about the take-up rate in 1945 or 1942, but they saw to the future again. 


I want to draw a few connections between things that are going on in this country. Low-income superannuation contribution might have nothing to do with this bill, but there is a link between it and what is happening here: National Party electorates in particular are copping the biggest hits. National Party electorates across this country have been dudded the most by the Liberal Party as to how many people will lose out on Labor's low-income superannuation contribution. And when it comes to NBN and the connection to the rest of the world, who is it that misses out the most? People in seats in Central Queensland and along the Queensland coast—seats like Herbert, Dickson, Dawson, Capricornia and Leichhardt—who are going to miss out on NBN. Those were the areas on the map for the next phase of the NBN rollout, which is going into the ground right now, but they are being ignored. Those on the other side can laugh and carry on. Their idea of the future is what they are having for lunch tomorrow, and not what might be happening to our great grandchildren or our economy in the future. This is not a debate about the election cycle; it is about an economic cycle; it is about telecommunications; it is about the industries of the future. Those industries are not horse and buggy whips—that might have been what you were considering in the run up to the election, but it is not what we are considering today.


They had more foresight in 1940 when they were laying these marine cables than this government has today, despite the greater opportunity for insight about what the future might bring. It is disappointing that in my electorate where we had maps, agreements and the next phase of rollouts in places like Bellbird Park, Augustine Heights, Ellen Grove, Gailes, Wacol, Carole Park—working-class suburbs with a large component of commercial and business operations. Those business people want this in the ground, because they want to hook in immediately and they do not want to wait for it to be at the node. They want it right at their front door. In a thriving new satellite city like greater Springfield it is not just about being a great place to live but about business and education—it already has dark optic fibre to its universities, TAFEs and schools, because the developers had foresight. They said a decade ago, 'If Telstra won't put in optic fibre, we'll take a punt with our own money and run our own cable.' And so there is dark optic fibre cable directly to the university, to the Springfield centre for commercial purposes and to some of the suburbs, because the developers understood what the future could provide and understood the value proposition of providing that to everyone's front door. That has produced incredible dividends for commerce and business. Let me tell you that the Springfield Chamber of Commerce is an absolute advocate and supporter of this technology, because they use it. People who live in Brookwater were very lucky to be able to access optic fibre to the home very early on. Those who run a home business in that suburb know the competitive advantage they have. They understand it in the same way as those who were laying the marine cable in 1940. They did not merely run it to the beach and leave it there for somebody else to do something with later. They said: 'We're going to go all the way with this, because we know what this represents. We know the next step we have to take.' 


I cannot say enough about the missed opportunity that this government has now delivered to all Australians. The time will come when there is no option but to take up the technology. Everything we do now is based on a higher need, a bigger pipe, greater access. A decade or so ago it might have been okay to be on dial-up. Some here might still remember those funny, clicky sounds when you dialled in. It was also a really frustrating sound. No-one could possibly use that today, because our systems no longer match to that. We need optic fibre to the home in the same way we need the big pipe. Whether it is infrastructure of a more technical nature like this or old-school infrastructure like bridges, roads or ports, you have to build in a bit of spare capacity. You have to look to the future. That is why we on this side will always be supporting the development of NBN to the home—it is in the national interest. While we will be supporting this bill, it does point to the failure of this government.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (18:35):  I am rising to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Submarine Cable Protection) Bill 2013. It is designed to protect the integrity, operation and security of submarine cables that are critical in providing telecommunications services between our continent and the rest of the globe. There has been a longstanding regime for protecting these cables. In fact, we are one of the few countries in the world that has a regime in place to do just this. These cables have been in place for decades and the regime has been there to support their continued and efficient operation. About three years ago, the ACMA—the Australian Communications and Media Authority—reviewed aspects of the regime, and the review recommended a number of actions that the minister spoke to when he introduced the legislation to the House. Notably, it ensures consistency between our cable protection regime and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It provides a structured process for the consideration of matters within the Attorney-General's portfolio concerning submarine cable installation and permit applications. It also enables significant domestic submarine cables or cables that connect two places within our nation to be brought under the regime and to be protected. It will streamline permit processes that govern installation. Finally, the bill contains some administrative and technical amendments.


The bill takes on greater importance when we consider how businesses are starting to respond to the demand for cable capacity. It is not surprising that, as more and more people and businesses begin to move into the online world, they are effectively transferring the way in which they operate from analog to digital—digitising businesses, creating demand for data, downloading more data and producing more data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the 12 months to December 2012, in relation to fixed line internet access, download of data had grown at a rate of about 63 per cent. I have often quoted the fact that, on figures that I have seen, the amount of data that is expected to be produced globally will increase by a phenomenal 4,300 per cent. The pressure is well and truly on for us to have the ability to transmit that data. So these cables are critical, particularly in linking us into servers based in other continents, and having this protection is vital.


In his second reading speech the Minister for Communications said that this bill was important in a wider context. He broadened the scope of his contribution and focus to state:


But connectedness is not just about ensuring our submarine cables—


which are the focus of the bill—


or satellite links or even backhaul fibre are of a high standard—it is just as much about ensuring that Australian mums and dads, school kids or small business people can take advantage of the resources and opportunities of the internet. 


That then gave him a platform to broaden his discussion and, amazingly, to say that the government could claim that they are delivering a better National Broadband Network. Their definition of 'better' is not to use one of the best platforms available to deliver data, which is fibre-optic cable. Their view of a better national broadband network is to rely on copper as the platform of the future—a technology that has been used for 100 years. I heard the member for Perth in her contribution quoting Telstra executives who, some time ago, had said that they were sweating the last moments of the copper network. This is what the member for Wentworth has championed within his party as the way of the future—copper. It is not NBN-lite, it is NBN-dull, because it will slow down the ability to download data. 


More importantly, as has often been reflected when it comes to issues involving the internet and broadband in this country, it is not just about download speeds but about upload capacity. In terms of the tech sector in Australia being able to conduct its work, to innovate, this is the focus for the future. We are being condemned with a fibre-to-the-node proposal that will dull down the ability of Australians to get better speeds on both download and upload. The minister in his speech stated:


… we have committed to prioritising the NBN rollout in areas with the poorest services so that those who currently cannot connect, or have the poorest speeds, get fast broadband sooner. 


The Sydney Morning Heraldreviewed the minister's plan in an article entitled 'Turnbull's broadband plan too slow, too late'. The minister says that this is the plan that will see those who suffer with the poorest services, those who cannot connect, getting fast broadband sooner. 


The minister knows of my long-running advocacy on behalf of residents in areas of the Chifley electorate that have been condemned with poor service. When the coalition was last in government it attempted 20 times to improve broadband and failed. For instance, residents of Woodcroft in my electorate suffered for ages. They were never going to see a fibre connection established from the Blacktown exchange. They were condemned with an overloaded copper network. In this residential estate there had been no plan for a better network. These residents had been condemned with poor service.


In his second reading speech on this bill, the minister reflected on the fact that he had been to Blacktown in the Chifley electorate, and he said that this was an area where Telstra HFC and Optus HFC cable existed. Yes, it did. HFC exists in Sydney and Melbourne. It was not widely opened up for household consumers to access broadband. It was primarily used as a method of delivering Foxtel signals, but it was not opened up for people to access internet services.


As a result of advocacy undertaken by me in conjunction with residents of Woodcroft, we were able to work with Telstra to open up areas of the cable broadband network in parts of Woodcroft as an interim measure while we waited for the NBN. The NBN was able to be rolled out in Woodcroft because it fell within a fibre footprint area which, as we announced in July 2010, allowed Woodcroft—as a result of advocating on their behalf and pushing for them to get broadband—to be included in the three-year roll-out plan. Residents of Woodcroft were finally able to see a ray of light that would let them access better internet services, because they knew the NBN was rolling out. In the interim we opened up cable broadband in parts of that suburb, which improved service dramatically, as well as an investment in ADSL Top Hat, which saw capacity for ADSL, particularly ADSL2, being offered to residents. What happened? 


Again, the minister says he is looking at prioritising the rollout of broadband in areas that have had the poorest connections. When the government announced their updated maps for their NBN rollout plan a few weeks ago, one of the mostly poorly served broadband network areas, Woodcroft, was completely dropped off the revised figures. The member for Wentworth went to the election claiming that every construction contract would be honoured, but he never had the courage or the decency to say that he was going to alter that commitment and break that promise once in government.


The member for Wentworth basically manufactured a deception on people who were expecting the NBN. He changed the terms. He said he would only honour contracts where the build instruction had been issued, thereby robbing residents of Woodcroft and Doonside, who were expecting to be connected to the NBN and had been waiting for years to get better broadband. They had been denied better broadband by the Howard government and now they are being ripped off by the Abbott government. This is from a person who makes a big deal of the fact that he can catch public transport and go out to Blacktown and say, 'There's HFC out here.' He has a great sense of theatre. He does not have a lot of modesty, but there are a lot of theatrical elements to the minister, the member for Wentworth. He talked about the fact that people could access HFC. In actual fact, if you hop online and try to access HFC services in the areas he looked at, you will see that not all the providers provide HFC access to the HFC network. So, clearly, he has not even done his homework. Frankly, I would not expect much from a Minister for Communications who advocates copper as a basis for rolling out better broadband services into the future. You are not really a fair dinkum communications minister if you think that that is the thing that you need to advocate for improving broadband in this country.


The member for Wentworth has ripped off Woodcroft residents. Those residents have complained bitterly about being left off the map. They do not deserve this shabby treatment from the member for Wentworth. He came out during the federal election to try to snare votes. He then made a promise about improving broadband services. He broke his promise after manufacturing a deception on the residents of Western Sydney. Then he slunk back to Bondi, which, funnily enough, has way better connection then the residents of Western Sydney are entitled to enjoy.




Mr Tudge:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Is the member for Chifley willing to give way?




Mr HUSIC:
  No. I am not interested in playing the game with the member for Aston, who probably has better broadband services for his constituents while we are fighting to get improved services for residents in my area.



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Why don't you go and speak to the member for Macquarie, who was present when we were turning on broadband services in our part of Western Sydney. He was quite happy to see that. Maybe even go and see the member for Herbert, who was getting NBN services turned on in his electorate as well.


Woodcroft residents do not deserve this treatment. When I was fighting for better connections for Woodcroft residents, Malcolm Turnbull, speaking on the problems that were being experienced by residents I represent, said:


… the Government now cannot get its wholly-owned taxpayer-funded monopoly to prioritize the neediest areas …


This was referring to Woodcroft in a speech that he made to a Young Liberals conference. He said:


That would be a travesty of social justice from a party that so loudly claims to believe in it.


So it is good enough for him in opposition to hold up Woodcroft and say that it is a travesty of social justice for them to not get broadband. It is good enough for him to come in here and pretend that he has some sort of concern when he quotes his visits to Blacktown in his speech on this bill. Yet the minute he gets into government he makes a decision that rips off those residents, and he does not have the guts or the decency to ensure that those residents get better service.


Instead, he is a man with a plan. His plan is to just conduct a review. It is a review that he says is very objective but is being conducted by a mate with whom he owns a yacht. I am sure that this review is going to be very objective! Is a mate who he has had for some time going to have the guts to stand up to Malcolm Turnbull and tell him where he has gone wrong with his broadband plan which, as I say, has already been slammed for being too slow and too late and will result in 30 per cent less revenue because it will be providing slower speeds? Yet we are supposed to be expecting to see some sort of fair dinkum outcome from this strategic review that is already late. No doubt it will be crunched through the minister's office. I would be interested to see how the review that goes into the minister's office looks after it leaves the office.


The fact of the matter is that they have to reach—off the top of my head—nine million premises by June 2016. I read an estimate that that means they would have to pass 12,000 homes or establish 12,000 connections a day. It will be interesting to see if the minister, the member for Wentworth, makes that mark. But he should have the decency to stand up and honour the commitments and the concerns that he put when he visited Blacktown and spoke about Woodcroft residents. They do not deserve to be dudded.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:52):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Commission Transfer) Bill 2013. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to separate the Anti-Dumping Commission from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and transfer it to the Department of Industry. The commission would continue to exercise the relevant antidumping powers and functions contained in parts XVB and XVC of the Customs Act 1901. This would include the receipt and screening of applications for antidumping measures and the conduct of investigations and inquiries relating to those applications. I note that the bill would also transfer to the commissioner any antidumping powers and functions currently retained by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service under the Customs ACT 1901.


We on this side of the House do not oppose this bill, but we note that it builds on reforms introduced by Labor in our February 2013 Industry and Innovation Statement. The initiatives in that package are still at risk of cuts. What is the government's position on those initiatives? The government needs to speak up soon and decisively to support Australian industry.


Industries, companies and workers are injured when goods from overseas are dumped into the Australian market. That is why it is important that we have a fair and effective antidumping regime. In government, Labor strengthened Australia's antidumping and countervailing system to provide stronger protection from unfair competition for Australian firms. We implemented the most significant reforms to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade. In 2011, we announced comprehensive, WTO-consistent improvements to Australia's antidumping system, as detailed in the policy statement Streamlining Australia's anti-dumping system. We also established the International Trade Remedies Forum to provide advice on antidumping matters, with members from industry, unions and government.


In December 2012, we announced a package of reforms to Australia's antidumping system to deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas. We recognised that, as global economic circumstances change and Australia is facing intense, and in some cases unfair, international competition from dumped goods, more needs to be done to ensure that Australia continues to have an effective antidumping system. Our reforms delivered stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas. These reforms were enshrined in Labor's Industry and Innovation Statement in February 2013, which included $27.7 million in further reforms to Australia's antidumping system. These reforms were, firstly, establishing a new antidumping commission to investigate dumping complaints; secondly, making it easier for SMEs to access and use the system; thirdly, investing $24.4 million to increase the investigative capability of the Customs and Border Protection Service, almost doubling the number of investigators; and, fourthly, strengthening remedies against overseas producers that injure Australian businesses by dumping and that attempt to circumvent Australia's antidumping rules.


The central objective of Labor's Industry and Innovation Statement was to build an economy which prospers in the 21st century and to create and support jobs. Our reforms to Australia's antidumping system were designed to support local businesses by ensuring a level playing field. In particular, the establishment of the Anti-Dumping Commission will deliver targeted resources to investigate dumping complaints and apply remedies where dumping is damaging local producers.


In government, Labor committed $1 billion in measures to support and create Australian jobs through the Industry and Innovation Statement. This included a series of measures to help Australian businesses gain access to major domestic projects, through changes to Australian industry participation plans. Labor's reform of Australian industry participation plans meant that domestic projects worth $500 million or more must demonstrate how they will provide more opportunities to Australian business. We set up a new Australian Industry Participation Authority to oversee these changes. We invested more than $500 million to establish industry innovation partnerships across the country including two in food and manufacturing, which are already up and running.


We provided $350 million as part of the Venture Australia initiative for a new round of the Industry Innovation Fund to attract private investment in the high-risk venture capital market. We continued to invest in the Buy Australian at Home and Abroad initiative, which included the appointment of supplier advocates, and the Supplier Access to Major Projects program and we continued to administer Australian industry participation plans requirements for government procurements and grants. We established the Manufacturing Leaders Group, a high-profile group of industry leaders, to provide advice to government across priority areas. We provided the Manufacturing Leaders Group with $5.6 million to 2016-17 to progress projects that will help improve productivity growth and ensure that Australian manufacturing is able to take advantage of opportunities in Asia and other markets. We invested $9.9 million in clinical trial reform to improve the conduct of clinical trials in Australia and support the pharmaceutical and medical research sectors.


All of these measures—Labor's $1 billion jobs package—are at risk of cuts by the coalition. While we do not oppose the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping) Bill 2013, we note that it does not provide the surety that Australian industry needs. The Abbott government is cutting the clean technology programs; it will not commit to programs under the jobs package; and it is turning its back on the automotive industry. It is time the coalition stopped turning its back on Australian industry and manufacturing and started helping businesses fund improvements and create jobs.


Dumping of overseas products onto the Australian market is becoming a matter of increasing concern for Australian manufacturers, food processors and food producers. In fact, it is putting many businesses under financial pressure, closing others and, with that, costing Australian jobs. I make two observations about why dumping is becoming a major issue of concern for Australia. Firstly, global multinationals deliberately sell products at below cost so that they can force competitors out of the market. When they have control of the global markets, they can then set their own prices. This is how large corporations operate and how they manipulate and monopolise world markets. There are many who will say that that is the way of the free market, that is the way it has always been and that consumers benefit as a result.


My view is that consumer gains are only short term and, ultimately, consumers pay more when the competition is eliminated. I note that many other countries have had antidumping legislation in place for some time. I also note from some statistics that many other countries use that legislation and whatever powers are available to them to counter antidumping measures on a much more regular basis than Australia does. Other countries use tariffs, import restrictions, quotas and a host of other trade barriers to protect their industries, whereas Australia complies with WTO principles and encourages free and fair trade. So Australia is considered an easy target. I hope that the free trade agreements that the government is currently negotiating with Japan, China, Korea, Indonesia and India, as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, do not further disadvantage Australia. 


The second observation I make is that the global financial crisis has caused a glut of products in world markets. These products, which cannot be sold, are filling up warehouses across the world and, in turn, are tying up funds and causing liquidity problems for those who own those stocks. The Australian economy, by contrast, is doing comparatively well. By international standards, I think it would be fair to say, we still have a very strong and robust economy—thanks to the Labor government's management of the Australian economy over those difficult years. So Australia is indeed a logical place to try to dump products, and that is exactly what has been occurring.


The Australian dollar is high, the economy is strong and so is consumption within Australia. Australia becomes an obvious place for those who cannot get rid of their product or who have a surplus of it to dump it. In fact, there have been reports in recent times of wind turbine towers being dumped in Australia. There have also been reports of a whole range of paper products, copier paper in particular, tomatoes, pork, biodiesel and canned fruit—to name just some of the products that are making their way into Australia as a result of the dumping that is occurring right here and now. 


One example of dumping that I wish to point to is occurring right now in my own electorate of Makin. Tindo Solar, a new manufacturer of new technology solar panels, is competing against solar panels that are being imported from China. The fact is that Tindo panels are manufactured at a cost that is competitive with the true manufacturing costs of those same panels in China. But, because the Chinese have a glut of solar panels—I understand that there are warehouses full of them—they are dumping them wherever they can at below-cost prices, making Tindo's operations much more difficult. Tindo is a new company, with a new plant. It is capable of competing at true cost with any other manufacturer in the world but it is being undercut because of the dumping that is taking place. I brought this matter to the attention of the House on a previous occasion, and I do so again because I believe it relates very specifically and directly to the legislation that we are dealing with. 


The last matter I raise is that of the Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. It currently has jurisdiction with respect to matters that come under the Customs and Border Protection Service. I note that, as a result of the legislation transferring functions to the department of industry and trade, that particular jurisdiction of the law enforcement commissioner will be lost, because the commissioner does not have jurisdiction over the department of industry and trade. Given that we are dealing with a matter that can very easily involve substantial amounts of money, I think it is very easy to see how improper behaviour might arise as a result of a process that deals with substantial values. 




Mr Baldwin:
  Do you understand what you are talking about? 




Mr ZAPPIA:
  Yes, I do. I bring this matter to the minister's attention because this is one of the changes in the legislation which the commissioner for law enforcement integrity currently has some interest in but will no longer have when the responsibility is transferred to the department of industry and trade. It is also a matter that the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity may wish to have a look at. 


I reiterate what I said earlier: we do not oppose this legislation and we certainly support any measures that ensure that there is a proper counter-system to the dumping of products in this country. We also support any measures that ensure that we do not lose any more jobs here in Australia.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:06):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Commission Transfer) Bill 2013. This bill is only the first step in the government's plan to strengthen Australia's antidumping regime. Australia's current regime for combating injurious dumping and subsidisation is transparent and complies with our international obligations under World Trade Organization agreements. There is clearly room for an improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the current system, and that is exactly what the coalition plans to do. 


This bill contains changes to the Customs Act and other legislation needed to separate the recently formed Anti-Dumping Commission from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. This will allow the commission to transfer to the Department of Industry, where it is clearly better placed. It will free up the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to enable them to concentrate on other matters of importance to this government. This will allow those that are considering requests for antidumping action to benefit from the considerable experience and knowledge held across the Industry portfolio and it will ensure that the Minister for Industry has the power to make decisions on antidumping matters.


But this is not about protectionism; this is about maintaining a level playing field for all industries and all businesses in Australia. Antidumping is not about stopping cheap imports. There are a couple of ways that goods can be defined as being dumped. The first is when they are sold below their cost of production, and this is often predatory dumping. The other is simply international, geographic price discrimination. That is when an exported product is sold at a lower price in the export market than it is in the home market. This is often referred to as selling at less than normal value.


But there are sometimes legitimate reasons why goods may be dearer or cheaper in one market than they are in the export market. I would like to give as an example Vegemite. Some people may say is actually being dumped overseas. But this is not true. I remember during the last election the then Prime Minister Rudd standing with a jar of Vegemite and claiming that, unless people voted for him, it would increase in price by 50c—one of his spurious claims that the coalition was going to increase the GST. Of course, we know that was absolute, complete nonsense. This was the same Prime Minister who had actually raised the issue of high grocery prices in Australia back in 2007 and gave a false hope that he would do something about it—the full extent of that was nothing more than Grocery Watch.


But I will get back to Vegemite and how it may appear that it is being dumped, but it is not. Here, today, our two major supermarkets sell a 150-gram jar of Vegemite for $3.25. In New Zealand, that exact same 150-gram jar of Australian-made Vegemite can be bought for the New Zealand dollar price of $3.20—less than the Australian price. When you do the calculations so that you are comparing apples with apples—the Australian currency is much stronger than the New Zealand currency and New Zealand has a 15 per cent GST on Vegemite whereas in Australia there is no GST—it works out that consumers in Australia are paying a 32 per cent higher price than consumers in New Zealand. The same applies for Vegemite sold in the UK. Here in Australia a 220-gram jar of Vegemite sells for $3.84 in our major supermarkets. In the UK the major supermarkets—Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and a host of others—sell that same Australian-made 220-gram jar of Vegemite for 1.87 pounds. Again, making an apples for apples comparison, 1.87 pounds converts to $3.34 Australian, so here in Australia that jar of Vegemite is actually being sold for 50c more than it is in the UK.


Many would argue that this is Vegemite being dumped. However, I would disagree with that. It is clear that there are much higher costs for food producers in Australia such as Kraft, which produces Vegemite. This is detailed in a recent KPMG report The Australian Food and Grocery Council State of the Industry 2013: Essential Information Facts and Figures. That report notes that one of the major costs for Australian food producers in doing business in Australia is what they define as 'trade spend', which is the payment of rebates, promotional allowances, special discounts and special payment terms to our two major supermarkets. KPMG noted that, in the last three years, trade spend had increased from 19 per cent to 24 per cent of total sales. That is a cost that is borne by Kraft, which increases their cost of doing business and selling their goods here in Australia, and this is reflected in our higher retail price. I would say that the product is not being dumped in the UK. It would appear they have much more competition in the UK and in New Zealand than we do here in our Australian retail sector, and that trade spend that is charged to them when they sell that good in Australia is not charged when they export those goods through the major supermarkets in New Zealand and the UK.


If we are going to stand here and condemn geographic price discrimination on an international level, we will also have to do the same thing about geographic price discrimination within Australia. The reason for antidumping legislation is to prevent harm to a domestic industry where a larger competitor, often an overseas competitor, sells goods at different prices in different markets, and that is exactly what we have here. That is what many of our Australian retailers actually face when they are competing here. They may find themselves in a market where they are competing against a company that is charging different prices in different markets simply because of the lack of competition.


This was detailed in a study by the Southern Sydney Retailers Association back in 2008, where they surveyed the price of a basket of fruit and vegetables in two adjoining stores of one of our major supermarkets. They found that, for a basket of 28 everyday fruit and vegetables, the major supermarket was charging between 51 per cent and 402 per cent higher prices than they were charging for the same items at their store four kilometres away. After that sustained geographic price discrimination attack, what eventuated was that the small retailer next to that major supermarket went out of business and we saw the large supermarket then jack up their prices. So, if we are going to condemn this practice internationally, we also must condemn it locally.


Ultimately, although our antidumping regime is important to give Australian industries a level playing field and enable them to compete, as we heard the member for Makin refer to, it is not going to help our industries if they are not in themselves internationally competitive. That is why we need to make sure that, whatever we are doing in this place, whatever legislation we are passing, we are doing everything we possibly can to make our Australian industries internationally competitive. Therefore, I thought it was worth noting the comments of John Hannagan, Chairman of Rusal, one of Australia's largest aluminium manufacturers. Of course, the aluminium sector competes in an international marketplace, and we must be viable and internationally competitive for that to continue. He was concerned that the effect of the carbon tax was that it was making Australian industry uncompetitive. He wrote an article in the Financial Review only last week, and I quote directly from it. He said:


We advised the government at the time that we would have great difficulty in establishing a sound business case for investing in major capital projects designed to improve the efficiency and emissions levels of the refinery. Our position remains unchanged.


He continued:


We will not invest another cent in major capital improvements until Labor agrees to the repeal of the carbon tax—bipartisan support is essential to enable the large, long-term investments required to maintain the international competitiveness of our industry.


An antidumping regime, no matter how strong it is, will not protect our aluminium industry from competition. They must be able to compete internationally. This is why we must be very clear that we cannot continue to burden our industries with these taxes, placing them at a competitive disadvantage where they act like a reverse tariff.


As for the stupidity of putting Australian industry at a competitive disadvantage with the carbon tax, we may hear some from the opposition say, 'Of course, this is to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.' But, perversely, it has exactly the opposite effect, because it will not mean that less aluminium is produced in the world; it will simply mean that production shifts to China. Now, in Australia the production of a tonne of aluminium emits an average of 0.85 tonnes of CO2, while in China the average emission of CO2 from the production of a tonne of aluminium is 1.35 tonnes. So all you are doing is knocking off Australian industry and having that production move overseas, where the emission of CO2 is greater. So the carbon tax not only places our industry at a competitive disadvantage but actually does not do the very thing it is trying to do, reduce emissions of CO2—it increases them. This is the danger and stupidity of the carbon tax legislation.


When it comes to dumping, we have seen some recent examples of investigations. SPC Ardmona recently put in a complaint, and an investigation found that Italian tinned tomatoes were being dumped in Australia, because they were being sold for less than they would fetch in Italy. They were causing unfair harm to the industry, and new tariffs were recommended. The problem with the current regime is the length of time it took to make that decision, because much of the damage to the industry would have already occurred. We need to make sure we are acting efficiently and quickly, especially when it comes to our rural and food-producing industries. 


That brings me to some of the great concerns that we have about making sure our small business producers, our small family farmers, can compete internationally, because we recently had the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union say:


… the day of ma and pa farming in Australia needs to end.


This is dangerous and misguided. He continued, saying the sector needed to have 'large-scale conglomerates that can diversify'. Now, I would suggest that the secretary of the Australian Workers Union consult his history book, because we have seen this idea before—that you do not need small family farms; you need large industrial conglomerates: that is what happened in the Bolshevik revolution, where we saw the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture. This is the same policy that is being recommended by the secretary of the Australian Workers Union. This is very misguided. This is dangerous.


We need to make sure that our food-producing sector and our family farms are viable and that they can continue and compete on a level playing field. That is what this legislation is meant to do. It is a small step, it is a small start, and I commend this legislation to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:21):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation before the House. It concerns dumping, but it also fits within the context of Australia as a free-trading nation, and I would like to make some observations about this before dealing with the details of the bill. Australia has been a leading advocate of free trade for more than two decades. While we have seen enormous benefits, such as greater market access for our exports and cheaper imports of everything from TVs, PCs and the shoes and clothes that we wear, it has not been without cost—massive restructuring of the economy and even greater exposure to the vicissitudes of international markets.




Governments simply must win support for open trade. The best way to do that is to show that there are benefits for Australians—as consumers, as businesses and as workers. It is not always easy, particularly when governments make populist decisions and give a nod to economic xenophobia. It is one thing to argue that the roll-back of protection has led to more efficient local industry, to cheaper cars and to electrical goods, but this is cold comfort to those who have lost their job, had to close their business or to send offshore some or all of their production.





Put simply
,
 if we can
not
 demonstrate that open trade exists within a set of rules, that these rules are fair and that everyone 
must stick 
to them
,  then we lose the argument.
 Moreover, 
we must be able to show that when someone breaks the rules 
there are consequences.


The rules are contained in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and 
Trade and 
in 
other bilateral agreements. They allow signatories to impose corrective measures to respond to dumping of goods and certain subsidies
 known as countervailing measures
. The W
orld Trade Organisation
 oversees the rules. In Australia
 the rules are also overseen
 by the courts.





Some argue that the imposition of a tariff in response to dumping or for any other purpose is a retreat to protectionism that distorts the efficient allocation of resources in Australia and props up inefficient industries. Others go further and argue that if a company or 
a 
country is willing to subsidise Australian consumers by selling us goods which are heavily subsidised or at below cost
, 
we should grab it with both hands.
 I argue that t
his is short-sighted. Importing goods at below cost may provide some short-term windfalls for some con
sumers but at the price of long-
term headwinds for open trade—the factory worker who loses his job, the farmer who 
loses access


to a local market 
who 
will turn their sights on a bigger target
, to 
the 
whole system of open trade itself. A point 
was made by 
the 
Productivity Commission, albeit half-
heartedly
,


when it 
accepted in its 2009 
r
eview of Australia's 
antidumping
 laws
 that o
ur 
antidumping
 framework was about 
'
system preservation
'
.





While these political economy arguments stack up
, 
there are commercial realities as well. Many ask—with some force
, I say
—about the impact on our domestic industry which is struggling to deal with the high Australian dollar while recovering from the GFC 
and
 dumped goods can be the straw that breaks the camel
'
s back.





In my own electorate, s
teel is a good example. In Australia
,
 steelmakers have had to make a series of 
very 
tough decisions
—to restructure
, 
to 
reduce costs and 
to 
focus on the domestic steel market. In the case of BlueScope it has mean
t large-scale redundancies and big reductions in spending, 
including the closure of one of its 
two
 blast furnaces.


These changes 
have been 
designed to allow it to focus on the domestic market
, which is 
worth around 2.5 
million tonnes per annum
. To put that into perspective
,
 China now produces about the same 
amount of steel within a month. 
Competing is
 not
 easy
 in these circumstances.


It is h
arder still when companies
, including Chinese companies, 
sell goods at 
or 
below cost with the objective of injuring a domestic producer.





In 
g
overnment, Labor strengthened Australia's 
antidumping
 and countervailing system to provide stronger protection for Australian firms from unfair competition.


We implemented the most significant reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 regime in more than a decade.
 The bill before the House is a logical extension of those changes. 





In 2011, we announced comprehensive, WTO-consistent improvements to Australia's 
antidumping
 system, as detailed in the Streamlining Australia's 
A
nti-dumping
 S
ystem policy statement.


We also established the International Trade Remedies Foru
m, 
ITRF
,
 to provide advice on 
antidumping
 matters, with members from industry, unions and government.





In December 2012, we announced a package of reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 system to deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas.


We recognised that as global economic circumstances change and Australia is facing intense and in some cases unfair
 or illegal competition from 
dumped goods
,
 more needs to be done to ensure that Australia continues to have an effective 
antidumping
 system.
 We were not acting alone. Other jurisdictions around the world, through legislative and administrative action, imposed new standards as well. 
Our reforms deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against u
nfair competition from overseas.





These reforms were enshrined in L
abor's Industry and Innovation 
Statement in February 2013
 and


in


a 
$27.7 million 
package of
 further reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 system
 including establishing a 
new Anti-Dumping Commission
er
 to investigate dumping complaints
; putting in resources to make 
it easier for 
small- and medium-sized enterprises
 to access and use the system
; and, we i
nvest
ed more than
 $24.4 million to increase 
the 
Custom
s
 and Border Protect
ion Service's investigative capability to ensure that they had the staff to do the investigations and to put in place the administrative arrangements to follow up complaints.





Strengthening remedies against overseas producers that injure Australian businesses by dumping and that attempt to circumvent Australia's 
antidumping
 rules
 were at the heart of these reforms. We also commissioned the former Premier of Victoria, Mr John Brumby, to conduct a review about the administrative arrangements, about whether it would be better for 
the new body to continue to exist with the Customs and Border Protection Service or move to the industry department. In his review of that report, he found that most submitters were neutral on the point. However, he left it open for further changes and administrative arrangements to be put in place if it suited the government of the day. So this legislation follows on from the track record of Labor in government taking this issue seriously.





The measures are welcomed by Australian manufacturers, including the largest manufacturer in the Illawarra, BlueScope in Port Kembla, and industry organisations including the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Steel Institute.





Manufacturing still employs over one million Australians
 and the agricultural sector is also a beneficiary of these changes with many thousands of Australians as well
. So it is an important source of 
employment and business. 
Our commitment to open trade means we are able to buy more with our pay


packet than we could 10 years ago
, but to ensure that we continue to maintain faith in our system we need to be able to show that Australia is not a soft 
touch for those who break the rules.
 We need to have the administrative arrangements in place to ensure that where rules exist they are enforced. 
That
 i
s why the
 legislation before the House is a logical extension of the reforms put in place by the former Labor government, enjoying support from all sides of the House. 





I commend the bill to the House.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:52):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Commission Transfer) Bill 2013. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to separate the Anti-Dumping Commission from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and transfer it to the Department of Industry. The commission would continue to exercise the relevant antidumping powers and functions contained in parts XVB and XVC of the Customs Act 1901. This would include the receipt and screening of applications for antidumping measures and the conduct of investigations and inquiries relating to those applications. I note that the bill would also transfer to the commissioner any antidumping powers and functions currently retained by the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service under the Customs ACT 1901.


We on this side of the House do not oppose this bill, but we note that it builds on reforms introduced by Labor in our February 2013 Industry and Innovation Statement. The initiatives in that package are still at risk of cuts. What is the government's position on those initiatives? The government needs to speak up soon and decisively to support Australian industry.


Industries, companies and workers are injured when goods from overseas are dumped into the Australian market. That is why it is important that we have a fair and effective antidumping regime. In government, Labor strengthened Australia's antidumping and countervailing system to provide stronger protection from unfair competition for Australian firms. We implemented the most significant reforms to Australia's antidumping regime in more than a decade. In 2011, we announced comprehensive, WTO-consistent improvements to Australia's antidumping system, as detailed in the policy statement Streamlining Australia's anti-dumping system. We also established the International Trade Remedies Forum to provide advice on antidumping matters, with members from industry, unions and government.


In December 2012, we announced a package of reforms to Australia's antidumping system to deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas. We recognised that, as global economic circumstances change and Australia is facing intense, and in some cases unfair, international competition from dumped goods, more needs to be done to ensure that Australia continues to have an effective antidumping system. Our reforms delivered stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas. These reforms were enshrined in Labor's Industry and Innovation Statement in February 2013, which included $27.7 million in further reforms to Australia's antidumping system. These reforms were, firstly, establishing a new antidumping commission to investigate dumping complaints; secondly, making it easier for SMEs to access and use the system; thirdly, investing $24.4 million to increase the investigative capability of the Customs and Border Protection Service, almost doubling the number of investigators; and, fourthly, strengthening remedies against overseas producers that injure Australian businesses by dumping and that attempt to circumvent Australia's antidumping rules.


The central objective of Labor's Industry and Innovation Statement was to build an economy which prospers in the 21st century and to create and support jobs. Our reforms to Australia's antidumping system were designed to support local businesses by ensuring a level playing field. In particular, the establishment of the Anti-Dumping Commission will deliver targeted resources to investigate dumping complaints and apply remedies where dumping is damaging local producers.


In government, Labor committed $1 billion in measures to support and create Australian jobs through the Industry and Innovation Statement. This included a series of measures to help Australian businesses gain access to major domestic projects, through changes to Australian industry participation plans. Labor's reform of Australian industry participation plans meant that domestic projects worth $500 million or more must demonstrate how they will provide more opportunities to Australian business. We set up a new Australian Industry Participation Authority to oversee these changes. We invested more than $500 million to establish industry innovation partnerships across the country including two in food and manufacturing, which are already up and running.


We provided $350 million as part of the Venture Australia initiative for a new round of the Industry Innovation Fund to attract private investment in the high-risk venture capital market. We continued to invest in the Buy Australian at Home and Abroad initiative, which included the appointment of supplier advocates, and the Supplier Access to Major Projects program and we continued to administer Australian industry participation plans requirements for government procurements and grants. We established the Manufacturing Leaders Group, a high-profile group of industry leaders, to provide advice to government across priority areas. We provided the Manufacturing Leaders Group with $5.6 million to 2016-17 to progress projects that will help improve productivity growth and ensure that Australian manufacturing is able to take advantage of opportunities in Asia and other markets. We invested $9.9 million in clinical trial reform to improve the conduct of clinical trials in Australia and support the pharmaceutical and medical research sectors.


All of these measures—Labor's $1 billion jobs package—are at risk of cuts by the coalition. While we do not oppose the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping) Bill 2013, we note that it does not provide the surety that Australian industry needs. The Abbott government is cutting the clean technology programs; it will not commit to programs under the jobs package; and it is turning its back on the automotive industry. It is time the coalition stopped turning its back on Australian industry and manufacturing and started helping businesses fund improvements and create jobs.


Dumping of overseas products onto the Australian market is becoming a matter of increasing concern for Australian manufacturers, food processors and food producers. In fact, it is putting many businesses under financial pressure, closing others and, with that, costing Australian jobs. I make two observations about why dumping is becoming a major issue of concern for Australia. Firstly, global multinationals deliberately sell products at below cost so that they can force competitors out of the market. When they have control of the global markets, they can then set their own prices. This is how large corporations operate and how they manipulate and monopolise world markets. There are many who will say that that is the way of the free market, that is the way it has always been and that consumers benefit as a result.


My view is that consumer gains are only short term and, ultimately, consumers pay more when the competition is eliminated. I note that many other countries have had antidumping legislation in place for some time. I also note from some statistics that many other countries use that legislation and whatever powers are available to them to counter antidumping measures on a much more regular basis than Australia does. Other countries use tariffs, import restrictions, quotas and a host of other trade barriers to protect their industries, whereas Australia complies with WTO principles and encourages free and fair trade. So Australia is considered an easy target. I hope that the free trade agreements that the government is currently negotiating with Japan, China, Korea, Indonesia and India, as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, do not further disadvantage Australia. 


The second observation I make is that the global financial crisis has caused a glut of products in world markets. These products, which cannot be sold, are filling up warehouses across the world and, in turn, are tying up funds and causing liquidity problems for those who own those stocks. The Australian economy, by contrast, is doing comparatively well. By international standards, I think it would be fair to say, we still have a very strong and robust economy—thanks to the Labor government's management of the Australian economy over those difficult years. So Australia is indeed a logical place to try to dump products, and that is exactly what has been occurring.


The Australian dollar is high, the economy is strong and so is consumption within Australia. Australia becomes an obvious place for those who cannot get rid of their product or who have a surplus of it to dump it. In fact, there have been reports in recent times of wind turbine towers being dumped in Australia. There have also been reports of a whole range of paper products, copier paper in particular, tomatoes, pork, biodiesel and canned fruit—to name just some of the products that are making their way into Australia as a result of the dumping that is occurring right here and now. 


One example of dumping that I wish to point to is occurring right now in my own electorate of Makin. Tindo Solar, a new manufacturer of new technology solar panels, is competing against solar panels that are being imported from China. The fact is that Tindo panels are manufactured at a cost that is competitive with the true manufacturing costs of those same panels in China. But, because the Chinese have a glut of solar panels—I understand that there are warehouses full of them—they are dumping them wherever they can at below-cost prices, making Tindo's operations much more difficult. Tindo is a new company, with a new plant. It is capable of competing at true cost with any other manufacturer in the world but it is being undercut because of the dumping that is taking place. I brought this matter to the attention of the House on a previous occasion, and I do so again because I believe it relates very specifically and directly to the legislation that we are dealing with. 


The last matter I raise is that of the Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. It currently has jurisdiction with respect to matters that come under the Customs and Border Protection Service. I note that, as a result of the legislation transferring functions to the department of industry and trade, that particular jurisdiction of the law enforcement commissioner will be lost, because the commissioner does not have jurisdiction over the department of industry and trade. Given that we are dealing with a matter that can very easily involve substantial amounts of money, I think it is very easy to see how improper behaviour might arise as a result of a process that deals with substantial values. 




Mr Baldwin:
  Do you understand what you are talking about? 




Mr ZAPPIA:
  Yes, I do. I bring this matter to the minister's attention because this is one of the changes in the legislation which the commissioner for law enforcement integrity currently has some interest in but will no longer have when the responsibility is transferred to the department of industry and trade. It is also a matter that the Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity may wish to have a look at. 


I reiterate what I said earlier: we do not oppose this legislation and we certainly support any measures that ensure that there is a proper counter-system to the dumping of products in this country. We also support any measures that ensure that we do not lose any more jobs here in Australia.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:06):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Commission Transfer) Bill 2013. This bill is only the first step in the government's plan to strengthen Australia's antidumping regime. Australia's current regime for combating injurious dumping and subsidisation is transparent and complies with our international obligations under World Trade Organization agreements. There is clearly room for an improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the current system, and that is exactly what the coalition plans to do. 


This bill contains changes to the Customs Act and other legislation needed to separate the recently formed Anti-Dumping Commission from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. This will allow the commission to transfer to the Department of Industry, where it is clearly better placed. It will free up the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to enable them to concentrate on other matters of importance to this government. This will allow those that are considering requests for antidumping action to benefit from the considerable experience and knowledge held across the Industry portfolio and it will ensure that the Minister for Industry has the power to make decisions on antidumping matters.


But this is not about protectionism; this is about maintaining a level playing field for all industries and all businesses in Australia. Antidumping is not about stopping cheap imports. There are a couple of ways that goods can be defined as being dumped. The first is when they are sold below their cost of production, and this is often predatory dumping. The other is simply international, geographic price discrimination. That is when an exported product is sold at a lower price in the export market than it is in the home market. This is often referred to as selling at less than normal value.


But there are sometimes legitimate reasons why goods may be dearer or cheaper in one market than they are in the export market. I would like to give as an example Vegemite. Some people may say is actually being dumped overseas. But this is not true. I remember during the last election the then Prime Minister Rudd standing with a jar of Vegemite and claiming that, unless people voted for him, it would increase in price by 50c—one of his spurious claims that the coalition was going to increase the GST. Of course, we know that was absolute, complete nonsense. This was the same Prime Minister who had actually raised the issue of high grocery prices in Australia back in 2007 and gave a false hope that he would do something about it—the full extent of that was nothing more than Grocery Watch.


But I will get back to Vegemite and how it may appear that it is being dumped, but it is not. Here, today, our two major supermarkets sell a 150-gram jar of Vegemite for $3.25. In New Zealand, that exact same 150-gram jar of Australian-made Vegemite can be bought for the New Zealand dollar price of $3.20—less than the Australian price. When you do the calculations so that you are comparing apples with apples—the Australian currency is much stronger than the New Zealand currency and New Zealand has a 15 per cent GST on Vegemite whereas in Australia there is no GST—it works out that consumers in Australia are paying a 32 per cent higher price than consumers in New Zealand. The same applies for Vegemite sold in the UK. Here in Australia a 220-gram jar of Vegemite sells for $3.84 in our major supermarkets. In the UK the major supermarkets—Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury and a host of others—sell that same Australian-made 220-gram jar of Vegemite for 1.87 pounds. Again, making an apples for apples comparison, 1.87 pounds converts to $3.34 Australian, so here in Australia that jar of Vegemite is actually being sold for 50c more than it is in the UK.


Many would argue that this is Vegemite being dumped. However, I would disagree with that. It is clear that there are much higher costs for food producers in Australia such as Kraft, which produces Vegemite. This is detailed in a recent KPMG report The Australian Food and Grocery Council State of the Industry 2013: Essential Information Facts and Figures. That report notes that one of the major costs for Australian food producers in doing business in Australia is what they define as 'trade spend', which is the payment of rebates, promotional allowances, special discounts and special payment terms to our two major supermarkets. KPMG noted that, in the last three years, trade spend had increased from 19 per cent to 24 per cent of total sales. That is a cost that is borne by Kraft, which increases their cost of doing business and selling their goods here in Australia, and this is reflected in our higher retail price. I would say that the product is not being dumped in the UK. It would appear they have much more competition in the UK and in New Zealand than we do here in our Australian retail sector, and that trade spend that is charged to them when they sell that good in Australia is not charged when they export those goods through the major supermarkets in New Zealand and the UK.


If we are going to stand here and condemn geographic price discrimination on an international level, we will also have to do the same thing about geographic price discrimination within Australia. The reason for antidumping legislation is to prevent harm to a domestic industry where a larger competitor, often an overseas competitor, sells goods at different prices in different markets, and that is exactly what we have here. That is what many of our Australian retailers actually face when they are competing here. They may find themselves in a market where they are competing against a company that is charging different prices in different markets simply because of the lack of competition.


This was detailed in a study by the Southern Sydney Retailers Association back in 2008, where they surveyed the price of a basket of fruit and vegetables in two adjoining stores of one of our major supermarkets. They found that, for a basket of 28 everyday fruit and vegetables, the major supermarket was charging between 51 per cent and 402 per cent higher prices than they were charging for the same items at their store four kilometres away. After that sustained geographic price discrimination attack, what eventuated was that the small retailer next to that major supermarket went out of business and we saw the large supermarket then jack up their prices. So, if we are going to condemn this practice internationally, we also must condemn it locally.


Ultimately, although our antidumping regime is important to give Australian industries a level playing field and enable them to compete, as we heard the member for Makin refer to, it is not going to help our industries if they are not in themselves internationally competitive. That is why we need to make sure that, whatever we are doing in this place, whatever legislation we are passing, we are doing everything we possibly can to make our Australian industries internationally competitive. Therefore, I thought it was worth noting the comments of John Hannagan, Chairman of Rusal, one of Australia's largest aluminium manufacturers. Of course, the aluminium sector competes in an international marketplace, and we must be viable and internationally competitive for that to continue. He was concerned that the effect of the carbon tax was that it was making Australian industry uncompetitive. He wrote an article in the Financial Review only last week, and I quote directly from it. He said:


We advised the government at the time that we would have great difficulty in establishing a sound business case for investing in major capital projects designed to improve the efficiency and emissions levels of the refinery. Our position remains unchanged.


He continued:


We will not invest another cent in major capital improvements until Labor agrees to the repeal of the carbon tax—bipartisan support is essential to enable the large, long-term investments required to maintain the international competitiveness of our industry.


An antidumping regime, no matter how strong it is, will not protect our aluminium industry from competition. They must be able to compete internationally. This is why we must be very clear that we cannot continue to burden our industries with these taxes, placing them at a competitive disadvantage where they act like a reverse tariff.


As for the stupidity of putting Australian industry at a competitive disadvantage with the carbon tax, we may hear some from the opposition say, 'Of course, this is to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.' But, perversely, it has exactly the opposite effect, because it will not mean that less aluminium is produced in the world; it will simply mean that production shifts to China. Now, in Australia the production of a tonne of aluminium emits an average of 0.85 tonnes of CO2, while in China the average emission of CO2 from the production of a tonne of aluminium is 1.35 tonnes. So all you are doing is knocking off Australian industry and having that production move overseas, where the emission of CO2 is greater. So the carbon tax not only places our industry at a competitive disadvantage but actually does not do the very thing it is trying to do, reduce emissions of CO2—it increases them. This is the danger and stupidity of the carbon tax legislation.


When it comes to dumping, we have seen some recent examples of investigations. SPC Ardmona recently put in a complaint, and an investigation found that Italian tinned tomatoes were being dumped in Australia, because they were being sold for less than they would fetch in Italy. They were causing unfair harm to the industry, and new tariffs were recommended. The problem with the current regime is the length of time it took to make that decision, because much of the damage to the industry would have already occurred. We need to make sure we are acting efficiently and quickly, especially when it comes to our rural and food-producing industries. 


That brings me to some of the great concerns that we have about making sure our small business producers, our small family farmers, can compete internationally, because we recently had the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union say:


… the day of ma and pa farming in Australia needs to end.


This is dangerous and misguided. He continued, saying the sector needed to have 'large-scale conglomerates that can diversify'. Now, I would suggest that the secretary of the Australian Workers Union consult his history book, because we have seen this idea before—that you do not need small family farms; you need large industrial conglomerates: that is what happened in the Bolshevik revolution, where we saw the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture. This is the same policy that is being recommended by the secretary of the Australian Workers Union. This is very misguided. This is dangerous.


We need to make sure that our food-producing sector and our family farms are viable and that they can continue and compete on a level playing field. That is what this legislation is meant to do. It is a small step, it is a small start, and I commend this legislation to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:21):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation before the House. It concerns dumping, but it also fits within the context of Australia as a free-trading nation, and I would like to make some observations about this before dealing with the details of the bill. Australia has been a leading advocate of free trade for more than two decades. While we have seen enormous benefits, such as greater market access for our exports and cheaper imports of everything from TVs, PCs and the shoes and clothes that we wear, it has not been without cost—massive restructuring of the economy and even greater exposure to the vicissitudes of international markets.




Governments simply must win support for open trade. The best way to do that is to show that there are benefits for Australians—as consumers, as businesses and as workers. It is not always easy, particularly when governments make populist decisions and give a nod to economic xenophobia. It is one thing to argue that the roll-back of protection has led to more efficient local industry, to cheaper cars and to electrical goods, but this is cold comfort to those who have lost their job, had to close their business or to send offshore some or all of their production.





Put simply
,
 if we can
not
 demonstrate that open trade exists within a set of rules, that these rules are fair and that everyone 
must stick 
to them
,  then we lose the argument.
 Moreover, 
we must be able to show that when someone breaks the rules 
there are consequences.


The rules are contained in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and 
Trade and 
in 
other bilateral agreements. They allow signatories to impose corrective measures to respond to dumping of goods and certain subsidies
 known as countervailing measures
. The W
orld Trade Organisation
 oversees the rules. In Australia
 the rules are also overseen
 by the courts.





Some argue that the imposition of a tariff in response to dumping or for any other purpose is a retreat to protectionism that distorts the efficient allocation of resources in Australia and props up inefficient industries. Others go further and argue that if a company or 
a 
country is willing to subsidise Australian consumers by selling us goods which are heavily subsidised or at below cost
, 
we should grab it with both hands.
 I argue that t
his is short-sighted. Importing goods at below cost may provide some short-term windfalls for some con
sumers but at the price of long-
term headwinds for open trade—the factory worker who loses his job, the farmer who 
loses access


to a local market 
who 
will turn their sights on a bigger target
, to 
the 
whole system of open trade itself. A point 
was made by 
the 
Productivity Commission, albeit half-

when it 
accepted in its 2009 
r
eview of Australia's 
antidumping

While these political economy arguments stack up

there are commercial realities as well. Many ask—with some force
, I say
—about the impact on our domestic industry which is struggling to deal with the high Australian dollar while recovering from the GFC 
and
 dumped goods can be the straw that breaks the camel

s back.





In my own electorate, s
teel is a good example. In Australia

 steelmakers have had to make a series of

to 
reduce costs and 
to 
focus on the domestic steel market. In the case of BlueScope it has mean
t large-scale redundancies and big reductions in spending, 
including the closure of one of its 
two
 blast furnaces.


These changes 
have been 
designed to allow it to focus on the domestic market
, which is 
worth around 2.5 
million tonnes per annum
. To put that into perspective
,
 China now produces about the same 
amount of steel within a month. 
Competing is
 not
 easy
 in these circumstances.


It is h
arder still when companies
, including Chinese companies, 
sell goods at 
or 
below cost with the objective of injuring a domestic producer.





In 
g
overnment, Labor strengthened Australia's 
antidumping
 and countervailing system to provide stronger protection for Australian firms from unfair competition.


We implemented the most significant reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 regime in more than a decade.
 The bill before the House is a logical extension of those changes. 





In 2011, we announced comprehensive, WTO-consistent improvements to Australia's 
antidumping
 system, as detailed in the Streamlining Australia's 
A
nti-dumping
 S
ystem policy statement.


We also established the International Trade Remedies Foru
m, 
ITRF
,
 to provide advice on 
antidumping
 matters, with members from industry, unions and government.





In December 2012, we announced a package of reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 system to deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against unfair competition from overseas.


We recognised that as global economic circumstances change and Australia is facing intense and in some cases unfair
 or illegal competition from 
dumped goods
,
 more needs to be done to ensure that Australia continues to have an effective 
antidumping
 system.
 We were not acting alone. Other jurisdictions around the world, through legislative and administrative action, imposed new standards as well. 
Our reforms deliver stronger protection for Australian industry against u
nfair competition from overseas.





These reforms were enshrined in L
abor's Industry and Innovation 
Statement in February 2013
 and


in


a 
$27.7 million 
package of
 further reforms to Australia's 
antidumping
 system
 including establishing a 
new Anti-Dumping Commission
er
 to investigate dumping complaints
; putting in resources to make 
it easier for 
small- and medium-sized enterprises
 to access and use the system
; and, we i
nvest
ed more than
 $24.4 million to increase 
the 
Custom
s
 and Border Protect
ion Service's investigative capability to ensure that they had the staff to do the investigations and to put in place the administrative arrangements to follow up complaints.





Strengthening remedies against overseas producers that injure Australian businesses by dumping and that attempt to circumvent Australia's 
antidumping
 rules
 were at the heart of these reforms. We also commissioned the former Premier of Victoria, Mr John Brumby, to conduct a review about the administrative arrangements, about whether it would be better for 
the new body to continue to exist with the Customs and Border Protection Service or move to the industry department. In his review of that report, he found that most submitters were neutral on the point. However, he left it open for further changes and administrative arrangements to be put in place if it suited the government of the day. So this legislation follows on from the track record of Labor in government taking this issue seriously.





The measures are welcomed by Australian manufacturers, including the largest manufacturer in the Illawarra, BlueScope in Port Kembla, and industry organisations including the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Steel Institute.





Manufacturing still employs over one million Australians
 and the agricultural sector is also a beneficiary of these changes with many thousands of Australians as well
. So it is an important source of 
employment and business. 
Our commitment to open trade means we are able to buy more with our pay


packet than we could 10 years ago
, but to ensure that we continue to maintain faith in our system we need to be able to show that Australia is not a soft 
touch for those who break the rules.
 We need to have the administrative arrangements in place to ensure that where rules exist they are enforced. 
That
 i
s why the
 legislation before the House is a logical extension of the reforms put in place by the former Labor government, enjoying support from all sides of the House. 





I commend the bill to the House.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (19:30):  I rise tonight to speak on a matter of great importance to my electorate and that is the disgraceful behaviour of the Abbott government in pulling the plug on the NBN rollout. In my electorate, many places were starting to get connected.



Dr Southcott interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  The member for Boothby might want to know that his office was not taking the phone calls of many residents who were trying to contact him to tell him about their distress. The response they got from his office was not supportive whatsoever. But I will stick up for all the residents in my electorate who need the National Broadband Network connected to their premises. We see the Minister for Communications come in here every day with hubris and arrogance. But what he is not doing is understanding the needs of local communities in my electorate.


We know that there were 18 or 19—the count is a little hazy—failed coalition broadband plans during the time they were last in government. Since that time, I have had over 700 people contact my office demanding they get the NBN to their premises. I have also started a petition on my website—and I have hundreds of responses from people in my electorate—urging the Abbott government to continue rolling it out to premises. Indeed, I have written to the Minister for Communications about this important matter. Unfortunately, he has once again displayed arrogance and hubris with his response, in which he says:


I find it remarkable that a member of parliament from South Australia claiming to represent the local interests of her community would demand that I continue Labor's fibre to the property national broadband network.


I do demand that because the residents in my electorate want it.


It is not only the people who sign my petition and the people who contact my office—the hundreds and hundreds. The demand for fibre to the premises is regularly evidenced in local papers. I have an article here from the Advertiser dated 16 November this year with the heading, 'Farmers market reaps NBN rewards' and another one from the Southern Times Messenger of 6 November titled 'Web road block'. These articles talk about people who are very upset that their small business or their home will not get fibre to the premises.


I seek leave to table these articles since the Minister for Communications does not seem to understand the needs of South Australians.


Leave not granted. 




Ms RISHWORTH:
  The Minister for Communications seems to think I am not representing my electorate very well. I would love him to come out to talk to the many hundreds of people in my electorate who want fibre to the premises. With the Liberal Party pulling the plug on the NBN, the suburbs of Aldinga Beach, Sellicks Beach, Moana, Seaford Rise, Maslin Beach, Old Noarlunga, Noarlunga, Noarlunga Downs, Seaford, Seaford Meadows and Port Noarlunga South have many residents who will not get the NBN.




Dr Southcott:
  Did you even connect one?




Ms RISHWORTH:
  Excuse me, Member for Boothby, but we did connect many people and you are obviously in some sort of imaginary place.



Dr Southcott interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  Why then will you not let me table these important articles which talk about the benefits of fibre to the premises? Are you scared of it? Is that the problem?


My residents want me to stand up for the NBN; they want me to stand up to ensure that it goes to the premises. The reason we need fibre to the premises is that the copper in the ground in the southern suburbs of Adelaide is inadequate. There are pair gains and there are RIM issues. Many premises do not have copper in the ground. The Liberal Party's plan to connect NBN to the node will mean that all those on poor copper connections will still not be able to get any faster broadband. They will not be able to get anything better. There is no plan from the Liberal Party—I have heard nothing from them—to say how they are going to deal with the issue of problems with the copper network. Are they going to re-lay more copper? If they re-lay more copper, surely they should just connect people to fibre? Surely the Liberal Party and the coalition government would just connect them to fibre? 


This is a sore point for the coalition. They are not listening to the people of Australia and they are not listening to the people of the southern suburbs of Adelaide who want a genuine long-term fix for their internet problems. Unfortunately, I fear that we are going to see broadband plan No. 21 or 22 from the Liberal Party fail. I call on them to— (Time expired)

 (Calwell) (09:30):  I recently conducted the opening of a very beautiful garden at the Catholic Regional College in my electorate, in Sydenham. The garden was the culmination of many hours of work by year 12 Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL) students who were tasked with the job of designing and rejuvenating the area in front of their college as part of their overall VCAL studies. This particular project formed the basis of the work related skills curriculum that required students to complete a work project whilst developing occupational health and safety awareness and transferable employability skills.


A local landscaper in the electorate, Mr Michael Casey, was engaged to oversee the project and acted as the 'token' employer whose job was to instruct students on how to go about the design process and how to acquire skills that they would find useful in their working lives. Initially students were split into project teams and submitted their own garden design. The individual designs were then incorporated into one master design that was applied to the final construction of the garden. The project team was also tasked with allocating students and it was all specifically tailored for them so they could best utilise their knowledge and develop their skills in the field of vocational training of their choice. I was struck by the real sense of pride that was conveyed to me by the students who had worked for that period as a team, as they worked together to achieve their ultimate goal, and I want to commend their collegiality and I want to commend the work results that they eventually delivered.


It was a beautiful day in Melbourne and the opening was catered for and hosted by other students at the school who are studying at the Trades Training Centre. The college received $6 million worth of funding in round 1 of the Australian government's Trades Training Centres in Schools Program and it has gone on to build this $8 million centre, which features, amongst other things, a restaurant, a print and design centre and a bakery and patisserie, which by the way sells its produce to members of the public. I was particularly impressed with the professionalism and discipline shown by all students. I want to take this opportunity to thank the principal, Mr Brendan Watson, for the incredible work that he does in assisting his students and in running the school; the staff landscaper, Mr Michael Casey; in particular, the students, Domenic Molluso, Liam Reynolds, Hugo Pereira, Georges Cini, Morgan Bussettil and Jeremy Boland; and as well Jillian Davis, the VCAL learning coordinator. It is a great school and they are great kids doing a great job.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:01):  In regard to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013, I think we have to understand that most of the oil that was released meant it was one of the biggest spills that could have endangered Australia and that this legislative amendment is an important change to the regulatory regime in relation to offshore petroleum management. A strong and updated regulatory regime in relation to offshore petroleum management was made clear by this spill. It is a necessity. This was from the blow-out of the Montara wellhead platform. The Montara development was owned and operated by PTTEP Australasia (Ashmore Cartier) PL and the area of this spill is located in the Timor Sea 690 kilometres west of Darwin in the Northern Territory and 250 kilometres north-west of Truscott in Western Australia. On the morning of 21 August 2009, there was a blow-out of oil and gas from the wellhead platform. Although 69 personnel on the platform were safely evacuated, a considerable amount of oil was released from the blow-out. Estimates vary but an inquiry observed that, if the worse-case scenario used in the initial response planning by PTTEP Australasia (Ashmore Cartier) PL meant 400 barrels a day were thought to have been spilt, the spill would have constituted 29,600 barrels or about 4,736 tonnes. This would have been Australia’s third largest oil spill after the Kirki spill of 17,280 tonnes in 1991 and the Princess Anne Marie one of 14, 800 tonnes in 1975. PTTEPAA advised the commission of inquiry that the initial release could have been as high as 1,500 barrels per day. If this figure had been the actual amount of oil released into the ocean per day until the well was 'killed', the spill would have been the largest in Australian history at 17,760 tonnes, larger than the Kirki spill which I have mentioned and which broke up off of the coast of Western Australia.


Most of the oil released from the blow-out remained within 35 kilometres of the Montara wellhead but some oil was observed 94 kilometres off the Indonesian island of Palau Roti and in the joint Petroleum Development Area off Timor Leste. The area of ocean where oil sheen or oil patches were observed was about 90,000 square kilometres. From 5 September 2009 through to 3 December 2009, two vessels were used to operate a 300-metre containment boom and skimmer around the oil well, which recovered an estimated 493,000 litres of oil or oil emulsion over 35 days of operation. Part of the response strategy was aimed at protecting Ashmore Reef, the Cartier Islands and the Western Australian coastline, because of their significant environmental features and the fact that trajectory models showed that the oil spill threatened Ashmore Reef and the Cartier Islands. A total of 184,000 litres of dispersants were used on the oil spill to accelerate weathering and breakdown of the oil on the sea over the period 23 August 2009 to 1 November 2009. 


On 5 November 2009 Martin Ferguson, the then Minister for Resources and Energy—the former member for Batman now departed this place—announced a commission of inquiry into the uncontrolled release of oil and gas from the wellhead petroleum. The inquiry was undertaken and a number of recommendations proposed. The government has agreed to a large number of these recommendations. New regulatory bodies have been created and relevant legislation passed. I think that we have seen with the events in the Gulf of Mexico that we cannot be too careful with offshore oil spills. They can cause severe damage to the country if the activities are not properly regulated by governments, particularly in their relations with commercial organisations which are seeking to exploit oil and gas.


The purpose of this particular bill is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to provide a new model for allocating cash-bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. In November 2012 the government announced the decision to apply the cash bidding allocation method for select blocks as released in the prospective 2014 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release. An independent and expert review of the act was conducted. It identified weaknesses in the current model that posed risks to implementation of the effective cash-bidding model. It proposed amendments to the existing cash-bid exploration permit allocation model in the act to have the following key features: limiting the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority; failure of highest bidder to accept offer results in the 10 per cent deposit paid by that bidder as part of cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth; full payment of the cash bid must be paid by the successful bidder within 14 days—previously 30 days.


The joint authority will set a reserve price for each of the areas being released. This price will reflect an estimate of the resource available. The reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications for the permit and, at the discretion of the joint authority, will be disclosed or undisclosed to bidders via the government Gazette. Where an offer is made below the reserve price, the permit will be offered at a reserve price.


Another of the regulations concerns the separate prequalification and bidding process. The prequalification assessment of potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to the applicants placing their cash bids. There will be a tie-breaker where two or more equal highest cash bids are received. In such cases, further cash bids will be invited from the tied applicants and the highest bidder will be offered the permit.


Oil spills threaten countries such as Australia. I commend the former minister for his inquiry. I obviously agree with the former government's inquiry and recommendations and am pleased that this current government is following up this issue, if not others.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:08):  I too take the opportunity to briefly speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill and the related bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013. As the member Melbourne Ports has quite properly pointed out, the purpose of the bills is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to provide an optimised model for allocating cash bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. The bills arise from a review of the current processes that took place some time ago—a review which was quite appropriate given the importance of offshore petroleum exploration in the waters around our country.


As we have debated in this place on other occasions, the importance of offshore petroleum exploration to the country is unquestioned in terms of what it means for the future of our nation because of the quantities of minerals and gasses that we understand are located in those waters. Simultaneously, the importance of preserving and protecting the natural environment is equally of immense value to our nation—and what is not often well understood or accepted is that the environment within the ocean waters is perhaps far more important than the natural environment that we see on a daily basis on land. In order to try and ensure we get a good balance of what goes on in the ocean waters, some of these changes have been brought in.


What this amendment will effectively do is introduce a two-staged process, whereby someone who wants to get an exploration permit for mining in the ocean waters is, firstly, assessed as to their suitability to even apply for the permit; and, secondly, if they are suitable, they are allowed to engage in a tender process. I will come back to the question of their suitability, because quite frankly I think that is a critical element of this proposal. Assessing whether an applicant is in fact suitable to be able to apply for a permit is critical to the whole process because the suitability of the applicant goes not only to the concern of whether they are suitable and competent to carry out the necessary work, and therefore ensure that the work they are carrying out is in the national interest, but it is also a matter of whether they are suitable and competent in terms of their previous track record in mining exploration, in particular their responsibility with respect to the environment. So the government is able to assess their suitability not only on the basis of their expertise but also on their compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and the level of responsibility shown by their previous activities in complying with all the environmental requirements placed on them.


One of the things that is not clear from the legislation is whether an applicant who is determined to be not suitable has an appeal mechanism available to them to be able to appeal the decision that they were not suitable. I could not find that anywhere in the material that I read, but it would be interesting to get a response from the minister as to whether there is a process available to them. I have no doubt that an applicant may lodge all of the necessary documentation, and perhaps be determined by the minister not to be suitable, and then in turn wish to appeal that decision because they may feel they were harshly or unjustly treated. Having said that, I have to say that I have no problems with the process being a two-stage one, with the suitability question being the first step of that.


The second stage of the process is where the government is now proposing to go from the current system, where I understand an applicant is allocated the permit on the basis of how much work they are expected to be able to carry out, to one where they simply bid for the right to carry out the exploration work on the basis of a value that the government has put on the area that is subject to the licence application. As the member for Melbourne Ports has quite rightly said, in the bidding process it is broken up into four categories: (1) limiting the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit; (2) the reserve price; (3) the separate pre-qualification and bidding process; and (4) a tie-breaker. They are all steps required to try and overcome different issues that may arise out of the whole process.


In my view the bidding process is the fair way to go. It enables an applicant to put in the bid that they believe is commensurate with the opportunities presented by the licence for which they are applying. It also has provision within the whole process to ensure that if the bids are tied then there is a tie-breaking mechanism. If a bidder puts in an application and then refuses to go through with it, they lose their 10 per cent deposit. It also establishes the process that will be required if none of the bidders put in an amount up to the reserve price that the government has set for it. Again, there are processes to see all of that through.


The whole process, I believe, will not only make the process of issuing licences much fairer but also make it more transparent. I think that that is critical given the immense interest that has been shown to date with respect to licences issued for permits to be granted in exploration of both land and sea opportunities here in Australia. We have seen cases in the past where licences have been issued to proponents and the activities resulted in serious damage to the ocean environment. We have also seen cases in the past where other activities associated with the mining, once the licence has been granted, have also resulted in serious environmental damage to the oceans. What we need to try to ensure is that that does not occur again. Whilst there is other legislation which covers some of the matters relating to the obligations of the people who are granted the permits and the penalties involved with them, I believe it is incumbent on the government, on behalf of the community that we represent here, to ensure that the processes that we apply are not only fair but responsible, because the last thing anybody wants to see is some of the environmental damage and catastrophes that have occurred in recent years both in Australia and elsewhere as a result of mineral exploration permits or mineral licences being granted in some of the sea waters around countries. We have had examples here in Australia and also in America where the damage that was done was such that it took months and months, and possibly even longer, to try to rectify or remedy it; in fact, I do not think it was ever properly remedied. The same applies with some of the areas here in Australia.


I think that in this country we have some of the most pristine ocean areas, which we need to protect. We also know that within those areas there are opportunities for mineral development and mining leases to be granted. So this legislation, in my view, draws the right sort of balance and, as I said earlier, picks up on recommendations as a result of a review that was commissioned by the previous government and which is now being implemented by the current government. I commend the legislation to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (10:17):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this legislation, which I believe is very important because it not only changes the regulatory regime that we currently have in place but also, as the member for Makin points out, gets the right balance between environmental protection and the issuing of permits, ensuring that Australia's exploration and mining industry continues to succeed. In Australia we have a strong commitment to the mining, petroleum and other industries. We are very committed to ensuring that we have a strong industry base, but we are also extremely committed to ensuring that our pristine environment is protected. Any issuing of permits and licences needs to take into account the need to preserve the environment.


The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It is providing a new model for the allocation of cash bidding exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. It is very important to mention at this stage that it was the previous government that undertook this. In November 2012 there was an announcement that we had moved to this system. The government then announced the decision to apply the cash bidding allocation method for the selection blocks released as from 2014.


The next statement I am making is a very important one: an independent and expert review was conducted of the act. It identified weaknesses in the current model that posed risks to the implementation of an effective cash bidding model. I am very supportive of any reviews that take place that really can improve the industry and ensure that the regime that is in place is the best possible regime, as I mentioned in the beginning, to deliver for the industry and protect the environment.


The proposed amendments will change the current cash bidding exploration permit allocation model in a number of ways. They will limit the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority, and failure of the highest bidder to accept will result in the 10 per cent deposit paid by the bidder as part of the cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth. Full payment of cash bids must be made by the successful bidder within 14 days; previously it was 30 days. So this puts in place a requirement for those who are involved in the industry to actually commit to the permit in a much quicker and more transparent way.


The joint authority will set a reserve price for each of the areas that are released, and the price will reflect an estimate of the resource available. The reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications, at the discretion of the joint authority, and will be either undisclosed or disclosed to bidders via the gazette.


There are separate prequalifications and bidding processes. Prequalification assessment of the potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to the applicant placing their cash bid. I think this is a very important aspect. It allows for the bidders' credentials to be looked at. This should take place definitely well in advance.


The amendments also introduce a range of tools to achieve more efficient allocation of petroleum permits. It is important that we have an efficient industry that operates in a way that is going to deliver the greatest benefit not only to the industry but also to the Australian economy. These changes will lead to that.


As I mentioned previously, it was the Labor government that, in 2012, announced that it would reintroduce cash bidding for selected offshore petroleum permits. Cash bidding was previously used in Australia between 1985 and 1992. It was used successfully in the US Gulf of Mexico and has recently been introduced for onshore coal tenements in Queensland. Last year the Labor government decided that cash bidding would be used from 2014 on, and we made that decision based purely on the fact that it was the best way to operate the industry, and that the allocation of offshore petroleum acreages in mature areas and in areas containing known petroleum accumulations was best served by operating under this new regime. Under the competitive cash-bidding system applicants offer cash bids for the right to explore, with exploration permits being awarded to the highest cash bidder. The legislation before the House follows the 2010 Australia's Future Tax System Review, which recommended a move in this direction.


I feel that this is very important legislation. It is noncontroversial simply because of the fact that we on this side of the House could see the benefit of introducing this regime when we were in government. I am pleased to say that the now government has picked up the recommendations and the changes to the legislation that we were looking at introducing before the election. These are changes that will strengthen the industry, improve environmental protection and ensure that we look after our pristine environment in those very special areas.


At the same time—because this is a cognate bill—the bill allows for the collection of annual administration fees by the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, and that will cover the ongoing costs associated with the cash-bidding bill. And so I am quite confident that the changes that have been outlined in this bill, which resulted from a review that was undertaken by the previous government, will benefit the industry, will benefit our economy and will be great for the future.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:26):  I am delighted to rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013 and the sister bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Green Hills Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013.


I am delighted for two reasons: firstly, it really is an example of what is very good regulation. While we quite often hear the current government—now and while in opposition—decrying regulation generally, you do find quite often very good examples of regulating, in this case by the use of a market based mechanism to achieve not just good economic outcomes for the industry itself but good outcomes for the Australian community in terms of safety and a return on the assets that it owns.


We should be reminded from past years how dangerous offshore exploration and drilling can be. We have seen two workplace deaths on offshore drills, we have seen a number of explosions and we have seen some unexplained release of hydrocarbons. We should always be aware that whatever regulatory regime we introduce in our offshore assets that safety of workers is one of the principal objectives, as also is safety of the environment. Our offshore assets are valuable for a range of reasons. They are incredibly valuable because of their pristine nature—'invaluable' perhaps one should say because of their pristine nature and the work they do in keeping our environment stable and in keeping us in good health. They are an extraordinary asset that we should be protecting for our children. But it is also because of this amazing wealth in hydrocarbon that sits below the ocean floor; these hydrocarbons belong to all the generations from now on and we must ensure that we get a return from them that we can share with future generations.


We are one of the world leaders in this field. We are incredibly good at finding and extracting hydrocarbons from below the ocean floor. We have been doing it for a while and we are renowned around the world for our safety record. But we can always do it better. The addition of this market based mechanism ensures the three things that we need to ensure—that human health and safety comes first, that the environment is protected in the way that we need to do for future generations and that we provide certainty and a return both to the businesses that engage in exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons and also to the generations to come.


It is a very interesting approach that is being taken here. It was first put forward and announced in November 2012 by the former Labor government when a decision was made to apply a cash-bidding mechanism to allocate titles for select blocks as released in the 2014 Offshore Petroleum Exploration Acreage Release. This model applies to the allocation of petroleum exploration permits for mature areas. They are areas that are known to contain petroleum accumulations and it is intended to prevent overexploration where none or little may be required. So this relates to areas where we already know that there are deposits or where it is strongly believed that there are ones.


It is a market based model and it imposes a competitive bidding system. But because of the issues of safety for its workers, the environment and the return to the Australian community, price is not the only indication. We all know of bidding processes where decisions are made once the bids have been put and they require judgements on expertise and on readiness as well as on price. They are incredibly complex and are not as transparent as one would want for the industry or for the community.


In this process the two issues of the qualifications to actually undertake the exploration and the drilling and the bid itself are separated into two processes. There is a prequalification assessment of potential bidders that takes place prior to the submission of the cash bids to ensure that those that are bidding are actually eligible. This involves an assessment of the technical and financial capacity of an applicant to undertake the exploration work offshore commensurate with being the holder of an exploration permit over the blocks that are being released for cash bidding. As a consequence of this, the companies placing the bids can be confident that those bids will be assessed on price and price alone and those assessing the bids can be confident that they are looking at price alone once the bids are placed. That is because in preassessment the judgements on whether a company is capable, eligible, has the appropriate record, has the appropriate expertise and has the appropriate financial assets to sustain their efforts in future years are all done prior to the submitting of the cash bid. So that part of the process takes care of a lot of the issues which have to be taken into consideration concerning the ability of a company to deliver safety for its workers and the ability of a company to be able to manage its exploration and drilling in a way that protects the incredibly valuable environment for future generations. That then means that when the bid is submitted the thing that matters at that point is the return for Australians and future generations. It is purely a matter of price at that point. So it is a very interesting application of a market based approach that manages to ensure firstly that the companies are able to deliver the things that the community needs them to deliver and, secondly, then considers price alone and the return to the Australian community on the assets which they own.


There are a number of other nice little bits in this bill as well and I do congratulate the minister and the government of the day, as back in 2012 there was extensive consultation on this process. In fact they brought in auctioneering experts and consulted widely. There was a very comprehensive process which led to the development of this rather clever approach.


There are two other elements that protect Australian owners of the assets and the companies themselves. Firstly, there is a reserve price, which is very important. The reserve price is set by the joint authority for each of the areas being released, so that ensures that the government cannot and does not sell the permits for less than a desirable price or below their public value. And the reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications and will be disclosed or undisclosed depending on the circumstances.


The reserve price will be set to ensure that if, at a point in the history of commodity prices, there is a slump in prices—and we know that prices for oil and gas and everything else we pull out of the ground go up and down—and the bids that are put in are less than the reserve price, those assets will remain in Australian hands until the prices are better. When you are dealing with assets that belong to this and future generations you never have to take a price that is less than desirable, because the assets stay in the ground until the price is right. In the growing market for hydrocarbons in our region it is hard to imagine that the value of our hydrocarbon reserves would decrease over the long term; one can only imagine them increasing if we wait for the right price. 


The second interesting addition to the bill is the limiting of the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit. Again, once a company has passed its eligibility process and submitted a bid, to ensure that the highest bidder is incentivised to accept the offer of permit, a 10 per cent deposit will be forfeited if they do not accept it. This discourages frivolous or ambit-claim bids and ensures that bids are serious. If you are the highest bidder and you refuse an offer of permit, you forfeit 10 per cent of the cash price of your bid. That is quite an onerous burden for a company making a bid that they do not intend to follow through on.


The other bill that we are talking about today, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill, is also an interesting one. It is the less complex of the two bills but it is an interesting one. It essentially requires companies engaging in the bidding process to pay a levy, which allows the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to recover costs for its annual titles administration activity. If we had actually managed to pass this bill—at the time it was a more controversial bill—I am sure that the then opposition, the current government, would have called it a tax. They do not seem to like the word 'levy' when we use it but love it when they do. 


This is a case of very reasonable cost recovery. The companies are making profits from the use of our assets, but they require this kind of regulatory regime in order to protect the community now and into the future from damage to its environmental assets. This ensures that our community now and into the future receives the financial benefit from the assets that it owns beneath our ocean shores and that these incredibly dangerous workplaces are managed in a way that keeps workers safe—they can go to work and come home again, as I put it, with all their bits intact. It is absolutely appropriate that the companies—a relatively small number of companies—that are engaged in this activity pay the cost of the regulatory regime. That is the second bill.


This is a very good pair of bills that takes a very practical, market based approach to ensuring that our very valuable offshore hydrocarbon assets are exploited in a way which is safe for workers, which ensures the best environmental outcomes that we can achieve, and ensures the best possible returns to Australians in this generation and the next. I commend the bills to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:38):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013. I commend the member for Parramatta on her contribution. I know that she is passionate about this topic. She is forever talking about hydrocarbons, and the pricing and extraction thereof. I have been in parliament for six years and have spoken on hundreds of pieces of legislation. Some of those were momentous, some exciting. This legislation is neither of those, but it is an important piece of legislation, supported by both sides of the House, in terms of ensuring that the Australian public receive the best possible return for the resources that they own. In fact, I would suggest that much of this legislation borrows elements from the Queensland Mineral Resources Act, a piece of legislation I know a lot about, having worked in that area in another life. It takes many of the competitive bidding characteristics from the Queensland legislation, so I am very familiar with that side of the legislation.


The purpose of the bills is to amend the act to provide a new model for allocating cash-bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. For those listening at home, the Commonwealth has control over the resources under the ocean and states have control over the resources on land. That is the way cooperative federation works. If we look back over the years there was much heated debate in this parliament when the states and the Commonwealth were working out that divide and how it was going to do it. In fact I think a previous member for Moreton, Sir James Killen, received a lot of attention over some of the sorting out of that process. The debate was nice and cold at the time—if you read the Hansard from the time at which we were working out the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, it was going to be the end of society as we knew it. Obviously that piece of legislation has resulted in $25 billion to $28 billion going into the coffers of the Commonwealth government.


Sadly, today we are having a similar debate about the MRRT. I understand that those opposite took that to the election and in their electorates they received confirmation that it is important that Gina Rinehart be given extra money. On this side of the chamber we support the idea that if super-profits are being made they should go to the Commonwealth. If super-profits are not being made, then obviously the tax is not being paid. So we are still passionate about the MRRT.


Nevertheless, in regard to the bill in front of us, in November last year the Gillard government announced the decision to apply the cash-bidding title allocation method for select blocks, as released in the 2014 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release. This is sort of like the way the gold rush was handled in days gone by, where it was said that you needed to put in a bid and stake out a claim. Obviously you just cannot stick up a flag like they did in the Klondike, as offshore exploration is a bit more complicated. You have to be able to put a deposit down. They set a reserve price so that speculators or carpetbaggers would not come in.


I think this method of ensuring we receive the best return on our resources is the envy of the world, although with the number of metres of drilling the Canadians are doing at the moment they have established a couple of factors that Australia needs to lift its game on. Where they have it over us at the moment is on the Australian equivalent of flow-through shares. I think it is still the Labor Party position that we would achieve this, even though it did not come in during the six years we were in office. The reason the cash-bid exploration permit process works is because of the great resource we have in Geoscience Australia. They have some of the best, if not the best, data in the world, which they are able to sell around the world at fairs and markets. The way that they do it is a lesson in federation, in that the individual states, although they are competitors, go to the rest of the world and offer an Australian product. I wish tourism would take a ticket out of this process. It is a situation where, even though northern New South Wales is competing against Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, we need to have one brand. I can see the member opposite nodding. I think it is something we need to work on a bit more: that we have that one recognisable brand. Rather than poor old Maroochydore going and trotting themselves out to the world, we need that Australian brand. But I think Geoscience Australia, despite the states competing for explorers, miners and capital, are able to go to the world and sell this information in such a way that for the last 20 years they have been able to sustain a level of investment that is the envy of the world.


There are a few grey clouds on the horizon and there are some bad decisions coming our way—I see Rio the other day announced that they are rethinking their capex in Australia, and a few other mines and exploration projects are on hold at the moment—but nevertheless this legislation, which is supported by both sides of the chamber, is all about making sure that we receive the best possible price. How do we do it? The independent review of the act said the cash-bidding model needed to be tweaked, so the proposed amendments to the existing cash bid exploration permit allocation model have the following key features. They limit the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority. The failure of the highest bidder to accept an offer results in the 10 per cent deposit paid by the bidder as part of the cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth, so it hits corporations in the wallet if they are not able to carry through, and that money must be paid within 14 days rather than 30 days. There is also something that I am particularly supportive of: even though capex is tapering off in the mining industry, there is a reserve price. So the joint authority—




Ms Hall:
  Why are you so supportive of that?




Mr PERRETT:
  Because the reserve price ensures that we get the best possible price, and it also means that only serious players come to the table. You cannot be a speculative outfit just trying to leverage money out of nothing when you are nothing more than a $2 company. Only serious players come to the table. That price is based on the information provided by Geoscience Australia, which is Australia's national geoscience agency and has some of the best geologists in the world, I would suggest. So this reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications for the permit and, at the discretion of the joint authority, will be disclosed or not disclosed to bidders via the government Gazette. Then, where an offer is made below the reserve price, the permit will be offered only at the reserve price. There is also the separate prequalification and bidding process. This prequalification assessment of potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to applicants placing their cash bids. The other feature that they have brought in is the tie breaker rule: where there are two or more equal highest cash bids, further cash bids will be invited from the tied applicants and the highest bidder obviously will be offered the permit.


I had a bit to do with this in the 42nd Parliament when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, chaired by the very capable Dick Adams. The deputy chair was Alby Schultz. In that committee, we were particularly looking at the greenhouse gas storage side of the legislation in advance of putting a price on carbon, realising that it would be in people's interest to be able to use these offshore facilities to store greenhouse gases. The reason I touch on that side of the legislation is that it illustrates how, in a carbon-constrained world, much of the low-hanging fruit has gone. It seriously calls into question the efficacy of the Direct Action policy that has been proposed, which we are yet to see unpacked or explained.


The reality is that most technical innovations—as I said, the low-hanging fruit—have already been taken by industry and households. When I drive around my electorate I see that just about every second or third house has solar panels on the roof. People are making the changes because they have experienced a price on carbon—that gentle guide to change behaviour, which is a market mechanism. Obviously the Labor Party still believe in markets, not in the command and control of Canberra bureaucrats. We believe in a market achieving the best price. It has worked for the last 5,000 years and it obviously will work when we are sorting out the future of the planet.


It will be interesting to see how people take advantage of the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage legislation in a direct action environment. It will be interesting to see who makes such choices, what public servant makes the decision to undertake such a speculative venture as putting greenhouse gases down in Bass Strait or the like.


The legislation we have before us is about achieving the best possible return for the Australian people for the resources, the hydrocarbons, that they earn. We know—the Labor Party and even those opposite know, because I remember what they said in the lead-up to the 2007 election when they were all gung-ho for ratifying Kyoto and putting a price on carbon—that putting a price on carbon will have the lowest possible cost to society. It will be interesting to see how direct action is rolled out.


It is 4 December today and I remember 2 December 2009 when the now Prime Minister became the opposition leader and that scuttled the deal that had been done in this parliament. Labor and Liberal had agreed to put a price on carbon. The ETS had gone through the lower house—supported by the member for Wentworth, I seem to recall. He came and voted with us. It went to the other place, where it was supported by Labor. If the Greens had voted with Labor, because two Liberal senators voted for it, we would have had an ETS back in December before we went off to Copenhagen. Imagine how the world would have been different if the biggest emitter per person on the planet, Australia, had been able to go to Copenhagen and say, 'We've done it.' Obviously, that did not take place. We cannot live in the past, even though that seems to be the prerogative of the current government. We cannot live in the past; we need to deal with today.


This legislation in front of us is about recognising that there will be a transition. Hydrocarbons will obviously play a part. They are a valuable resource for the Australian people. We can see the economic benefits that come when a country is not relying on hydrocarbons being imported. Look at the transformation in the US economy in the last two or three years. That is a story of hydrocarbons coming out of North America, rather than the Middle East. That is how the US is transforming its economy in the current climate.



This legislation is noncontroversial; it is supported by both sides of the chamber. I commend the Gillard government for bringing it forward and the Abbott government for bringing it forward. I commend the bills to the House. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:54):  The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 and related bill deal with our energy security and the efficient allocation of rights to explore for petroleum related resources. A stable and internationally competitive offshore exploration investment regime is critical to this objective. I think that view is shared by members of all the major parties in this country.


Each year the Commonwealth engages with stakeholders and releases offshore petroleum exploration acreage for competitive bidding by those in the industry who wish to prospect and explore. The amendments in these bills before the House introduce a range of tools to achieve a more efficient allocation of exploration permits. They are not new. In 2012 the Labor government made an announcement that we would introduce cash bidding for offshore petroleum permits. In fact, this returns to a system that had previously been used in Australia in the mid-1980s. In fact, it was used up until 1992. It has been used successfully in other jurisdictions including in the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, where they have massive resources and a lot of interest from explorers to exploit those resources. It has also been used recently in Queensland for onshore coal tenement titles. It has been proven around the world to be one of the more effective means of having an open and transparent mechanism for distributing these rights and ensuring that there is a fair return to taxpayers.


Pursuing this, last year the then Labor government decided that cash bidding would be used from 2014 onwards to allocate offshore petroleum acreage in mature areas and in areas containing known petroleum accumulations. So these bills, in effect, build on the work that the previous government did in the area and seek to make amendments to cash bidding for petroleum exploration permits functions to make it more efficient. Under a competitive cash bidding system, applicants offer cash bids for the right to explore with exploration permits being awarded to the highest cash bidder. So this legislation follows from the 2010 future tax system review, which recommends a move to cash bidding for these sorts of petroleum exploration permits.


The bills contain a compulsory payment of a 10 per cent deposit from all bidders as part of their cash bid—in essence, to ensure that we have bona fide bidders only and that people are not squatting on their rights. This is relinquished to the Commonwealth if the highest bidder fails to accept an offer. It is designed to guarantee that the bidder will accept the offer. The creation of a reserve price is to ensure that the Commonwealth does not sell the permits below their public value. And, finally, there is a prequalification of potential bidders for technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit to ensure expeditious processing of permits. It includes provisions to ensure that where there are two or more equal highest bids, a highest bidder will be determined and offered the exploration permit. Using cash bidding as the method to allocate petroleum exploration permits for mature areas, or those known to contain petroleum accumulations, is intended to prevent overexploration where none or little may be required.


The 2013-14 budget predicted that the reintroduction of cash bidding would provide around $160 million in additional revenue from 2014-15 alone, through to 2016-17. In a tight revenue environment where the present government is militantly denying itself sources of revenue from Australia's mineral wealth, measures such as these are absolutely critical—not just now, but well into the future—so that Australians, no matter what state they live in, benefit from the resources that all Australians own.


I said at the outset that these bills are a part of our total package of measures to ensure that we have resource security now and into the future. To that extent, I welcome the bipartisan support for this legislation and other measures. Of course, more needs to be done. I have in mind in particular the crisis that we are about to face, particularly in the Eastern States—particularly in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania—around the supply of natural gas. So if we are going to address energy security issues, and if we are going to have an efficient market for our energy resources, then we should be looking at each and every one of these pressure points. The position with the eastern gas market is something that requires urgent attention and legislation before the House.


You would know, coming from the Territory, Deputy Speaker Griggs, that Australia has an abundant supply of natural gas resources. We are set to become the second or third, if not the largest, exporter of natural gas in the world based on the abundance of our exploitable supplies. Against this background, it must strike Australians, whatever their political hue, as passing strange that over the next couple of years we are about to face a shortage of natural gas in the eastern states because of a failure of government policy to protect supplies for domestic users. The reason for this is that as large natural gas trains come on line in Northern Queensland they are going to be sucking up natural gas from right around the east coast and leaving domestic users, particularly manufacturers on the east coast of Australia, with a potential shortage of supplies and a doubling of prices. So whilst we are considering legislation which is about the efficient allocation of rights to explore our petroleum resources, we should also be considering policies and legislation before this House which deal with this impending crisis.


We are facing a situation where natural gas prices for domestic users could double by 2020. We have had a lot of hue and cry about the impact of a carbon price on electricity bills. All I can say is that domestic users have seen nothing yet. If we are going to address the impact on domestic manufacturers and householders, particularly in the eastern states, of soaring energy prices, then we are negligent unless we address this impending crisis.


It is not just me saying this; it is the large retailers of natural gas supplies in the eastern states and the large manufacturers as well. According to the managing director of New South Wales's largest gas supplier, AGL, when Gladstone comes online:


Gladstone is going to be like a giant vacuum cleaner for the East Coast gas market hoovering up all the gas it can get its hands on.


And they predict that natural gas prices are going to double for energy users on the east coast of Australia—potentially, further driving manufacturers offshore and seeing people switch from clean or relatively clean sources of energy such as natural gas back to electricity. As many manufacturers have told me, they have done the right thing in reducing their carbon footprint by switching from coal to natural gas, and unless this issue is addressed they will be switching back to coal—not because they want to but because the market will drive them that way. So if we are going to consider legislation that deals with our future energy security and ensure that we are benefiting all Australians with the wealth of natural resources that we have, then we should also be considering these important issues.


I do not want to see this situation for consumers in my state of New South Wales. I see the member for Paterson over there; he should be equally concerned about the potential impact on manufacturers and households in his electorate. I know he has had a lot to say about the impact of carbon pricing on power bills for businesses and households in his electorate. He should be worried sick about the impact on businesses in his electorate of a doubling in gas prices because of a failure of governments to address this impending crisis. It is within our gift to do it, and it is no wonder that the large manufacturing businesses in this country have formed an alliance to lobby all sides of parliament to do something about this issue. They are deeply concerned that a failure of policy in this area will see manufacturers go offshore.



Government members interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I am asked by the members opposite what I did when I was sitting on the other side of the House. I was the only member who brought this matter before parliament, and I did not enjoy any support from members opposite when I brought this before parliament as a private member's matter. I enjoyed no support from members opposite on this particular issue. There were declaratory cries and crocodile tears but no support and no action. Now you have the opportunity to do something about it. You have retailers and manufacturers crying out for action on this issue. You are now in government. It is time to act like a government and not like an opposition and address this impending crisis.


So I welcome the fact that you have picked up one of the bills prepared by Labor when we were in government to address the efficient allocation of exploration licences in the petroleum industry, but the job cannot stop there. If we are going to address energy security in this country then we cannot take our eye off the main game. It strikes Australians as bizarre that we are one of the world's wealthiest nations when it comes to natural gas resources yet we are going to be paying one of the highest prices for natural gas in this country, not because we have to but because of a deliberate policy by government to ensure that Australians pay some of the highest prices for natural gas in the world.


I commend the bill to the House. I think it is good legislation, but if members of this House are truly interested in ensuring that Australians reap the benefits of our bountiful supplies of energy then we have to address these impending crises, and I see no action at the moment. I see a big cry from industry. I see a big cry from gas suppliers saying, 'Complete the picture; do something about this.' So I call upon those opposite to do something about it, and you will enjoy support at least from this member of parliament in any efforts that you are able to make to ensure that businesses and households in my electorate and the adjoining electorates are not faced with some of the world's highest gas prices. While those opposite are whinging about the modest impact of a carbon price, they are taking their eye off the main game, and that main game is the price of gas in this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2013-12-04,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (11:08):  I rise to provide the closing arguments on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013. Every year the Australian government releases offshore exploration acreage for competitive bidding. The areas released are selected to offer the global petroleum exploration industry a variety of investment opportunities. The regular release of acreage ensures that Australia has a pipeline of exploration investment opportunities—an essential component of Australia's retaining its attractiveness as a premier investment destination for the oil and gas industry.


Currently, the Australian offshore acreage is allocated through a competitive work-bidding system, essentially, a tender system, whereby exploration acreage is awarded to those who will undertake the most comprehensive program of exploration. The system has served Australia's interests well to date and will continue to do so in the future for frontier area basins where the geology is less understood.


However the inclusion of cash bidding starting in the 2014 offshore exploration acreage as an additional method of exploration permit allocation in mature areas or those known to contain petroleum accumulations, is intended to prevent over-exploration where none or little may be required and to ensure the release of these areas continues to be equitable, economic and efficient. To enable this, the minister, Minister Macfarlane, introduced this bill containing amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to optimise the existing cash-bidding system in respect of both efficiency and administrative integrity by setting a reserve price in advance of bids being received, which will help to ensure the government does not sell the right to explore below its value and ensuring a return to the Australian community. It requires prequalification of bidders to ensure that eligible bidders have the requisite technical and financial capacity, encouraging serious and genuine bidding through the requirement to pay a 10 per cent deposit together with a placement of a cash bid, and specifying nondiscretionary tie-breaker mechanisms.


The member for Makin asked whether there is an appeal mechanism for bidders if they are assessed as unsuitable. Our response to that is that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act applies in this situation. The technical and financial assessments undertaken for cash bidding are the same as those taken for the existing work-program bidding for exploration permits.


Turning my attention to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013, the Australian government recently announced its intention to include cash bidding in the 2014 offshore exploration acreage release as an alternative method of exploration permit allocation in relation to mature areas or those known to contain certain petroleum accumulations. The inclusion of cash bidding as an alternative to work-program bidding is intended to prevent over-exploration where none or little may be required, while ensuring that the release of these areas continues to be equitable, economic and efficient. To enable this, Minister Macfarlane introduced some amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to optimise the existing cash-bidding system.


The National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator performs an important function in Australia's offshore petroleum regulatory regime through assisting and advising the joint authority and the minister, the responsible Commonwealth minister, on the award of titles as well as managing the ongoing titles administration function, including keeping a register of titles and data and information management. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to allow the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to cost-recover for its annual titles administration activities in relation to cash-bid petroleum experts. We appreciate the contributions of the members opposite and we commend this bill to the House.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (10:01):  In regard to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013, I think we have to understand that most of the oil that was released meant it was one of the biggest spills that could have endangered Australia and that this legislative amendment is an important change to the regulatory regime in relation to offshore petroleum management. A strong and updated regulatory regime in relation to offshore petroleum management was made clear by this spill. It is a necessity. This was from the blow-out of the Montara wellhead platform. The Montara development was owned and operated by PTTEP Australasia (Ashmore Cartier) PL and the area of this spill is located in the Timor Sea 690 kilometres west of Darwin in the Northern Territory and 250 kilometres north-west of Truscott in Western Australia. On the morning of 21 August 2009, there was a blow-out of oil and gas from the wellhead platform. Although 69 personnel on the platform were safely evacuated, a considerable amount of oil was released from the blow-out. Estimates vary but an inquiry observed that, if the worse-case scenario used in the initial response planning by PTTEP Australasia (Ashmore Cartier) PL meant 400 barrels a day were thought to have been spilt, the spill would have constituted 29,600 barrels or about 4,736 tonnes. This would have been Australia’s third largest oil spill after the Kirki spill of 17,280 tonnes in 1991 and the Princess Anne Marie one of 14, 800 tonnes in 1975. PTTEPAA advised the commission of inquiry that the initial release could have been as high as 1,500 barrels per day. If this figure had been the actual amount of oil released into the ocean per day until the well was 'killed', the spill would have been the largest in Australian history at 17,760 tonnes, larger than the Kirki spill which I have mentioned and which broke up off of the coast of Western Australia.


Most of the oil released from the blow-out remained within 35 kilometres of the Montara wellhead but some oil was observed 94 kilometres off the Indonesian island of Palau Roti and in the joint Petroleum Development Area off Timor Leste. The area of ocean where oil sheen or oil patches were observed was about 90,000 square kilometres. From 5 September 2009 through to 3 December 2009, two vessels were used to operate a 300-metre containment boom and skimmer around the oil well, which recovered an estimated 493,000 litres of oil or oil emulsion over 35 days of operation. Part of the response strategy was aimed at protecting Ashmore Reef, the Cartier Islands and the Western Australian coastline, because of their significant environmental features and the fact that trajectory models showed that the oil spill threatened Ashmore Reef and the Cartier Islands. A total of 184,000 litres of dispersants were used on the oil spill to accelerate weathering and breakdown of the oil on the sea over the period 23 August 2009 to 1 November 2009. 


On 5 November 2009 Martin Ferguson, the then Minister for Resources and Energy—the former member for Batman now departed this place—announced a commission of inquiry into the uncontrolled release of oil and gas from the wellhead petroleum. The inquiry was undertaken and a number of recommendations proposed. The government has agreed to a large number of these recommendations. New regulatory bodies have been created and relevant legislation passed. I think that we have seen with the events in the Gulf of Mexico that we cannot be too careful with offshore oil spills. They can cause severe damage to the country if the activities are not properly regulated by governments, particularly in their relations with commercial organisations which are seeking to exploit oil and gas.


The purpose of this particular bill is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to provide a new model for allocating cash-bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. In November 2012 the government announced the decision to apply the cash bidding allocation method for select blocks as released in the prospective 2014 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release. An independent and expert review of the act was conducted. It identified weaknesses in the current model that posed risks to implementation of the effective cash-bidding model. It proposed amendments to the existing cash-bid exploration permit allocation model in the act to have the following key features: limiting the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority; failure of highest bidder to accept offer results in the 10 per cent deposit paid by that bidder as part of cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth; full payment of the cash bid must be paid by the successful bidder within 14 days—previously 30 days.


The joint authority will set a reserve price for each of the areas being released. This price will reflect an estimate of the resource available. The reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications for the permit and, at the discretion of the joint authority, will be disclosed or undisclosed to bidders via the government Gazette. Where an offer is made below the reserve price, the permit will be offered at a reserve price.


Another of the regulations concerns the separate prequalification and bidding process. The prequalification assessment of potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to the applicants placing their cash bids. There will be a tie-breaker where two or more equal highest cash bids are received. In such cases, further cash bids will be invited from the tied applicants and the highest bidder will be offered the permit.


Oil spills threaten countries such as Australia. I commend the former minister for his inquiry. I obviously agree with the former government's inquiry and recommendations and am pleased that this current government is following up this issue, if not others.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:08):  I too take the opportunity to briefly speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill and the related bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013. As the member Melbourne Ports has quite properly pointed out, the purpose of the bills is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to provide an optimised model for allocating cash bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. The bills arise from a review of the current processes that took place some time ago—a review which was quite appropriate given the importance of offshore petroleum exploration in the waters around our country.


As we have debated in this place on other occasions, the importance of offshore petroleum exploration to the country is unquestioned in terms of what it means for the future of our nation because of the quantities of minerals and gasses that we understand are located in those waters. Simultaneously, the importance of preserving and protecting the natural environment is equally of immense value to our nation—and what is not often well understood or accepted is that the environment within the ocean waters is perhaps far more important than the natural environment that we see on a daily basis on land. In order to try and ensure we get a good balance of what goes on in the ocean waters, some of these changes have been brought in.


What this amendment will effectively do is introduce a two-staged process, whereby someone who wants to get an exploration permit for mining in the ocean waters is, firstly, assessed as to their suitability to even apply for the permit; and, secondly, if they are suitable, they are allowed to engage in a tender process. I will come back to the question of their suitability, because quite frankly I think that is a critical element of this proposal. Assessing whether an applicant is in fact suitable to be able to apply for a permit is critical to the whole process because the suitability of the applicant goes not only to the concern of whether they are suitable and competent to carry out the necessary work, and therefore ensure that the work they are carrying out is in the national interest, but it is also a matter of whether they are suitable and competent in terms of their previous track record in mining exploration, in particular their responsibility with respect to the environment. So the government is able to assess their suitability not only on the basis of their expertise but also on their compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and the level of responsibility shown by their previous activities in complying with all the environmental requirements placed on them.


One of the things that is not clear from the legislation is whether an applicant who is determined to be not suitable has an appeal mechanism available to them to be able to appeal the decision that they were not suitable. I could not find that anywhere in the material that I read, but it would be interesting to get a response from the minister as to whether there is a process available to them. I have no doubt that an applicant may lodge all of the necessary documentation, and perhaps be determined by the minister not to be suitable, and then in turn wish to appeal that decision because they may feel they were harshly or unjustly treated. Having said that, I have to say that I have no problems with the process being a two-stage one, with the suitability question being the first step of that.


The second stage of the process is where the government is now proposing to go from the current system, where I understand an applicant is allocated the permit on the basis of how much work they are expected to be able to carry out, to one where they simply bid for the right to carry out the exploration work on the basis of a value that the government has put on the area that is subject to the licence application. As the member for Melbourne Ports has quite rightly said, in the bidding process it is broken up into four categories: (1) limiting the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit; (2) the reserve price; (3) the separate pre-qualification and bidding process; and (4) a tie-breaker. They are all steps required to try and overcome different issues that may arise out of the whole process.


In my view the bidding process is the fair way to go. It enables an applicant to put in the bid that they believe is commensurate with the opportunities presented by the licence for which they are applying. It also has provision within the whole process to ensure that if the bids are tied then there is a tie-breaking mechanism. If a bidder puts in an application and then refuses to go through with it, they lose their 10 per cent deposit. It also establishes the process that will be required if none of the bidders put in an amount up to the reserve price that the government has set for it. Again, there are processes to see all of that through.


The whole process, I believe, will not only make the process of issuing licences much fairer but also make it more transparent. I think that that is critical given the immense interest that has been shown to date with respect to licences issued for permits to be granted in exploration of both land and sea opportunities here in Australia. We have seen cases in the past where licences have been issued to proponents and the activities resulted in serious damage to the ocean environment. We have also seen cases in the past where other activities associated with the mining, once the licence has been granted, have also resulted in serious environmental damage to the oceans. What we need to try to ensure is that that does not occur again. Whilst there is other legislation which covers some of the matters relating to the obligations of the people who are granted the permits and the penalties involved with them, I believe it is incumbent on the government, on behalf of the community that we represent here, to ensure that the processes that we apply are not only fair but responsible, because the last thing anybody wants to see is some of the environmental damage and catastrophes that have occurred in recent years both in Australia and elsewhere as a result of mineral exploration permits or mineral licences being granted in some of the sea waters around countries. We have had examples here in Australia and also in America where the damage that was done was such that it took months and months, and possibly even longer, to try to rectify or remedy it; in fact, I do not think it was ever properly remedied. The same applies with some of the areas here in Australia.


I think that in this country we have some of the most pristine ocean areas, which we need to protect. We also know that within those areas there are opportunities for mineral development and mining leases to be granted. So this legislation, in my view, draws the right sort of balance and, as I said earlier, picks up on recommendations as a result of a review that was commissioned by the previous government and which is now being implemented by the current government. I commend the legislation to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (10:17):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this legislation, which I believe is very important because it not only changes the regulatory regime that we currently have in place but also, as the member for Makin points out, gets the right balance between environmental protection and the issuing of permits, ensuring that Australia's exploration and mining industry continues to succeed. In Australia we have a strong commitment to the mining, petroleum and other industries. We are very committed to ensuring that we have a strong industry base, but we are also extremely committed to ensuring that our pristine environment is protected. Any issuing of permits and licences needs to take into account the need to preserve the environment.


The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It is providing a new model for the allocation of cash bidding exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. It is very important to mention at this stage that it was the previous government that undertook this. In November 2012 there was an announcement that we had moved to this system. The government then announced the decision to apply the cash bidding allocation method for the selection blocks released as from 2014.


The next statement I am making is a very important one: an independent and expert review was conducted of the act. It identified weaknesses in the current model that posed risks to the implementation of an effective cash bidding model. I am very supportive of any reviews that take place that really can improve the industry and ensure that the regime that is in place is the best possible regime, as I mentioned in the beginning, to deliver for the industry and protect the environment.


The proposed amendments will change the current cash bidding exploration permit allocation model in a number of ways. They will limit the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority, and failure of the highest bidder to accept will result in the 10 per cent deposit paid by the bidder as part of the cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth. Full payment of cash bids must be made by the successful bidder within 14 days; previously it was 30 days. So this puts in place a requirement for those who are involved in the industry to actually commit to the permit in a much quicker and more transparent way.


The joint authority will set a reserve price for each of the areas that are released, and the price will reflect an estimate of the resource available. The reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications, at the discretion of the joint authority, and will be either undisclosed or disclosed to bidders via the gazette.


There are separate prequalifications and bidding processes. Prequalification assessment of the potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to the applicant placing their cash bid. I think this is a very important aspect. It allows for the bidders' credentials to be looked at. This should take place definitely well in advance.


The amendments also introduce a range of tools to achieve more efficient allocation of petroleum permits. It is important that we have an efficient industry that operates in a way that is going to deliver the greatest benefit not only to the industry but also to the Australian economy. These changes will lead to that.


As I mentioned previously, it was the Labor government that, in 2012, announced that it would reintroduce cash bidding for selected offshore petroleum permits. Cash bidding was previously used in Australia between 1985 and 1992. It was used successfully in the US Gulf of Mexico and has recently been introduced for onshore coal tenements in Queensland. Last year the Labor government decided that cash bidding would be used from 2014 on, and we made that decision based purely on the fact that it was the best way to operate the industry, and that the allocation of offshore petroleum acreages in mature areas and in areas containing known petroleum accumulations was best served by operating under this new regime. Under the competitive cash-bidding system applicants offer cash bids for the right to explore, with exploration permits being awarded to the highest cash bidder. The legislation before the House follows the 2010 Australia's Future Tax System Review, which recommended a move in this direction.


I feel that this is very important legislation. It is noncontroversial simply because of the fact that we on this side of the House could see the benefit of introducing this regime when we were in government. I am pleased to say that the now government has picked up the recommendations and the changes to the legislation that we were looking at introducing before the election. These are changes that will strengthen the industry, improve environmental protection and ensure that we look after our pristine environment in those very special areas.


At the same time—because this is a cognate bill—the bill allows for the collection of annual administration fees by the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, and that will cover the ongoing costs associated with the cash-bidding bill. And so I am quite confident that the changes that have been outlined in this bill, which resulted from a review that was undertaken by the previous government, will benefit the industry, will benefit our economy and will be great for the future.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:26):  I am delighted to rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013 and the sister bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Green Hills Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013.


I am delighted for two reasons: firstly, it really is an example of what is very good regulation. While we quite often hear the current government—now and while in opposition—decrying regulation generally, you do find quite often very good examples of regulating, in this case by the use of a market based mechanism to achieve not just good economic outcomes for the industry itself but good outcomes for the Australian community in terms of safety and a return on the assets that it owns.


We should be reminded from past years how dangerous offshore exploration and drilling can be. We have seen two workplace deaths on offshore drills, we have seen a number of explosions and we have seen some unexplained release of hydrocarbons. We should always be aware that whatever regulatory regime we introduce in our offshore assets that safety of workers is one of the principal objectives, as also is safety of the environment. Our offshore assets are valuable for a range of reasons. They are incredibly valuable because of their pristine nature—'invaluable' perhaps one should say because of their pristine nature and the work they do in keeping our environment stable and in keeping us in good health. They are an extraordinary asset that we should be protecting for our children. But it is also because of this amazing wealth in hydrocarbon that sits below the ocean floor; these hydrocarbons belong to all the generations from now on and we must ensure that we get a return from them that we can share with future generations.


We are one of the world leaders in this field. We are incredibly good at finding and extracting hydrocarbons from below the ocean floor. We have been doing it for a while and we are renowned around the world for our safety record. But we can always do it better. The addition of this market based mechanism ensures the three things that we need to ensure—that human health and safety comes first, that the environment is protected in the way that we need to do for future generations and that we provide certainty and a return both to the businesses that engage in exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons and also to the generations to come.


It is a very interesting approach that is being taken here. It was first put forward and announced in November 2012 by the former Labor government when a decision was made to apply a cash-bidding mechanism to allocate titles for select blocks as released in the 2014 Offshore Petroleum Exploration Acreage Release. This model applies to the allocation of petroleum exploration permits for mature areas. They are areas that are known to contain petroleum accumulations and it is intended to prevent overexploration where none or little may be required. So this relates to areas where we already know that there are deposits or where it is strongly believed that there are ones.


It is a market based model and it imposes a competitive bidding system. But because of the issues of safety for its workers, the environment and the return to the Australian community, price is not the only indication. We all know of bidding processes where decisions are made once the bids have been put and they require judgements on expertise and on readiness as well as on price. They are incredibly complex and are not as transparent as one would want for the industry or for the community.


In this process the two issues of the qualifications to actually undertake the exploration and the drilling and the bid itself are separated into two processes. There is a prequalification assessment of potential bidders that takes place prior to the submission of the cash bids to ensure that those that are bidding are actually eligible. This involves an assessment of the technical and financial capacity of an applicant to undertake the exploration work offshore commensurate with being the holder of an exploration permit over the blocks that are being released for cash bidding. As a consequence of this, the companies placing the bids can be confident that those bids will be assessed on price and price alone and those assessing the bids can be confident that they are looking at price alone once the bids are placed. That is because in preassessment the judgements on whether a company is capable, eligible, has the appropriate record, has the appropriate expertise and has the appropriate financial assets to sustain their efforts in future years are all done prior to the submitting of the cash bid. So that part of the process takes care of a lot of the issues which have to be taken into consideration concerning the ability of a company to deliver safety for its workers and the ability of a company to be able to manage its exploration and drilling in a way that protects the incredibly valuable environment for future generations. That then means that when the bid is submitted the thing that matters at that point is the return for Australians and future generations. It is purely a matter of price at that point. So it is a very interesting application of a market based approach that manages to ensure firstly that the companies are able to deliver the things that the community needs them to deliver and, secondly, then considers price alone and the return to the Australian community on the assets which they own.


There are a number of other nice little bits in this bill as well and I do congratulate the minister and the government of the day, as back in 2012 there was extensive consultation on this process. In fact they brought in auctioneering experts and consulted widely. There was a very comprehensive process which led to the development of this rather clever approach.


There are two other elements that protect Australian owners of the assets and the companies themselves. Firstly, there is a reserve price, which is very important. The reserve price is set by the joint authority for each of the areas being released, so that ensures that the government cannot and does not sell the permits for less than a desirable price or below their public value. And the reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications and will be disclosed or undisclosed depending on the circumstances.


The reserve price will be set to ensure that if, at a point in the history of commodity prices, there is a slump in prices—and we know that prices for oil and gas and everything else we pull out of the ground go up and down—and the bids that are put in are less than the reserve price, those assets will remain in Australian hands until the prices are better. When you are dealing with assets that belong to this and future generations you never have to take a price that is less than desirable, because the assets stay in the ground until the price is right. In the growing market for hydrocarbons in our region it is hard to imagine that the value of our hydrocarbon reserves would decrease over the long term; one can only imagine them increasing if we wait for the right price. 


The second interesting addition to the bill is the limiting of the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit. Again, once a company has passed its eligibility process and submitted a bid, to ensure that the highest bidder is incentivised to accept the offer of permit, a 10 per cent deposit will be forfeited if they do not accept it. This discourages frivolous or ambit-claim bids and ensures that bids are serious. If you are the highest bidder and you refuse an offer of permit, you forfeit 10 per cent of the cash price of your bid. That is quite an onerous burden for a company making a bid that they do not intend to follow through on.


The other bill that we are talking about today, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill, is also an interesting one. It is the less complex of the two bills but it is an interesting one. It essentially requires companies engaging in the bidding process to pay a levy, which allows the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to recover costs for its annual titles administration activity. If we had actually managed to pass this bill—at the time it was a more controversial bill—I am sure that the then opposition, the current government, would have called it a tax. They do not seem to like the word 'levy' when we use it but love it when they do. 


This is a case of very reasonable cost recovery. The companies are making profits from the use of our assets, but they require this kind of regulatory regime in order to protect the community now and into the future from damage to its environmental assets. This ensures that our community now and into the future receives the financial benefit from the assets that it owns beneath our ocean shores and that these incredibly dangerous workplaces are managed in a way that keeps workers safe—they can go to work and come home again, as I put it, with all their bits intact. It is absolutely appropriate that the companies—a relatively small number of companies—that are engaged in this activity pay the cost of the regulatory regime. That is the second bill.


This is a very good pair of bills that takes a very practical, market based approach to ensuring that our very valuable offshore hydrocarbon assets are exploited in a way which is safe for workers, which ensures the best environmental outcomes that we can achieve, and ensures the best possible returns to Australians in this generation and the next. I commend the bills to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:38):  I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013. I commend the member for Parramatta on her contribution. I know that she is passionate about this topic. She is forever talking about hydrocarbons, and the pricing and extraction thereof. I have been in parliament for six years and have spoken on hundreds of pieces of legislation. Some of those were momentous, some exciting. This legislation is neither of those, but it is an important piece of legislation, supported by both sides of the House, in terms of ensuring that the Australian public receive the best possible return for the resources that they own. In fact, I would suggest that much of this legislation borrows elements from the Queensland Mineral Resources Act, a piece of legislation I know a lot about, having worked in that area in another life. It takes many of the competitive bidding characteristics from the Queensland legislation, so I am very familiar with that side of the legislation.


The purpose of the bills is to amend the act to provide a new model for allocating cash-bid exploration permits in the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. For those listening at home, the Commonwealth has control over the resources under the ocean and states have control over the resources on land. That is the way cooperative federation works. If we look back over the years there was much heated debate in this parliament when the states and the Commonwealth were working out that divide and how it was going to do it. In fact I think a previous member for Moreton, Sir James Killen, received a lot of attention over some of the sorting out of that process. The debate was nice and cold at the time—if you read the Hansard from the time at which we were working out the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, it was going to be the end of society as we knew it. Obviously that piece of legislation has resulted in $25 billion to $28 billion going into the coffers of the Commonwealth government.


Sadly, today we are having a similar debate about the MRRT. I understand that those opposite took that to the election and in their electorates they received confirmation that it is important that Gina Rinehart be given extra money. On this side of the chamber we support the idea that if super-profits are being made they should go to the Commonwealth. If super-profits are not being made, then obviously the tax is not being paid. So we are still passionate about the MRRT.


Nevertheless, in regard to the bill in front of us, in November last year the Gillard government announced the decision to apply the cash-bidding title allocation method for select blocks, as released in the 2014 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release. This is sort of like the way the gold rush was handled in days gone by, where it was said that you needed to put in a bid and stake out a claim. Obviously you just cannot stick up a flag like they did in the Klondike, as offshore exploration is a bit more complicated. You have to be able to put a deposit down. They set a reserve price so that speculators or carpetbaggers would not come in.


I think this method of ensuring we receive the best return on our resources is the envy of the world, although with the number of metres of drilling the Canadians are doing at the moment they have established a couple of factors that Australia needs to lift its game on. Where they have it over us at the moment is on the Australian equivalent of flow-through shares. I think it is still the Labor Party position that we would achieve this, even though it did not come in during the six years we were in office. The reason the cash-bid exploration permit process works is because of the great resource we have in Geoscience Australia. They have some of the best, if not the best, data in the world, which they are able to sell around the world at fairs and markets. The way that they do it is a lesson in federation, in that the individual states, although they are competitors, go to the rest of the world and offer an Australian product. I wish tourism would take a ticket out of this process. It is a situation where, even though northern New South Wales is competing against Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, we need to have one brand. I can see the member opposite nodding. I think it is something we need to work on a bit more: that we have that one recognisable brand. Rather than poor old Maroochydore going and trotting themselves out to the world, we need that Australian brand. But I think Geoscience Australia, despite the states competing for explorers, miners and capital, are able to go to the world and sell this information in such a way that for the last 20 years they have been able to sustain a level of investment that is the envy of the world.


There are a few grey clouds on the horizon and there are some bad decisions coming our way—I see Rio the other day announced that they are rethinking their capex in Australia, and a few other mines and exploration projects are on hold at the moment—but nevertheless this legislation, which is supported by both sides of the chamber, is all about making sure that we receive the best possible price. How do we do it? The independent review of the act said the cash-bidding model needed to be tweaked, so the proposed amendments to the existing cash bid exploration permit allocation model have the following key features. They limit the discretion to refuse an offer of a permit made by the joint authority. The failure of the highest bidder to accept an offer results in the 10 per cent deposit paid by the bidder as part of the cash bid being forfeited to the Commonwealth, so it hits corporations in the wallet if they are not able to carry through, and that money must be paid within 14 days rather than 30 days. There is also something that I am particularly supportive of: even though capex is tapering off in the mining industry, there is a reserve price. So the joint authority—




Ms Hall:
  Why are you so supportive of that?




Mr PERRETT:
  Because the reserve price ensures that we get the best possible price, and it also means that only serious players come to the table. You cannot be a speculative outfit just trying to leverage money out of nothing when you are nothing more than a $2 company. Only serious players come to the table. That price is based on the information provided by Geoscience Australia, which is Australia's national geoscience agency and has some of the best geologists in the world, I would suggest. So this reserve price will be determined in advance of inviting applications for the permit and, at the discretion of the joint authority, will be disclosed or not disclosed to bidders via the government Gazette. Then, where an offer is made below the reserve price, the permit will be offered only at the reserve price. There is also the separate prequalification and bidding process. This prequalification assessment of potential bidders' technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit will take place prior to applicants placing their cash bids. The other feature that they have brought in is the tie breaker rule: where there are two or more equal highest cash bids, further cash bids will be invited from the tied applicants and the highest bidder obviously will be offered the permit.


I had a bit to do with this in the 42nd Parliament when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources, chaired by the very capable Dick Adams. The deputy chair was Alby Schultz. In that committee, we were particularly looking at the greenhouse gas storage side of the legislation in advance of putting a price on carbon, realising that it would be in people's interest to be able to use these offshore facilities to store greenhouse gases. The reason I touch on that side of the legislation is that it illustrates how, in a carbon-constrained world, much of the low-hanging fruit has gone. It seriously calls into question the efficacy of the Direct Action policy that has been proposed, which we are yet to see unpacked or explained.


The reality is that most technical innovations—as I said, the low-hanging fruit—have already been taken by industry and households. When I drive around my electorate I see that just about every second or third house has solar panels on the roof. People are making the changes because they have experienced a price on carbon—that gentle guide to change behaviour, which is a market mechanism. Obviously the Labor Party still believe in markets, not in the command and control of Canberra bureaucrats. We believe in a market achieving the best price. It has worked for the last 5,000 years and it obviously will work when we are sorting out the future of the planet.


It will be interesting to see how people take advantage of the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage legislation in a direct action environment. It will be interesting to see who makes such choices, what public servant makes the decision to undertake such a speculative venture as putting greenhouse gases down in Bass Strait or the like.


The legislation we have before us is about achieving the best possible return for the Australian people for the resources, the hydrocarbons, that they earn. We know—the Labor Party and even those opposite know, because I remember what they said in the lead-up to the 2007 election when they were all gung-ho for ratifying Kyoto and putting a price on carbon—that putting a price on carbon will have the lowest possible cost to society. It will be interesting to see how direct action is rolled out.


It is 4 December today and I remember 2 December 2009 when the now Prime Minister became the opposition leader and that scuttled the deal that had been done in this parliament. Labor and Liberal had agreed to put a price on carbon. The ETS had gone through the lower house—supported by the member for Wentworth, I seem to recall. He came and voted with us. It went to the other place, where it was supported by Labor. If the Greens had voted with Labor, because two Liberal senators voted for it, we would have had an ETS back in December before we went off to Copenhagen. Imagine how the world would have been different if the biggest emitter per person on the planet, Australia, had been able to go to Copenhagen and say, 'We've done it.' Obviously, that did not take place. We cannot live in the past, even though that seems to be the prerogative of the current government. We cannot live in the past; we need to deal with today.


This legislation in front of us is about recognising that there will be a transition. Hydrocarbons will obviously play a part. They are a valuable resource for the Australian people. We can see the economic benefits that come when a country is not relying on hydrocarbons being imported. Look at the transformation in the US economy in the last two or three years. That is a story of hydrocarbons coming out of North America, rather than the Middle East. That is how the US is transforming its economy in the current climate.



This legislation is noncontroversial; it is supported by both sides of the chamber. I commend the Gillard government for bringing it forward and the Abbott government for bringing it forward. I commend the bills to the House. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-12-04,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:54):  The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 and related bill deal with our energy security and the efficient allocation of rights to explore for petroleum related resources. A stable and internationally competitive offshore exploration investment regime is critical to this objective. I think that view is shared by members of all the major parties in this country.


Each year the Commonwealth engages with stakeholders and releases offshore petroleum exploration acreage for competitive bidding by those in the industry who wish to prospect and explore. The amendments in these bills before the House introduce a range of tools to achieve a more efficient allocation of exploration permits. They are not new. In 2012 the Labor government made an announcement that we would introduce cash bidding for offshore petroleum permits. In fact, this returns to a system that had previously been used in Australia in the mid-1980s. In fact, it was used up until 1992. It has been used successfully in other jurisdictions including in the United States in the Gulf of Mexico, where they have massive resources and a lot of interest from explorers to exploit those resources. It has also been used recently in Queensland for onshore coal tenement titles. It has been proven around the world to be one of the more effective means of having an open and transparent mechanism for distributing these rights and ensuring that there is a fair return to taxpayers.


Pursuing this, last year the then Labor government decided that cash bidding would be used from 2014 onwards to allocate offshore petroleum acreage in mature areas and in areas containing known petroleum accumulations. So these bills, in effect, build on the work that the previous government did in the area and seek to make amendments to cash bidding for petroleum exploration permits functions to make it more efficient. Under a competitive cash bidding system, applicants offer cash bids for the right to explore with exploration permits being awarded to the highest cash bidder. So this legislation follows from the 2010 future tax system review, which recommends a move to cash bidding for these sorts of petroleum exploration permits.


The bills contain a compulsory payment of a 10 per cent deposit from all bidders as part of their cash bid—in essence, to ensure that we have bona fide bidders only and that people are not squatting on their rights. This is relinquished to the Commonwealth if the highest bidder fails to accept an offer. It is designed to guarantee that the bidder will accept the offer. The creation of a reserve price is to ensure that the Commonwealth does not sell the permits below their public value. And, finally, there is a prequalification of potential bidders for technical and financial capacity to hold an exploration permit to ensure expeditious processing of permits. It includes provisions to ensure that where there are two or more equal highest bids, a highest bidder will be determined and offered the exploration permit. Using cash bidding as the method to allocate petroleum exploration permits for mature areas, or those known to contain petroleum accumulations, is intended to prevent overexploration where none or little may be required.


The 2013-14 budget predicted that the reintroduction of cash bidding would provide around $160 million in additional revenue from 2014-15 alone, through to 2016-17. In a tight revenue environment where the present government is militantly denying itself sources of revenue from Australia's mineral wealth, measures such as these are absolutely critical—not just now, but well into the future—so that Australians, no matter what state they live in, benefit from the resources that all Australians own.


I said at the outset that these bills are a part of our total package of measures to ensure that we have resource security now and into the future. To that extent, I welcome the bipartisan support for this legislation and other measures. Of course, more needs to be done. I have in mind in particular the crisis that we are about to face, particularly in the Eastern States—particularly in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania—around the supply of natural gas. So if we are going to address energy security issues, and if we are going to have an efficient market for our energy resources, then we should be looking at each and every one of these pressure points. The position with the eastern gas market is something that requires urgent attention and legislation before the House.


You would know, coming from the Territory, Deputy Speaker Griggs, that Australia has an abundant supply of natural gas resources. We are set to become the second or third, if not the largest, exporter of natural gas in the world based on the abundance of our exploitable supplies. Against this background, it must strike Australians, whatever their political hue, as passing strange that over the next couple of years we are about to face a shortage of natural gas in the eastern states because of a failure of government policy to protect supplies for domestic users. The reason for this is that as large natural gas trains come on line in Northern Queensland they are going to be sucking up natural gas from right around the east coast and leaving domestic users, particularly manufacturers on the east coast of Australia, with a potential shortage of supplies and a doubling of prices. So whilst we are considering legislation which is about the efficient allocation of rights to explore our petroleum resources, we should also be considering policies and legislation before this House which deal with this impending crisis.


We are facing a situation where natural gas prices for domestic users could double by 2020. We have had a lot of hue and cry about the impact of a carbon price on electricity bills. All I can say is that domestic users have seen nothing yet. If we are going to address the impact on domestic manufacturers and householders, particularly in the eastern states, of soaring energy prices, then we are negligent unless we address this impending crisis.


It is not just me saying this; it is the large retailers of natural gas supplies in the eastern states and the large manufacturers as well. According to the managing director of New South Wales's largest gas supplier, AGL, when Gladstone comes online:


Gladstone is going to be like a giant vacuum cleaner for the East Coast gas market hoovering up all the gas it can get its hands on.


And they predict that natural gas prices are going to double for energy users on the east coast of Australia—potentially, further driving manufacturers offshore and seeing people switch from clean or relatively clean sources of energy such as natural gas back to electricity. As many manufacturers have told me, they have done the right thing in reducing their carbon footprint by switching from coal to natural gas, and unless this issue is addressed they will be switching back to coal—not because they want to but because the market will drive them that way. So if we are going to consider legislation that deals with our future energy security and ensure that we are benefiting all Australians with the wealth of natural resources that we have, then we should also be considering these important issues.


I do not want to see this situation for consumers in my state of New South Wales. I see the member for Paterson over there; he should be equally concerned about the potential impact on manufacturers and households in his electorate. I know he has had a lot to say about the impact of carbon pricing on power bills for businesses and households in his electorate. He should be worried sick about the impact on businesses in his electorate of a doubling in gas prices because of a failure of governments to address this impending crisis. It is within our gift to do it, and it is no wonder that the large manufacturing businesses in this country have formed an alliance to lobby all sides of parliament to do something about this issue. They are deeply concerned that a failure of policy in this area will see manufacturers go offshore.



Government members interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I am asked by the members opposite what I did when I was sitting on the other side of the House. I was the only member who brought this matter before parliament, and I did not enjoy any support from members opposite when I brought this before parliament as a private member's matter. I enjoyed no support from members opposite on this particular issue. There were declaratory cries and crocodile tears but no support and no action. Now you have the opportunity to do something about it. You have retailers and manufacturers crying out for action on this issue. You are now in government. It is time to act like a government and not like an opposition and address this impending crisis.


So I welcome the fact that you have picked up one of the bills prepared by Labor when we were in government to address the efficient allocation of exploration licences in the petroleum industry, but the job cannot stop there. If we are going to address energy security in this country then we cannot take our eye off the main game. It strikes Australians as bizarre that we are one of the world's wealthiest nations when it comes to natural gas resources yet we are going to be paying one of the highest prices for natural gas in this country, not because we have to but because of a deliberate policy by government to ensure that Australians pay some of the highest prices for natural gas in the world.


I commend the bill to the House. I think it is good legislation, but if members of this House are truly interested in ensuring that Australians reap the benefits of our bountiful supplies of energy then we have to address these impending crises, and I see no action at the moment. I see a big cry from industry. I see a big cry from gas suppliers saying, 'Complete the picture; do something about this.' So I call upon those opposite to do something about it, and you will enjoy support at least from this member of parliament in any efforts that you are able to make to ensure that businesses and households in my electorate and the adjoining electorates are not faced with some of the world's highest gas prices. While those opposite are whinging about the modest impact of a carbon price, they are taking their eye off the main game, and that main game is the price of gas in this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (11:08):  I rise to provide the closing arguments on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cash Bidding) Bill 2013 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013. Every year the Australian government releases offshore exploration acreage for competitive bidding. The areas released are selected to offer the global petroleum exploration industry a variety of investment opportunities. The regular release of acreage ensures that Australia has a pipeline of exploration investment opportunities—an essential component of Australia's retaining its attractiveness as a premier investment destination for the oil and gas industry.


Currently, the Australian offshore acreage is allocated through a competitive work-bidding system, essentially, a tender system, whereby exploration acreage is awarded to those who will undertake the most comprehensive program of exploration. The system has served Australia's interests well to date and will continue to do so in the future for frontier area basins where the geology is less understood.


However the inclusion of cash bidding starting in the 2014 offshore exploration acreage as an additional method of exploration permit allocation in mature areas or those known to contain petroleum accumulations, is intended to prevent over-exploration where none or little may be required and to ensure the release of these areas continues to be equitable, economic and efficient. To enable this, the minister, Minister Macfarlane, introduced this bill containing amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to optimise the existing cash-bidding system in respect of both efficiency and administrative integrity by setting a reserve price in advance of bids being received, which will help to ensure the government does not sell the right to explore below its value and ensuring a return to the Australian community. It requires prequalification of bidders to ensure that eligible bidders have the requisite technical and financial capacity, encouraging serious and genuine bidding through the requirement to pay a 10 per cent deposit together with a placement of a cash bid, and specifying nondiscretionary tie-breaker mechanisms.


The member for Makin asked whether there is an appeal mechanism for bidders if they are assessed as unsuitable. Our response to that is that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act applies in this situation. The technical and financial assessments undertaken for cash bidding are the same as those taken for the existing work-program bidding for exploration permits.


Turning my attention to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2013, the Australian government recently announced its intention to include cash bidding in the 2014 offshore exploration acreage release as an alternative method of exploration permit allocation in relation to mature areas or those known to contain certain petroleum accumulations. The inclusion of cash bidding as an alternative to work-program bidding is intended to prevent over-exploration where none or little may be required, while ensuring that the release of these areas continues to be equitable, economic and efficient. To enable this, Minister Macfarlane introduced some amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to optimise the existing cash-bidding system.


The National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator performs an important function in Australia's offshore petroleum regulatory regime through assisting and advising the joint authority and the minister, the responsible Commonwealth minister, on the award of titles as well as managing the ongoing titles administration function, including keeping a register of titles and data and information management. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to allow the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to cost-recover for its annual titles administration activities in relation to cash-bid petroleum experts. We appreciate the contributions of the members opposite and we commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.
