Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014 will contribute to the success of the G20 later this year.


It will do this by ensuring the powers that can be exercised by police and other authorised persons are clear and unambiguous. These powers are designed to provide for the safety and security of people and property at the Brisbane Airport during the leaders' summit in November.


The G20 is an important global forum.


It brings together the leaders of the world's biggest economies to play a leadership role in addressing economic issues that matter to all countries, members and non-members alike.


Collectively, G20 member countries represent around 85 per cent of global GDP, over 75 per cent of global trade and two-thirds of the world's population. Australia assumed the G20 presidency in December last year. To be able to host the next round of G20 events this year is a great privilege.


These events will bring national leaders and a range of other influential international figures to our shores.


This presents an opportunity for Australia to demonstrate its leadership both regionally and globally on economic issues in a tough economic climate.


As Chair, the Prime Minister has structured this year's events around the key themes of:


Promoting stronger economic growth and employment outcomes


Making the global economy more resilient to deal with future challenges


Finance ministers and central bank governors had a successful meeting in February and will meet again in September.


Trade ministers will meet in July and employment ministers will meet in September.


These meetings will culminate in the leaders' summit in Brisbane in November which will build on the work of earlier meetings.


The Prime Minister has labelled the leaders' summit the most important meeting of world leaders Australia has ever hosted.


It is easy to see why.


But along with this important opportunity comes great responsibility.


Appropriate security arrangements and effective collaboration between law enforcement and other agencies will be paramount to ensuring these G20 events proceed smoothly.


I am confident our nation's first-rate law enforcement and security agencies possess the personnel, organisational capacity, skills and experience to meet this challenge.


It is our responsibility to ensure that the appropriate settings are in place for our agencies to do their job.


Queensland has enacted legislation to give police and other authorised persons the powers they will need to ensure the safety of our high-profile guests and the public during the G20.


Specifically, the Queensland G20 (Safety and Security) Act will ensure police have the powers they need to:


protect the safety of persons attending G20 meetings


protect the public from civil disobedience during the time of the G20


protect property from damage during the G20 meetings


prevent acts of terrorism, and


regulate movement to ensure the passage of motorcades related to the G20 are not impeded.


The Queensland legislation also provides for 'security areas' in which closer security arrangements can be implemented.


This bill is necessary to ensure the powers conferred by the Queensland legislation can be exercised within the Brisbane Airport during the leaders' summit.


It will do this by clarifying the relationship between the Queensland legislation and existing Commonwealth aviation and airports legislation at the Brisbane Airport for the purposes of the G20 summit.


Importantly, it will address any unintended overlap between Commonwealth aviation and airports legislation and Queensland legislation to ensure the safety of this event is not affected by any ambiguity.


The bill will sunset the day after the leaders' summit ends. This will avoid the need to repeal the legislation after it has ceased to be necessary.


Debate adjourned.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (13:30):  I extend an invitation to the health minister to visit the GP Plus Super Clinic at Modbury, a facility that is improving access to doctors and health services for residents in Makin. This superclinic provides bulk billing services to local patients as part of the previous government's support for universal access to health care—something that will end under this government as it goes about destroying Medicare.


The clinic provides a range of health services, including GP services; modern public dental services for adults and children; chronic disease management; and specialist clinical services for diabetes, wounds, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management, heart failure and respiratory and orthopaedic health issues. The clinic also provides allied health services, including exercise physiology, physiotherapy, podiatry, social work, psychology, diabetes nurse education and dietetics.


These services were previously not available under one roof and have been making a tangible benefit to the health of patients for several years now. The superclinic is removing demand and pressure on the nearby Modbury hospital and easing demand on the hospital's emergency department, which is precisely what GP superclinics were intended to do. If the health minister wants to see firsthand evidence of the benefit of Labor's GP superclinic program, he is welcome to visit the GP Plus Super Clinic at Modbury.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (13:59):  on indulgence—I wish to note that this is the first anniversary of the parliament's apology for forced adoptions. On 21 March last year the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and I led the national apology for forced adoptions. It was a heartfelt occasion that meant much to many across our country. We rightly apologised to the women, the children and the families who were victims of forced adoption. For too long, too many had believed that they knew what was for the best for young unwed mothers and their babies. But the people who claimed it should have known better. If they had known better, terrible and avoidable pain that was inflicted on hundreds of thousands of people would have been avoided.


There is no stronger bond than between a mother and her child, and it should never have been presumed that these young women were incapable of raising their children. It was a tragedy for them and for our nation, and last year we did do our best to atone. We said that we were sorry for being hard-hearted and judgemental. We said we were sorry for turning what should have been the wonderful experience of new life into something filled with shame.


A year ago, as a nation, we accepted responsibility for the pain, the suffering and the grief. I want to assure all those who were hurt—the mothers, the children and the fathers—that you are not forgotten. Our hope last year was that the apology would be part of a healing process. My hope today is that the apology has played, and is playing, its part in transforming reproach into reassurance and anger into peace.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  A year ago, the Australian parliament came together to face a hard truth to right an old wrong. I pay tribute to the leadership and compassion of Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who delivered the national apology on forced adoption. I acknowledge the words of the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, too. It was an apology to thousands of young mothers who had their special, unique, beautiful, precious babies taken away from them. It did hurt fathers, too—largely women, but men, too, suffered. It was an apology to thousands of children who grew up deprived of their mother's love. It was an apology for decades of indifference—callous indifference—from governments, bureaucracies, churches, charities and hospitals.


As Prime Minister Gillard did a year ago, I, too, now pay my tribute to the strength and bravery of the thousands of Australians who came forward to tell their stories and make their difficult submissions to the Senate committee—the mothers, the fathers, the sons and the daughters who found the courage to publicly draw upon their strength to tell their difficult personal stories, who found the strength to demand the identity and the respect which they had been so long denied. It was this intensely individual, deeply personal determination that drew back a veil of shame and a veil of silence that has been cast over the lives of thousands of our fellow Australians.


Perhaps more inspiring still, they found it in themselves to accept the apology in the generous spirit that it was given. The 42nd and the 43rd parliaments delivered three national apologies—each one of them stands as a powerful reminder that there is nothing to fear or to lose in facing up to historical truth. Indeed, every time Australians come together to acknowledge the wrongs of our past, our country becomes a better and more decent place. Let all of us in this place recall that lesson again today. Let all of us in this place draw some inspiration from that well of the never-give-up spirit of those who were wrongly forcibly adopted. Let us all in this place declare that never again should any of our fellow Australians undergo pain and invisibility alone, as those affected by forced adoption endured.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:06):  Let me repeat what I said to the House yesterday, that Senator Sinodinos has done the right and the honourable thing. That is what we would expect from someone who has given our country such long and faithful public service. The question of who knew what when will be dealt with by the ICAC inquiry, as it should be.




Mr Burke:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: it cannot be before ICAC as to what the knowledge of the Prime Minister was. That is a matter for this parliament and this question time.



The SPEAKER:  What is the point of order you are drawing?

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:02):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Upon announcing his ministry on 16 September last year, the Prime Minister unequivocally said:


Well, I want to absolutely scotch any suggestion that there is a cloud over Arthur Sinodinos. There is not. I wouldn’t be appointing Arthur to the incoming ministry if I thought there was any cloud over him.


What has changed materially since then, or did the Prime Minister knowingly appoint Arthur Sinodinos to a key economic portfolio when in fact he believed there was a cloud?

 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (15:02):  As just about every member of this House knows, including members opposite, Senator Sinodinos is a fundamentally decent man. He is an extremely competent man.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:09):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Watson moving immediately:


That the House:


(1) notes that the Prime Minister:


(a) committed to the Australian people that he would lead a Government that is 'transparent and open' and would 'restore accountability and improve transparency measures';


(b) is accountable to the Australian people and the Australian Parliament; and


(c) has been asked on numerous occasions to explain to the House what he knew about Senator Sinodinos' involvement in Australian Water Holdings and when he knew it;


(2) requires the Prime Minister, for 15 minutes, to immediately explain to the House:


(a) all the information in the possession of the Prime Minister or his office in relation to Senator Sinodinos' involvement in Australian Water Holdings; and


(b) what changed between the Prime Minister appointing Senator Sinodinos as Assistant Treasurer in September, expressing full confidence in Senator Sinodinos on Tuesday and allowing Senator Sinodinos to stand aside on Wednesday; and


(3) allow the Leader of the Opposition, for 15 minutes in the House, to immediately reply to the Prime Minister.


We know two things. We know—and this is an important point to establish—that Arthur Sinodinos is entitled to the presumption of innocence. We understand there is a process underway, and the process should not target unfairly someone's innocence or pre-presume the outcome. Labor supports that principle. I might add personally that my dealings with Arthur Sinodinos have always been professional, pleasant, civil and decent. But there is a second principle which people want to know.


The people of Australia are entitled to know what has gone on here. It is not enough for the Prime Minister not to tell us what he has done. It is not good enough for him not to tell the Australian people what he knows, when they say, 'We asked the Prime Minister on 20 occasions what he knows.' It is not enough for a Prime Minister of Australia to brush off the Australian people with a reference to private conversations about ministers in government not being worthy of being answered in question time. It is not appropriate for a Prime Minister of Australia to talk about the standing aside of a minister and provide to not only the opposition but the people of Australia only the information that it is a private conversation and that he does not need to explain his actions to anyone.


What the Prime Minister has actually answered in no fewer than 26 or 27 questions over the last two days is that the Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, does not want the Australian people to know what the Prime Minister knows and to know when the Prime Minister learnt of certain key information. We have heard unanswered questions in this parliament today. That is why we should suspend standing orders. We asked the Prime Minister today: was he aware of the remarkably large $1 million amount, which would raise eyebrows in every lounge room in Australia—an informal $1 million success fee—and what did he know about it? We asked the Prime Minister today: what was the role, and what did he know about the role, of Senator Sinodinos in arranging a letter from Premier Barry O'Farrell to help secure a large contract? He said that he knows and that he will not tell us when he knew it or what he knows. We asked today: what is the knowledge that the Prime Minister has about one of his ministers being involved with facilitating a $20 million windfall fee? These are not ordinary amounts of money. These are not ordinary goings-on. Most Australians would understand that if someone says, 'If you can arrange a contract, you will get $20 million,' it is not business as usual. What we want to know and I think what the Australian people want to know—and the one thing we know that the Prime Minister is not telling us, in fact—is his awareness or state of mind on these matters.


We have asked questions about what Senator Sinodinos has done. The Prime Minister said that the reason he has stood aside is not that he has done anything wrong—the Prime Minister is entitled to say that. But what the Prime Minister is saying is that the ministerial conduct standards of this Abbott government are that if a minister becomes a sideshow or a distraction they must move sideways—whatever moving sideways means, which is a point I will come to. That is why we must suspend standing orders—to deal with this issue. The Abbott government's ministerial standard for accountability is that, if you become a sideshow—this must be worrying Mr Joyce!—or a distraction, this is the standard that the government will apply to their ministers. The standard the Prime Minister will not apply to himself is his willingness to be transparent with the Australian people.


It is a fairly made question, I believe: what has changed? ICAC said they were going to investigate Australian Water Holdings in December 2012. Senator Sinodinos appropriately made a statement in February 2013. Then the Prime Minister, upon appointing Senator Sinodinos to the outer ministry, said that there was no cloud and that he wanted to scotch the rumours of a cloud. Yet well-informed sources in the Liberal Party tell us the reason the remarkably well credentialled Senator Sinodinos was not appointed to the cabinet—which I think most people thought was a likelihood—was that there was a cloud.


I actually admire the Prime Minister's commitment to Senator Sinodinos—I admire that on a personal level. What I do not admire is his unwillingness to be transparent about what he knew. There may not have been a cloud over Senator Sinodinos, but there are smoke signals coming from the Prime Minister's office that he knew more than he said. It beggars belief. I have heard the almost eulogistic comments from those opposite about Senator Sinodinos—that in fact he is a great fellow. I too have found him reasonable to deal with; I say that. Therefore, why wasn't Senator Sinodinos appointed by the Liberal Party to the cabinet, which is what everyone expected? Of course, there were the rumours—probably not from allies of the Prime Minister within the Liberal Party—that there were concerns raised. But when we have asked the Prime Minister just to come clean—Prime Minister, just come clean and tell us what you know—what he says is: 'I do not have to tell you. That is a matter that will be at ICAC.' But we are not asking about Senator Sinodinos; we are asking about what the Prime Minister knows. That is why we should suspend standing orders.


What happened to the famous due diligence process at the Prime Minister's office? We understand that the chief of staff of the Assistant Minister for Health slipped through that until the chief of staff became a distraction, not Assistant Minister Nash. But what happened to the due diligence process? I do not think anyone seriously believes—and that is why we should suspend standing orders—that there was a due diligence process. I suspect that there was a chance the people just sort of hoped—there was more hope than due diligence—that this matter would go away. How on earth can a prime minister say that he will not tell us what he knows at any point, when there are clear signposts that these matters have been discussed with the Prime Minister's knowledge and within his orbit of influence? Does the Prime Minister know anything that the public does not already know? This is a fundamental question. The first question is: why is it, and what changed, materially, from September last year to now that has led to a minister standing aside? The second issue is that surely we saw in September last year issues that raised concern and commentary then, but what we do ask now is: does the Prime Minister have any knowledge of any matter with Australian Water Holdings?


This Prime Minister is being shifty. I get that he does not want to tell Qantas workers about their future. I get that he does not want to reveal the Commission of Audit to Western Australian voters before the election—I get that. It is shifty, but I get that. What I do not understand is that there is no way he can simply say it is someone else's issue when it comes to the conduct of his own ministers. I get that he has contracted out the Commission of Audit to the Business Council of Australia, and he says, 'I don't know what they're doing'. I get that he says, 'I have not read a 900-page report'; I get that he does not know anything about manufacturing or fighting for jobs. What I do not get is question after question in this place—legitimate question after question: what did you know, and when did you know it? And what I really find uncomfortable about the Prime Minister's shifty conduct is this: what is it that he knows that the public does not? At the very least, he should come clean and say it. If he knows nothing else besides the public reports, so be it—end of matter; Labor will leave this question alone. But if it emerges that the Prime Minister is aware of more than he has revealed to the Australian parliament, to the Australian people, to the opposition, to the Australian media, then that is a problem for this Prime Minister. It is not the standard he sets for everyone else.


And indeed the final, most frustrating issue in this whole standing aside issue is that we know that the act of parliament governing ministerial conditions does not allow for this sort of half-pregnant proposition that the government has advanced about Senator Sinodinos. His label is still on his office—he has still got his office. Does he get his superannuation? He is going to forgo it—he will probably give it to charity. Fair enough. The Prime Minister needs to come clean with what he knows, when he knew it, and whether he knows anything that he has not told the rest of Australia. (Time expired)

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:19):  I second the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. It is right that the House suspends standing orders to discuss transparency and accountability under this government. This is a Prime Minister who promised the Australian people that he would restore accountability and improve transparency measures. And we have seen accountability and transparency go AWOL under this Prime Minister today. He is not willing to answer for the conduct of his own ministers, and he is not willing to answer for his own conduct. The Australian people have known that this inquiry was coming; everybody in this parliament has known that this inquiry was coming; the Prime Minister knew that this inquiry was coming. There were media reports in December 2012 that the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption has begun to make formal inquiries into Australian Water Holdings. There were media reports in August 2013 that said Australian Water Holdings would be the focus of ICAC public hearings. And what due diligence did the Prime Minister use about that? What inquiries did he make? What did he ask about Senator Sinodinos and his involvement in these matters before appointing him to the high office of Assistant Treasurer? What did the Prime Minister do to protect the integrity of his ministry?


That is a question the opposition is entitled to ask, and it is a question the Australian people are entitled to have answered, and this Prime Minister has failed miserably to do so. We are prepared to give the Prime Minister another chance, another opportunity. He can have 15 minutes of the House to explain what he has done to uphold the integrity of his office and his government. And if he votes against this motion, that means he is unwilling to do so and he is running yet again from that accountability. And we have seen the Prime Minister today, creating a new alibi about the salary and conditions of Senator Sinodinos. We had to drag from him these letters about Senator Sinodinos's entitlements. He told us that it was all crystal clear and clear-cut—that Senator Sinodinos would not receive his ministerial entitlements. Yet we see this letter from Senator Sinodinos that says, 'It is my intention to forgo my ministerial entitlements'—'my intention'. We want to know how that is done under the relevant act of parliament. We want to know whether his superannuation will continue to be paid as a percentage of his entire ministerial salary. We want to know whether he will continue to receive ministerial level travel allowance. We want to know whether he will sit, formally or informally, on the Expenditure Review Committee as this government brings down a budget. These are questions that the Prime Minister should be able to answer. These are questions that the Prime Minister must answer before this House and the Australian people, and if he does not then he has something to hide.


If he was willing to answer these questions, then he should not worry about this motion, he should welcome this motion. He should embrace this motion, and thank the House for the time it is prepared to give him to explain his conduct and the conduct of his government, to explain what measures he has put in place so that the Australian people can have confidence that he is running an administration of appropriate accountability and transparency measures, as he suggested.


We have seen this government ducking and weaving all week. We had the speculation about whether Senator Sinodinos would stand aside or not, about whether the Prime Minister would ask him to. Well, the Prime Minister did ask him to, but he did it through the pages of Australia's newspapers—that is how he treats his ministers. He sends smoke signals to one of his colleagues, sending him the message that it might be a good idea to stand aside. When matters like this arise, as the Leader of Opposition has said, there is one fundamental question that somebody who sits in that chair must answer: what did you know, and when did you know it? It is an old question, but it is a question that has stood the test of time, and it is a question this Prime Minister has failed miserably to answer.


Senator Sinodinos has had great responsibilities. He has been responsible for things like changing Australia's financial advice laws, laws that were introduced after $6 billion was ripped off of 120,000 Australians, laws that were introduced to provide more protection, more accountability, and more transparency. Senator Sinodinos is ripping these laws up, and this Prime Minister is letting it happen. He has got some serious explaining to do about this entire matter, and if he will not do it in question time then he should do it now.


The leader of the House is about to get on his hind feet and talk to the House. The Prime Minister should be doing that. The Prime Minister should be taking this opportunity to explain to the Australian people what he knew, and when he knew it. The Prime Minister should be accountable to the Australian people and he should be taking this opportunity— (Time expired)

 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:24):  We on this side of the House do not agree with the motion, and the opposition's attempt to suspend standing orders should not be carried. I will say why in the next 10 minutes. We will not be judged by the party of Craig Thomson, and the party of Michael Williamson, and the party of the AWU slush fund, and the party of Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald. We will not be judged by the Labor Party on the issue of standards in government. I have waited all week for the opportunity that I hoped the opposition would give me, to outline why we will never be lectured by the Labor Party about ministerial standards.


I say to the House, how dare the Labor Party come into this chamber and try and wear the clothes of ministerial accountability and standards, after the sewer they presided over for three years in the 43rd Parliament, putting aside the 42nd Parliament. But in the 43rd Parliament—



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Charlton!




Mr PYNE:
  there was an endless list of atrocities committed against this parliament. Not only did they suborn the former member for Fisher into becoming the Speaker, and replacing a good man in Harry Jenkins, to gain a vote—



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Gorton will desist!




Mr PYNE:
  but they kept Craig Thomson's vote in their party room until 29 April 2012.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth has already been warned! That is the last time.




Mr PYNE:
  Labor clung to the vote of the former member for Dobell, the now disgraced Craig Thomson. Now, when did they find out? When did we all find out there was a cloud hanging over the member for Dobell? Well, it certainly was not on 28 April 2012. It certainly was not the day before Labor excluded him from their caucus. In January 2009, even before the 2010 election, Terry Nassios from the Fair Work Commission commenced his inquiry into the HSU's Victorian No. 1 Branch. In January 2009, the Fair Work Commission began its inquiry into the Health Services Union No. 1 Branch, and the stories started appearing in the newspapers about former member for Dobell Craig Thomson.


In fact, we know that in early 2009 Ben Hubbard, the former chief of staff to then Prime Minister Gillard, rang the then Industrial Registrar Doug Williams to inquire into whether they were investigating a Labor MP. So we know that in early 2009 the Prime Minister's office and the Labor Party were aware enough, and concerned enough, that the chief of staff of the Prime Minister contacted—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Hunter will take his seat!




Mr PYNE:
  the then Industrial Registrar Doug Williams to discover—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Hunter will take his seat or leave!




Mr PYNE:
  if there was an inquiry into the former member for Dobell going on. It goes on and on. There were so many stories. The New South Wales police launched Strike Force Carnarvon in September 2011. The Victorian police fraud squad confirmed in October 2011 that they were investigating Craig Thomson. Fair Work Australia published their investigation into the HSU in April 2012, and in March 2012 they released their investigation into the Victorian HSU No. 1 Branch.


For all that time the Labor Party protected former member for Dobell Craig Thomson and kept his vote in their caucus.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth will leave under standing order 94(a).




The member for Perth then left the chamber.





Mr PYNE:
  Yet they come in here and try to lecture the coalition about ministerial standards. Craig Thomson is just one example. This is the party of Eddie Obeid. This is the party of Joe Tripodi. This is the Party of Ian Macdonald—and federal ministers were named in the Independent Commission Against Corruption investigation into the Obeid family's financial matters. Two of them appeared as witnesses.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for McEwen is warned!




Mr PYNE:
  Greg Combet appeared as a witness to ICAC. Did we demand that he resign from the front bench? No, we did not demand that he resign. Senator Doug Cameron, now sitting on the Labor Party front bench, appeared as a witness at the ICAC investigation into the Obeid family fortune. Did we demand that Doug Cameron be disciplined and be stripped of his responsibilities? No we did not, because there is an enormous difference between appearing as a witness in an investigation and being investigated by the ICAC. The member for Chifley knows that very well; the member for Kingsford Smith knows it very well. For all the confected outrage in the world that Labor are trying to raise this week, they cannot get away from one fact: they are the party of sleaze and smear in New South Wales, in particular, and Sussex Street has got its reputation. We will not be lectured by Labor about standards in this place.


I would also say that the big difference between this side of House and the other side of House is that, when a matter like this occurs, we act. When something was raised, as it was against the former Assistant Treasurer, the former Assistant Treasurer acted. He did the right thing. He stood aside yesterday so that he would not be a distraction from the government's important economic and social agenda. So the Labor Party have spent all week in question time, wasting question time and criticising us for doing the right thing. When Labor were in power, what did they use to do when these things happened? They circled the wagons, they aggressively attacked the opposition and they used all sorts of personal calumnies against members of the opposition, including me and including you, Madam Speaker, when you were in opposition, and including the now Prime Minister, the member for Warringah. That was their response. The response on our side of the House was for a decent man, a man of honour and reputation, Senator Arthur Sinodinos to stand aside until this matter is resolved.



Mr Husic interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley will either desist or leave.




Mr PYNE:
  So, in fact, Labor have spent the week criticising the government for doing the right thing, demanding every day that the Prime Minister respond to question after question—repetitive questions—because they want to criticise us for doing the right thing. If, on the other hand, we had behaved like Labor behaved in government then maybe they would have had a feather to fly with—a leg to stand on. But, no, this is all just the confected outrage of an opposition without a strategy and without a narrative that lives tactically from day to day and that is being marked down by the public because of this exact strategy. That is why the Griffith by-election was the best result for a government since 1984.

Mr PYNE:
  In Tasmania, we swept aside 16 years of Labor-Greens government, because the public knows that this side of House is operating in an adult, calm and methodical way, introducing the policies that we promised to take to the election and introducing the governmental changes that we know will create jobs, build growth and restore the reputation of Australia internationally and domestically. We are getting on with the job. What Labor are doing is spending a week wasting their questions, wasting question time and building to their suspension of standing orders on Thursday afternoon. I say to the new members of the Labor Party, particularly: you should speak to the strategy team about their strategy, because you are not winning it. You spent all week criticising the government for doing the right thing, and this was a complete waste of a question time.


There are so many precedents for the action of Senator Sinodinos. Mick Young in 1984—



An opposition member:  Thanks for your help!




Mr PYNE:
  Someone needs to help you! Mick Young, your predecessor, in 1984 stood down from the Hawke ministry; he was reinstated about a month or so later. Phillip Lynch stood down as the Treasurer in the Fraser government; he was reinstated to the ministry a little while later. Ian Sinclair stood down from the Fraser government; he was reinstated to the ministry after he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Even the member for Lilley, when he was a shadow minister, stood down from the role that he held in family and community services under the former Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, until he was cleared of any wrongdoing in any matters and returned to the front bench. These are the precedents—Mick Young, Phillip Lynch, Ian Sinclair and Wayne Swan. These are the precedents. The action that was taken by Senator Arthur Sinodinos yesterday by standing aside from his position—



Mr Dutton interjecting—




Mr Mitchell:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: the Minister for Health has used words against the member for Lilley which are offensive, and I request that you ask him to withdraw them unreservedly.



The SPEAKER:  If there is something that needs withdrawing, it would assist the House for the Minister for Health to do so.




Mr DUTTON:
  I withdraw.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-03-20,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:49):  Yesterday, in this House, the Leader of the House said as follows:


There will be a single national database for university reporting, so government departments will coordinate with each other rather than putting that burden of coordination on the university sector—


a single national database to allow coordination. But remove the word 'university' and insert the word 'charity' and you have exactly what the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission does.


It is a one-stop shop. This is a government that approves of one-stop shops when it comes to environmental approvals but when it comes to a one-stop shop for charities they are suddenly against it. When it comes to one-stop shops this government is all over the shop. The charities commission is a body that could not enjoy wider support from across the charity sector. A wide range of charities, more than 40, have signed an open letter to save the charity commission. They include: Save the Children, St John Ambulance Australia, the Ted Noffs Foundation, RSPCA, The Sidney Myer Fund & the Myer Foundation, Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, Volunteering Australia, Lifeline, ACOSS, SANE Australia, Musica Viva Australia, Hillsong Church, Social Ventures Australia, Australian Conservation Foundation, the YMCA, the Wesley Mission and the Queensland Theatre Company. What else could bring all of these organisations together from across the political spectrum but the Abbott government?


The Abbott government said it would bring Australians together—and it has. They are united in opposition to what this government is doing. This government wants to get rid of a charities commission, about which Tim Costello said:


The commission is actually working for us, and it gives the public confidence. It underpins the consumer benefit to charities.


Myles McGregor Lowndes, of the Australian Centre for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Studies said:


During its short history, the ACNC has played a positive role in the overall regulatory environment of charities.


Indeed, he describes:


Its stellar improvement in terms of timeliness, consistency of decision making and responsiveness…


Carolyn Kitto of Stop the Traffik said: 


The ACNC is a dream come true for small charities…The ACNC has cut red tape dramatically. The staff are helpful and navigate complexities so we can be sure we are compliant and efficient.


David Crosbie, CEO of the Community Council of Australia said:


The ACNC is more efficient than the government regulators it replaced, is doing good work and deserves a chance to achieve its three goals of reducing red tape, increasing public trust and strengthening the charity sector.


Louise Walsh from Philanthropy Australia says:


Since the ACNC’s establishment as an independent charities regulator, Philanthropy Australia has consistently supported the ACNC’s important role in our community.


We also heard strong support yesterday from Anglicare Australia, which said:


The repeal of the ACNC will simply recreate more bureaucracy, lessen protection for the public and add unnecessarily to the workload of community service providers. It will also create uncertainty as there is no clear replacement. Uncertainty is the biggest enemy of efficiency, as big business tells us.


The matter of public importance before the House goes in particular to the impact on Western Australia. Professor David Gilchrist, the Director of the Not-for-profit Initiative at Western Australia's Curtin University, spoke to my office today and said:


A silent majority in Western Australia think the ACNC is the way forward. Regulation is only part of what it offers. 


Its best practice governance principles have been very well accepted. It has provided the sector with a good set of financial principles that allow for differences between charities. It recognises that the WA sector is every bit as complex as any other sector.


Removing the ACNC without a fair trial and without leveraging the hard work of the commission in recent months would be a mistake.


That is what David Gilchrist of the Not-for-profit Initiative at Curtin University said.


A pro bono survey in August 2013 of 1,500 charities found that 81 per cent supported the ACNC. What share supported the government's preferred solution of returning charities regulation to the ATO? Just six per cent. The National Party gets more votes than that! There is more support for the Australian Greens and the National Party than there is for this government's approach of returning charitable regulation to the Australian Taxation Office.


This is a serious sector. The not-for-profit sector employs one million Australians, turns over $100 billion and involves five million volunteers. It is at the heart of our community and many of us in this place take pride in the work of the not-for-profit sector. But if we want a strong not-for-profit sector we have to listen to what expert reviews have said. No fewer than five reviews, including the Productivity Commission review and the Henry tax review, have said we need a national charities commission. That is because without a charities commission there is a hodgepodge of regulation which puts donors at risk and does not allow charities their own bespoke regulator.


This government is driven not by expert advice, not by listening to five inquiries and not by listening to the four in five charities that want to keep the ACNC; instead, it is driven by blind ideology. There is no better evidence of that than the attempt by the minister in charge of abolishing the charities commission to hang onto a 400-year-old common-law definition of charities rather than a new statutory definition. John Howard back in 2000 said that this statutory definition would be a good idea. Mr Howard said:


Yet the common law definition of a charity, which is based on a legal concept dating back to 1601, has resulted in a number of legal definitions and often gives rise to legal disputes.


This government is a pre-Howard-era government in its approach to charities. It wants to take us back to 1601. In fact, not only it is pre Howard but it is pre Protestant, pre Enlightenment, pre electric lights and pre steam engines. When it comes to charities, this government would take us back to the time of leeches and witch burning. That is its view of charities. Its view of charities is that they should be seen and not heard. It wants the Australian charity sector to be simply a service delivery arm of government. That is why the Minister for Social Services is taking carriage of this and not the Assistant Treasurer—that was at the time when we had an Assistant Treasurer!


Labor's view is that charities play an important role in the Australian community sector and they should be free to speak their minds. Brave charities have spoken their minds. You have to be a pretty bold charity to put your head above the parapet with this government, knowing their willingness to play favourites and to have a go at charities that are of a mind to speak in the public interest rather than simply look at where their next dollar is coming from. We have seen charities, from ACOSS to the age sector, saying that this is a bad idea and that, if this change goes through, it will be utterly retrograde. Charitable donors will be at risk. They will be placed at risk from scam artists. If you are opening your door to a charity, you want to know that there is a charities commission standing ready to take complaints against the thankfully small number of dodgy charities. If we do not have that then we are not going to have the backstop that the sector requires. This approach would be like the coalition saying to financial investors: 'Let's get rid of ASIC. We'll be okay without the Securities and Investments Commission. Let's just let the market rip.' 



Mr Bowen interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  The shadow Treasurer said perhaps I should not suggest that. You never know what this government will do. This is, after all, a government that is going further in the area of removing protections on consumers than the Financial Planning Association would want. This government should listen to donors, should listen to charities, should listen to philanthropists and should keep the ACNC.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (15:59):  What was that? We had the professorial tutorial. He read the timetable wrong. 



Dr Leigh interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  Those who are listening may be bewildered to know that the MPI topic we are supposed to be debating is the government's move to cut transparency, accountability and consumer protection and its impact particularly on the voters of Western Australia.



Dr Leigh interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  Instead, we got a PhD dissertation about why we need another regulator.



Dr Leigh interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  He did not manage to come to the point that the points he said were so crucial to the regulator can actually be dealt with without creating another institution. What a novel idea! To see the professor who does not even have the courtesy to sit quietly and listen to the discussion on the actual topic he brought forward—it just shows you what a rabble Labor is. 


To show you what a matter of public importance this is, there were 21 questions at question time today and not one of them was on this subject. So absolutely gripping, so compelling—Labor was so insistent that the parliament allocate time to this matter of public importance, but it was not important enough to ask a question. Isn't that remarkable. But doesn't that give you an idea about just how misguided and how completely befuddled this Labor opposition is. To hear the professor talk about what should be happening to protect consumers—he seems to overlook a little problem. We heard the Treasurer today saying that under the previous Labor government we saw the fastest growth in government outlays in the top 17 IMF countries in the world. But what did they forget to fund? They forgot to fund the ACCC. They forgot to fund the regulator that is there supposedly to protect the consumers. I know those opposite have had very little interest in competition policy and consumer affairs. They have had so little interest while they were putting all this debt and deficit on the national bank card that they forgot to fund the ACCC. 


Did you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, that if it were not for the election and the change in government, our principal regulator and protector of consumer rights would run out of cash next month? So convinced was Labor that consumer protection mattered that they forgot to fund the agency whose task it was to implement those protections. On 12 September 2011, there was a request for an unimproved operating loss that ran over the top of the budget that was allocated in 2010-11. We thought, 'Oops, we have overshot.' The professor is off to read the timetable and realise what the topic is before the parliament. On 16 January 2012, guess what, another operating loss—




Ms Bird:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister should refer to people by their correct titles.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call.




Mr BILLSON:
  On 16 January 2012, we had the discussion from the member for—



A government member:  Fraser.




Mr BILLSON:
  Fraser, thank you. The member for Fraser did not manage to speak at all about the necessary requirement to actually fund the consumer protection regulator. Again on 16 January, we saw another letter to the Treasurer, 'Look we have got an operating loss of over $17 million.' There was another one on 13 April, 'There is another operating loss and we have eaten away at all of the accumulated surpluses.' We then saw another request saying, 'There is another operating loss coming in 2012-13.' Guess what? The operating loss was actually greater than the disclosed operating loss. What happened? Labor did not even fund the ACCC. So let us have none of this cant. Let us have none of this nonsense from Labor that they have the slightest interest in consumer protection. If they were interested in consumers, they would join us in helping consumers by the abolition of the carbon tax. 


Here we have a discussion about transparency and accountability. We have the Labor lead candidate for the Western Australian Senate election saying in The West Australian, 'Labor is scrapping the carbon tax.' That is not right. Labor just voted to keep the carbon tax, allowing Labor's law to run which will see the rate of the carbon tax actually increase. So the punishment is extended by the action in the Senate today which will also see it applied to heavy vehicle transport. On the back of this completely false and misleading statement in The Western Australian from Labor's lead candidate for the Senate election, those Western Australian voters who want their consumer interests protected would be aghast to hear what is going on in the other place. It is not only a preservation of Labor's carbon tax; it is a protection of the Labor law that will see the punishment increase and extend to on-road freight. This must be a compelling issue for the Western Australian community. 


You would think that if they were interested in the abolition of the carbon tax, they would fund the ACCC to make sure the savings were actually passed on to consumers. That is consumer protection. When the price rises previously attributed to the carbon tax are removed, we want to see a price reduction. But that would require resourcing for the ACCC. Again, this side of the House has provided those resources, unlike Labor that were just happy to let it run down.


I turn to the area of our competition review, an area that Labor cannot even turn itself to address. In its last utterance on this topic, Labor said that they thought the law that was currently in place was perfectly adequate. David Bradbury said that in a debate in this place when he was the responsible minister. The coalition parties were arguing about the need to revisit and reanalyse our competition framework to make sure it was fit for purpose for a modern changing economy; that it would deliver durable consumer benefits and protect their interests; that it would support efficient businesses, big and small, investing in this country by having the opportunity to grow and prosper. What was Labor's response? When Labor were in government, their position was, 'The existing competition framework is adequate to deal with these challenges.' They are not even interested in the review that has the consumer interest and the machinery that is in place to protect it at its heart. 


So, again, let us hear none of this nonsense from Labor about being the slightest bit interested in consumers. Their actions do not back up that the glib rhetoric that we get. More worryingly, the debate that we have does not even align with the topic that Labor submitted for discussion today. So what is happening instead? You have seen the coalition bring forward its program about terminating the carbon tax, ensuring proper resourcing for our consumer protection regulator and putting the resources in place to monitor the impact of the removal of the carbon tax. We have also put in place a deregulatory agenda, something that is of great interest to consumers. They know excessive regulatory overreach costs money. Those costs are carried by the consumers. They are passed on from those burdened with those excessive compliance requirements. 


We have a deregulation agenda that is at the heart of trying to ensure that regulation is right-sized in the financial services area and deals with some of the overreach and excesses of Labor's approach that has made the affordability and accessibility of financial advice more out of reach for those with modest resources to invest in that important part of planning for their retirement or their financial independence. We want proper protection for consumers if you happen to be a worker on a building site. That is why we want the ABCC. We want them protected as well. That is why we want to make sure there is a registered organisations entity in place so that that commission can do its work to protect Australian consumers and ensure this is a positive place where there is transparency, accountability and protections. 


How important is that for the people of Western Australia who have heard about the thuggery that has gone on in building sites in that state. Do we hear anything about that from Labor? No, we hear nothing about those crucial topics. So we have a choice. We can get behind the government's program, respecting the fact that our deregulation  agenda delivers benefits for our economy, delivers benefits for those being weighed down and burdened by excess red tape, which causes costs and missed opportunities for consumers. Protecting their interests is getting regulation right sized. It is about reflecting the fact that in this country, before Labor was elected, we were 68th in the world in terms of the burden government regulation put on our economy. By the time Labor had left office, we were 128th. That was after one of their previous ministers said regulation was a noose around small businesses and that they needed to do something about it. What did do they do about it? They just added more and more regulation—21,000 new and amended regulations. Again, there was report after report saying that for time poor small businesses, excessive regulation cruels their opportunity to find work, to generate revenue, to support their viability. Yet what do we get from Labor? We get opposition to that. 


Concerning paid parental leave, why is Labor so obsessed with making employers, particularly small businesses and not-for-profit employers, pay a cost to double-handle the paid parental leave payments that the previous Labor government had put in place? What is the argument for that? $44 million additional costs for businesses and $4 million of additional costs for not-for-profit organisations. 


What you have seen today is a ridiculous attempt for Labor to make it sound like they are remotely interested in the people of Western Australia. Well, the voters are smarter. They know that we have the plan that will put the mojo back into the Western Australian economy, that will support opportunities for the economy. And talking about consumer protection, we will walk the talk, not just talk the walk.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-03-20,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (16:09):  I rise to speak on this very important matter of public importance because I know there is a lot of interest in and talk about getting rid of red tape and reducing regulation. For that, we are all supportive. Red tape ought to go as much as is possible. Unnecessary redundant regulations ought to go wherever possible. That is exactly what Labor did in government and we did it in spades, but we did not crow about it and we did not have special days in honour of doing the normal work of business. It is what a government ought to do every single day. It is what a government ought to do as a matter of normal business. It is what governments should be doing. 


We need to examine very closely what this mob are up to when they say that they are cutting red tape and getting rid of regulation. It is actually a very big smokescreen. It is a big cloak for what they are actually doing which is removing consumer protections and taking away hard fought and hard won protections. When people come to see me—whether they are consumers or small businesses—they often come about things that burden them, about things that are happening in the market and about things for which the government ought to be doing more to protect them. So they often come about the two things—yes we want to get rid of red tape, yes we want to make life easier—and that is exactly what Labor did in government. We did it with business name registrations, which used to be an absolute nightmare under the mob from across the way, the Liberals and the Nationals. During their time you were required to register your business in seven different jurisdictions across the states and territories, either by paper or online. There was a different system in all of them and if you wanted to register your small business across Australia, it would cost over $1,000 and take you an enormous deal of effort. What Labor did to reduce red tape, to get rid of regulations and to reduce the cost was to actually do it properly and do it by making sure that we had an online system, seven days a week, 24 hours of the day. It worked absolutely fantastically for small businesses.




Mr Christensen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The shadow minister might want to relate to the House how that result now takes months to achieve rather than days.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  There is no point of order.




Mr RIPOLL:
  What they have forgotten is simply this: they have forgotten the damage that is being done to ordinary mums and dads through the Storm Financial collapse. About $4 billion of life savings of ordinary mums and dads cannot be recouped. That is what happened under the poor culture and poor practices in the financial services sector. Labor did not just watch it happen; we did something about it. In fact, we did a lot of the heavy lifting. We made sure over the past five years that something was being done significantly to protect consumers, something that the consumers were wanting and demanding and something that this government will completely dismantle and rip away, under the guise of red tape and of getting rid of bureaucracy. This is not what people expected. 


The former Labor government put in a best interests duty to make sure that advisers would act in the best interests of their clients. We put in an opt-in clause, requiring advisers to make sure that they go back to their clients once every two years—that is not too onerous—to ask, 'Is it okay if we keep taking money out of your account?' I am sure most people on the other side would want to know, maybe even more than once in every two years, if somebody was taking money out of their account. They might even want to know what are they taking the money for. I have had a close look at what these changes actually do. When the former, the stood-aside, Assistant Treasurer gets his stuff through, when it actually becomes part of the new regulations, it will mean that a firm, an institution or a bank can change the amount they charge you, they can change the length of the agreement and they do not have to inform you. They do not have to disclose it. It is specifically written in. This is the tragedy of what these guys do not understand. They are not going to read the detail because for them it is all just about sweeping away red tape. You are sweeping away red tape but you are also sweeping away the protections that ordinary mums and dads have in investment and financial world. There are some very important measures in place, whether they are in best interests, in the opt-in or in the annual disclosure, so that every single one of you actually knows what you are getting and what you are being charged. 


We got rid of banned commissions, which everybody in this sector agreed with. Now they are going to change the definition of 'advice' and reintroduce banned commissions. They are going to get rid of the catch-all and the safe harbour, and they are going to scrap opt-in. Worst of all, this has been a shambolic process from day one with draft legislation being dropped a couple of days before Christmas and people having until the middle of January to respond, while not taking it through the scrutiny of the House.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-03-20,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (16:14):  The issue of charities was raised earlier. The Financial Services Council estimate that charitable trusts will save more than $2 million in compliance costs with the disbandment of the ACMC; and that is obviously money that could be allocated to charitable areas; that is to say, the recipients of charity. Like all these things in the deregulatory area, the arguments against deregulation are theoretical but the effects of actually deregulating are practical and real—in this case, $2 million in trust savings.


This is a discussion that is ostensibly about Western Australia, but in 15 minutes of speech from the opposition we had no more than one sentence addressing issues relevant to Western Australia. I thought I might touch on a few issues relevant to Western Australia, just to break that small habit. Before I do that, I would like to place my speech in the context of the notion of this matter of public importance. The wording has an element of spin about it. We hear that word often. Spin is defined as 'the act or practice of attempting to manipulate the way an event is interpreted by others often in a way which is contrary to the best reasonable assessment of the quality of the act.' There are two basic types spin. The first is where you have an event which, on the best factual evidence, is a positive event and the aim of the spin is to have people interpret it negatively. The alternative is an event which, on the best factual evidence, is a negative event and the aim is to have people interpret it positively. We have an event here, which is the deregulatory agenda of the coalition government. A good example of trying to convey a negative event positively—this is a story from the internet so it must be true—is a story about a Ms Wallman, a professional genealogist. She is doing work on her own family tree when she discovers that a relative of hers was also a relative of the US congressmen Harry Reid. It turns out that the great uncle of Mr Harry Reid, Remus Reid, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889. The story says the only known photograph of Remus Reid shows him standing on the gallows in Montana Territory. On the back of the photo an inscription read: 


Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889. 


Ms Wallman, so the story goes, corresponds with the good congressmen's office and he sends back, through his staff, a description, a biographical sketch, of his great uncle, which reads: 


Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.


That is an excellent example of how an event which is largely negative can be spun to look positive. What we have before us is a proposal attempting to do the precise opposite of that—to take an event which is overwhelmingly positive for WA and try to find some kind of negativity in it, no matter how minor, imagined or pretend. In fact, what we have here is a classic example of a motion where there is a massive expanse of silver lining in the sky and Labor is trying desperately to find some kind of imagined dark cloud. 


The event that we are interpreting here is yesterday's deregulation event from the coalition government—legislation and documents tabled to repeal more than 10,000 unnecessary and counterproductive pieces of legislation and regulation, and 50,000 pages of unnecessary and costly regulation. The effect will be $700 million a year in compliance cost savings. That is in one year, so the accumulation of that effect will be extremely significant—$700 million in year one, $1.4 billion by year two, $2.1 billion by year three and $2.8 billion by year four. Some of the headline features of this process are particularly beneficial for WA. The NOPSEMA reform, to have a one stop shop for compliance for offshore oil and gas, will provide massive savings of about $120 million a year recurrent Australia wide. WA represents 75 per cent of Australia's oil and condensate production and 55 per cent of our gas production and, accordingly, the share of WA's benefit of that $120 million compliance cost saving is about 80 per cent. So, in year one the compliance cost saving to the WA economy will be $96 million; it will be $192 million in year two, $288 million in year three and $384 million in year four. Yet, we have here in a discussion about WA spurious arguments about the charity sector. WA's mineral and petroleum exports represent 89 per cent of the state's total merchandise exports and 47 per cent of the nation's total merchandise exports. We are also getting rid of the mining tax as part of this deregulatory package. Here is a massive expanse of silver lining; there aren't any dark clouds. (Time expired)

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:19):  Yesterday, in this House, the Assistant Minister for Education suggested that the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education would be axed as part of their red tape repeal day. I am sure the previous speaker, the member for Pearce, knows there are child-care centres in WA, and that is why it is relevant that that issue be raised in this matter of public importance. I cannot believe that the minister stood here and said that quality child care was red tape. I cannot believe that she stood here and suggested that we need to get rid of the quality framework that ensures good child care. To have good child care we need a system; a system that will ensure good child care. The minister went on to say that she thought it was okay to have less-qualified staff. Part of the quality framework involves ensuring that there are trained staff and ratios setting the requisite number of qualified staff to educate and care for our youngest Australians. But yesterday the minister suggested that this framework was nonsense. In fact, she used the word 'madness'—it was madness to suggest that child-care centres should be required to have qualified staff working in them. She thought it would be okay to have not a kindergarten teacher but a cert III, or rather than having a qualified kindergarten teacher we should have someone with absolutely no qualifications teaching children. It is hard to believe that part of getting rid of red tape includes completely axing the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education. It is what ensures that our youngest Australians get the care and education they deserve. 


To be honest, the stunt yesterday was a smokescreen. It was about trying to cover up what this government is trying to do—trying to do in terms of cuts in jobs, cuts in health and cuts in education. It is also hard to believe that the minister, who was saying it was okay to have less-qualified staff, comes from the same government that says they are going to help people to go from a good job to a better job. Yet, they are saying it is okay to have people work in a child-care centre without qualifications. What is next? Are we going to see further cuts to higher education? That is where people get their qualifications. Are we going to see further cuts to health care? 


Some time ago, the Abbott government was handed the biggest review into government spending in a generation. Because of the confusion, because of the mixed messages coming from government, Australians need to know more than ever what is in that Commission of Audit. Is the government hiding it? Is the secrecy because there are plans for privatisation? Is it the fact that public sector jobs will go?


We all know what happens when we cut public servants numbers: there is a reduction in the quality of service, there are fewer services and services are outsourced. There is only one reason why governments outsource services and that is so those workers get paid less. We see a dumbing-down of the workforce. 


It will not come as a surprise to anybody opposite that in WA there are public servants. There are public servants working really hard to ensure that Centrelink queues are not 90-minutes long and there are public servants working really hard to ensure that Medicare offices stay open and people get help, but all we are seeing from those opposite is secrecy around the cuts. They are trying to hide the cuts because they do not want people in WA to know that they are about to axe their Centrelink staff, that they are about to axe any number of public sector jobs. 


I want to touch on a couple of statistics that the CPSU brought up in a recent Senate inquiry. Twenty years ago the Public Service employed roughly 160,000 people for a population of 17.8 million, yet today they employ only a few thousand more. There are 167,000 employees working for the Public Service, yet our population has grown to 23.1 million, suggesting that we are already understaffed in terms of public servants. If you think that we had the ratio right 20 years ago, then we do not have the ratio right today. Every time I am out there talking to people, they always tell me about their need to get access to our services, but if we continue these cuts, if we continue to wind back the jobs, we will see longer queues and more people waiting. That is not what Australians want.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:24):  I must admit I had to come to the table to actually read the terms of the matter of public importance after the member for Fraser's contribution. The topic is the government’s moves to cut transparency, accountability and consumer protection and its impact particularly on the voters of Western Australia. I listened carefully to the member's contribution, as I always do, and that is why I had to come and look at the blue sheet, because I was not quite sure that he was on topic. Given the fact that all we heard about from the member for Bendigo was child care, it is obviously an open discussion; we can talk about anything.


I want to talk about something that is very important, and that is the carbon tax. It was not mentioned in the MPI, but given the fact that everybody else is talking about everything I will have my turn too. An interview published today by the ABC—so it has to be correct-says:


West Australian Labor MP Alannah MacTiernan says the Federal Opposition should go ""back to the drawing board"" on the mining tax.


The government wants to repeal the mining and carbon tax for reasons that are obvious, particularly for Western Australia, which is referred to in the MPI but which Labor forgot to refer to.The ABC goes on:


Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says Labor's policy is to support the mining tax.


He says one thing in Perth; he says another thing in Canberra. The article says:


But Ms MacTiernan—


the member for Perth—


says the policy, implemented by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Wayne Swan—


the current member for Lilley—


has been ineffective.


""I think it would be fair to say that the mining tax hasn't done the job that it was designed to do,"" Ms MacTiernan told reporters at Parliament House in Canberra. ""This is time to look at that again and look at how we do that in a better way. ""We will have to be talking to state governments about how to introduce a successful mining tax.""


Well, the mining tax has not been a success. Labor's whole budget was based on the mining tax reaping these rivers of money, which were never realised. Unfortunately, so many programs which Labor put forward just have not been able to materialise because there was no money brought forth by the mining tax. 


We know where Labor and the Greens stand with the repeal of the carbon tax. Today in the Senate it was voted down 33 to 29. What a disgrace. Last year, on 7 September, we had an election where the will of the people endorsed the coalition overwhelmingly to get rid of the mining and the carbon taxes, but today in the Senate we have the Greens and Labor, that formidable duo, once again knocking back the will of the people—once again turning their backs on Australians. Labor and the Greens just do not get it. The people of Western Australia go to the polls on 5 April to elect a new Senate—hopefully, they will endorse the coalition overwhelmingly again. Labor and the Greens do not get that Western Australia do not want a carbon tax. They do not understand that 7 September last year, which has been eradicated from the calendars of all those opposite, saw the Australian people have their say and vote for the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes. They do not understand that the coalition does get Australian families, does get small business, which is the engine room of the Australian economy, that it does understand the impost which the carbon tax places on families, and that it has a bill to reduce their electricity bills. 


Today, Labor and the Greens yet again said no. They are so negative, those on the other side; they just say no all the time. Today, Labor and the Greens sent a message to Western Australia—they are smart people over in Western Australia—and I bet they are listening. I bet you they know that this government wants to get rid of the mining and carbon taxes and that this opposition wants to continue those job-destroying, economy-crippling carbon and mining taxes. The Western Australian people saw today that the Labor Party and the Greens do not want to work with the new government. They do not want to accept the results of 7 September; they do not want to abolish the carbon and mining taxes. If the people of Western Australia want a strong voice in the Senate, they need to know that they should not vote Labor and certainly should not vote Greens. They need to get on board with the coalition, get on board with the Liberals or the Nationals, and put good people in the Senate who will overturn these economy-wide, job-destroying, crippling taxes. They have to vote for the coalition.


Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance, said that nearly 100 per cent of all relevant Australian iron ore production takes place in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and it is being hurt by the mining tax. Furthermore, WA taxpayers were forced to pay $627 million in carbon tax last year, increasing the cost of living for families and increasing the cost of doing business in Western Australia. I say to Western Australian voters: get on board, vote for the coalition on 5 April and get rid of the mining and carbon taxes.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (15:07):  Each and every day the Abbott government finds a new way to cut transparency, accountability and consumer protection. The people of Western Australia deserve to know the details of the Commission of Audit and what cuts the Abbott government has in store for them—cuts to education, cuts to health, cuts to the pension and a new GP tax. The people of Western Australia need to know that. They need to know that the Abbott government says one thing before an election and another after. They stand condemned.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:30):  I rise today to let the House know that last Friday the Bendigo Art Gallery opened its new extensions. The project was worth $8.5 million and increased the gallery's size by about a third. There will now be underground storage for the permanent collection.


The gallery was established in 1887 and is one of the oldest in Australia. The new extension will be used for temporary exhibitions and will also showcase some of the gallery's permanent collection. The extensions also have spaces to project on, which allow contemporary and historical works to be displayed. The gallery now has the flexibility to meet the needs of a growing audience and our local community.


The arts are valuable and they are also valuable for our local economy. In 2012, before the extensions, the Bendigo Art Gallery displayed the exclusive Grace Kelly exhibition, and it was a hit with people not just from Bendigo but from all over Victoria. The economic impact on the Bendigo economy was worth more than $16 million. The exhibition ran from March to June.


Investment in culture in Bendigo is a good investment. Cultural tourists are attracted to Bendigo. We are a thriving cultural economy. Just over 9.8 per cent of attendees to the Grace Kelly exhibition were from interstate and a further 0.4 per cent were from overseas. Melbourne residents made up the highest proportion of visitors, and a further 20 per cent of visitors came from other parts of regional Victoria.


I can remember talking to coffee shop, cafe and restaurant owners, and they talked about how people would arrive by train, walk through the town, pop in for lunch and then pop up to the gallery. One owner, Tim Baxter, owner/operator of The Dispensary Enoteca, told me that the only time he is really profitable and really makes money is during excellent exhibitions at the art gallery. That is another example of how important our cultural economy is to other parts of our economy in Bendigo. During the exhibition, he was turning away 20 to 50 people for most lunches and dinners for three months straight.


The Bendigo Art Gallery and its new extension will have a positive impact on our local community. La Trobe University are partnering with the council and the art gallery. Investment in our arts and training is an investment in a creative Australia.


I am proud to have one of the paintings from the Parliament House art collection in my office here in Canberra. It is a painting by abstract artist Roger Kemp. Roger Kemp was born in Bendigo in 1944 and won the Bendigo Art Gallery prize. Roger was born in Long Gully, one of the most impoverished parts of Bendigo. I am proud to have his work in my office here in Canberra and hope that it will be joined by the works of other artists from the Bendigo electorate.


The Bendigo Art Gallery has stimulated and inspired the growth of artists throughout our region. Whether they be students studying one of the new courses at the university or involved the new La Trobe Art Institute—an alliance between the Bendigo Art Gallery, the City of Greater Bendigo and the university—art lovers or artists who have lived in the region forever, the Bendigo Art Gallery is home to them all.


I acknowledge the efforts of the Bendigo Art Gallery board and its director, Karen Quinlan, the City of Greater Bendigo, the former Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, and the former Minister for Regional and Rural Development, Jacinta Allan. Together, they had the vision and foresight to put the money aside in the budget for these extensions.


We welcome everybody to come to Bendigo to enjoy our gallery, to see our new extensions and engage in the exciting exhibitions and programs of 2014. Come help us grow our cultural economy. Next year, we hope that the theatre project will be completed. Again, that is another great state Labor and federal Labor government project. The theatre will be open to you soon.

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (09:30):  Today I am here to speak about the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. Recently I had the pleasure of attending an Australia Day multifaith dinner hosted by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Victorian branch at the Bait-us Salam mosque in Langwarrin, an event which celebrates Australia Day and the coming together of people from different faiths and different cultural backgrounds. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community hold peace, reconciliation, harmony, love and mutual respect as their key values and, importantly, promote open interfaith dialogue to remove misunderstanding and to achieve inter-religious harmony. They have worked tirelessly to convey the peaceful message of Islam and to discredit supposed Islamic justifications for terrorism or extremism.


The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association have as their motto 'love for all and hatred for none' and they are deeply committed to upholding this doctrine. Despite this, the Ahmadiyya community face persecution in many countries around the world, including Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia, where they are considered non-Muslim and, as a result, face serious breaches of their human rights, such as not having the right to vote and having their lives at constant risk because of their moderate beliefs.


In October last year I had the pleasure of meeting with his Holiness Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the fifth Khalifa of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim community, who expressed in his speech and powerful presentation the peaceful beliefs of the Ahmadiyya community and their enduring commitment to support Ahmadiyyas around the world and the communities they live within.


Globally the Ahmadiyya Muslim community has built over 15,000 mosques, 500 schools and 300 hospitals. It has translated the holy Koran into 70 languages and propagates the true meaning of Islam and the message of peace and tolerance through the internet, print and a 24-hour satellite television channel. The Ahmadiyya community is heavily involved in social welfare activities for the benefit not only of its members but of the broader community. It runs a number of schools and medical facilities across Africa and Asia. It also has a very powerful role and influence in Victoria. 


Last week I met with a raft of important Ahmadiyya community members. The Victorian branch of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association are the largest chapter in Australia and they are actively involved in supporting the broader community. These are people who are putting their money where their mouths are, reaching out, trying to connect across faiths and across the community, promoting tolerance and understanding. Unfortunately, for their trouble, in other countries that I have mentioned they are being persecuted; they are literally being killed. President Obama mentioned this in a prayer breakfast speech in Washington. They are a great community; they are a community we should be holding and promoting. I congratulate them on their endeavours and look forward to working with them in the future.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:00):  I want to talk today about two important days. One, the National Close the Gap Day, is today and relates to my role as shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, and the second is National Harmony Day, which is tomorrow. Events will take place here in Canberra in Parliament House but also around the country.


Harmony Day is on 21 March, which is also the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It provides an opportunity to celebrate and recognise the benefits that cultural diversity brings to our country. Since World War II, 7.2 million people have migrated to Australia. We identify about 300 ancestries, and about 45 per cent of Australians were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. We speak about 300 languages. Within 10 years of people coming to Australia, it is likely that 85 per cent of them will become Australian citizens.


Since 1999, more than 55,000 Harmony Day events have been staged around the country. Last Saturday, I attended one in my electorate. I congratulate Shan-Ju Lin, the President of the World Harmony Society, for putting on the event in Springfield, in Ipswich, where I was joined by Bernie Ripoll, the member for Oxley; the Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale; and Senator Claire Moore. It is a wonderful occasion each year and I run a mobile office each time it takes place. There were Japanese sword performances. We saw Maori-Anglican Church guitar performances and kung-fu performances. We saw the Middle Eastern dance and drum group from the Ipswich Multicultural Projects, Polynesian dance by St Augustine's College and a whole host of other events. One of the most moving aspects was the national anthem being sung in an Indigenous language by the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts. I congratulate the World Harmony Society on their efforts.


Ipswich is changing. It is becoming more multicultural. Gone are the days when it was represented by Pauline Hanson, the former member for Oxley, when there was division and disharmony. These days, Ipswich is a vibrant centre for multicultural growth, and I warmly welcome people from all over the world coming to our wonderful city.


I wish to also speak in relation to National Close the Gap Day, which is taking place today. There will be about 1,200 events around the country and about 150,000 people will publicly demonstrate their commitment to closing the gap, to end Indigenous disadvantage in their workplaces, schools and communities. Here in Canberra, Indigenous Allied Health Australia will reaffirm the commitment to closing the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. Only two per cent of the total workforce involved in allied health services are from an Indigenous background. That is quite a tragic situation in the context of what we see. We have about 120,000 practising allied health professionals in this country, delivering an estimated 200 million allied health services around the country annually—and only two per cent of those services are delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So we need to do more.


Recently, I attended Kambu Medical Centre in Ipswich. It is one of the biggest community controlled centres in the country and it is located in my electorate, in the heart of the Ipswich CBD. I recently saw the benefit of a wraparound service provided to young mums, young dads and older Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, by this wonderful centre. I commend them on the work they do.


But, once again, today we reaffirm the commitment required of both sides of politics. Our side is committed; to us, the government remains uncommitted to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan, a 10-year health plan launched in the middle of last year. The government should take up that health plan and undertake its implementation. They should also commit themselves to the national partnership on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. They have not done so. Sadly, we will see Indigenous health disadvantaged in this country if they do not.


I also call on them to commit themselves to improving early childhood development by reaffirming at the middle of this year their commitment to the national partnership. If you cannot get your kids to school and they cannot be taught in the early childhood context by teachers with the educational resources and funding required, then we will not get good outcomes and we will not close the gap in this country. So, the government has a big responsibility. They need to change their perspective, commitment, and determination to fund these wonderful programs.

Mr Turnbull:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


The Government's Interim Statement of Expectations provided to NBN Co on 24 September 2013, directed NBN Co to continue deploying the fixed wireless network, but, in doing so, take into account the very likely availability of fixed line broadband technologies via very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) in smaller communities not currently in the fixed line footprint.


The planning of the fixed wireless network, including site selection and the construction schedule are commercial decisions for NBN Co. As part of the Government's direction to increase transparency in NBN Co, as construction commences in areas, these areas will be updated to the rollout maps, which are all publicly available on the NBN Co website.


Additionally, the NBN Co Strategic Review, received by the Government on 12 December 2013, advised that NBN Co will undertake a detailed review of its Fixed Wireless and Satellite programs. The review will consider strategic options available to NBN Co to cost effectively provide coverage to areas outside the fixed footprint, as well as considering the optimal model to provide this coverage.


The Government will consider the recommendations of the Strategic Review, together with the outcomes of other reviews as part of its transformation of the NBN.
