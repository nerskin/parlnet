"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-10-23,"—by leave— I move:
That the provisions of standing order 111 not apply to the Crimes Amendment Bill 2002.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bill
The Crimes Amendment Bill 2002 will put in place measures to enable the Commonwealth, States and Territories to access and disclose information held on DNA databases for the purposes of:
·	identifying persons killed by the Bali bombing incident; and
·	assisting with the investigation of the Bali bombing incident.
As the CrimTrac DNA database was established for criminal investigation and not for Disaster Victim Identification (DVI), it is now imperative that legislation be passed so that the CrimTrac system can be used for DVI for the Bali incident.
The Australian community expects us to do everything possible to re-unite relatives and friends with the victims of this attack as quickly as possible.
This legislation will amend the Crimes Act 1914 to modify the effect of Commonwealth, State and Territory provisions that restrict the ability of the Commonwealth, States and Territories to exchange DNA information. This will ensure that DNA collected and analysed by the States and Territories as a result of the Bali bombing, can be up-loaded and matched on the CrimTrac system and the results communicated to the relevant authorities both in Australia and overseas.
The application of the legislation to future incidents will require a determination of the Minister which will be a disallowable instrument. This will ensure that the existing regime remains the primary source governing the exchange of DNA information.
The amendments will also clarify the category of people to whom information may be disclosed for non-law enforcement purposes and enable the matching of the unknown deceased persons index with an unknown deceased person access.
There is a need to have the legislation apply retrospectively to ensure that the existing restrictions on the sharing of that information do not preclude its transmission to the Commonwealth.
Reasons for Urgency
The amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 are urgently required as some State and Territory police services have commenced collecting samples from relatives of those who are missing. Until legislation is enacted that modifies existing restrictions on the sharing of information held on DNA databases, the process of investigating the Bali incident and the identification of deceased persons could be delayed.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-10-23,"—The Crimes Amendment Bill 2002 is an extraordinarily important bill. As the government has informed us by letter, it deals with the tragic events in Bali and the need to assist in the rapid processing of the DNA samples that are required for identification purposes and so on. These circumstances mean that the Greens will indeed support the rapid passage of this piece of legislation.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-10-23,"— The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2002 before us today is one that the opposition will be supporting. It makes a number of relatively minor amendments to the education services for overseas students regime, which forms the basis of the regulation of Australia's international education industry. However, in speaking to this bill I would like to make a few points about the state of the international education industry in this country. Given that the industry now contributes some $4 billion to our export revenue, I think it is one that this parliament should consider from time to time. It is now one of the most significant contributors to Australia's export industries.
I am pleased to say that this is an area to which the opposition has been able to devote considerable time over recent years. In many ways it highlights to the cynics in our midst and at large that this is an example of where parliament does matter. We are able to use the forms of the parliament, through the Senate estimates committee and through this chamber, to force change. We now have a situation in which the government has responded to the concerns of the opposition and the industry. The industry, of course, has been only too happy to talk to the opposition about effecting change, and that has resulted in new legislation and, in fact, a whole new regulatory regime. To this extent, I think the government has moved very much closer to the opposition's views on this matter. In this way, we have the development of what seems to be a much higher level of bipartisanship on this question than there was a few years ago.
I think it has also been affected by the changes that have occurred within the department itself, with new personnel working in the department, and by the change in philosophy that has occurred in the department and the government. When these matters were first pursued, I recall government senators, ministers and some in the sector saying that the opposition was damaging the industry by drawing to public attention some of the problems. That is not said so often now. I think it is understood that to have a strong international education industry this country needs an extremely strong quality assurance regime that is internationally recognised as rigorous and transparent. 
In making these points, I draw attention to some of the issues that still concern me. I begin by drawing attention to the shocking tragedy that occurred at Monash University two days ago. I am sure that all senators would be in agreement in expressing their horror at this event and would wish to extend their deepest sympathies to the families of the dead students and to the students who have been injured in this shocking attack. Like many of us, I am amazed at the bravery of the lecturer and the students who disarmed the gunman and at the way in which the students have responded to this at Monash University. In the context of this bill, I note that charges have now been laid for murder. As such, I do not want to comment on the matters that are before the courts.
I would like to comment, though, on a newspaper report in the Melbourne Age yesterday concerning a fourth-year student in the honours degree program in economics at Monash University. It said that the student was struggling with the English language; in fact, the article suggested that this was a contributing factor to the shootings that occurred. The student was due to give an oral presentation to the class on the day that these events occurred. It is argued that the student was suffering from extreme stress. I am not one who runs the argument that people are misunderstood in these circumstances. As far as I am concerned, these are matters for the court, and the full weight of the law should be brought against people in these things.
I want to make a couple of points. The student concerned had been studying at Monash University for four years. According to the AVCC guidelines which exist now— and they also existed four years ago—and according to the Commonwealth guidelines, a student whose English language skills are insufficient to undertake a course successfully should not have been enrolled. It would appear, on the material that has been made available to us, that not only did Monash University enrol a student whose English skills were not up to standard but the English skills of the student had not improved in a period of four years.
In fact, it would appear that the student had been enrolled in an honours course but could not meet the basic English language requirements. I think we are entitled to ask what Monash University is doing allowing a situation like this to develop. Is this the only case where students who are enrolled in programs do not have the necessary English skills to complete them? How widespread is the problem of inadequate English language skills within our international student programs?
I note that in the court in Melbourne yesterday the magistrate had to have the charges read out by a Chinese interpreter. I also note that the question of students with inadequate English language skills was the subject of an Auditor-General's report in Melbourne in April this year, which indicated that a majority of Victorian academics believe that the foreign students they teach do not have sufficient competency in English. A survey of nearly 360 academics in Victoria's three biggest universities revealed that 66 per cent considered that English language entry requirements were set too low for international students. The Auditor-General pointed out that academics found it difficult to assess the written work of students with underdeveloped English skills and that they should be given greater guidance in such assessment.
This is obviously a question that the Labor Party have been pursuing, and we have expressed our concern about this over a considerable period of time. I raised the matter through the report Universities in crisis, and I note that the government have yet to respond to that—days and days after we were told that they would be responding to it. We are waiting for the government to address that particular issue. We would like to know what action the government has taken to ensure that universities and other education providers do not accept for enrolment international students who have had inadequate English language preparation. There is a question here about the quality of programs being provided. If we have students who do not speak English graduating from our domestic campuses then it undermines all students who gain the same qualifications. 
I think we are entitled to ask that the government ensures that education providers meet their responsibilities to ensure that there is sufficient support with the English language and that students who do not have the English language skills one would expect are not awarded those qualifications. In the past the government has sought to deny its responsibilities with regard to international education. Senator Tierney has joined us now. He has often pointed out to me that I was on fishing expeditions and that illegal and dodgy behaviour by crooks was a matter that we should not be concerned about. I have always said, and I will repeat, that the overwhelming number of people involved in international education are of the highest quality and our education institutions are of the highest quality. But the problem remains that a few dishonest operators are using colleges for immigration rorts and visa scams and are bringing people here. It is a people-smuggling exercise and it can undermine the entire industry. By ripping off students in this way these operators can undermine the qualifications of all students.
There are a number of notorious examples one could point to. I am sure that Senator Tierney would remember the case that I raised of the G-Quest Institute of Advanced Learning. That was a case that was drawn to the attention of Commonwealth officers as a result of a complaint received from an overseas student, who said that she went down to have a look at the college and it physically did not exist. It was a vacant block of land. What did the department do about this? They did not smell a rat, of course—nothing silly like that! They made sure a refund was organised, which was very big of them!
The nature of that college and how it got registration was something I think we ought to be more rigorous about. There were several rounds of Senate estimates before the department woke up to the problem. There were extraordinary numbers of unscrupulous operators in our major capital cities, particularly on the eastern seaboard, who were using so-called students to work illegally. They were using falsified attendance records. Recently in Sydney printers were charged because they were printing up bodgie qualifications, academic transcripts of results and various other documents necessary to essentially perpetuate a scam. Those persons have been charged under the Crimes Act and I understand they are being processed through the courts. These are examples of what has happened, and we have been raising such matters for some time.
This government likes to talk tough about border protection. It likes to talk about drastic action being taken against asylum seekers but it does not do sufficient work, in my opinion, to ensure that those people who arrive here on aeroplanes with student visas and who have gained those illegitimately and improperly are dealt with. It has not done sufficient work, in my judgment, to make sure that the bodgie providers—who are undermining the industry and who are not approaching this industry on the basis of a level playing field, because they are getting an unfair advantage economically and in many other ways—are forced out. My concern is that the government has not taken sufficient steps to force changes in that regard.
We do acknowledge that changes have occurred and, as I say, the government has moved forward by introducing the new regime last year. We are looking forward to the review in 2003 that the government has announced and we are keen to know how the new legislative framework is standing up to the pressure that invariably occurs. As I say, this is a bit like tax avoidance. You need to be constantly vigilant. The same bodgie operators seem to reappear in one guise or another, involving new groups of people. They are taking in all sorts of gullible people, including people now within the university sector itself who have gone into partnerships with some of these bodgie operators in the quest for additional student numbers without doing the proper checks and review of their own operations. These are points that have been raised in the Senate estimates hearings and demonstrated to be correct—despite the denials, I might add, of some of these companies who have written to me and no doubt to the Privileges Committee, and I am looking forward to yet another hearing on that. 
Despite the fact that ads are placed in newspapers, some simple devices can be used to establish that these events have occurred—that is, that a number of universities have fallen for these bodgie operators. That is why we welcome the changes that have occurred and the change in attitude. We will remain vigilant and we will continue to place pressure on the government to ensure that there is a follow-through to look behind the state accreditations. All too often the government is still relying upon being told that certain things are all right and is not following through to ensure that the decisions taken at other levels of government are in fact followed through. The capacity to enter colleges to ascertain whether the ESOS Act is being contravened; the seizure of documents, computer records and other things; the demand for information or records, and an improvement in student record keeping are all things we support. However, they have to be enforced. That is why we are concerned about recent events. In the time remaining to me I will go to some of those issues. 
We have had about 100 colleges close down in the last year or so. Of the 30 or so colleges that I have named, my understanding is that about 25 of them are now out of business. We have a reasonable strike rate record in naming people who have done the wrong thing, having them investigated and having them forced out of the industry. But it should not be up to senators and the resources of a senator's office to produce this. I am concerned that further actions be taken by the department to show that they too are concerned. I understand there are some six colleges currently under investigation over compliance issues, and I would like to hear from the department about what progress is being made on the six colleges that were named in the last round of Senate estimates—because we have yet to see work in that regard. 
We have had the example recently of the Australian College of Technology, which collapsed in August and owed $1 million to students and creditors. The academic director of this college was a Michael Megas. This is a man widely known in the international education industry. I understand he had been convicted for embezzlement while working for other industries. He and the chief executive of the college, Mr Nabil Nasr, have been convicted for embezzlement of funds. Both the key players in the college had criminal records involving dishonesty. Yet they managed to get a licence and run an international college, and only when it collapsed was any attention paid to their past record. These were people who were able to operate under the old rules because the `fit and proper person' test was different under the old rules from what it is under the new rules. This is an area in which we need to move. We need to find a mechanism to make sure that those crooks who are operating in the industry and who are able slip under the regulatory regime are encouraged to get out.
We have had the example of the Sydney International College. The proprietor of that college, Mr Phillip Lobo, claimed a doctorate in business administration which, as I understand it, he bought on the Internet from an institution known as Harrington University. Quite clearly, by purchasing his qualifications on the Internet—running an educational institution and claiming that he has a doctorate—he was misleading potential students and their families.
Then there was a private school in Queensland, the Kooralbyn International School, which collapsed. At that school there were 132 international students displaced. If my memory serves me rightly, a number of those students could not be found. There was some $400,000 in paid-up fees. They had to be bailed out by the state education department in Queensland. Because the current act does not require institutions that are in receipt of recurrent funds from the Commonwealth government to be part of the TAS, the Tuition Assurance Scheme, those students could not call upon the protection of this regulatory regime. That is another area that requires further attention.
There are questions that require further action and, while this bill proposes relatively minor changes, the 2003 review provides the opportunity for more extensive changes to be entertained. They go to, for instance, the relationship between private colleges and the universities, the issue of institutions that receive recurrent funding but are currently exempted from the ESOS provisions, and the question of the fit and proper persons test and the means by which we can ensure that persons who are not genuine educators and who are not genuinely running educational businesses and who have serious criminal records can be excluded from the industry. 
This bill is a development on the regime that we have seen and has come about as a result of parliamentary discussion. This is a point that can never be underestimated. It is an occasion where we can demonstrate that the parliament does work. The bill is essentially technical and it does provide for additional powers for the Commonwealth to act. These are measures we support. However, we do think that further action needs to be taken. The bill also needs to be seen in the context of a staging post in that regard. We place the government on notice that our interest in international education is not declining.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2002. This bill underpins one of the great export success stories of the Australian economy over the last 15 years. The whole education export industry is a sign that a country as intellectually rich as ours—one in which there is a very high level of education and training—can, in the new information age, develop past the primary and secondary stage into the tertiary stage of industrial development and create industries that support jobs and growth in our economy. Since I have been in this place there has been remarkable growth in this industry.
When I first came into the parliament in 1991, this was a $700 million industry and it is now a $4 billion industry. It is very important that the parliament should get right the legislative underpinning of such an important export industry. The development of this legislation has had an interesting history. The first piece of legislation was brought in in 1991, under the Labor government and Minister Dawkins, who had considerable concerns about operations of some of the private colleges that were not delivering quality or value. At that time, he gave reasons as to why this industry needed this sort of legislation. In the parliament in 1991, discussing the export of education services, he said it was:
... a major industry, one which is already making an enormous contribution to Australia and is already extending Australia's influence as a provider of education and training services throughout the region
...	...	...
We do not need to go back to the old rules, which prevented students coming here at all. We can manage this program and deal with the problems as they arise ...
The legislative history of ESOS—the overseas student legislation—is one of managing the problems as they arise. The original legislation was quite draconian and, as I mentioned, it was a $700 million industry which has now grown to a $4 billion industry. But it would have been cut off in its prime if the original legislation, designed by the former Labor government, had gone through at that time.
It was a very short bill, and it was the first bill I ever had to deal with when I came into this place. The education committee then was chaired by Terry Aulich with Karin Sowada, leading for the Democrats, and me for the Liberals. We were all horrified by this piece of legislation. We conducted an inquiry into the eight-page bill and suggested 32 recommendations to change it. At the end of the day the minister accepted that, because he realised that he had overreached the proper provisions that were needed for the control of this industry at that time and it would have killed off the industry if those had gone ahead. So a regulatory regime was brought in that was not quite as draconian.
As the industry very rapidly expanded, obviously, problems did emerge and, as Minister Dawkins originally said, `We will manage the program and deal with the problems as they arise.' There have been five amendments to the bill over time. As this industry develops and evolves and problems emerge, we have to manage them by adjusting the legislation and the provisions to try to get the balance between providing a system of education for overseas students that, in the first instance, provides quality and, in the second instance, provides a driver for our economy. Those are the goals that we are trying to achieve. 
For the most recent changes that were made a few years ago, I would like to pay special tribute to Senator Kay Patterson, who at that time was the parliamentary secretary to the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs. She did major work to get the education bureaucrats and the migration bureaucrats to work together in a much more harmonious and consistent way and actually put in place changes that solved a number of problems that were developing in the industry as it evolved.
I was on the migration committee in the mid-1990s in Cairns when we picked up the fact that the two departments were not working very well together. They were working in their own little silos and they really needed to work in a very cooperative way to make sure that the migration and the education aspects of these problems were being dealt with in a consistent way. Senator Patterson did a marvellous job in bringing that together and developing a regime which solved a lot of the difficulties that were arising. Of course, we now have a new piece of legislation and we welcome the fact that the Labor Party is supporting that legislation. It does strengthen the act further and, as Senator Carr mentioned, there will be a review later this year and further changes might be made then.
In reference to the new changes, Dr Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has said:
Ambiguities will be removed and greater clarity provided with regard to certain sections relating to Commonwealth powers and sanctions of the ESOS Act. These measures all contribute to providing greater certainty for the Australian education and training export industry.
We do have a much better regime: problems have been raised and responded to. In such a complex industry, which is privately provided, I suppose that you are never going to solve all the problems. But, through the processes of the parliament, I think we are just about at the point where we have finetuned the legislation so that it complements and supports a great Australian export industry. It is industries like this that are the hope of the future. I think this parliament has played a major role in helping it flourish, thus not only assisting in the education of students that have come from overseas but also giving great underpinning and support to an export industry and, therefore, to the entire Australian economy.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-10-23,"—in reply—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2002. We have had two contributions, one by Senator Carr and one by Senator Tierney. In relation to Senator Carr's contribution, I acknowledge some of the concerns he expressed about certain schools and colleges. All I can say to him, and remind him of, is that these schools are in fact registered and licensed by the various state Labor governments around this nation. We as a federal government do not seek to second-guess whether or not they are necessarily appropriate institutions.
—You haven't read the act, have you, to say something as silly as that!
—I have just checked with the advisers, who confirmed exactly what I have said, Senator Carr, so I think it is quite obvious who has not read the act. Once again Senator Carr has charged in with an interjection, clothed with his usual ignorance, and has shown that he does not know what he is on about. I invite the honourable senator to speak with his mates in the various state Labor governments and see what can be done. If the matters that are raised are an issue—and I am sure they were raised genuinely by Senator Carr—then clearly these matters do need to be addressed, and I simply seek to direct him to the appropriate area to have them addressed.
In relation to Senator Tierney's contribution, I acknowledge his longstanding interest in education and especially in overseas students in this country. As Senator Tierney pointed out, when he first came into this Senate in 1991, the value to Australia of overseas students coming to this country was $700 million. That figure is now $4 billion. As I understand it, in the academic year 2000, there was a 16 per cent increase in the number of overseas students. Most of them came from South-East Asia or were our Asian neighbours. So much for the nonsense that we continually have fed to us by those on the extreme left of politics in Australia that somehow Australia's reputation amongst our near neighbours is being damaged by the Howard government! In fact, overseas students are coming here in droves, as witnessed by these figures, because they respect this nation and they respect the rigour of our education system. 
I would not want anybody to think that we are interested only in the dollars. Clearly, we are interested in the dollars; it is good for our economy and good for our educational institutions. But there is also a richness added to this nation by having these students come from overseas. They add to the richness and diversity in the schools and in the communities in which they live. After they have undertaken their education, the vast majority of them go back to their home countries having had a very positive experience of Australia and, as a result, spread the good news about Australia to their fellow countrymen when they go home.
The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2002 seeks to make the regime that we have somewhat more robust. I understand that a review of the complete act will commence by December 2003. I believe that this area of education is often overlooked and not given the regard that it deserves. I compliment Senator Carr and Senator Tierney on their interest in this bill and for the fact that they have been willing to make a contribution to the debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. Finally we are now nearing the end of what has been quite a drawn-out process on the government's implementation of its Australians Working Together proposals. The bill before us today originated in 1999, when the former Minister for Family and Community Services, former Senator Newman, heralded a `seminal' address at the National Press Club. According to media reports, the speech and discussion paper were to announce a major welfare shake-up, including cuts to payments for parents with children over 12, cuts to disability pension recipients and more mutual obligation. But the minister was forced to abandon the proposals after community backlash and simply announced the McClure committee process. The bill before us today forms the government's response to the McClure welfare reform committee. 
The measures included in the bill are incremental. After more than six years in government and three years specifically contemplating welfare reforms, we have a set of proposals that take us back rather than appreciably forward. We have wasted six years of unemployed Australians' lives; for six years we have denied them opportunities to assist them back into work. The central spending measure—the work credit—is essentially the restoration of Labor's earning credit scheme that was abolished by the coalition in 1997. Other elements of the package essentially restore the tailored individual case management that was a feature of Labor's Working Nation reforms, which were dismantled by the coalition on coming to office. Given the prospect of a continuation of the status quo, the elements contained in this bill are a marginal improvement, but we do have concerns.
Apart from the government's slash-and-burn mentality when it comes to making the necessary investments to assist people to move off benefits, over the past few years it has demonstrated its cold-heartedness. It has presided over a `shoot first, ask questions later' breaching policy that saw a trebling in the number of people being breached—many unfairly. Labor has no objection to proper compliance in the social security system— indeed, it was Labor that introduced data matching and most of the other compliance tools that are in use today. This is essential to ensure that the public has absolute confidence in the operation of our social security safety net.
But this government went too far and penalised people without sufficient justification. It has used a ramped-up breaching regime as a crude tool to reduce benefit outlays. It did this rather than make the proper investments in people and decent financial incentives, coupled with a fair compliance regime, to assist people to get off benefits and back into work. And Labor was not alone in its criticism. Some of Australia's largest charities rang the alarm bell: St Vincent de Paul, Uniting Care, and even those who have had close dealings with the government, such as the Salvation Army and Mission Australia. They had to help the flood of people who were left without an income, many of whom had been breached unfairly. 
How do we know that they had been breached unfairly? We need look no further than the stories of people being breached for not turning up to appointments that they had never received advice of or that clashed with other compulsory activities. The Pearce review and, more recently, the Ombudsman exposed patently unfair breaching activity. We also need look no further than the government's own statistics on appeal. Up to 50 per cent of people who appeal their breach have it overturned. Belatedly the government acknowledged that there were problems and announced a range of administrative measures to improve the regime. In all honesty, though, it is not enough. The government is going to have to accept that further changes need to be made. And in the context of this bill, we are going to insist that they are made if the government is to receive support for its changes in relation to the parenting payment and the mature age allowance. 
Before I discuss what Labor will propose to restore the balance in relation to breaching, I intend to outline Labor's position on the detail of the bill before us. Schedule 1 sets out proposed new arrangements for people receiving parenting payment, PP. The measures apply to both parenting payment partnered, PPP, and parenting payment single, PPS, recipients. PP recipients with a youngest child between the ages of 13 and 15 may be required to participate in one or more activities—such as Jobsearch, education, training or community work—of up to 150 hours duration over a six-month period; that is, up to six hours per week. A participation agreement will set out the activities that the person agrees to undertake or participate in during the life of the agreement. This requirement will not apply to a person with a severely disabled child. The penalty regime proposed for PP recipients subject to the new arrangements differs significantly from the breaching regime for Newstart and youth allowance recipients. The regime has more checks and balances in place before a breach is applied and also has the ability to reinstate and fully backdate payments on compliance. 
Before a breach may be applied to a person, Centrelink must first examine whether the person had taken reasonable steps to comply with the agreement, then examine whether the terms of the agreement were appropriate, and then establish whether the person does not have a reasonable excuse for the failure. If at this point it is decided that a breach will be imposed, the person's compliance will then be monitored at shorter intervals until the person starts to comply. Compliance with the terms of an agreement will trigger waiver of a breach penalty. Their payments will be reinstated and, if compliance occurs within 13 weeks, payments will also be fully backdated. There will be no administrative breach penalties applicable to parenting payment customers, as is the case now.
Labor is broadly supportive of the government's efforts through these measures to provide a better transition for parents who are just two short years off being placed on a full activity-tested benefit like Newstart. There is compelling evidence that more needs to be done to assist parents to gradually return to the work force as their children become older. Bob Gregory's research using longitudinal data has reinforced this point. Whilst Labor's view is that these are not onerous requirements, we believe there needs to be greater scope for exemptions and more flexibility in the participation agreements. In the light of the government's `shoot first, ask questions later' breaching regime, Labor is concerned to ensure that the application of financial sanctions to parents is an absolute last resort. Accordingly, Labor will be moving amendments in the committee stage to broaden exemptions and improve the flexibility of the participation requirements, with particular attention paid to ensuring that the terms of the participation agreements properly take into account the circumstances of parents and their children.
Schedule 2 establishes a tax exempt language, literacy and numeracy supplement of $20.80 per fortnight to assist people who undertake approved language, literacy or numeracy training and who receive one of the following payments: DSP, mature age allowance, Newstart allowance, parenting payment, partner allowance, widow allowance or Youth Allowance. This is a positive measure and will assist with the costs of participating in such training programs. It receives our full support, although we encourage the government to examine other areas of participation where a payment such as this could be paid to help offset costs.
Schedule 3 establishes the Personal Support Program, the PSP, which replaces the Community Support Program, the CSP. The PSP is designed to assist people who have multiple non-vocational barriers, such as homelessness, drug and alcohol problems, mental illness or domestic violence. These people have been judged to be unable to participate in employment related activities or to benefit from employment assistance because of their barriers. The PSP is designed to encourage social as well as economic participation by establishing outcomes that match participants' individual abilities, capacities and circumstances. The schedule proposes to make PSP an activity available under the activity test for Newstart allowance and Youth Allowance and an activity that can be included in a person's activity agreement. It also proposes PSP as an activity that can be included in a person's parenting payment participation agreement from 1 July 2003. The schedule also contains breach penalty waiver rules that will ensure that a breach penalty does not apply while a person is participating in a Personal Support Program. This schedule is supported by the opposition. 
Schedule 4 seeks to close entry to the mature age allowance and partner allowance from 1 July 2003. Current recipients will be saved. As a result, the respective populations of mature age allowance will be completely phased out by 2008, and of partner allowance by 2020. Mature age allowance is currently paid to people who are unemployed and aged over 60 who have no recent work force experience and have been receiving income support payments for nine months. Partner allowance is currently paid to people born before 1 July 1955 who have no recent work force experience and are not caring for dependent children and who have partners receiving an income support payment.
The changes will involve no loss of benefits or concessions. Newstart allowance recipients aged over 60 who have been in receipt of benefits for nine months will still be eligible for the higher rate of allowance, pharmaceutical allowance and a pensioner concession card. Notwithstanding Labor's concerns about the next schedule and proposed amendments, this schedule will receive our support.
Despite the government's efforts, the application of new participation frameworks for parenting payment and the mature age unemployed is far from perfect. Accordingly, Labor will be moving amendments in relation to these measures. I intend to outline these amendments in some detail shortly. Whilst not attempting to exceed the scope of this bill, Labor will also be moving amendments to improve the fairness of the compliance and breaching regime for other job seekers.
Schedule 5 seeks to establish new participation requirements for those who formerly would have received mature age allowance and partner allowance. People who might otherwise have qualified for these payments will be eligible for Newstart. These requirements are intended to be more flexible than those applicable to other Newstart clients and will be extended to Newstart recipients aged 50 and over. The terms of the activity agreements are made more flexible in line with the changes made to parenting payment recipients. Significantly, a new modified breaching regime will apply which allows full reinstatement of payments upon compliance. The government's changes also incorporate a more flexible reporting period of 12 weeks rather than fortnightly.
Labor are supportive of these changes but we do have a number of concerns. Labor created the mature age allowance in recognition of the fact that many of those who were eligible faced little prospect that they would work again. Mature age allowance removed this group from the requirements that exist under Newstart and, for many, the view that they were part of the active labour market. While the changes bring this group back within the Newstart population and will ensure that some are more engaged in retraining or skilling, for others it may impose participation requirements that may not be appropriate to their circumstances. Accordingly, Labor's approach is to safeguard the population of 50-plus-year-olds from any unreasonable obligations. Labor will move amendments similar to those in relation to schedule 1 to ensure that the participation agreements properly take into account the circumstances of the mature age unemployed.
Labor are also concerned to ensure that the mature age group are not forced to apply for countless job vacancies where they have little or no prospect of success. Accordingly, Labor will seek to introduce caps on the number of job vacancies that they will be asked to apply for. These caps will only apply in circumstances where job search is required in the activity agreements; in many instances, voluntary and paid work may occur in lieu of job search. 
Schedule 6 introduces the working credit and a modified implementation date as announced in the 2002-03 budget. The credit is strikingly similar to Labor's earning credit scheme, which the government saw fit to abolish in 1997, a short-sighted cut by any definition. The working credit will provide a benefit of up to $1,000 per year for all work force age income support recipients. Labor are disappointed that the government has had to delay this measure, which is desperately needed and which is the central spending measure in this bill. It goes some way to improving incentives, but more does need to be done. Those who have exhausted their credit or who have sufficiently low levels of part-time earnings for the credit not to accumulate will still face effective marginal tax rates, EMTRs, of 90 per cent or more.
Schedule 7 contains an amendment that enables Centrelink to trial new methods of flagging family homelessness. This measure is the result of extensive research conducted jointly with Hanover and other homelessness services. It is welcome and receives Labor's full support.
I want now to foreshadow other amendments. Labor are heartened by the more constructive approach the government has taken in relation to the activity agreement and penalty regime for the parenting payment and mature age allowance recipients. We have in this legislation a different approach to penalties. There has been an attempt to address the situation of parents and older unemployed people, although we do not necessarily believe that the government has got it right yet.
As I indicated at the commencement of my remarks, Labor will be making some moderate amendments to ensure that the proposed new framework for mature age and for parents will work fairly. However, it is our view that a fairer framework should also be implemented for other job seekers at the same time as we consider this bill. Some of the elements in the proposed regime for parents and for mature age should be incorporated into the activity agreement and compliance regime for other job seekers, namely Newstart allowance and Youth Allowance. This needs to be done.
Despite the government's assurances that its administrative changes have improved the safeguards that protect against unfair breaching, the truth is that the government can just as easily push the changes to one side and ramp up breaching again. The Pearce report, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Australia's most respected charities have all concluded that there is a gross imbalance between the level of breaching activity and the incidence of wrongdoing on the part of job seekers and other income support recipients. Labor are of the view that the government too quickly dismissed many of the suggestions made by Professor Pearce in his independent report on breaching. The report is a balanced piece of work that, in some cases, pushes tough but fair requirements. Most importantly, the report focuses on ensuring compliance. The government has consistently claimed that its breaching policies are not about revenue raising. If this is the case, it should embrace the logic of Professor Pearce, Julian Disney and their own Heather Ridout and undertake further reform of the system to ensure that it is compliance oriented.
I reiterate that no side of politics should tolerate welfare fraud. We did not in government and in fact we established the data-matching programs that ensure compliance and weed out the fraudsters. But we must respond when our systems are chewing up Centrelink staff time and time in appeals and are costing people on very low incomes who are trying to play by the rules their payments. Accordingly, Labor will move a range of moderate amendments to give effect to a number of recommendations of the Pearce report. Labor will move amendments to ensure greater fairness and improved compliance for Newstart and youth allowance recipients. Labor will move amendments in respect of the cooling-off period for participation agreements. Recipients required to enter into an activity agreement will be able to change the terms of the agreement, with the approval of the secretary, within 14 days of the agreement first being signed. The secretary will be required to advise them of this right. As for appropriate agreement terms, formulation of the terms of participation agreements will need to more thoroughly take into account the circumstances of the job seeker, including costs of compliance, travel, particular barriers to employment, medical conditions and any caring responsibilities. The agreement will also be required to include the assistance to be provided to the job seeker to comply with the agreement. In respect of new safeguards before breaches are imposed, before the application of a breach the secretary is to determine that the terms of the agreement are still reasonable. Before a breach is applied, the secretary will be required to attempt to contact the job seeker by a minimum of two different mediums. 
With regard to notice and application of breaches, a notice setting out the reasons for a breach must be sent at least 14 days before the breach is to be applied. As for exemptions from agreements, we will broaden exemptions to include job seekers utilising SAAP funded crisis accommodation. As for measures to ensure that those in housing difficulty are not breached, sections of the act dealing with movement to lower employment areas will be amended to include a clause to protect people who have moved due to housing affordability. In respect of the penalty accumulation period, Labor will move to reduce the accumulation period from two years to 12 months.
These are reasonable amendments and many build into the broader compliance mechanism proposals that the government is seeking to introduce for smaller groups— parents and mature age people—through its bill today. Labor are happy to talk to the government about any technical issues regarding these amendments and are willing to discuss options to make them workable if the government is concerned that they are likely to be difficult to implement. However, we stand by our intentions: we can and must improve the fairness of the system. In addition to these measures, Labor will be moving a second reading amendment urging the government to adopt a fairer and more effective breach penalty regime broadly in line with the Pearce report recommendations— namely, that benefit reductions should not exceed 25 per cent for the first or second breach, that breach reduction and non-payment periods should not exceed eight weeks and that benefits should be reinstated on compliance. I now move the amendment that has been circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
“But the Senate condemns the Government's unfair application of breach penalties on job seekers and calls on it to amend the breach penalty regime in line with principles outlined in the report of the Independent Review of Breaches and Penalties in the Social Security System (The Pearce review), including:
(a)	a rate reduction for first or second breaches of no more than 25 per cent of benefits;
(b)	breach and non-payment periods of a maximum of 8 weeks duration; and
(c)	reinstatement of benefits on compliance.
I seek advice from the chair, Madam Acting Deputy President. Do I have to speak to that amendment now or can I address the amendment at a later stage of deliberations? 
 (Senator Knowles)—You speak to it now, Senator.
—If I speak to it now, can I return to it or will my time be exhausted?
—Your time will be exhausted in one minute and 42 seconds.
—So, if I choose not to speak to it now, can I speak to it in more detail later?
—No, it is a second reading amendment, Senator, and you need to make your contribution prior to the second reading.
—Thank you for that guidance, Madam Acting Deputy President. In that case, in speaking very briefly to that amendment, it is instructive to look at the current breaches under the bill. They are significant breaches: $863 payable over 26 weeks for a first breach, $1,144 payable over 26 weeks for a second breach, and even higher penalties for third and subsequent breaches. They are indeed significant penalties to apply to those who are seeking employment and whose breach may be of the most minute or incidental nature. When one looks at the history of the current breaching regime in recent years, one notes that in the period from 1996-97 up until 1999-2000 the average monthly number of breaches increased from about 9,400 to 25,200. So there has been almost a trebling in the number of breaches since the government instituted the new regime in 1997. We believe that the government has stepped up breaching activity as part of a concerted attempt to hassle people back into work. This activity reflects a view that the personal attributes of the unemployed are— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. The bill before us is touted by the government as a major step in welfare reform towards building a modern and responsive social support system for people of working age. Reform of the Australian welfare system is overdue and indeed needs to be a continuous process. The Australian Democrats have long called for reform, but true welfare reform is that which assists Australians to participate economically in community and society while at the same time enabling them to live in dignity and with sufficient means to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families. This bill does the opposite. It provides the means to take away the means of support not only of unemployed Australians but now also of sole parents and their children and older Australians. It was never the intention of the McClure report, out of which this bill has allegedly sprung, that people be trapped by rules which do not help them get a job, which cut their benefits and which stigmatise and penalise them because they have lost the support of a partner while raising children. Welfare reform means investment before savings can be achieved. This bill is simply about savings, with little investment by government. In the name of welfare reform, this government is reintroducing the 19th century notion of the undeserving poor, those who in past centuries would be condemned to the workhouse because of unavoidable life events that overtook them.
The government's construction of mutual obligation is that, if you are a sole parent, you are undeserving not only of income support but of the right to parent your own children. If you are a partnered parent, this government's policies encourage you to stay at home and care for your child. You can claim the baby bonus to stay at home for five years following the birth of your child and you can claim family tax benefit B for your child's entire growing period, with no regard to your partner's income. This way, even wealthy families are therefore encouraged to have one parent stay at home and raise the children. But, according to the public policies, if you lose the support of that partner, you no longer deserve to be a parent.
This bill fails to acknowledge that research published in 2000 by Eardley and in 2002 by Gray et al. reports that, of all income support recipients, single parents are already the most active in education, training and employment—even more than Newstart allowance recipients. ABS data shows that half of the population of single parents with dependent children are already active in the work force. Gray's longitudinal data on maternal employment in Australia shows that both single- and couple-family mothers return to employment as their children get older. Given that they already have the highest level of labour force participation and given that the majority of sole parents spend only three years in receipt of parenting payments, the question must be asked: why is compulsion necessary, particularly one with financial penalties attached?
The extension of compulsory activities to parents is a conceptually misguided initiative, drawn from inferences and imagined stereotypes about sole parents, without reference to the demographics or reality. Introducing new compulsory activities devalues the significance of caring for children, even though social indicators such as family homelessness, children in care and youth suicide point to a need to increase support for families' care-giving activities. The absurdity of this bill is that it requires a parenting payment recipient with young children to take time away from work and study to go and tell Centrelink that they are working or studying. Interviewing parents of young children and financially depriving them when they are unable to attend because of an unforeseen family crisis does not help them get a job. Current family policy that rewards mothers in coupled families for withdrawing from the work force but stigmatises them when relationships end is incoherent and inconsistent. 
The best protection against unemployment for single parents is to enable all parents, whether coupled or single, to make structured transitions in and out of the work force, as their care-giving needs require, until the child reaches the age of 16. This needs consideration of initiatives such as maternity leave, affordable quality child-care services, retraining packages and subsidy entitlements, and tax breaks for caregivers returning to work. Increasing the economic risks to parents through inventing new methods to reduce and remove their income—as this legislation does—will directly impact on the welfare of their children.
There is no cogent research evidence that compulsion is a better approach than assistance, hence there is no strategy in this element of the bill. It would have been a more efficient use of public funds to increase resources to the JET program, the Jobs, Education and Training Program, which is so successful but which has such enormously long waiting lists. This program has a proven track record of assisting sole parents back into the work force, yet we do not see in this bill—a bill about participation in the work force—any extension of that particular scheme.
Indeed, this government is determined to plan for people who already have plans and to check on people who are already busy trying to meet family and work commitments and who would have to satisfy a range of new paperwork and activities for the Centrelink office in order to avoid losing a subsistence income. In its changes to the sole parent pension and parenting payments, this bill focuses almost exclusively on compelling parents to get into work, to the unfortunate exclusion of their caring roles as parents. Forcing parents to agree to undertake an activity which will have no effect on their chances of gaining employment, which has no regard for their personal circumstances and which threatens to take away the financial support with which they house, feed and educate their children is both regressive and dangerous. It provides no protection for children who will be subjected to the outcomes of decisions imposed on their parents because of this bill.
The penalties on sole parents will be considerable. While the percentage reductions of payments are the same as those currently applying to Newstart recipients, the actual amount of penalty for single parents will be greater. A first activity breach for a sole parent will be $987. The Australian Democrats asked Senator Vanstone earlier this week whether she could give a guarantee that a person who fails to attend a Centrelink interview would only be subject to the administrative test and not the activity test. The minister could not give such a commitment, despite touting the changes to administration made by Centrelink since 1 July 2000.
Therefore, a single parent who is unable, because of family or parenting requirements, to comply with a Centrelink direction to attend just one interview could be fined $987. That is just extraordinary. The sum of $987 is a lot of money in anyone's terms, but it is significantly more so when you are trying to raise children alone on income support, which is already well below the poverty line. It may mean that you will not be able to pay the rent for weeks and hence face being homeless. It may mean you cannot afford school fees, excursion fees or shoes and clothes for your children. It may mean that you will not be able to feed your family adequately for that week. All of this may happen because you could not comply with a request to attend a Centrelink interview, a request that has no regard for your circumstances in the first place.
Reports released this year by the Hanover Foundation, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Commonwealth Ombudsman all concur that the current breaches and penalties system applying to Newstart allowance and Youth Allowance customers is harsh and counterproductive and is sending people into homelessness and poverty. The extension of this punishment framework of breaches and penalties to parents will impact most harshly on parents who are least able to challenge Centrelink's decisions. A single parent who has just had $987 stripped from her payments and who cannot see her way straight to rent a house and feed the family over the next few weeks will certainly not have the wherewithal to navigate the complexities of authorised review and social security appeals mechanisms. 
Most sole parents live week to week with no reserves, and cutting payment on a day when rent and bills are due is devastating for them. Most likely, the disadvantages of illiteracy, limited education, transitory or uncertain accommodation or family trauma have led to the failure to comply in the first place. Adding financial deprivation to the equation does nothing to assist that person to get a job. The impact of such circumstances is not always easily understood by people who have not experienced them personally, and sole parents will be faced with subjective judgments by Centrelink staff. Sole parents are not immune from the severe and demoralising pressures faced by long-term job seekers, particularly when very few jobs are available which they can realistically hope to secure and when many of those jobs—even if secured—will be part time and casual in nature.
This is not mere surmising on our part. We know that the punitive breaching regime has had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable Newstart and Youth Allowance claimants. The system has operated to identify those who are not coping, remove their income, reduce their capacity to cope still further and then blame them for it. Hanover welfare services, which provides services to people who find themselves homeless, found that almost one-third of their clients have been breached in the last 12 months. The Salvation Army found that around one-quarter of its emergency relief clients had been breached. Of even more concern is that it found that 11 per cent of clients said they had to turn to crime to survive.
The report of the Independent Review of Breaches and Penalties in the Social Security System—the Pearce report—made strong recommendations to the government. It found that, notwithstanding the existence of phrases such as `reasonable steps', `reasonable excuse', `without sufficient reason' and `special circumstances' in the relevant legislation, in practice insufficient investigation and consideration of reasons and surrounding circumstances have often prevented the achievement of this intention.
I would draw the relevant provisions of that report to the Labor Party's attention if indeed they wish to go down the route of adding more special circumstances and reasonable steps as possible exemptions to breaching, because the evidence is that it does not work. The evidence is that it does not reduce unfairness. The evidence is that departmental officers are overstressed, have too many clients and simply do not have the time, the effort or even the inclination to implement things effectively. For this reason the Australian Democrats are not satisfied that the presence of such exemptions or even new exemptions will provide any guard against arbitrary or unfair impositions of penalties, despite the parliament's clear intention.
For many Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients, the breaching regime has been a sickening and frightening experience. Extending it to new groups, including single parents, means more crisis and suffering for the most disadvantaged people in Australia. The extension of breaching to sole parents raises the prospect of an even worse impact on children, since there is no other income source available to those parents or children. In a climate where welfare agencies are reeling from the impact of Newstart clients who encounter breaching and where they are overloaded with requests for food and shelter, and in the light of the independent review and the Ombudsman's inquiry, it is simply outrageous to contemplate extending this regime to sole parents.
Research in US welfare reform also provides some unsettling findings relating to children. A considerable body of that research suggests that forcing parents away from caring for their children may have detrimental effects on teenage children but little effect on rates of poverty. The Australian Democrats have always believed that parents are best placed to make decisions about the relative importance of employment and parenting and to determine when their own parenting responsibilities enable them to participate. 
This bill provides for exemptions from compulsory activities for children with profound disabilities or recognised disabilities linked to the carer allowance. The term `profound disabilities' is extremely misleading. Cystic fibrosis, which is a terminal condition, is considered to be neither profound nor a recognised disability, according to this legislation. The actions of this government in 1998 saw the parents of children with this condition denied carer allowance. Juvenile diabetes is not recognised as a profound disability, despite being a potentially life-threatening condition in children that requires significant parental intervention to ensure a safe medication regime. The notion of a single parent being compelled to leave a child with a potentially fatal condition unsupervised in order to participate in training or volunteer activities is contrary to the notion of parenting.
The Australian Democrats do not support rorting of the welfare system, but sole parents struggling to raise their children are not rorters. They are vulnerable people who have encountered difficult life circumstances and who, as statistics report, will move into economic participation relatively quickly as their circumstances permit. The Australian Democrats propose that sole parents should be encouraged to participate and we particularly welcome the inclusion in this particular bill of participation payments, albeit at such a low level. But we want to do this in a constructive way. We want to offer access to affordable and accessible child-care support; access to out of school hours recreation programs for adolescent children; better access to stable, low-cost public housing; accessible transport; and, importantly, access to job creation schemes that will provide them with employment instead of compelling them to add to the ranks of the seven unemployed Australians for every job vacancy already out there in the labour market.
At the very least, we should take long-term measurements of the impact of these changes on Australian families, before implementation. We do not want to hold up the implementation of the Working Credit scheme, although we do wish that it were more in keeping with current earnings patterns. But it is an un-Australian thing to do to link it with legislation that vilifies and penalises people who have lost the support of a partner, as this government has done in the bill before us. The Australian Democrats will sit down with the government and nut out welfare reform but, where that reform reflects a commitment by government to address the real economic and social barriers to participation, we will do what the government has failed to do—that is, act on the recommendations of the independent review by Pearce et al. and amend the breaching provisions of the social security legislation so that it reflects the original will of parliament.
I should note in passing that the bill does contain a number of other provisions, as indicated earlier. The Working Credit scheme will be supported by the Australian Democrats. We opposed the repeal of the former working credit scheme in 1996, as it was a measure that did in fact assist unemployed people in accessing casual and part-time work. It is only a very small, token start and, as Senator Bishop pointed out, it certainly has been delayed as an obvious budget savings measure this year. But it is a scheme that we support, and we would encourage the government to extend it to ensure that it actually does provide much better encouragement to unemployed people to pick up casual and part-time work.
The Personal Support Program included in this bill is also a measure that we will be supporting, but, again, our concern is access to the number of places. The problem right across the welfare reform system and in this notion of mutual obligation is so often that the government is not providing sufficient resources for its side of mutual obligation, whether it be the JET program for sole parents, the PSP or the personal service advisers that are being put into Centrelink offices. The resources are simply not there to ensure that people are given every encouragement and every assistance to participate in the labour market. 
The Democrats have deep concerns about the closing-off of the mature age and partner allowances. This will impose JobSearch activities on groups of Australians who, frankly, really have the probably the lowest chance of actually finding employment. So often, for those in mature age and partner categories who have been out of the work force for a very long-time, if they want work they will look for work. There is plenty of evidence to show that people in those categories want to work rather than not participate in the labour force. As the ABS showed in its statistics on labour force participation earlier this week, it is quite clear that so many people drop out of the work force because they have been told time and time again that they are too old for the job. It has been quite clearly shown through the Job Network and the Productivity Commission that the government is not providing sufficient assistance to the mature aged to get back into work. Whilst there have been some attempts to improve this in recent months, the situation for mature age workers is simply not good enough in terms of ensuring that there are jobs available for them.
I should note in passing that in Queensland the Beattie government has initiated a community jobs program directed at the mature aged in particular. That scheme has a very high success rate of easing the mature aged back into employment by at least giving them a real job for a period of time. It works far better than Work for the Dole, with a 90 per cent placement rate as opposed to about a 35 per cent placement rate on Work for the Dole. It highlights that if you offer real work opportunities doing real community work and real training opportunities then it will be recognised by employers in a way that participation in Work for the Dole clearly is not being recognised.
The changes to the breaching regime in this bill are obviously providing different rules for parents and mature age workers. The Democrats believe that this is the first acknowledgment that we have seen from the government that the breaching regime that is in place is simply not satisfactory in terms of the unfairness that it is causing. I particularly welcome the second reading amendment moved by Senator Bishop, which draws attention to the failings and unfairness of the government's breaching regime and its failure to ensure that the full recommendations of the Pearce inquiry have been implemented. I would encourage the Labor Party to turn that second reading amendment into formal amendments at the committee stage. Certainly, the Democrats would support amendments reflecting the Pearce inquiry being moved and becoming part of the act, because we believe that that provides a better basis on which the breaching regime can finally be reformed.
In conclusion, this bill contains some things which are good and welcome and a lot of things which simply are very harsh and unfair. It is picking the eyes out of McClure and leaving so much of what is important in McClure and the regional welfare reform blueprint in the too-hard basket. Most of what McClure recommended in terms of the government's side of mutual obligation has not been delivered. The programs and support which are needed to ensure that people can participate effectively in the work force have not been delivered or have been delivered only partially or ineffectively. These things need to be reviewed by this government if welfare reform is to proceed in a form that delivers social inclusion and better economic opportunities.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. The increasing pressure of globalism is leading to a far greater role for economic rationalism in welfare economics. As the negative impacts of globalisation spiral, the wage earners' welfare state is threatened. All aspects of the welfare state, from financial assistance for the unemployed and disabled to health care, are experiencing considerable cutbacks. The bill before us today, misleadingly titled `Australians Working Together', reflects that fact. 
We know that unemployment is rising and that the government's figures in unemployment are rubbery. The department's glossy, full covered PR pack—that is, the Australians Working Together initiative—acknowledges that today more than one in five, or over 2½ million people, are receiving government income support. Thirty years ago, just one in 20 working age people were receiving welfare. The government continues to perpetuate the myth of a low rate of unemployment of around 6.2 per cent, or a total of 609,400 Australians unemployed. In a number of regional and rural areas, the official unemployment rate is much higher. I will quote a few statistics from Queensland: in Coolum, it is 17.8 per cent; in Maroochydore, it is 14.4 per cent; in Rockhampton, it is 9.4 per cent; in Mount Morgan, it is 27.8 per cent; in Gladstone it is 7.5 per cent; and in Gympie, it is 11.8 per cent. 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics define an employed person as someone who is doing paid work for at least one hour a week. The real unemployment figures would be even higher—and our estimate would be in the millions—if the definition of employment was not so narrow. The Brotherhood of St Laurence recently pointed out that the unemployment rate does not show that jobs are disappearing or being created, whether they are part time or full time, permanent or casual. It also does not show whether people are working too many hours or not enough hours, or for how long they remain without work. The stark reality is that there are simply not enough jobs to go around.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics data indicates that, in February 2002, there were seven job seekers for every job that was available. Trends towards privatisation and outsourcing are forcing jobs offshore. Even Minister Alexander Downer's foreign affairs department has encouraged Australian businesses to consider outsourcing their computer needs to low-wage developed nations such as India. The deliberate destruction of Australia's manufacturing, clothing and textile industries through the removal of tariffs has seen the demise of thousands of jobs in small businesses.
Meanwhile, the World Trade Organisation has reaped a fateful harvest for our farmers. The seemingly deliberate and well-orchestrated drive to turn family farmers into peasants on their own land has exacerbated unemployment in rural and regional Australia, with many seeing no way out but to head for a life of unemployment in the cities. Rural Australia is one of the major casualties of the global trap of free trade, yet it is interesting to note that the government's initiative Australians Working Together ignores the rural constituency. The government's PR pack does not make one mention of people living in rural Australia, not one mention of the special and unique circumstances—that is, the tyranny of distance, the lack of educational services, the barriers to employment— that these people face. Where is the assistance for those rural people?
The bill should be more aptly titled the `Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (IMF and the Government Working Together) Bill'. Most current economic reform programs here in Australia have a common origin: the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's prescription included privatisation, removal of health subsidies and cutbacks to welfare budgets. In 1998, the International Monetary Fund made a recommendation to the Liberal-National coalition government:
... to limit the duration of unemployment benefits to encourage employment search, and to scale back other social welfare benefits that discourage labor force participation.
Again, in 2000, the IMF articles of agreement stated:
Directors welcomed the steps being taken to reduce disincentives to workforce participation and endorsed the view that the welfare system should provide greater incentives for people to move from welfare to work.
This year the fund congratulated the government on its Australians Working Together initiative and urged further comprehensive reform. Pushing people off welfare rolls and into low-paid jobs—which fits into the IMF's description for abolishing the award system for setting minimum wages—is a very narrow solution to the real problem of employment. So what is needed? What is needed is legislation that addresses the deep structural crisis that Australia has been in and is currently experiencing. Indeed, we have a pathetic bandaid, superficial approach that focuses upon individual responsibilities or individual failings of welfare recipients themselves: legislation which implements a kind of new paternalism and mutual obligation or voluntary compliance centring on people's choices, not on the fundamental causes of unemployment; legislation which echoes the mantra that there is no society— there are only individuals and corporations; legislation which positions Centrelink as a new interventionist bureaucracy replacing some of the roles traditionally filled by the church, the family unit and professional counsellors. 
As a counter to welfare dependence, this new paternalism advocates the controlling of patterns of behaviour. Rather than merely helping those in need, new paternalists place great emphasis on program administration and efficiency, privatisation and the enforcement of social values. They are set out in two of the documents contained within the Australians Working Together package. One has a reference `Centrelink—with life events'. The customer chart in that shows a program from birth to death. If we look at the second document, regarding life event frameworks for the new service delivery model, this is what Centrelink is setting out. The document is headed `How can Centrelink help you?' It asks: `Are you responsible for children, changing your marital or partner status, needing help after someone has died, sick or disabled, caring for someone sick or disabled, arriving to settle in Australia, looking for a job, responsible for a business or self-employed, in a crisis situation, seeking or changing education, planning your retirement?' We have Centrelink becoming the overarching program through which this paternalism is going to be effected.
The new paternalism amounts to the close supervision of the poor. This supervision goes hand in glove with future scenarios which would employ the use of biometrics in human service provision. I will raise that issue later in the debate on the bill. This could be along the lines of the model in the US state of Connecticut which uses a person's fingerprints to verify their identity or it could be an extension of Centrelink's speech recognition system, the multimillion dollar system that will be used by customers reporting for the government's working credit scheme, a key initiative of Australians Working Together.
`Personal support programs', `community work coordinators', `personal advisers', `participation plans', `training accounts', `passports to employment' and `mutual obligation' are phrases that our unemployed people are increasingly more familiar with. For the government, it is a cosy middle ground between the welfare state and the market economy. It is cosy because governments world wide are gradually extracting themselves from the provision of welfare and other social services. Take the UK, for example, where the leading Centre Left think tank, the IPPR, recently published its report Building better partnerships. This report was seen as a key event in the move towards the privatisation of essential public services in the UK.
In the context of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS, it will be necessary to eventually dismantle the public provision of health, education, welfare and other social services, precisely because these services represent the major area of expansion for corporate profit. Corporations will transform welfare in rich countries so that profits can be made from the delivery of tax funded services. GATS means that these developments may well be forced on our citizens. In Australia, the community welfare coalition has already foreshadowed the outsourcing or privatisation of Centrelink programs and services and has raised issues regarding a lack of staff resources and the enormous pressure to get clients in and out as quickly as possible.
The Howard government's welfare reforms are premised on the idea that unemployment has been caused or at least exacerbated by the welfare system. The government's attitude towards unemployment is reflected in Minister Abbott's statement that welfare is `cruelty masquerading as compassion'. Rather than addressing the causes of unemployment which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech—causes such as the dramatic decline in our manufacturing industries, the devastation of family farming, privatisation, outsourcing and corporate collapses—the government's programs represent and promote the belief that unemployment is a problem because of the deficiencies of the individual, like being unmotivated or lacking a work ethic. The real problem is that there is insufficient demand or growth in the economy to employ these people. 
The Australians Working Together initiative creates a new stream of bureaucrats— that is, personal advisers—who will give information about getting back to work and about balancing work and family, and tips on how to look for work or take on study, training or volunteer work. This is a new sort of intervention where Centrelink becomes a coordinating service for people's lives. It is a form of paternalism—a life events approach from birth to death. Almost everywhere, the welfare state is under siege and is being recast in new directions. Unquestionably, welfare reform is needed. Equity and efficiency demand suitable new welfare programs where existing programs can be reliably shown to discourage the search for work and the acquisition of skills or to hinder growth and employment. There is even greater need, however, to reconsider the problems that globalisation brings: unemployment, the ascendancy of market immorality, the overriding preoccupation with international competition, privatisation, and the codification of social welfare as economic activities.
Many of the new social problems that old welfare state programs are failing to meet spring from the effect of economic policies being pushed on the world by radical liberalisation. Much of the welfare state crisis is due to market failure and free market ideology. While there will always be support for government initiatives which generally assist unemployed people, One Nation believes that we need a far more vigorous and long-term assessment to ensure the continuation of the public welfare safety net. This will be achieved by the government committing to a program of constructing public infrastructure and the introduction of domestic consumption premiums on primary produce consumed in Australia. One of the major problems that One Nation has with this legislation is that it does bring some benefits but it fails to address the real cause of the unemployment that we see in Australia.
As I mentioned earlier, there is Centrelink's program for the implementation of voice recognition in their services. The speech recognition system would be used, firstly, for customers reporting to the Commonwealth government's working credit scheme, which will begin in April next year. People using the scheme will call the automatic speech recognition line, report how much money they have earned and thus, according to Centrelink, they will be able to keep more of their income support payment. People will call in every two weeks. What we actually have is a program whereby, instead of the person going to Centrelink and having at least a one-on-one interview with a person, they will pick up the phone—their voices would eventually have been digitised so that they would be recognised by that system—and they will then give their details to a machine—that is, a computer—over the phone line. How impersonal! How will our unemployed people have an incentive to use a system such as that? I believe that is only one of the uses to which biometrics is eventually going to be put. In conclusion, One Nation sees enormous discrepancies in this legislation. We see that there are areas that should have been addressed, including those that I have raised my speech. I seek leave to table the two documents that I have circulated in the chamber.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak, in this debate on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002, about the current provisions on breaches and penalties under the social security system. Recently, I was fortunate enough to be with you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, on a review that the Senate handled of the participation requirements and penalties in the current social security system. This particular Senate inquiry was fortunate enough to be briefed by a range of people—community groups, participants in the system as it currently works and genuinely interested people—about how the current system works before any changes could be made in future legislation. The key, common concern of the people who appeared before the Senate committee was the harshness—perhaps the unfairness—and the fear generated by the current system of breaches and penalties under the social security system. This is a particularly important point as we move towards discussion about extending this same process. 
The original changes to the system came under the process of Australians Working Together. That is such a splendid title: Australians Working Together. In fact, the whole concept is that, if there is going to be genuine movement forward, Australians must be working together under this system. One of the key components of the changes to Australians Working Together—it is called AWT, and I do not like that very much—was the concept of increased mutual obligation. This came out all the time during our Senate committee process. What we heard from the people who were working in the system, from recipients of different payments in the system and from people who were helping make the system work as it is was that there was some concern about the mutual nature of the obligation. This is where I come to a point about how any focus of breaches and penalties would operate. Encouraging people to participate is the key concept of Australians Working Together.
There is an acceptance that people must be engaged in the community and must be engaged in participating in the work force and in training. There is no question about that. It is the process by which people are engaged in participation that is being questioned, as well as what happens to people who, for whatever reason, are not effectively engaged. I submit that the current process of breaching and penalties does not encourage participation. In fact, it pushes people away. It encourages fear and concern and it increases the massive distrust of the system. The end result of such a process is not increased participation; I fear it is actually exclusion, marginalisation and total loss from the system.
There has not been a lack of reviews into the way breaches and penalties operate in our system. As with all social security operations of government departments, this has been reviewed and reviewed. In terms of the system of breaches and penalties, there have been internal reviews, the Senate committee process, the much publicised Pearce independent review and an Ombudsman's report on the whole process. It is a good thing that people are reviewing the system. What we need to do is listen to what comes out of those reviews.
A common theme of the results of those reviews is that it must be done better. Another common theme is that there are genuine administrative and processing problems in the current system, which means that the system is not working effectively. I am not here to put blame on anyone for those failures but I am saying that those failures are making the entire concept of mutual obligation and participation fall over, because people are being pushed away. Their distrust of the system is increasing, and therefore the efforts to involve and engage them are not being successful.
The process that we have had, in terms of what has gone wrong with the system, seems to hinge on a couple of key themes. One theme is the communication between the people who need the system and the people who work in the system. There seems to be an ongoing need for improvement, and this is accepted by all the reviews, accepted by people in the various departments and accepted by the ministry. The issue of getting people who want to be involved back into work and participating as members of the Australian community is being damaged by the fear generated by the way that the breaching system is currently operating.
We had a number of submissions from people that talked about receiving communication from the department. The communication was intended to keep them involved with the department but it actually forced them away. It forced them away for a number of reasons, ranging from their inability to understand the system and their inability to understand the communication through to their genuine fear of the whole departmental process. The very efforts being made by the department to engage with people actually ended up pushing them further away. 
In that way, the entire step 1, step 2, step 3 breaching process, with its increasingly severe penalties, just made people who were already marginalised and feeling isolated more damaged and less capable of doing the very things which the legislation intends them to do: to engage with the department; to engage with the community; and to seek out effective methods of training, communication and ways of developing so that they can return to the work force in some way.
If any of the legislation that has been placed before both houses of parliament is going to be successful, the key issue must be a rekindling of trust between those people who are developing the legislation and those people who need it. The amendment before the house, which talks about a change in the current breaching provisions quite specifically as part of an overall change to the general legislation, takes on board three specific components of our concerns with the current breaching regime.
One aspect is just the sheer size of the breach. We heard various people before our committee talk about the immediate impact of the cut in payment. It was very difficult in many ways for those of us who were sitting on that committee to be confronted with submissions from people talking about what it was like to lose such a large and immediate aspect of your very livelihood. I am not talking about people who are receiving supplementary payments. I am not talking about people who, in most cases, are receiving money on top of some kind of supported wage or any wage that they are currently able to receive. I am talking about people who are totally reliant on fortnightly welfare payments.
That sense of total reliance is something that many of us cannot understand. I am talking about people who are totally reliant on a fortnightly payment which is already quite small, and about a breaching regime which currently takes massive amounts of money. There are various debates about what a fair system is and I am aware that the system that was in place in the early nineties was, in some ways, more difficult than the one that is currently in place. But this is not the time to be talking about which system is tougher than others. This is the time to talk about the information that we have received from people who know the system and participate in the system, and to work together to try and make the system better.
There is no particular value in saying that one system is tougher or has more impact than another. What we have is a body of evidence, which we have all shared, from a range of different reviews and which points out that the impact of the current system is onerous. The impact of the current regime of penalties and breaches has the most monstrous effect on people who, currently, are mostly young unemployed. That is where the current range of breaching penalties is imposed.
Their stories are now public. They are stories about what it means to have your money cut, sometimes without even realising why, sometimes without receiving effective communication from any level of government— to suddenly go to your bank account, on which you are totally reliant, and find significant cuts in your fortnightly payment. Under the current system the cuts can extend over strike 1, strike 2 and strike 3 for increasing periods of time—up to half a year. The current statistics—and there are numerous statistics, but I have to admit there are very few I trust—indicate that there is a low percentage of single breaches. People who are into this cycle of breaching fall into consecutive breaching. Once you have breached once, once you have fallen into the penalty process once, it is highly likely that you will then fall into a second and a third process. That means that you are not further involved in the community and that you are not more likely to take up job opportunities or develop yourself as a trained, effective person in the community. What happens is that you lose money, you lose your accommodation and you lose your ability to move around, because you have no money to access transport. The very system which has been developed to encourage people to participate is, as I said, moving people further away, pushing them aside and reinforcing some feeling that they are not worthy, that somehow they are evil, that they have done wrong and that they must be punished. I question the ability of a system that uses that form of terminology— the terms `breaching' and `penalties'—to effectively engage and enforce participation. 
The second point is the quantum. Perhaps it would be useful for all of us on our current wage—and this was something put to us by the Welfare Rights Centre of New South Wales during the committee hearings—to translate our current employment and wage rates to a breaching regime and see, using our own money, what it would mean to cut it down by the current percentages and for the periods of time. It is a particularly confronting system, and I encourage people to have a look at their own processes and see how that would work.
The evidence provided to us by people who were directly involved in the Pearce review indicated that they were not saying that there should not be some form of penalty. They were not saying that there was a philosophical opposition to any kind of process to encourage people to keep in contact. They were questioning the size of the penalty under the current regime and they were clearly questioning the process by which it was administered. They could point to massive amounts of evidence which indicated that people were not trusting the way the system was operating. There was considerable evidence about the administrative processes within the department which indicated that it was not an easy thing to maintain communication between the people who are working within the system at the departmental level and the people who are totally reliant on it. The people who are totally reliant on it do not fit any particular model. There are all kinds people who are reliant on the social welfare system, and not all of them can be clearly defined or labelled. A system that would work effectively for some client groups may not, and in fact I submit does not, work for everyone. 
Our reliance on written communication is misplaced. We seem to think that, once you put something in the mail and send a recipient a letter, they will get it automatically and then be automatically part of the process. That has been proven to be just not true. You cannot rely on written communication to engage people in the social welfare system. I submit that you cannot rely on written communication to get anyone engaged in any system and certainly not people who are reliant on the social welfare system, some of whom—our figures indicate many of whom—are in situations of homelessness or, at best, are rapidly moving between different addresses. If our process continues to be reliant on people receiving mail or having regular phone calls, it is guaranteed to fall over. The first step towards receiving a penalty under the system is reliant on someone responding to mail or responding to telephone communications or, I am thrilled to say, responding to an SMS! The department were very excited about their ability to SMS people on mobile phones. That is a wonderful thing but I question just how many people who are totally reliant on the social welfare system will have the immediacy of the SMS system for receiving their information from the department.
It was clear during the discussions that we had that some of the people who were most interested in developing and making the system work better were the people in Centrelink and the Department of Family and Community Services who administer the system. Those people genuinely wanted to make the system work better as well. Throughout the Ombudsman's report and other documents that I have read it has been noted that the departmental people are very keen to look at ways to make the system work better. That is a tremendous effort to contribute to the concept of Australians Working Together, because we are never going to develop an effective social welfare system if it develops into some kind of contest. I have mentioned this before in this place. There is no moral high ground. There is no righteousness in this argument. The only way we are going to be able to develop and, much more importantly, implement an effective social justice system—as opposed to a purely welfare system—is for everybody who has a stake in this to be actively involved and be part of the solution. That involves some genuine communication between all the stakeholders. 
We must ensure that, instead of the first reaction to people expressing criticism being outrage, the first reaction is to listen. We must listen to the issues being raised by the people who know the system. If people say that they are having difficulty with the system, perhaps the first response should be to listen and to say, `How do you think it could work better?' The committee made some specific recommendations about how it could work better. In fact, the three points in this amendment are directly part of a response from the committee comprising people who want to make the system work better. There is no expectation that the system should be destroyed; there is an expectation that the system should be made to work better. One of my pet issues is with point (c) of this amendment, which talks about the `reinstatement of payments benefits'—I do not like the word `benefits'—`on compliance'.
I began by saying that the concept of this whole process is to have people participating. That is what we are trying to do. If the concept of the penalty is to ensure that people participate then surely once the person or persons, if it is a group, do fulfil their requirements under the legislation and communicate, that must mean that their payment should be returned. This, in fact, was one of the key issues that came out of our discussion. We have this concept of `balance'—we use the word a lot at the moment—between encouragement and the success of the system, which is about getting people communicating and participating, and yet we have a penalty which says, `We have not heard from you; we do not know where you are; you have not fulfilled your commitment to the system, so you have breached.' The requirements of mutual obligation must be fully understood by the person before they receive the payment. If, in fact, the intent of the process is to get people training, engaging, communicating and moving towards work, then when they do communicate, get in touch, and fulfil their requirements surely that must mean that they have complied. Surely then their payments and their status in the system should be restored.
If we use this process to continually punish, to—in many more ways—label and marginalise, we will not have Australians working together. We will have more people who are distrustful of our system and who are fearful of any engagement with government agencies regardless of which ones they are. One of the real issues is that people do not know with whom they are speaking. There is not a great deal of knowledge out there in the community about exactly which government department does what. In fact, if people actually get the courage to come into a government department, they just want all their questions answered by whoever is behind the desk at that time. If we are to break down that fear and engender trust and get people into the system, surely we must reward, encourage and nurture them so that the next steps of Australians Working Together will be successful and they will be working together.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-10-23,"—I rise to speak on the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Australians Working Together and other 2001 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. This bill implements the first stage of the government's response to the McClure report on Australia's social welfare system. These measures were announced in last year's budget and have been examined by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, which last month tabled its report highlighting the bill's shortcomings.
This bill increases the requirements imposed on people in receipt of income support under threat of having benefits suspended. With the exception of a few worthwhile measures—such as the introduction of a working credit to assist people moving from income support to paid work; minor financial assistance for language, literacy and numeracy training; and more help with child care—this bill continues the government's misguided approach to addressing long-term reliance on income support, poverty traps and shortfall of available jobs at adequate rates of pay. The Australian Greens support measures to assist people to move into paid work, including providing relevant training and education, but we do not support coercion or penalties which cause substantial hardship to people already struggling to meet their material needs. 
Like so much of this government's focus, this bill is couched in terms of providing `incentives for self-reliance' which the government says are missing in the income support system. The government tells us people should be `taking responsibility for their own futures'. The language reveals the government's misunderstanding of the circumstances of Australians who find it difficult to obtain a secure job at reasonable pay that also permits them to meet their responsibilities as carers and members of their community. It blames individuals for their circumstances instead of acknowledging structural impediments to greater work force participation. These include affordable child care, publicly funded education and training, decent wage rates, reasonable hours of work, paid parental leave and creating work in places where people live—not expecting them to move, possibly with a family, to some other place. This language disguises the government's real agenda, which is to create an impression of activity amid a burden of paperwork and interviews. What is required is a serious refocusing on our workplace environment, including the pursuit of sustainable and socially useful work; the sharing of available paid work; and a significant investment in training, education and child care. It underestimates the generosity of spirit amongst many Australians who in general, unlike this government, are not bent on punishing disadvantaged members of our society.
This legislation is based on the policy of mutual obligation, which under this government translates to onerous obligations on individuals and minimal obligations on the part of government. The government argues that people receiving income support should give something back to society in return. But this policy is founded on false premises. People rely on income support when their circumstances prevent them from earning income. They may be mentally ill, physically disabled, suffering chronic ill health, caring for young children alone, or caring for a sick partner or parent, or they may have been retrenched from their job. These circumstances occur through no fault of the individual, and income support is provided so that they have enough to eat and a place to live. It is the minimum that a decent society should provide to those members whom our economic system has failed.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIANS WORKING TOGETHER AND OTHER 2001 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Senator JOHNSTON,",LP,2002-10-23,"—I rise to discuss as a matter of public interest the situation in Western Australia which arose recently following the demise of the timber industry in that state. People living in rural and regional Western Australia are currently enduring a sustained and vindictive attack, if I may say so, upon their standard of living such as has not previously been seen in my state. 
By way of example I point to the formerly thriving communities of Manjimup and Pemberton in the south-west of Western Australia. The Premier of my state, with one stroke of the pen, has devastated Manjimup and the lives of timber workers throughout the entire south-west of my state, but particularly in Manjimup, when he slashed timber quotas in that region. Everyone, including the timber working families of Manjimup, realises that our old growth forests must be preserved for future generations. But that preservation can be achieved through a reasonable program to phase out the logging of such forests with a gradual and less traumatic shift to value adding and plantation industries. 
The reality is that my state Premier does not care at all about WA's rural and regional communities. I have been to Manjimup twice since being elected to this place. The leader of my state parliamentary party, Mr Colin Barnett MLA, has visited Manjimup five times since the last state election. Mr Gallop is yet to go there, notwithstanding his quite capricious actions regarding the livelihood of the people living in these communities. 
I have observed first-hand, with the assistance of the Hon. Paul Omodei, the very hard-working and popular member who represents that local community, just how resilient and committed the people of Manjimup and Pemberton are to their communities and to the region generally. In the face of the loss of many millions of dollars in annual investment and of hundreds of jobs through the decimation of the timber industry, this community is bouncing back, I am pleased to advise the Senate. There is renewed energy in the area of export horticulture. This region exports potatoes into South-East Asia and cauliflowers into Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. Avocados, wine, apples and other horticultural products are all being exported from this region. Traditional agriculture is thriving, thanks to beef and sheep. Plantation timber is coming along, and tourism is slowly but surely developing, permitting a recovery from this government induced disaster.
In these circumstances, I am drawn to ask just how many times the Premier of my state has visited this community and shown concern for the livelihood of these people. The answer, of course, is: not once. However, since being elected, he has been to China, Dubai, the United Kingdom and other places with an international address. It seems that, clearly, he has a great deal more concern for people living over there than he does for those living in his own state. 
The contempt shown for the hard-working people of country Western Australia is all played out against the backdrop of a further and more insidious assault upon rural and regional communities. That assault is in the form of the repeal of the Electoral Distribution Act. Since the mid-1970s the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia has used every possible occasion when it has been in power to seek to introduce changes to the electoral arrangements of my state. It was therefore no surprise when the current Western Australian state Labor government set out to introduce one vote, one value alterations by undertaking a movement of eight seats from the country to the metropolitan area. The changes were going to alter the balance between metropolitan and country seats from 34-23 to 41-15. 
It is no surprise that various people allied together to oppose the alteration to the state's electoral laws and expressed their determination to fight those changes. They formed the Country Alliance, which took the matter, with the Clerk of the Legislative Council of Western Australia, to the full court of the Supreme Court.
The crucial legislation was the Electoral Distribution Act, which was to be repealed to inaugurate these changes. There were two potential problems for the government. Firstly, section 13 of the act had entrenchment provisions. Section 13 stated:
It shall not be lawful to present to the Governor for Her Majesty's assent any Bill to amend this Act, unless the second and third readings of such Bill shall have been passed with the concurrence of an absolute majority of the whole number of the members for the time being of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly respectively.
The government had no difficulty in the Legislative Assembly. However, it had a 16-17 ratio in the upper house. The government actually had 18 seats in the upper house. However, one of those seats was occupied by the President and, of course, under the Constitution Act of 1899 the President of the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Western Australia does not have a deliberative vote, only a casting vote. The government asserted that a vote of 17-16 was sufficient to meet the terms of the Electoral Distribution Act, which sought simply to repeal the previous entrenchment provisions.
The other question which arose from section 13 of the act was that the words seemed to suggest that the law could be broken if the legislation, passed in this way, were to be presented for royal assent. The interesting legal aspect that flowed from this was the position in which that left the Clerk of the Legislative Council, Mr Laurie Marquet, with respect to the passing of the law in these circumstances. Marquet himself actually referred the matter to the full court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia for determination. Liberal parliamentary legal affairs spokesperson and former Attorney-General Peter Foss suggested that, at the very least, the government had put Marquet in a difficult and precarious position. He stated that if the bill had received vice-regal approval, the Clerk may have been, or could have been, facing criminal charges if the law were subsequently struck down. This would have been on the grounds of it having been found not to have been properly passed. Mr Marquet's referral sought a determination from the full court, as I said, as to the legitimate passing of this repeal act.  
In the unreported decision handed down last Friday week—the case is Marquet Clerk of the Parliaments of Western Australia v. The Attorney-General of Western Australia and Anor, 2002, WA Supreme Court, 277—a 4-1 majority rejected the view that the simple majority of 17-16 met the provisions of section 13 of the Electoral Distribution Act. As Mr Justice Steytler and Mr Justice Parker stated:
It is clear that the entrenchment provision in s.13 was not enacted for its own sake. As indicated there was a purpose for its enactment and that purpose, in our view, is material to understanding the intended meaning of its terms. It is also relevant to the understanding of this purpose, and to the interpretation of s.13 that, in the absence of a fundamental change to the manner of constituting the Houses of the Houses of Parliament, the 1947 Act could not be repealed, in the sense of finally revoked or annulled, and not replaced. 
The legislative purpose for the enactment of s.13 is therefore to be perceived from the viewpoint that it was intended to entrench the provisions of an Act which dealt with an essential and politically important aspect of the process by which the Houses of Parliament are constituted, and was enacted in the expectation that there must always be legislation on that topic.
This discourages any narrow understanding of the intention of Parliament when it used the word `amend' in s.13. It is strongly indicative, that the purpose of s.13, which its language was intended to achieve, was to protect or `entrench' the provisions of the 1947 Act from change, except in circumstances where the requirements of s.13 were satisfied. Whether, as a matter of form, change was effected by some alteration of the existing provisions, or by their complete repeal and re-enactment incorporating the desired change, would appear to be of no materiality in the context of such an intention. `Amend', in our view, should be interpreted accordingly.
That is to say, of course, that to simply drive around the entrenchment provisions by amending the act was unconstitutional. It is, therefore, with some great relief for regional Western Australians that the Supreme Court decision was handed down, as I say, last Friday week. In its wisdom, the court found 4-1 that the democratic principles of the Legislative Council were being abrogated by this piece of legislation. 
The Western Australian Attorney-General, who is vested with the onerous responsibility of upholding the law and democratic principles in that state, was attacking the constitution he was bound by his office to defend. The Attorney-General's actions were found to be unlawful. He, along with the Premier of Western Australia, must bear the responsibility for the undermining of the Western Australian constitution and its parliamentary systems. The position of the Attorney-General is now plainly and obviously untenable, given the decision of the Supreme Court. I pause to observe that this Attorney has a long and thankfully unsuccessful track record with respect to the prosecution of this issue. He has attacked with zeal the constitutional electoral framework of my state for the past seven years. It has become the major focus of his political life.
Four judges of the Supreme Court have now confirmed that he was wrong to pursue legislative change through underhand and backdoor legislative strategies. He has already been warned by the highly regarded Clerk of the House, Mr Laurie Marquet, that his parliamentary tactic of trying to circumvent the legitimate legislative process was flawed, but he ignored this warning and pressed on. Further to this, there were numerous precedents that would have told him that what he was proposing was wrong. The Supreme Court reminded him of these precedents when telling him that he was so very wrong. It is of considerable concern to realise that Western Australia has an Attorney-General prepared to ignore sound advice and reasonable warnings in the pursuit of an ideological objective. I have no doubt that, given the level of obsession, further scarce resources will be committed to an appeal of this decision.  
The current system of how Western Australians are elected to the Legislative Council has been put in place for very good reason. Western Australia is a large and vast state with, if not the biggest, one of the largest electoral territories in the world. It is 3,000 kilometres from the north of the state to its most southern point. From South Australia and the Northern Territory borders to the west coast it is close to 2,000 kilometres. Coupled with a large population mass that is centred on the capital city of Perth, it is inconceivable that there should be an electorate system that would allow the people living in an area that represents less than one-tenth of one per cent of the landmass of the state to have vastly disproportionate electorate representation in the parliament of Western Australia. 
If the Labor government in Western Australia had been successful with its chicanery, we would have one electorate that stretched 2,000 kilometres from Coral Bay on the west coast to the South Australian border on the east side of my state. Four of the country electorates would have been individually larger than the entire state of New South Wales. This would be clearly unfair and would have denied effective representation to a significant number of Western Australians. What was suggested by this legislation was that one member of parliament would be able to travel for a day and a half through his electorate and still not reach the other side.
The Western Australian Labor government has reportedly wasted $3 million in lawyers' fees on this bid which, on anybody's reading of the argument, was always going to fail. It would not be beyond the realm of possibility that the all-up cost of this little foray into the electoral reform process is going to cost something like $9 million—an abhorrent waste of taxpayers' funds. Western Australians have rallied to the cause to protect their rights and to protect their right to representation—and decent representation. Of course, senators who come from states such as Tasmania, where you can virtually look across to the other side of the whole island from any high point—have absolutely no concept of what it is like.
—What about New South Wales? Talk to Peter Black.
—For the benefit of the learned senator from New South Wales, I have just cited the fact that under this electoral system we would have had four country electorates each the same size as that one state. I am certain that some of the senators opposite have never even traversed the regions of their own state to see how vast they are. 
The Western Australian Attorney-General has not accepted this humiliating defeat. David has taken on Goliath and won. He plans now to present a further amendment and a further law to the parliament—that is, he wants to give the President of the Legislative Council a deliberative vote. This is in the face of a number of citations by his own Premier who, when such a proposal was made in 1997, as reported in the West Australian of 21 January 1997, declared that it was `a cynical attempt to subvert the will of WA voters'. It was not so cynical for them now to purport to achieve exactly the same purpose. Let us look at what that really means. Harry Phillips, politics professor at Edith Cowan University, said:
Changing the law to give the President a deliberative vote was an unacceptable break with convention.
Further to that, David Black of Curtin University said:
Any change to the president's voting rights would be subject to legal challenge and posed a political danger to the Government.
That is not enough for this Attorney-General. He wants to push on; he has no concept of the convention of this parliament and seeks to undermine it. He has previously lost 4-2 in the High Court; he has now lost 4-1 in the Supreme Court. It is clear that he is going to press on with this foolhardy zealotry when, of course, he should be saving the time and money of the taxpayers of Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Western Australia: Timber Industry</title>,Matters of Public Interest,7,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-10-23,"—Yesterday Senator Buckland asked me about the Agricultural Development Partnership Program. I can tell Senator Buckland that in the 2001-02 budget the Commonwealth announced the program, which is designed to provide assistance for structural adjustment targeted to agricultural industries and regions experiencing significant problems affecting farm profitability and sustainability. A feature of the program is that the state governments are expected to provide matching funding to facilitate a genuine partnership approach.
The state governments' responses have been, to put it politely, mixed. There have been a number of issues and points of difference, especially with regard to the shared funding responsibilities. In 2001-02, as the states had not come on board, $2.5 million was transferred from the program to fund other regional and industry priorities within the portfolio. A revised set of guidelines is now being prepared, Senator Buckland, and is being considered by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry prior to dispatch to state ministers for their concurrence.
The Commonwealth is very eager for the partnership program to become operational but it will depend on the future support and cooperation of the states. A number of preliminary proposals that may fit within the program either have been developed or are being developed in some states. I urge Senator Buckland to use his influence with the Labor states to get them to come on board with this program so that the money can start to flow.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Sherry today relating to superannuation and the Australian Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund.
The Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund was a subcomponent of a superannuation trust known as Commercial Nominees. Unfortunately within the structure and the various substructures of Commercial Nominees a level of alleged theft and fraud has taken place. My colleagues Senator Buckland and Senator Wong will be commenting on some specific matters in relation to the issues of Commercial Nominees and compensation in the event of moneys being lost as a result of theft and fraud. They will comment on the compensation payable in those circumstances and also on compensation for fees and charges that apply in those circumstances.
Superannuation is very important to Australians. It is compulsory and it is set at a level of a nine per cent contribution for all employees in this country. I think the last documentation I looked at showed that 8.8 million Australians are in superannuation, with approximately $530 billion in assets. It is compulsory and it is there to be preserved for retirement. So superannuation has a very special status in this country and plays a very important role in providing an additional retirement income over and above the relatively modest pension that Australia has for persons who have reached retirement age.
Superannuation deserves special consideration with regard to the protection that it is afforded. We cannot have the situation in Australia that has occurred in some other countries, and the UK comes to mind. I draw a distinction between theft and fraud in a superannuation fund and low returns. At the present time, unfortunately, we are in a low-return and generally negative-return environment with respect to superannuation. That follows a significant number of years of positive and generally very favourable returns. We have to draw a distinction between what to do when theft and fraud occur— when the money is literally stolen from a worker's retirement fund—and the issue of lower returns.
The Labor Party argues that it is totally unacceptable in a society such as ours that, where a person's retirement income is in part or whole stolen before the person reaches retirement, there should not be adequate compensation for the moneys that have been removed from the fund illegally and also in respect of the fees and charges that are part and parcel of the administration of the fund in those circumstances. It is totally untenable and totally wrong for Australians not to be fully compensated in those circumstances. If the theft or fraud occurs close to retirement it is obviously impossible for those people to make up the losses that have occurred as a result of that theft and fraud.
In a policy options paper I released approximately two months ago, I advocated much tougher protections for Australians' superannuation in the event of theft or fraud taking place. Unfortunately, some in the media seem to be perpetuating a myth that the Labor Party has not put out any policy since the last election. This is incorrect and I urge them to read my 60-page superannuation policy options document. I think it is a very comprehensive document, and this is one of the issues that we focus on. The Labor Party has put forward the fundamental principle that where theft and fraud occurs in a superannuation retirement fund—fortunately, it is very rare in this country—full compensation, 100 per cent compensation, for both moneys lost and the costs of the fees and charges should be provided to persons in those circumstances because of the unique status of their savings as compulsory superannuation savings vested in the private sector. We have also outlined a range of very tough options for stronger protections on the fees and charges that apply to superannuation.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2002-10-23,"—It is interesting how much the government appears to want to debate the issue of superannuation. I rise to support Senator Sherry's motion to take note of the answer provided by Minister Coonan in relation to the Commercial Nominees case and the failure by this government, as exemplified in her answer, to provide adequate compensation to employees who have been victims of the theft or fraud of their hard won superannuation savings which, as we all know, are supposed to be part of their retirement incomes. It really is indicative of this government's failure to recognise problems in allowing the market to operate unfettered in the area of superannuation, its failure to regulate properly and its failure to ensure that consumers, ordinary Australians, have the opportunity to obtain compensation when their savings are taken away through theft or fraud.
This concern that the government appears to have with regulating the market is also shown when one looks at their position on fees and charges, in particular exit fees. We know that massive exit fees already exist amongst retail superannuation funds. While some of them are reasonable, in the unregulated sectors there are some extremely unreasonable examples of exit fees. These operate as a substantial disincentive to people who wish to leave funds. It is interesting that we have a government that propounds the concept of choice in superannuation but refuses to deal with a policy factor—that is, the imposition of unreasonable exit fees—that is clearly limiting the choices available to Australian consumers.
We are aware of many cases of excessive exit fees charged against superannuation savings, and I will advise the Senate of a number of these. We have one example where, after 12 years, a fund member had built up savings of $65,500. He attempted to transfer his money to another fund and was told that around 18 per cent, being $11,500, would be deducted as an exit fee. This was not explained to him when joining the fund. Other examples are an exit fee of $4,000 imposed on savings of $33,000, an exit penalty of $1,796 on an account of $2,635— around 68 per cent of the total savings—and, most disturbingly, a punitive fee of $3,324 on savings of $3,300, which left the member owing the provider some $24.
Minister Coonan, consistent with her approach today, has previously argued that making the government rather than the market responsible for setting or regulating fees and charges is inappropriate. However, this position of the government bears little logical analysis. It is saying that this should be left to the free market when clearly the free market in this situation is causing significant problems for consumers in this area—it is a disincentive to fund choice. It is extraordinary that the government is refusing to engage in any regulation where there is clearly market failure in some instances on the issue of exit fees. I do note that Minister Coonan did concede at a press conference on 19 September when she was discussing portability that some funds might increase exit fees to stop people withdrawing their money under a choice regime and going to another fund. Despite this, we still see no action from this government to regulate exit fees, just as we see today in the answer given by Minister Coonan no action on compensating adequately Australians whose retirement savings are lost through theft or fraud.
The minister has stated that the government will reserve the right to regulate exit fees but has so far failed to act, despite clear evidence that there is market failure in relation to a number of funds and that this is a massive disincentive to choice of funds for many Australian consumers. It seems that the government is more interested in a superannuation sector which benefits the big end of town who want to get their snouts into the superannuation trough rather than protecting Australian consumers. That failure of the government is exemplified, as I said, in relation not only to exit fees but also to the inadequate compensation of Australians who are victims of superannuation theft or fraud.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2002-10-23,"—I find it somewhat amusing that Senator Sherry gets up to talk about policy on superannuation given the record of the Labor Party over the last six years in this respect. In fact, looking at the Labor Party web site, I notice they mention policy discussion papers but there is nothing on their web site that relates to Labor Party policy. I am happy to concede that the policy papers exist, but I find that it is a little bit difficult to believe the Labor Party's claim that they have specific policy with respect to superannuation when all the evidence suggests that they do not.
—We set it up.
—Oh, good on you. In fact, they have had no policy since 1996. They went to the 1998 election without any policy and they went to the 2001 election without any policy. Go to the web site and have a look at that. It is amusing that, all of a sudden, the Labor Party seem to have found superannuation as an issue and that they have extensive policy credentials with respect to superannuation. They might have had some policy in a previous government but in the last six years there has been no policy activity whatsoever.
—I am happy to go again if you have run out of things to say.
—I am sure you would be, Senator. The coalition has made superannuation a significant priority. Tax concessions provided to superannuation make it the single largest tax expenditure item amounting to approximately $9.5 billion in 2001-02. Measures contained in A Better Superannuation System will increase the attractiveness of superannuation by allowing couples to split their superannuation contributions, ensuring that single income families will have better access to two ETP tax-free thresholds and two reasonable benefit limits in the same way as dual income families. The superannuation termination payment surcharge rates will be reduced by a tenth of their current level in each of the next three years and this will lower the maximum surcharge rate to 10.5 per cent by 2004-05.
A co-contribution of up to $1,000 per annum will be introduced for personal superannuation contributions made by low-income earners in place of the current $100 rebate. The limit on full deductibility of superannuation contributions by self-employed persons will increase from $3,000 to $5,000 while retaining 75 per cent deductibility on any amounts above this threshold, subject to the age based deductibility limits. Also the tax on the excessive component of ETPs from superannuation funds will be reduced to lower the tax effective rate to no more than 48.5 per cent.
Other measures in the package will widen the accessibility of superannuation by extending the circumstances in which contributions to superannuation can be made. This will be achieved by allowing working individuals aged between 70 and 75 to make personal contributions to superannuation. This follows on from the government's earlier increase from 65 to 70 years for voluntary contributions and to 70 years for employer contributions. Recipients of the baby bonus will be allowed to contribute it to superannuation and superannuation contributions up to $3,000 per child will be allowed over a three-year period. Other elements of the package announced will require all employers to make at least quarterly superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees from 1 July 2003 and reaffirm the government's commitment to its policy of choice and portability of superannuation. This policy will give workers the freedom to decide who manages superannuation and the right to move superannuation benefits from one fund to another. The measures will allow temporary residents the option of accessing their superannuation benefits after they have permanently departed Australia, subject to tax withholding arrangements, and commit the government to examining whether market linked income streams also— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I also rise to speak on the take note motion moved by Senator Sherry. In the last 18 months in this chamber we have witnessed the fallout of the Commercial Nominees debacle with all of its ongoing difficult issues. Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in her answer today did not give us any assurance and this issue remains a source of grave concern. We have been given no assurance that it is going to get any better and we have grave concerns, as do many Australians, waiting for the government to resolve the issue. 
Commercial Nominees was a for-profit corporate trust. It acted as a trustee for a number of public offer superannuation funds and some 475 small funds. One of those public offer funds was the Australian Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund, AWERF. Commercial Nominees directed money from these funds into a number of unregulated investment trusts, where it was also a trustee, moving money from one pocket to another. Unbeknown to fund members, these trusts invested in business related to Commercial Nominees directors, including a mushroom farm. They moved money out of funds into their own pockets and into their own business enterprises. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has done nothing to redress this situation. Through these suspicious investments, Commercial Nominees lost millions of dollars worth of members' retirement savings. These members are ordinary workers who have entrusted their money to a company that was using it for its own gain and that fraudulently took their money.
In December 2000 APRA replaced Commercial Nominees as a trustee of AWERF and two other public offer funds. In February 2001 it replaced Commercial Nominees as trustee of the 475 small funds. On 14 June this year, after a delay of over 12 months and not without significant pressure from Labor, Senator Coonan agreed to provide assistance to some 181 of these small funds that had suffered losses as a result of serious fraud by Commercial Nominees. Labor had every right to be critical of Senator Coonan for providing less than full compensation as permitted by the act. At least members of these funds have received something, but the act provides for full compensation—far more than what has been received by these funds.
Senator Coonan's answer today shows that she has done nothing concrete to ensure that the 21,000 members of Commercial Nominees' AWERF—who have lost superannuation savings at the hands of what is arguably the worst and most dishonest trustee in history—receive at least some of their losses back. The Australian Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund had around 40,000 members. The fund was divided into a number of pools, some of which were invested in Commercial Nominees' own unregulated trusts. This translates to some of the members not having suffered losses through fraud, but around 21,000 of the members have.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-10-23,"—We are talking about what happens to superannuation fund members who have lost money as a result of mismanagement of the super funds by directors and so on. That is certainly an issue, and one case which specifically comes to mind concerns the activities of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. In that case the people who belonged to the superannuation fund were disadvantaged by the activities of directors. On 14 June the Assistant Treasurer announced that it had been decided to grant financial assistance to certain small superannuation funds formerly under the trusteeship of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. This assistance was to be granted under part 3 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to some 181 small superannuation funds that suffered loss in the Enhanced Cash Management Trust, or ECMT. In other words, these people were being looked after by the Howard government to ensure that their losses were redeemed.
Redemptions from the ECMT were frozen in November 2000 and applications for assistance for these funds were made by Oak Breeze, the replacement trustee, on 7 February 2002. The Assistant Treasurer was satisfied that the 181 small funds suffered eligible losses under the act; that is, that the losses were the result of fraudulent conduct or, in effect, theft, and the public interest required that a grant of assistance was made, and it was done. In this situation the safety net which is in place acted to support the 181 small funds which had suffered losses as a result of the bad management of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. 
Finally, with regard to the outstanding applications for financial assistance, the trustee of a superannuation fund can apply for financial assistance through a regulated fund under part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 where that fund has suffered an eligible loss. As it happens, some 466 applications have been received for losses under that category. Again, these losses have been redeemed under the system which I have already referred to. The losses which overall related to the ECMT—the Global Bank Account, the Enhanced Income Trust, the Equity Enhanced Fund and the Confidence Investment Trust—came to an estimated total of some $30 million. The ECMT losses accounted for 199 applications with estimated losses in the order of $23.3 million. Determinations were made in relation to 196 of these applications and payment was made to all 196 funds. So the people who had been disadvantaged by the collapse of these funds due to fraud and other kinds of activities, which fell within the requirements for the assistance to be given, had their losses redeemed. This shows that the safety net which is in place has worked to support people in this kind of situation. 
The federal government has supported the compulsory superannuation provisions which have been in place for some time now and, certainly with the ageing of Australia, it is necessary that we have an effective and strong superannuation industry and that people have the confidence to believe that their funds are secure. If, due to fraud or criminal mismanagement, the money is lost, then people in these superannuation funds need to know that their losses will be redeemed. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I move the following amendment to the motion that the Selection of Bills Committee report be adopted:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002, the bill be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2002”.
I do not wish to take up much time of the Senate—I know that we have a packed program—but it is worth while stating the reasons for referral. Earlier today we denied leave for this legislation to be exempt from the cut-off to allow this bill to go to the relevant committee for inquiry and report. The bill should not be passed in the Senate until such time as the committee has had the opportunity to consider the wider governance issues relating to the Australian Taxation Office and tax policy involving the ATO, Treasury, the Board of Taxation, the Tax Ombudsman, the Auditor-General and the proposed Inspector-General of Taxation. Labor wishes to save taxpayers' money and to ensure that the unnecessary duplication of Commonwealth administration in this tax area is dealt with. Those are the reasons for the referral, which will allow the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to have sufficient time to inquire into and report on the bill. 
It is also worth while adding that, procedurally, the Selection of Bills Committee sought to defer a recommendation that the matter go to the Economics Legislation Committee. However, five minutes or so after the committee had concluded we received a reference request. As we will not be sitting again for another two weeks, it was worth while ensuring that the Economics Legislation Committee had that reference so that it could inquire into that piece of legislation. That is the reason that we now propose to amend the report to allow the reference to the Economics Legislation Committee. It can now undertake that inquiry, get the appropriate processes under way and ensure that the bill receives proper scrutiny by the committee. The Selection of Bills Committee will not meet again until the next sitting week of the Senate—on the Tuesday at 4 p.m. Referral will allow the process to get under way now and it will allow proper scrutiny of the bill by the Senate committee in the terms that I have proposed.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I move the following amendment to the motion that the Selection of Bills Committee report be adopted:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Inspector-General of Taxation Bill 2002, the bill be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2002”.
I do not wish to take up much time of the Senate—I know that we have a packed program—but it is worth while stating the reasons for referral. Earlier today we denied leave for this legislation to be exempt from the cut-off to allow this bill to go to the relevant committee for inquiry and report. The bill should not be passed in the Senate until such time as the committee has had the opportunity to consider the wider governance issues relating to the Australian Taxation Office and tax policy involving the ATO, Treasury, the Board of Taxation, the Tax Ombudsman, the Auditor-General and the proposed Inspector-General of Taxation. Labor wishes to save taxpayers' money and to ensure that the unnecessary duplication of Commonwealth administration in this tax area is dealt with. Those are the reasons for the referral, which will allow the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to have sufficient time to inquire into and report on the bill. 
It is also worth while adding that, procedurally, the Selection of Bills Committee sought to defer a recommendation that the matter go to the Economics Legislation Committee. However, five minutes or so after the committee had concluded we received a reference request. As we will not be sitting again for another two weeks, it was worth while ensuring that the Economics Legislation Committee had that reference so that it could inquire into that piece of legislation. That is the reason that we now propose to amend the report to allow the reference to the Economics Legislation Committee. It can now undertake that inquiry, get the appropriate processes under way and ensure that the bill receives proper scrutiny by the committee. The Selection of Bills Committee will not meet again until the next sitting week of the Senate—on the Tuesday at 4 p.m. Referral will allow the process to get under way now and it will allow proper scrutiny of the bill by the Senate committee in the terms that I have proposed.

I seek leave to make a short statement.
Leave granted.
—The motion which we are seeking to amend has been the subject of long consultation at meetings today between leaders of parties, Independents and the whips and in discussions around the chamber. In effect, it seeks to facilitate a heavy legislative program. We effectively have three and a bit weeks left to complete the legislative program and, of course, amongst the bills on the list are the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. These are obviously bills which are well known in the community and in the parliament, in respect of which all senators will be exercising a conscience vote, and we know, through talking to whips and colleagues, that most senators will be involved, so there will be a long debate. The government is trying to ensure, through consultation with all senators and interested parties, that the debate enables all senators to contribute in an adequate and thorough manner. 
The hours may be subject to alteration and I may have to get leave to do that later, as we are waiting for one party to come back on a small outstanding issue. However, the motion involves sitting at 9.30 on a Monday morning, which is unusual. That will allow the commencement of a second reading debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 to commence on a Monday morning. That will allow senators who come in on Sunday night to commence the second reading debate. It certainly will not mean that other senators need to get here on the Monday morning. I will be seeking to ensure that, as far as possible, the second reading debates are done on a no divisions and no quorums basis. That will need a good amount of goodwill, which I think has been evident already in negotiations on how to handle these bills. The Senate will then sit until 11 p.m. on the Monday night. We will resume again at 12.30 on the Tuesday, which is an hour and a half earlier than normal, and again sit late on Tuesday night until 11 o'clock.
On Wednesday we will commence sitting at 9.30 and go, with normal breaks and so forth, until 11 o'clock at night. On the Thursday we will sit at the normal time and the debate on those bills will stop at 12.45 p.m., which is the normal time for what is known as non-controversial legislation. The bills I have referred to will not be considered again that week. That, Mr Deputy President, as you know personally, is to ensure that the greatest number of senators possible will be able to be here for votes on the committee stage of the Research Involving Embryos Bill. A number of senators are travelling on overseas delegations and ministerial delegations at that time, and we obviously want to facilitate as many people as possible.
The Senate will sit on the Friday to consider other government business, to make up for time we would have otherwise lost. It will sit from 9.30 a.m. to 3.45 p.m., which, as far as sitting on a Friday is normal, is a normal schedule for Friday. As for votes on any remaining stages, it may be possible that the bills are finished by lunchtime on Thursday. I certainly hope they are but if they are not the votes will be held over to 2 December. We have checked with the whips and we think there may only be one or two people from the entire Senate not here on that day, which is highly unusual. The government hope that perhaps with a late sitting on the Monday, if that legislation is still under consideration, we will be able to complete those bills on the Monday night. It may not be possible; it is very hard to tell at this stage. That lengthy explanation explains amended government business motion No. 1 in relation to those sitting hours.
Question, as amended, agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,20,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-10-23,"—I move:
That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Federal Government to act to include midwives in the medical insurance rescue package, as by next week all agencies supplying contract and casual midwives—around one quarter of all working midwives—will be unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance cover precipitating an immediate crisis in the safe birthing of babies in both public and private hospitals.
I move this urgency motion because of a dramatic worsening in the professional indemnity insurance situation as it applies to midwives. We are now approaching a near-disaster situation in birthing and maternity care within Australian hospitals and birth centres. It is a developing disaster of which the government has been well aware for some time. It is also not the first time I have raised this matter in the chamber. I raised it as recently as yesterday—last evening in relation to the Senate Economics References Committee report that had been tabled—and in the last fortnight's sitting as well as on a number of other occasions.
When the recent insurance crisis hit, the federal government was willing to assist doctors and specialists not only through the financial assistance that has been afforded to failed insurer United Medical Protection but also as a result of the recommendations of the first report on the law of negligence—the Ipp review. With UMP, the government has offered millions of dollars in support of an insurance company that operated with opportunistic business practices that essentially led to its inability to be `an ongoing concern'. Yet, in this particular case, the government rightly recognised that this was necessary to ensure that doctors were able to continue to practise. At the same time, around 200 independent midwives who were unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance were seeking a relatively small amount of money, which was not forthcoming from the government. Midwives were also not initially invited to participate in the Medical and Professional Indemnity Working Party that was established by the Commonwealth government. That particular situation affected not only independent midwives but also around 500 future midwives who are and will be discouraged from entering the field by being unable to undertake clinical placements as a part of their studies.
Today I come here with this urgency motion as this situation has since escalated. By the end of tomorrow, one of the largest agencies providing contract and casual midwives will have no professional indemnity cover. It will no longer be able to provide midwives to public and private hospitals. Other such agencies have already closed the books on midwives. By early next week, most agencies providing any other contract and casual midwives will have no professional indemnity cover. To put this into context, the crisis in professional indemnity insurance now means that approximately 3,000 contract and casual midwives—that is, 25 per cent of all working midwives in Australia—will not be able to work due to the lack of insurance cover. These 3,000 contract and casual midwives are an essential part of the operations of birthing in public and private hospitals, covering daily roster shortages.
In Australia there are currently around 12,000 midwives, who attend 98 per cent of the 250,000 births in Australian hospitals and birth centres. They are the ones that provide the constant care and commitment to women before, during and after childbirth while doctors, obstetricians and others attend the birth only when it is necessary. Based on recent figures, this dramatic removal of 3,000 midwives from the health system in the work force globally is exacerbated by the insurance crisis. I ask senators to contemplate the situation where you or your wife or your partner or daughter arrive at a hospital or birthing centre next Monday in an advanced stage of labour, only to be told, `Sorry, can you come back another day? We have no midwives available.' You do not need me to tell you that the birth of a baby is not an elective surgery issue. When independent midwives and midwifery students lost their insurance coverage, the government ignored their plight. That affected 200 midwives and around 500 students enrolled in universities across the country. It appears that in this situation the government is once again prepared to ignore midwives by not responding to the plight of the 3,000 midwives that are now subject to their own crisis. Yet had this week's legislation program continued as planned, as the government would have wanted, we would have been voting on the government's bill to prop up UMP to the tune of around $500 million. 
We have to ask the question: where is the government when it comes to assisting midwives, those who are most responsible for the safe birthing of our babies and who support our women and our babies into the future? Having recently had a birth in my own family, I know the value of midwives. We did not see much of our obstetrician, but we certainly saw the bill when it arrived in the mail. In order to ensure that senators are aware of the contribution of midwives, some crucial information needs to be provided. Firstly, the World Health Organisation says:
Midwives are the most appropriate and cost-effective care provider for normal pregnancies and normal birth, including risk assessment and the recognition of complications.
In addition, midwives provide continuous care to women from the early stages of pregnancy until around four to six weeks after the birth of the child—the kind of care that is not readily available from any doctor or obstetrician. Midwives also make good economic sense, cutting hospital and health care costs. The recently launched national maternity action plan stated:
Normal birth is more likely to be achieved when a woman has access to `continuity of carer' or `continuity of care' from a midwife who is responsible for her care throughout pregnancy, labour and birth, and the postnatal period ... The `continuity of carer' model of care has been proven to reduce the use of obstetric interventions in labour and birth, including the need for pharmacological pain relief, inductions, augmentations, instrumental deliveries, episiotomies and caesarean sections.
But all of this sounds very hollow when the agency representing these essential health care workers cannot find professional indemnity insurance, full stop. This is not a case of insurance premiums being too high; this is about blanket unavailability—the insurance is simply not available. One of the agencies involved described to me how they have `trawled the world' looking for an underwriter but have been unable to find anyone who will accept the risk. That agency's insurance cover expires tomorrow.
This morning, I heard the Prime Minister generously extending until the end of next year the insurance guarantee for doctors, and during question time Senator Coonan made her own announcement. This is a big deal, and we should provide certainty for doctors and those in high-risk specialties such as obstetrics. I want to commend the government for responding in the way that they have but, let us be quite clear, the Prime Minister's rescue package is assistance for doctors facing unaffordable premiums. I remind the government that the professional indemnity crisis facing independent midwives, contract and casual midwives and students of midwifery is not one of soaring or unaffordable premiums but one of getting any cover, full stop.
It seems to me that the government was quick to offer short-term insurance—and will continue to do so on a three-monthly basis— to the aviation industry while they were unable to obtain war or terrorism insurance. If the government can help there, then why can't they help in the case of midwives? This is a crisis of unavailability of cover, this is a crisis which has been building since July last year and this is a crisis of which this government has been too well aware. I now ask the government to take up the message in this urgency motion and put midwives in the insurance picture by extending to the 3,000 midwives who are likely to be out of work next week the rescue package announced by the PM this morning. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title>,Matters of Urgency,21,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-10-23,"—Today we are debating whether or not midwives should be included in medical indemnity. It is interesting, because Senator Ridgeway has been offered, as recently as today, a full and comprehensive response from Senators Patterson and Coonan. He chose not to go down that path but to move this urgency motion today. I really have to question the motive as to why one would move a motion of this kind if one was seeking definite answers and definitive responses when that was offered but this course of action was preferred. Its just begs the question of whether or not we are wanting an answer or whether or not we are just wanting to grandstand. I fear now, having listened to the debate and having heard what has been said previously, that the grandstanding option is the course of action that is now being taken. 
We need to understand that midwives actually fall into three employment groups: midwives who are employed by hospitals, agency midwives contracted to hospitals and independent, self-employed midwives. I do not think anybody would underestimate the role of many of the midwives. But one of the things that I think Australia has to come to grips with is whether the government now has to step in for every group of people and provide cover, insurance and backup. I think we are heading to a very dangerous course. I said to group of people who were in my office a few days ago that it is starting to worry me, with all of this insurance and with people now wanting government to take responsibility for their own actions, that government—and, thereby, the taxpayer, remembering that government does not have any money other than what the taxpayer gives it—is now becoming more of a hammock than a safety net. That worries me. I think the attitude of many people could certainly develop so that they could lie back and say: `It does not matter what happens; the taxpayer will pick up the tab. It doesn't matter, I don't have to cover myself; the taxpayer will pick up that tab as well.'
I think we should be looking at this under very different circumstances. Some of these midwives have got no coverage not because of any lack of government initiative but because insurance companies believe many of the midwives are a high risk. We also have to understand that the overwhelming majority of midwives are directly employed as employees of hospitals and are therefore covered under the professional indemnity arrangements of their employers.
I know that many good independent midwives are having difficulty obtaining professional indemnity insurance. But we need to understand that this is quite different from the situation doctors face, since doctors are able to obtain medical indemnity insurance cover. What I am trying to say is that it is because of the policies of the insurance companies that midwives have not got that cover, not because of some government policy that we are going to discriminate against all independent midwives and are not going to allow them to have indemnity cover. It is quite a different kettle of fish. The package announced today by the Prime Minister is designed, firstly, to address the financial viability of the providers of medical indemnity insurance and, secondly, to ensure that insurance cover for doctors remains affordable.
It is interesting that there is basically nothing the Commonwealth can do to force an insurer to cover certain people; it is the decision of an insurance company whether or not to cover those people. Dare I say that we have seen such decisions being taken by the insurance companies only in the last week and a half in relation to the tragic events in Bali. It was the insurance companies that made the decision to cover many of those who had policies that specifically excluded acts of terrorism. The government did not say to the insurance companies, `You must do X, Y and Z'; the decision was taken by the insurance companies. As I said, there is nothing the Commonwealth can do to force the insurance industry to provide insurance to this group of professionals, but it is interesting to note that the governments of my state of Western Australia and of the Australian Capital Territory have extended insurance coverage to independent midwives by effectively bringing them under the umbrella of government employment.
—So governments can do something.
—The state and territory governments can. The point Senator McLucas has just raised by way of interjection—that governments can do something— is a very good point because, based on what I was just saying, one could think that I meant all governments. What I am actually saying is that these people are working in the state and territory environment. They are working under state and territory auspices and they should be covered, if at all possible, under the umbrella of government employment in the states and territories. If Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory can do that, I do not see any reason why the other states and the Northern Territory cannot do it as well. I encourage them to consider noting that they are responsible for the registration of midwives and for issues relating to midwives' professional standards. Therein lies the important distinction which Senator McLucas quite rightly raised: it is the states that are responsible for licensing and registration of midwives and it is the states that set their professional standards. 
The Commonwealth has an important role in encouraging our state and territory counterparts to assist the midwifery work force in this way. The comprehensive package of measures announced today to address the financial viability of the providers of medical indemnity insurance and to ensure that insurance cover remains affordable for the doctors is important. But I say to honourable senators that we are heading down a dangerous path where everyone is wanting the taxpayers to pick up coverage as a matter of course instead of as a matter of last resort. There are many ways out of this other than trying to bring this very important group of professionals under the same umbrella as doctors when, in fact, the states and territories have the responsibility for registration and professional standards with regard to midwifery. I in no way wish to diminish the importance of the role of midwives and I in no way wish to diminish the importance of their indemnity. But I think it is important to understand that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures indicate that 1.6 per cent of the midwifery work force is self-employed, while the claim by recruitment agencies to represent 25 per cent of the midwifery work force may to all intents and purposes be an overestimate.
The package of measures announced by the Prime Minister today does not address the indemnity arrangements for midwives as these are professional indemnity arrangements not covered by medical defence organisations. MDOs are mutual societies of doctors and so are separate from general insurers. I wish to make that point very clear. It is a very separate subject, and people who try to bring them under the same net are just trying to complicate the issue in an emotive way. They are saying that the government has to pick this up, when it should in fact be looking at the source of the problem and how it can be resolved instead of trying to bring the midwives into an area where responsibility for them does not lie. There has been a recently escalating media campaign by and on behalf of midwives in response to media reporting on the expected medical indemnity package, and I think that this debate is now part of that. If he had really wanted to try to resolve this issue, it would have been much more sensible of Senator Ridgeway to accept the offer of a full and comprehensive update and briefing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Insurance: Medical Indemnity</title>,Matters of Urgency,21,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I also rise today to support the urgency motion moved by Senator Ridgeway. For the benefit of Hansard, I think it is important to read again the words of this motion. The matter of urgency is:
The need for the Federal Government to act to include midwives in the medical insurance rescue package, as by next week all agencies supplying contract and casual midwives—around one quarter of all working midwives—will be unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance cover precipitating an immediate crisis in the safe birthing of babies in both public and private hospitals.
The government must move to address the insurance crisis that midwives are facing and, in doing so, gain an understanding of the potential impact that the lack of action would have on women and families in this country. Having experienced childbirth myself, I know of the support that midwives can provide to a woman during that process. I was fortunate to be supported by a midwife during my delivery and also in prenatal and postnatal care. Midwives provide a service that obstetricians and gynaecologists just simply do not have the time to. They provide an enormous amount of support; they have the time. They are often women, although there are some men, and they have a greater empathy with an expectant mother. As an older potential parent—as I was before the birth of my child—with no family close to me, the relationship between me and my midwife was a very strong one. Especially as a person coming from a regional area, I relied on her very much for support. 
There is a real crisis facing our community when over 3,000 contract and casual midwives cannot get professional indemnity insurance—that is about one-quarter of all working midwives in Australia. Whether you have your baby in a hospital or at home, a midwife assists in almost every birth that occurs in this nation. Approximately 250,000 births occur in Australia every year and the vast majority of those births take place in a hospital assisted by a midwife. These contract and casual midwives are an important part of birthing in Australia, with midwives assisting in rostering and daily shortages. The involvement of midwives in the birthing process provides a positive health benefit for our community that we cannot overlook. The benefits are of course to the mother and the child, as I have explained from my personal experience. A good relationship between an expectant mother and a midwife statistically leads to reduced intervention in the birthing process. It has also been shown that bonding between the mother and the child is improved if that process is a more comfortable one.
We all know how much strain the health system is under because of the government's attacks on public hospitals and the public health care system in general. The failure of the government to address the crisis facing midwifery is just another symptom of government mismanagement of health care in this country. Expectant mothers and their partners and families should not have to worry about whether or not our health care system can meet their basic needs. With the Americanisation of health care in this country, however, increasingly the quality of care you receive is based more on the size of your wallet than the need that you have. Whilst that is true, the actual reality that we are facing is the absolute unavailability of midwives. That, of course, will increase pressure on the obstetricians in the country. Senator Knowles suggested that the federal government had no role at all in supporting midwives in their need to obtain professional indemnity insurance. She said that there was nothing that we could do, nothing that the government could do. There was something the government could do when we had the crisis in the aviation industry late last year; there was something that we could do when Ansett collapsed. I am afraid that the reality is that the government is simply sitting on its hands.
There has been significant discussion recently about declining fertility rates in Australia and the need for government policy on balancing work and family. We have heard a lot from the Prime Minister about the need for this to occur. We have heard a lot of words but, unfortunately, we have seen very little policy. Providing quality services to mothers and their partners during and following the birth of their child is central to the debate about declining fertility rates. As I have said, midwives play an essential role in ensuring mothers receive the appropriate care and support that they need at that time. I suggest that women are more likely to want to have more children if their first birthing experience, and their prenatal and postnatal care during that time, is reasonable. You are certainly not going to come back happily if you have had a fairly difficult birth; you would have to think twice. I suggest that the crisis in midwifery could have an effect on women making choices about whether or not to have a second or third child. The issue is also about choice. Women should have the option to choose whether to have their baby in a hospital or at home. Women are increasingly wanting to give birth in a place of their choice, and that is often their home. They find that option suitable to their needs. Unfortunately, if midwives are not going to be able to gain professional indemnity insurance then that may not be able to occur.
The other concern that I have is for women in rural and remote areas. In the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into nursing, we were given very strong evidence about the lack of availability of midwives. In fact, we noted in our report, The patient profession: time for action, that there are shortages of registered midwives across every state in Australia. We all know that this is exacerbated in regional and rural areas, with impacts on the women who live in those areas. But the other area of my concern is the impact that it has on Indigenous women who want to take the option not to travel. Many Indigenous women who live in remote areas do have to travel a long way from their community in order to have their baby. In North Queensland, women have to leave their community six weeks before the expected delivery date of their child and travel in most cases to Cairns but often to Thursday Island or Mount Isa. Six weeks of separation from one's family is difficult. 
There have been efforts by the state government in Queensland to encourage women who do not have a series of risks to deliver their children at home. This shortage of midwives will exacerbate that initiative enormously. If midwives cannot practise in rural and remote places, I would suggest that the opportunities for women to give birth in their communities will be almost zero. Indigenous women deserve choice; rural and regional women deserve choice. Women deserve to be able to choose where to have their child, whether it is in a hospital or at home. This crisis facing midwives will put enormous pressure on the ability of those women to actually make those choices.
The government has recognised today, in its statement about medical indemnity insurance, the important work that doctors and specialists, including obstetricians, do in providing health services to the community. It has extended its insurance protection to that sector. Unfortunately, the announcement today in no way goes to the issue of professional indemnity insurance for midwives. Maybe the Prime Minister just does not know or understand the crisis that faces midwives and women in our community, but he should have included them in his framework. Labor does recognise the crisis that midwives face. The press statement today from Stephen Smith, our shadow minister for health and ageing, says: 
The medical indemnity insurance package announced today also fails to address the professional indemnity needs of health care professionals such as midwives who are also facing a crisis situation that may result in further withdrawal of services.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-10-23,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have learnt that there is some arrangement that there will only be three speakers to the urgency motion. I was not made aware of that previously. With your consent and that of the chamber, I would like to make one comment. I would have liked to have said quite a deal about this question, as I believe it to be very important. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—You can speak to the motion.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will respect the arrangements that have been made to limit the debate. I will just state that I too believe that it is very important to provide medical insurance for midwives. In the medical insurance rescue package, I am sorry to see that most midwives are not covered. As has been stated by the mover of the motion and the last speaker, it is very important that this be reviewed and that something be done to ensure that those working midwives are protected. Unfortunately, as the motion says, they will be unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance and that will precipitate an immediate crisis in the safe birthing of babies in both public and private hospitals. I suppose I should declare an interest. When I was born—out bush—there was a midwife present. Obviously I am grateful—as my mother and father and family were—for the help of that midwife. I congratulate Senator Aden Ridgeway for bringing this vital matter forward. At another stage I certainly will be explaining to the Senate how I feel about this matter, including some of the old boy type networking that goes on, where some doctors look down on people such as midwives. To be fair, other doctors are very keen on seeing that midwives are covered. I support the motion and I hope it is carried.

That the provisions of standing order 111 not apply to the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2002 will amend the Criminal Code so that regulations made from the commencement of this Act specifying organisations for the purpose of the definition of terrorist organisation in Division 102 take effect in accordance with section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
The bill will also ensure that the existing regulation specifying Al Qa'ida/Islamic Army as a terrorist organisation takes effect on 21 October 2002, the date the regulation was notified in the Gazette. 
The Criminal Code currently provides that regulations specifying organisations as terrorist organisations do not come into effect until after the end of the Parliamentary disallowance period.
Division 102 of the Criminal Code contains a number of offences relating to terrorist organisations. These offences include directing activities of a terrorist organisation, membership of a terrorist organisation, recruiting for a terrorist organisation and providing training to, or receiving training from, a terrorist organisation. 
Terrorist organisations for the purposes of Division 102 are organisations that are engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act or organisations specified in regulations. Organisations may be specified in regulations if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is identified in a United Nations Security Council decision relating to terrorism and that the organisation is engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act.
Reasons for urgency
Urgent amendments to the Criminal Code are required to ensure that regulations specifying terrorist organisations take effect immediately on notification in the Gazette in accordance with section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
This will enable immediate action to be taken by law enforcement authorities against specified terrorist organisations, including any terrorist organisation believed to be responsible for the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-10-23,"—I realise that time is short this evening, so I may have to leave for an adjournment debate in the weeks before Christmas a number of comments that I would like to make about recent statements in regard to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2002, but let me provide the Senate with some of the background to this bill. The bill will add five new parcels of land to part 4 of schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. These additions are the result of two separate agreements that have been reached between the Northern Territory government and the relevant traditional owners and land councils.
The effect of the scheduling will firstly be to enable the grant of four parcels of land in the Northern Territory that were the subject of the Upper Daly repeat land claim. This land will be given to an Aboriginal trust established under the land rights act for the purpose of being able to manage the land. This land will be granted to the land trust to hold on behalf of the Aboriginal traditional owners. The land we are talking about is situated some 250 kilometres south-west of Darwin.
The scheduling will also enable the grant of a smaller portion of land, about 450 hectares in size, located some 40 kilometres north of Alice Springs. This will be for the benefit of the members of the Harry Creek East community. This scheduling has come about through the need to relocate land previously owned by the community—a relocation to which the community has agreed. This transfer of land is to accommodate the Darwin to Alice Springs railway corridor. The existing land has been rendered unfit for human occupation because it will be too close to that railway corridor. The new parcel of land is situated only a few kilometres south-east of the community's previous location. 
The passage of this bill and the scheduling of these new parcels of land will bring to 69 the number of parcels of land scheduled under the land rights act since 1977. I want to quickly make a number of comments about the land rights act. There have been many comments in recent weeks, if not months, about the need for this act to be reformed. It was started many years back by the Northern Territory CLP government when John Reeves was commissioned to do a review of the act. Since then there has been a response to that by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.
Following on from that, we saw an options paper produced by Minister Ruddock earlier this year. However, in his speech in relation to this bill, Minister Ruddock said that the land rights act is in need of urgent reform. He is probably right about that— there are recognised areas of that act that need to be improved. But he went on to say that only one new mine had been created on Aboriginal land in 25 years. It was a claim that he also made in an article in the Sunday Territorian on 8 September. Those claims are wrong, as are the claims by Mr David Tollner, the member for Solomon, that the current Chief Minister has refused to take control of 55 per cent of the land—not that it is land for her to take control of. So what we see is a government that on one hand wants to reform the land rights act but on the other hand is starting to promulgate untruths and misconceptions about the way in which this act operates. In fact, as my colleague in the House of Representatives said in his contribution to this bill:
It is not in fact the act that is at fault. It is the actions of the previous CLP government in holding up and sitting on exploration licensing applications that have been the problems.
It is actually the inaction of a previous conservative government that has created the problem—the perception that the act is not working—rather than the act itself.
As I said, there is a need for this act to be reformed but with two things in mind. We will always point to the recommendations in the House of Representatives report that said, firstly, that no changes to this act should occur unless there is the consent of the traditional owners and, secondly, that no changes to this act should occur that would be to the detriment of Aboriginal people and traditional owners in the Northern Territory. I realise time is short and I will conclude my comments there, perhaps taking up at some other time a speech that dispels the myth that certainly this current federal government would want to promulgate about the land rights act.
This bill is another example of where this land rights legislation is working. It is another example of where Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory get the title to their land and get to reclaim the land, to their benefit, in the legal way in which we perceive land ought to be held.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-10-23,"—The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2002 reflects the continuing commitment of the Howard government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. While supporting the return of traditional lands to Aboriginal owners, the government considers that the land rights act is in urgent need of repair because it has not assisted as it should have in improving the social and economic position of Aboriginal landowners. There is much more I wanted to say but time has beaten us. I thank senators for their support for this bill and urge its adoption.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-10-23,"—Earlier this year the Speaker and the then President of the Senate commissioned the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Andrew Podger, to inquire into certain aspects of the administration of the parliament. On 30 September 2002, the commissioner provided his report to me and the Speaker. Before the Speaker and I make decisions in relation to the recommendations made in the report, we felt it important to provide it to all senators and members for their consideration. Accordingly, I will table the report, together with a copy of the commissioner's covering letter and a draft research paper prepared at the commissioner's request tracing the history of previous attempts to make structural changes within the parliamentary administration.
The Speaker and I intend to consider the matter further at the end of November, and I would welcome any written comments from senators by 22 November 2002. The Speaker and I have also written to the heads of the parliamentary departments asking them to circulate the report to all their staff. We would welcome written comments on the report's recommendations from those who serve the parliament as well as from any other interested parties by the same date, 22 November. Electronic copies of the documents I have just tabled will be made available shortly on the parliament's Internet site and can be found by going to the publications link on the parliament home page.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-10-23,"—Having consulted with the government in relation to this matter, I propose to incorporate the opposition's contribution to this debate on the Insurance and Aviation Liability Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 in the form of a document which does, I must admit to Senator Ian Macdonald, criticise the minister from the previous parliament.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
The Opposition supports of the Insurance and Aviation Liability Legislation Amendment Bill 2002
The bill proposes minor amendments to three pieces of legislation. Two of the amendments arise from the events that shook the world on September 11 last year.
There are a number of key parts of this bill.
The first part is the amendment to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959.
This bill amends the act to correct an error that imposes a liability on foreign charter operations that is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations.
The amendment has been mooted for some time. It actually formed part of the lapsed Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001.
This was a bill that lapsed mainly as a result of the incompetence of the Minister when the parliament was prorogued.
The bill proposes changes to two other pieces of legislation. As I said the changes arise from the events of September 11.
The first is an amendment to the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999.
The act is amended to exclude passive owners, such as lessors, from absolute liability for damage on the ground.
The events of September 11 last year threw the aviation and airport insurance industries into chaos. 
Initially it was thought that Australia's fairly unique protection for industry against insurance companies withdrawing cover was a major benefit to the aviation industry; however, it soon became clear that the unique provisions hampered reinsurance processes.
This in turn impacted on the leasing and financing arrangements negotiated for aircraft operators in Australia.
Following September 11, the insurance and finance industries raised concerns about the liability of passive owners for damage on the ground, noting that the Australian practice of having owners and operators jointly and severally liable was not common international practice.
The amendment removes the liability of passive owners who do not have an active role in the operation of the aircraft immediately before the impact occurred and where another person or organisation has the exclusive right to use the aircraft, and finance or other arrangements are in place.
The amendment does not affect the strict and unlimited liability of aircraft operators.
The amendment to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 allows for the exemption by regulation of war and terrorism risk insurance from the cancellation and variation provisions of the act.
The protection offered by the current act against cancellation simply meant that the bulk of Australia's aviation industry was not able to obtain cover once the existing contracts came up for renewal.
This industry relies on the global insurance market for cover.
Exempting war and terrorism cover from the cancellation and variation provisions of the act will place this class of insurance in the same position as the rest of the international aviation world.
It will thereby enable Australian operators to have access to global markets for insurance.
Australia is now part of a global alliance of countries pursuing a global, coordinated solution to terrorism insurance for airlines, airports and associated organisations and operations.
In the meantime, the government is correctly offering war risk indemnities to those aviation industry participants who have not been able to obtain sufficient war risk cover.
This bill is a timely response to events beyond our control and beyond the control of the industry.",SENATE,<title>INSURANCE AND AVIATION LIABILITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
We are happy to support the two separate measures contained in today's bill.
The measure to codify arrangements relating to nominees in the social security system is, on the whole a welcome one.
So too is the measure that assists children with disabilities with terminal conditions and their families.
However, our support on this occasion should not be taken as ringing endorsement of the nominee arrangements in the social security system.
Nominees
The legislative formalisation of nominees of Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the bill are primarily administrative initiatives that provide specific guidelines for the role and obligations of nominees under the social security and family assistance laws. 
The amendments grant the Secretary the authority to appoint a nominee to be responsible for correspondence and the necessary action and, participation of a social security payment recipient (principal).
Under these amendments, the role of the nominee will vary from bearing the responsibility of receiving principal correspondence to receiving a social security benefit and other payments on a principal's behalf.
A correspondence nominee has a fairly straightforward role of being responsible for ensuring that the principal will receive any notifications, requests and information from relevant government agencies. The amendments are clear on this.
The amendments however, do not provide clear protection for a nominee in relation to their obligation in ensuring a principal's compliance with requests for government required information and appointments.
Proposed section 123J outlines the responsibilities of correspondence nominees in advising principals of social security requests for information and appointments.
The amendments strongly outline a correspondence nominee's duty to notify principals of such social security requests. There is a concern however that based on available information, it is difficult to ascertain the ramifications of a nominee's continued suitability should the principal not comply with a request.
On the surface the amendments imply that a nominee can be considered fully responsible for a principal's non-compliance to social security requests. However, the amendments appear inflexible in accounting for a principal's capacity to comply with requests and a nominee's ability to ensure compliance.
Based on the amendments being considered, the onus for failing to comply with social security requirements are primarily the responsibilities of the nominee.
The nominee may therefore have to rely heavily on a good working knowledge of the social security system and an awareness of the flexibility that can sometimes be accommodated for special individual cases.
The Government has advised that each appointed nominee under these amendments will be assessed by a social worker and advised of their rights and obligations. They will also be given the opportunity to discuss and negotiate any problems that arise out of the non-compliance of a principal.
The Government has also assured that comprehensive information material will be made available to existing and potential nominees.
As it is envisaged that with an ageing population the use of nominees will increase, there also needs to be the assumption that many nominees may be new to the social security system.
A person who is naive to agencies such as Centrelink, will no doubt find the internal hostility, lack of genuine support and understanding within such agencies, can make a simple exercise quite daunting.
While there is no obligation from the Government to implement designated case workers for new nominees, it is recommended that individuals be encouraged to quickly establish a sound working relationship with an individual staff member (perhaps a Social Worker), who can at least provide continued guidance for the Centrelink novice.
Under these amendments, nominees can also receive a Principal's social security benefit directly into a designated bank account, with the understanding that any financial obligation a principal may have, such as rent, bills and daily living would be undertaken by the nominee. Existing nominees have this current ability.
There is a concern however, that a principal may be vulnerable to exploitation from a nominee who does not have the principle's interest at heart.
Proposed section 123E of the amendments grant the Secretary the ability to review and revoke a nominee's status when it is found that the nominee is unable to fulfil their obligation.
Current information does not however, provide sufficient guidance on what circumstances can trigger a review and what matters are taken into account. There is an assumption that current review processes, such as investigation based on information from another interested party, would comply with the ongoing suitability of a nominee. This assumption however, is not clearly indicated in the amendments.
The Government has advised that a significant amount of anomalies with nominee payment arrangements are usually found through administrative processes; such as returned mail or failure to comply with Centrelink request.
There is also an arrangement that Centrelink will investigate an allegation of nominee misuse from an interested party.
Although, the interested party is usually another family member and are often considered hostile to the nominee. 
The government has assured us that the current process to investigate the suitability of a nominee is sufficient to sustain the new formal nominee arrangements.
We are going to revisit this issue over the next twelve months. As I said at the outset we do have some niggling concerns about the new arrangements.
However, we accept that this legislation represents a genuine attempt to codify the current administrative arrangements.
Children with disabilities who have terminal conditions
In December 1999 the Department of Family and Community Services completed a review of measure relating to carer payment in respect of parents of children with profound disabilities.
That review made a number of recommendations to address inadequacies in the original legislation.
Amongst those was the one before the Parliament today. I commend the government for bringing it forward.
The proposed amendment maintains Carer's Allowance for parents who maintain active treatment for a profoundly disabled child, even if the child is medically considered to have a terminal condition.
The addition of new subsection 197(2) also allows a less intrusive diagnostic and restrictive criteria process for a medical practitioner to advise of a change in the status of a profoundly disabled child.
Put simply this means that a person caring for a terminally ill child with a profound disability will not have their payment jeopardised.
I just want to record my disappointment that this amendment was not accompanied by a further one to address the situation of children with disabilities who have high support needs, who do not meet the qualifications to enable their parents to receive carer payment.
There are a group of children identified in the 1999 review in this category.
While the objective of the payment is to recognise the needs of those parents whose caring responsibilities to a disabled child prevent them from working, it is so narrowly drafted, the parents of many children whose disabilities are not as severe, but whose support needs are very high, miss out.
Families caring for children with chronic illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, epilepsy and phenylketonuria continue to miss out on the payment.
Assessment for the Carers Payment should take into account the financial, social and emotional cost borne by families caring for children with severe disabilities.
The problem is that the Child Disability Assessment Tool which is used to determine the functional ability of the child does not measure the care and attention demanded of the carer.
As a result, many more families are failing to qualify for financial support.
Since the new assessment tool was introduced in July 1998 the Labor Party has received a constant stream of letters and phone calls from concerned and distressed parents struggling to care for children with severe disabilities.
These parents caring for children with disabilities such as cystic fibrosis are struggling to keep their heads above water.
Without the Carers Payment they are forced to meet the costs of pumps, masks, sterilising equipment, special diets, exercise programs and equipment out of their own pockets.
These are substantial costs.
It is often the case that the extraordinary efforts and care provided by parents is the very reason that children are able to function day-to-day even when their life-span is limited.
Ironically, these efforts may also disqualify them from receiving financial support.
These families want an assessment tool that recognises the cost and time involved in providing care for their children.
I urge the Government to expand on what it is doing for terminally ill children today.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET INITIATIVES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002 makes amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Bill's amendments are essentially a clarification of the 2001 Act. Labor supported the 2001 Act and will also support this Bill.
The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 recognised the importance of superannuation funds as a source of family wealth in Australia. Compulsory membership of superannuation funds has meant that superannuation represents an increasingly significant proportion of the personal wealth of all Australians, and is now second in value only to the family home.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its report “Superannuation: Coverage and Financial Characteristics” last year, in which it identified that three quarters of the pre-retired population aged 15 to 69 years had some superannuation. Approximately 78% of males in this group had some superannuation, and 71% of females. Of these, however, the median total amount was $13,400 for men, more than double that of the median $6,400 for women.
These disparities reflect the substantially different employment experiences that face men and women. Men in work are far more likely to hold full-time positions, while almost half of all female jobholders are part-time workers.
Women are also much more likely to punctuate their working life with periods out of the workforce to care for children, the elderly and disabled. This not only tends to slow their career path, and progress toward better wages, it also means that little or no superannuation contributions are made during these periods.
In general, women have less superannuation than men, and those who do have superannuation have significantly smaller amounts than their male counterparts. These differences are evident in the statistics for retired Australians under 70 years of age who receive income from superannuation, with the relevant figure for men being 55% while the correlating percentage for women is only 28%.
Thus, the significance of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Super) (consequential provisions) Act 2001 was to ensure that superannuation, as a substantial part of Australians' wealth, could be divided as part of a property settlement in the event of divorce. This was a step toward enabling more equitable and just settlements at the end of a marriage. The statistics I have given you above paint a picture of the superannuation situation for many Australians, and why it is so crucial that these benefits can be divided. The
Labor party also supports the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002.
It is important that we have legislation in place that ensures that disadvantage does not become entrenched. Taking into account the vulnerable position of women from low asset marriages and allowing for superannuation payments to be divided is one way that we can do this.
However, it is also important that our legislation keeps pace with a rapidly changing Australian society. The Act does recognise the growing importance of superannuation as a family asset. It does not, however, recognise the need to rectify the current lack of legal provisions for same sex couples, who face the same difficulties, and should be afforded to same rights as, heterosexual couples.
The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services recommended that the Commonwealth discuss with the States how to achieve similar superannuation provisions for same sex couples that separate. The Government has refused to accept the States' referral of powers in this area.
The Opposition believes that the Government must act in this area. The law should not discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity or sexual preference. The Government's inaction on the issue of ensuring consistent superannuation and family law legislation for both heterosexual and homosexual Australians shows it to be unresponsive and unreasonable.
We should do all that we can to ensure that the Law itself does not discriminate. The Government, despite having been given the opportunity, has done nothing. 
This Bill basically makes three minor amendments to the Family Law Act to clarify aspects of the 2001 Act.
Firstly, under the 2001 Act, a splittable superannuation interest included a payment to a reversionary beneficiary, but this term was not defined. This Bill defines a “reversionary beneficiary” as any person who becomes entitled to a benefit in respect of a superannuation interest of a spouse, after the death of that spouse. This is a broader definition than the one used in the superannuation industry but it reflects the intention of the original bill that most death benefits constitute splittable payments.
Secondly, this Bill rectifies an inconsistency that arose from the 2001 Act, in that successive splits could be made if a person divorces more than once, but this principle did not apply where the same couple divorces, remarries and divorces again.
Thirdly, under the 2001 Act, the entitlement of a spouse under a split was subject to preservation requirements if it was paid to a regulated superannuation fund of Retirement Savings Account. This Bill clarifies that the preservation requirements also apply to interests paid to an approved deposit fund or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme.
This Bill also make one amendment to the Judges' Pensions Act to authorise the making of regulations to set out factors for use in calculating the proportion of a judge's pension had “accrued” at the time of a judge's marriage breakdown. This amount can then be used to determine superannuation interest under the Family Law Act.
This Bill makes amendments to the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act, essentially to ensure that payments from a family law superannuation interest split can be consistently assessed with other income and assets under the social security and veterans' entitlement means tests. The bill authorises the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services, in the case of the Social Security Act, and the Repatriation Commission, in the case of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to make guidelines for income testing of different kinds of income streams under the superannuation splitting regime. This is important as it provides consistency between the guidelines produced by the Department of Family and Community Services and those produced by the Repatriation Commission.
My South Australian colleague in the House of Representatives, the Member for Kingston and Assistant Shadow Treasurer, the Hon. David Cox MP, has outlined some technical concerns relating to the implementation of this Bill, which I will briefly relate to you.
In general, the Government has handled the implementation of this Bill very poorly. The complexities of family law and superannuation mean that together this new legislation is very complicated. Government bungling has made this even more difficult for those who must operate under the altered legislation.
A particular issue is the commencement provision in the original Bill allowed for an earlier commencement date by proclamation. It now seems certain that no such proclamation will be made and the legislation will commence the full 18 months after receiving royal assent. If this was always the government's intention, they should have made this clear from the beginning.
The inadequacies of the initial legislation have made the implementation of the Act particularly difficult for the superannuation industry, who had initially been promised a transition period of at least twelve months from the tabling of the new regulations. However, the government made an additional 102 pages of regulations on 25 July this year, largely to make up for drafting deficiencies in the Act. This is in addition to the amendments made by this bill. Most of the announced amendments to the regulations, made on 25 July, were of a minor and technical nature. However, the treatment of allocated pensions for the purposes of payment splits was substantially revised. Altering rules applying to an entire class of superannuation benefits so tardily points to a government that is inefficient, and out of touch with the real work that needs to be done in implementation.
It is crucial that both industry and the general public are informed of these changes, so that advisers and super funds are able to best inform their clients. It is also crucial that the public are aware of these changes and their intricacies so they are able to make informed and wise decisions.
Despite the importance of clarity in fostering an understanding of legislation, confusion reigns in the interpretation of some areas of this Act. One is the extent to which superannuation benefits transferred from one partner to another are subject to preservation. Apparently, it is the government's intention that preserved and non-preserved components of an interest be transferred on a pro rata basis. Despite the fact that Peter Costello has prematurely foreshadowed plans to increase the preservation age the Government needs to act now to clarify this aspect of the new law.
Another area of uncertainty is what is commonly called the `clean break' principle. This refers to whether members of defined benefit schemes will be able to transfer a proportion of their benefit, as required by a court order or financial agreement, to their former partner straightaway or whether they will need to wait until their benefits become payable. Amendments to the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations provide for the immediate transfer of accumulation interests to another account in the same fund or a different fund, depending on the rules of the fund or the receiving partner's preference. 
The Attorney-General's Department has indicated that there are constitutional difficulties in applying this `clean break' principle to certain funds, and in particular, state public sector funds. This needs clarification. I believe the government must ensure that we have a national approach to superannuation regulation, and they should act expediently in this area for consistency and conformity.
The continuing uncertainty surrounding these regulations has only contributed to the low levels of awareness in the community and, indeed, the superannuation industry and family law practitioners.
The government's lack of attention to detail in ensuring that the general public is able to understand and operate within the new legislation shows a government out of touch with the people. Everyday Australians should be uppermost in the mind of the government when drafting and implementing any new legislation regime. Unfortunately, this government seems to have forgotten the very people who elected them.
An area of ongoing concern to the Opposition is the resources provided to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The original bill conferred new powers on the tribunal to deal with complaints against superannuation providers from prospective members of superannuation funds-that is, spouses or former spouses who are party to, engaged in or considering a property settlement involving superannuation. It seems likely that a number of disputes will arise in relation to the splitting of superannuation interests and payments and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will need more funding to cope with these.
The exceptionally complex provisions and the government's lack of action to clarify them means that the number of disputes is also likely to be higher than expected. The tribunal's workload will most certainly increase after December 28th. Labor's concerns have been noted by the Senate inquiry, but as yet we have seen no indication from the government that it intends to act on this matter.
Senator Coonan should commit to providing more resources to the tribunal and begin to take appointments more seriously than her predecessor Mr Hockey, former Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, did when he appointed former Liberal Senator Michael Baume to this supposedly independent tribunal.
Labor supports this bill as part of the necessary reforms to superannuation and family law. The number of outstanding issues that remain unaddressed by the government is testament to their lack of regard for all Australians who must contend with this new legislative regime. The government has an obligation to clarify the remaining ambiguities and attend to the task of creating consistent superannuation legislation that does not discriminate.

A few days later, I was very pleased to hear that Senator Marshall responded to my comments. I am particularly pleased to see Senator Marshall here today. I welcome Senator Marshall's contribution, especially because it came with some very impressively crafted statistics. But I was rather bewildered when I realised that Senator Marshall's theme was an attack on the Kennett government, since the Kennett government is clearly a matter of history and its achievements a matter of record. Surely Senator Marshall, as a Victorian senator, should be more interested in the current perilous situation of his home state. 
Let me quickly deal with Senator Marshall's criticisms of the record of the Kennett government. It is a very curious collection of choices, since in each category that Senator Marshall has chosen the Bracks government's record has been far worse. Senator Marshall started with major projects and drew the interesting conclusion that the Kennett government had failed because statistics show that all the major projects undertaken by the Kennett government were in the metropolitan area and that the majority of building investment in 1998 was in metropolitan Melbourne as well, thus demonstrating a neglect of regional Victoria.
The simple fact that seems to have escaped Senator Marshall's notice is that the Bracks government has initiated no major project at all. If Senator Marshall cares to check Victorian building statistics for, say, 2001, he will find the pattern of building investment has not changed since 1998. So his statistics are meaningless. Kenneth Davidson—no friend of Kennett or the Liberal Party—writing recently in the Age about the difference between Jeff Kennett and Steve Bracks, said:
What's different is style. Jeff Kennett was in your face ... Steve Bracks tries to sugar-coat the same pill with phoney consultative processes and documents in warm, earthy colours ... with lots of pictures of happy people enjoying cafe latte society ...
Let us have a look at some of the specifics. I will start with gaming. Ewin Hannan, writing also in the Age, on 28 September 2002 said:
After relentlessly attacking Jeff Kennett for promoting a casino culture, Labor came to office promising to reduce the state's reliance on gaming revenue ... In fact, they—
that is, the pokie losses—
ballooned by $460 million over two years.
Jeff Kennett had to rely on gaming revenue because he had no choice. After 10 years of Labor mismanagement, Victoria was broke in 1992—flat broke. In 1992, the Kirner government was borrowing money on the short-term market to pay public servants. In 1992, Jeff Kennett was given the task of rescuing Victoria from financial ruin, and he succeeded. Let me quote this assessment of his performance by Dr David Hayward, the executive director of the Institute for Social Research at the Swinburne University of Technology—another certified `non-friend' of Jeff Kennett. In an unashamed apologia for the Bracks government in the Age on 26 September 2002, Dr Hayward said that Kennett did so well that:
The budget turned from deep red to thick black 10 years ahead of schedule.
Not so the Bracks government. Not only did it inherit a full treasury, it inherited a blooming economy so well set up that even the kind of incompetence exemplified by the saga of the Federation Square—the uniquely post-Federation Square—cannot stop it from performing well. 
Senators may be interested to note that the Victorian state budget brought down in May 2002 estimated a surplus of some $765 million, which has since been reduced to $250 million after losses incurred in currency trading by the Victorian government. The same budget revealed revenue from stamp duties to be almost 50 per cent higher than forecast, providing a $773 million windfall. It also showed that land tax revenue would be $611 million, up 66 per cent since 1999, and that police fines would be a staggering $337 million, up from $99 million in 1999. So there is no reason for the Bracks government to rely on gaming revenue. Surely there is no reason why the Bracks government could not keep its promise to reduce the state's gambling culture. Yet there has been no action—none.
Senator Marshall then picked education as an area of Kennett failure because 350 schools were closed and teachers were `removed from schools'. These were Senator's Marshall's words; I am sure that is because the number who actually left the education sector was far less impressive. But what about the quality of education that Victorian children receive? Surely the quality of education provided by the schools and the teachers is far more important than the quantity of schools and the number of teachers who turn up for work between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.?
Let me cite an example. Once upon a time, there was a school in Melbourne called the Richmond Secondary College. It had no building more recent than 1950, it had no facilities more modern than the 1980s and, on a good day, it had about 100 students attending. It was one of the schools that was closed, and its closure provoked considerable public protest and disorder, lockout and arrests. On this site, the Kennett government established a new school in 1994—the Melbourne Girls College. Recently, I had the great privilege of visiting the Melbourne Girls College to attend the opening of the $3.3 million stage 3 of the school's capital works project, to which the school community contributed close to $1 million. The Melbourne Girls College has an enrolment of approximately 1,180 students, and it prides itself as a model girls school for the 21st century, aiming for exemplary standards of achievement and conduct. The curriculum places a special emphasis on science and technology and aims to be the leading edge of technological innovation in teaching and learning, providing innovative and challenging learning experiences. It stands as an illuminating example of the education vision of the Kennett government. Senator Marshall should visit it to experience it himself before he again criticises the Kennett achievement in education.
In the time left to me, let me quickly touch on two other areas of government services that Senator Marshall has nominated as Kennett failures and, by implication, Bracks successes: public hospitals and WorkCover. Since Senator Marshall shows such a preference for statistics, let me provide him with some more. According to the Victorian hospital services report for the June 2002 quarter, in the 15 major Victorian hospitals the number of people waiting on trolleys for more than 12 hours in emergency departments has gone from 2,245 in 1999 to 6,887 in 2002—that is a 207 per cent increase. The number of people on waiting lists for elective surgery has increased by 4,425 people in three years. The number of people on waiting lists for `longer than ideal'—I do not know what that means exactly; I have quoted that from the report—has increased from 3,623 to 6,252. That is an increase of 73 per cent in three years. The number of ambulance bypasses has gone from 130 in 1999 to 416 in 2002. These statistics speak for themselves. Senator Marshall should study them carefully before he sings the Bracks government's praises again.
On WorkCover, in 1992, Victoria had unfunded liabilities amounting to $2.1 billion. By 1999, this had been reduced to $295.6 million, representing a deficit of just 6.8 per cent, and the premiums were 1.9 per cent of wages. At the end of 2001, the unfunded liabilities had again blown out to $533 million or a deficit of 10 per cent, notwithstanding an increase in the rate of the premium to 2.22 per cent. In 1998-99 there were 31,242 reported claims and in 2000-01 there were 32,539 reported claims—a small increase. The number of staff increased from 709 to 828 during this period. But, Senator Marshall, the return to work rate has decreased by eight per cent. 
Let me conclude by once again quoting Kenneth Davidson's comment on the Bracks government:

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-10-23," asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 27 June 2002:
(1)	What is the amount of revenue generated from the sale of Commonwealth heritage properties over the past 3 years.
(2)	What is the Government's current position with respect to the disposal of heritage property.
(3)	Is it a fact that decisions about the disposal of heritage properties are made on an agency by agency basis; if so, how does the Government ensure that heritage values are not compromised under these arrangements.
(4)	Does the Government have any plans to establish a whole of government policy which balances considerations of financial return to the Government with environmental or heritage values to the community.
(5)	Does the department have any system for identifying heritage-listed properties when it is planning to dispose of property.
(6)	Did the department notify the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) in relation to the proposed sale of two properties listed on the Register of the National Estate at Myilly Point in Darwin; if so, on what date did this notification occur.
(7)	Did the department seek advice about the proposed sale; if so, what advice was given.
(8)	In the case of a tendering or expression of interest process, does the department involve the AHC in selecting the successful bid when disposing of a property listed on the Register of the National Estate; if not: (a) how does the department use the advice of the AHC in relation to disposal of these properties; and (b) is there any system for weighing heritage considerations against the financial gain to be made.
(9)	Why is the disposal of the Myilly Point properties being done by an `expressions of interest' process while the heritage-listed property in Hartley Street Alice Springs was granted in freehold title to the National Trust in 1998.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Commonwealth Heritage Properties</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,41,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-10-23,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Over the past three years (1999/2000 to 2001/02) the Department of Finance and Administration has sold properties with heritage values recognised by listing in a heritage Register by either the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC) or a State/Territory heritage authority, for sale revenue totalling some $37 million ($30 million of this total was from the sale of one property - the Cameron Offices at Belconnen ACT).
(2)	The Government's position is that the Commonwealth should own property only where there is an efficient economic reason for doing so, or where it is otherwise in the public interest. This reflects the Government's view that the Commonwealth should not be a property investor, and should focus its scarce resources on core functions. At the same time, the Government acknowledges the importance of heritage issues generally, and is particularly sensitive to the heritage values inherent in some of its own Commonwealth properties. The ongoing protection of heritage values is an important public interest consideration in divestment decisions.  
(3)	There are several portfolios of Commonwealth owned properties managed by different agencies, including the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Finance and Administration, as well as individual buildings, such as the National Library and Gallery, which are controlled by the user agency. Divestment decisions are made by the agency responsible for the property portfolio, its Minister and/or the Government depending on the significance of the divestment. The environmental and heritage values of Commonwealth properties are protected by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which bind Commonwealth agencies and Ministers in their decision making.
(4)	The current legislative framework will be further enhanced by the environment and heritage legislation amendment bills currently in passage through the Parliament. The primary responsibility for this legislation rests with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Hon Dr David Kemp MP. 
(5)	Yes.
(6)	Yes. The formal notification occurred on 6 December 1999.
(7)	On 30 December 1999 the AHC wrote to the Department of Finance and Administration indicating that it appreciated the Department's commitment to the heritage values of the Myilly Point houses, ensuring their long term protection through preparation of a conservation management plan, investigating appropriate contractual mechanisms and consultation with the Northern Territory Government to ensure its commitment to the protection of the properties.  
(8)	No. (a) AHC advice is obtained, accepted and implemented to ensure the ongoing protection of heritage values via mechanisms that include conditions of sale, conservation management plans, restrictive covenants and State and Territory heritage legislation. (b) Yes.
(9)	Transfer of the heritage house at 86 Hartley Street, Alice Springs to the National Trust was negotiated in 1997. Since that time, the Government has implemented major reforms to the ownership and management of Commonwealth property because it is committed to strong financial management, full accountability and value for money for the Australian taxpayer. The Government is also committed to ensuring the preservation of the Myilly Point heritage houses, and the `expressions of interest' process will assist development of a strategy for their long-term ownership and management.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Commonwealth Heritage Properties</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,41,1,answer
