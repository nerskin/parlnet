The CHAIRMAN:
  The committee is considering the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011, as amended, and amendments (4) and (1) to (3) on sheet 7129 revised moved by Senator Xenophon, also on behalf of Senator Birmingham. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:01):  I would like to hear from the government in relation to this but my understanding is that there have been extensive discussions between the government and the key stakeholders. There was a concern that early adopters for landfill management would be penalised. I am very grateful for the work of Senator Milne in bringing the parties together to reach a sensible compromise so that there will be certainty for early adopters. I have not had an opportunity to speak to my colleague Senator Birmingham, with whom I moved this amend­ment. If the government could indicate, firstly, that progress has been made and, secondly, that it is satisfactory to the two key stakeholders, LMS and EDL, that could be quite satisfactory. In the meantime, I am obligated to discuss this with my colleague Senator Birmingham.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:03):  We are picking up from the debate on Friday in relation to this amendment for the landfill gas sector. I have done one better than to speak with Senator Xenophon. I have had the fortune this morning of speaking with Evelyn Ek from his office, who from time to time provides great guidance to many of us in this place on serious issues. Let us remind ourselves that this is an amendment which Senator Xenophon and the coalition have pursued to ensure the landfill gas sector is protected from any perverse or adverse outcomes under this legislation. It is a big issue. We are talking about more than 4,500 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent gases that were recovered or destroyed in 2009 from waste in landfills. Many of those projects could be at risk or at threat of discontinuance should we get this legislation wrong or should the government get the implementation of this legislation wrong. We want to make sure that that outcome is avoided. 


I join with Senator Xenophon in thanking Senator Milne for her initial support of the issues raised and ensuring that industry was able to engage in some discussions with the government. It is equally my understanding, having spoken to some of the industry players as well as Ms Ek, that the industry has had further discussions with government, that there is an agreed pathway forward for how the methodology and the time line will be developed and the base lines that will be considered as part of that process. 


We want as many guarantees and as much information on the record as the minister is able to provide as to what the guarantees provided to industry are. I posed some questions to the minister on Thursday about how he thought he could achieve the timing that Senator Milne had alluded to and that he had alluded to in the debate on Thursday. If he could for the benefit of the chamber and the record provide us with the detail of the time line for discussions with industry and finalisation of the methodology, the approach that is going to be applied to the base line in this regard and the government's understanding of what this will mean for the existing projects, that would certainly assist us in hopefully proceeding with this debate, dealing with this amendment and, most importantly, providing certainty for early adopters and early movers who have invested significantly and done so much to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas that comes off landfill gas facilities.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:07):  People have been very busy working on this issue over the ensuing period since we last met on Thursday. I think that all within the chamber see this as an important matter that does need to be resolved.


From the government's perspective, we have released a revised draft methodology to the landfill technical working group that includes standardised baselines for GGAS and greenhouse-friendly landfill projects. Landfill companies have indicated that they support the proposed approach. That is what I indicated on Thursday—that is, going back and working through the draft methodologies and then going to the independent assessor, which, to all intents and purposes, we now refer to as DOIC, for those who are interested in acronyms. The government will continue to work with the industry to implement the methodology following its assessment by the DOIC.


Let us be clear that what we now have is a draft methodology for the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas, and the companies have indicated they support the proposed approach, which is to take the draft methodology, move it into assessment by the DOIC and, then, following that assessment, the independent assessor will make the decision in relation to it to establish those issues, including the baseline. So it effectively means that the integrity of the system is maintained and the legislation continues to provide a framework that has integrity that continues to deliver for all areas, including this one, which we have now proposed a way forward with.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I thank the minister for the information and his response. Certainly, the landfill gas sector have said to me, and I am sure they have said it to Senator Xenophon as well, that they are eager to ensure that the integrity and equity of the system is maintained, as well. But they also want to make sure that there is as much certainty for them as possible.


I pose two areas of questioning, first in relation to the draft methodology that is being finalised and will be presented to the DOIC. Is there an understanding of how that will approach the baseline figures and, if so, how is it going to approach those? Are you able to inform the chamber of that? If you are not able to inform the chamber perhaps you could tell us why you are unable to do so. Secondly—this is a matter I raised on Thursday—in regard to timing I understand that there is an expectation that the finalisation of the independent assessment should all be done within the space of about a month. I think you, Minister, alluded to that on Thursday. Is that your understanding? Perhaps to educate me, if not anybody else, could you inform the Senate how it is possible that that timeline is going to be met in such a short period of time. Is the DOIC already operational, notwithstanding the fact that it appears to have its rules and mandate laid out within this legislation? Is there a process already underway to ensure that those timelines to provide certainty can in fact be met?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:12):  Dealing with the timeline, we do expect it to be dealt with in the one month. Why? Because the govern­ment has established an interim process—that is, the DOIC—that is in place. One of the issues you raised last Thursday was that you imagined—hypothetically—that it would take a lot longer. What I did not have an opportunity to tell you at the time was that there is in fact a DOIC in place. So, all of the work that you, hypothetically, envisaged had to be done is done. There is an interim DOIC in place and the draft methodology has been prepared and is ready for the interim DOIC to assess in a very short space of time. So all of that work is in train and can be done in a matter of a very short space of time—less than a month, I am advised, and probably sooner, depending of course on people's work commitments. But it is expected within that period and that is why we were confident in making that original assessment.


The draft methodology includes a standardised baseline of 30 per cent of projects transitioning from GGAS and zero for projects transitioning from greenhouse-friendly. In addition to that the draft methodology contains the baselines for both GGAS and for greenhouse-friendly projects as well. This means it is now likely to go to the interim DOIC within the month. Therefore, depending on how long the interim DOIC takes, we do not expect it to take particularly long. We are confident that the landfill sector can have confidence in the process.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:14):  I appreciate the minister's explanation and response to those two questions. I have one just one subse­quent question that flows from the minister outlining the establishment of the interim DOIC and the manner in which the interim DOIC will work. When this legisla­tion is enacted and the permanent DOIC is established, as against the interim DOIC, will that permanent body equally have to review all of the determinations of metho­dologies that the interim body has ticked off? If so, what guarantees are there for industries which think they have certainty once it has been ticked off by an interim body that the permanent body may not undo that? Is it expected that the memberships of the two will be consistent, or what guarantees are there? Obviously the minister is turning to a page of the bill which may well address that very question. Could the minister make sure for the benefit of completeness on the record and certainty for this industry sector, given the government's commitments, that this is dealt with as quickly as possibly—certainly in less than a month, which is important to the industry—so that the industry does not see serious negative financial consequences? What certainty or guarantee is there for them as this issue progresses beyond the interim stage and into the permanent stage?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:16):  Yes, you have correctly identified the bill in my hand. At 131, 'Transitional—pre-commencement application for endorsement of proposal' the bill contemplated that there would be an interim DOIC in place and how we would then deal with transitional arrangements. Effectively that section means that a person applies to the interim offsets integrity committee for the endorsement of a proposal or a methodology determination and the committee either endorses the proposal or refuses to endorse the proposal—avoid doubt. Then 132 deals with pre-commence­ment endorsement of proposal and indicates how each is to be effectively dealt with. Then, as you are aware, the methodologies are disallowable instruments. So once they are set in train, the short answer is that they are flipped over into the new DOIC as methodologies that will be picked up—that is the easiest way to explain it. That allows all of that work to commence prior to the establishment of the permanent DOIC and to be utilised and continue in operation.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:17):  Minister, thank you for humouring me and ensuring that all of that detail is clearly on the record. I want to indicate that, following discussions with Senator Xenophon, it is our intention to withdraw this amendment. Having spoken to the industry sectors involved and having got the information on the record from the minister this morning, we are of the belief that the government is intending to do the right thing by this industry. I want to make it clear once again that the last thing we want to see is a perverse outcome where projects that were early movers in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions are somehow penalised, where projects that were early movers are facing a situation of financial disadvantage or where projects that were early movers in fact close down and we have the perverse situation that a bill designed to encourage further abatement and new abatement activities has the consequence of causing early abatement activities to cease to operate. 


The industry is taking the government at their word that this process will avoid that outcome and will provide appropriate certainty for the sector. I hope that is the case. We are placing that trust in the government rather than the chamber seeking to exercise its will. We are placing that trust in the process of this legislation. We hope that that trust is not ultimately proven to be misplaced. Once again, we emphasise that this was an issue highlighted by the Senate inquiry. It is a shame that it has taken until this last moment of the legislative debate to solidify a pathway forward on it to ensure that there is some level of certainty for the sector. Hopefully, this is the end of the uncertainty and that they are able to proceed within the month knowing exactly where they stand. Hopefully, that will ensure that the projects, especially the many regional projects in the landfill gas sector, are able to continue and to be supported by this scheme, just as they were previously under a greenhouse-friendly arrangement or the New South Wales government's GGAS scheme. 


I again place on the record my thanks to Senator Xenophon for his work with the coalition on this matter, to industry for making sure that we all had this matter brought to our attention and to the Greens and the government for trying to come up with an appropriate resolution. We hope that this resolution sticks and works for the benefit of industry. We will certainly be watching very closely from here.


I seek leave to withdraw the amendments.


Leave granted.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:22):   by leave—I move amendments (3) and (4), standing in my name on sheet 7118, together:


(3)   Clause 56, page 81 (line 19), after ""Act"", insert ""and subject to subsection (1A)"".


(4)   Clause 56, page 81 (after line 21), after subclause (1), insert:


(1A)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), if a project:


   (a)   was established as, or as part of, a managed investment scheme; or


   (b)   is determined by the Minister, on the advice of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to have an adverse impact on:


      (i)   the availability of water; or


      (ii)   land and resource access for agricultural production;


the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project.


(1B)   A determination under paragraph (1A)(b) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.


(1C)   In this section:



managed investment scheme has the same meaning as in section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001.


I remind my colleagues that the position with this is that the government was to provide details of the risk management principles and guidelines. I am grateful to the government for providing those. This is AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management—Principles and guidelines. My question to the government is that, on the face of looking at these risk management guidelines, I do not understand how it will work in the context of this amendment, which relates to the negative list, and setting out criteria for a project that will have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on agricultural production. How does the government envisage that these guidelines, which, with annexures, run into some 23 pages, will work? For instance, on page 17, item 5.4.2, which is headed 'Risk identification', states:


The organization should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events (including changes in circumstances) and their causes and their potential consequences.


I have a genuine question. What on earth does that mean in the context of how the government proposes these risk management guidelines will operate?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  I think we are in fact all in screaming agreement. What you are proposing concerns doing it project by project, which would create unnecessary work and would, I think, also slow the process down and create a logjam. We are proposing types of projects. The reason we use that is so that you can characterise them all within a group and in doing so allow those types to be proceeded with in the process of maintaining the integrity of the process—that is, the ability for methodolo­gies to come forward and be independently assessed and then put in place.


The real difference between us here is between projects and types of projects. The reason we use the ISO code is that it allows DOIC to have a way for everyone to understand that the way they do their assessment is in accordance with accepted practice—that is, ISO guidelines. This means that there is integrity in the system and that integrity is underpinned by the independence of the DOIC, as well. All of this means that projects that come forward will be assessed with methodologies under the type they fit within. So there is a broad ability for people interested in particular types of projects to know that they have got certainty. Using as an example the one we have just been talking about—the draft methodology for the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas—the draft methodology is broader than an individual project. It is the type that fits within it, the type being the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas. That is the breadth of it. It then provides the draft methodologies we would use and the issues that we have been talking about, including how it would apply. But it is not an individual project. It is not one company saying, 'Here is one landfill. This is the project we want.' This means that all of those firms that deal with the combustion of methane in landfill gas have certainty that once that methodology is independently assessed and approved by DOIC any similar project coming forward will fit within that framework. Therefore they have certainty. They also then have the ability to utilise the scheme and they do not have to come up, as individual projects, and go through the whole issue again, which would cause both unnecessary cost and delays.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:28):  Perhaps we could look at it in another way, and I appreciate the spirit in which the minister answered the question. I think the issue is this—and this is a question I posed on 16 August in this place—how will it be assessed whether a project reduces the production of a particular type of food or grain in a particular area? How does the government take these matters into account? The government is saying that they agree that these are important matters, but that this is not the way to do it. The government is saying, 'Don't assess this on an individual basis.' But I ask for an assurance about how the methodology would work in individual cases. In other words, it seems to me that the risk management process would be irrelevant. I am still not sure how it would apply and that is why I will still maintain this amendment.


I am not sure what the coalition's point of view is in respect of this amendment. But I would have thought that if there is a clear statement of principle in the legislation that if there were to be an adverse impact on the use of water and on fruit production that would place it clearly in the negative list. I do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily. If the government could explain what assurances they can give in the context of these risk management guidelines about how the methodologies would be individually assessed and what level of transparency and scrutiny there will be, then I guess we can get on and vote on this particular amendment. I am concerned that we are not giving the priority that is required to water security and food production.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:30):  Perhaps you will forgive me for using an example. One type of weed in one paddock might be a threat to food production. One project is to eliminate that weed in that paddock. It may or may not be a threat to food production. It may be specifi­cally a threat to that farm's food production, but when you look broadly at all the arable land, if that weed is only in that one paddock, it is not a threat because it is one weed in one paddock. If you aggregate that you can say: 'This weed in many paddocks across all the arable land might be a material risk. Therefore we need to address it.' I am trying to describe that what you are talking about, as I understand it, is individuals, whereas I am talking about types—a type of weed aggregated across. In other words, that is the only way you can assess whether or not it has an impact. That is a poor way of trying to make it concrete.


The challenge always is that—forgive this analogy—if you look within the weeds, you will not see the bigger picture. The bigger picture is the aggregation across this area. That is why we use types. A type of weed may not be a material risk to food production, but the aggregation of that—in other words, a significant number—then may be. I am trying to use a different way of explaining it to you to give you some confidence that this is the way forward, not the way that you have sought to put in your amendment. I am trying to show why we have chosen the path that we have chosen, why we have confidence in the way the negative list will work and why you cannot use individual circumstances. Each of them on their own may not actually amount to a material risk, whereas if you aggregate it and look at the type it may in fact do that. I will pause there and see if we can progress it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:32):  I think it boils down to this: there are different paths to achieve this. I think the path that I have suggested in this amendment is a clearer, unambiguous path. I appreciate what the government is saying. I feel more comfortable with the amendment. My concern is that the way the process will operate may be subject to a number of ambiguities and uncertainties where we will end up with certain projects being approved where there is an overall adverse impact on water security and food production. I understand it is a question of approach and which path will be more effective. I think there ought to be a legislative approach. I am not certain what the opposition's view is in relation to this. That may determine whether we have a division in relation to this or not. If this amendment fails, as appears likely, I am sure that there will be ongoing scrutiny of the methodology and of how the risk management principles are used. Again, it is a question of different paths presumably to reach the same objective. I believe the objective could be reached more easily with an unambiguous approach such as the one set out in this amendment.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:34):  In the earlier debate on this amendment before we postponed it, I indicated that the opposition is sympathetic to the issues that Senator Xenophon is attempting to address with this amendment and that we are inclined to support this amendment. That position has not changed in the days that have followed or as a result of the advice that the minister has given. I understand the point the minister is attempt­ing to make in terms of the differentiation between kinds or types of projects and broad criteria and the potential of this amendment to capture and require analysis of specific projects. However, the types of projects that are likely to flow from this bill are of course going to have very specific effects and impacts in very different areas as they are applied right across the country, especially when it comes to water availability or agricultural production. We spent quite a period of time debating another amendment that had been championed by the opposition in relation to providing some security over land access for agricultural production. We think that in this regard it is important that we do not allow a system where loopholes in broader regulations can be exploited by specific projects. Whether they are exploited deliberately or otherwise, the potential is there for these specific projects to potentially have an adverse impact on water or agricultural production even under the type of regulations that the government is proposing under the existing section. Indeed, we have seen it in those draft regulations and in the earlier debates on the amendment about land access for agricultural production. I expressed quite strongly and passionately at that stage the concern that the government appeared to be treating land access for agricultural production as a side issue. The government appeared to not take into account the amendment that has now been made to insert new subclause 56(2)(e) to provide for consideration of land access for agricultural production. The government appeared to have no intention to revise the regulations relating to the negative list to reflect any guidelines in that regard.


I understand that there are challenges in preparing guidelines for that such as: what is your prime agricultural land and how do you go about defining it? These are issues the minister has to tackle in a number of different areas. But in this regard we think there is value in Senator Xenophon's amendments, which provide the potential for some case-by-case scrutiny and provide the potential for projects that may sneak through the types of project regulations to be addressed under a specific project-by-project regulatory approach.


To that end, we are supportive of these amendments. They may not be perfect. The challenge with any legislation is whether or not we can make it perfect. However, as is so often the case—and will probably be the case with this bill—I am sure that, whether this amendment passes or otherwise, the bill will be back before us in a year or two so we can tidy up things that have problems in the way they operate. If this clause were to have such problems then I am sure it will be addressed equally. It is possible that by not passing this clause, we will find in a couple of years that we are back, perhaps inserting something like this to provide greater discretion and greater powers to the minister to disallow certain projects or put them on the negative list.


I think it is important for the government to take this matter seriously. As I said, I understand the arguments the minister has made. But we think, as Senator Xenophon has outlined, that there is a continuing risk at the end of this process that if the bill passes in its current form we may see projects proceed that have an adverse impact on water availability, or we may see projects proceed that have an adverse impact on agricultural production. They may be one-off projects, but those one-offs add up to create a problem. It is that type of adverse impact and inadvertent consequence of a bill like this that we want to make sure is avoided. That is why we are inclined to support and will be supporting these amendments. 


We urge the government, if these amendments fail, to once again take a good look at the regulations it is proposing, to once again take a good look at that draft and, particularly, to once again revise that draft with regard to the new clause, 56(2)(e), which was inserted the other day; it does at least provide for some consideration of any adverse impact in regard to land access for agricultural production. I urge the govern­ment to take a look at that again and be particularly mindful of what the stakeholders have to say during consultation on this. I am accepting the likely political reality that this amendment will fail, but I hope the govern­ment at least takes into consideration the principles that this amendment is seeking to pursue. If it will not do that, then I urge the government to make the regulations for the negative list as tough and as stringent as possible. That is what is absolutely important—to make sure that the credibility of this system and the credibility of the assurances the government has given to farmers and to all those stakeholders in the industry stack up and are seen through. With that, I again thank Senator Xenophon for proposing these amendments and once again indicate the opposition's intention to support them.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:42):  As Senator Birmingham said, the opposition support amendment (3) and (4), proposed by Senator Xenophon. I will come back and say a couple of words about the amendments, but before I do that I want to raise a couple of issues that came up in this debate last Wednesday, I think it was.


I must say, Senator Ludwig is an important person! I have just been out to the rally at the front of Parliament House, and his name is being mentioned quite a lot out there. I might also say, though, that his name is not being mentioned very favourably. A lot of the people out there are the sorts of people who are now in desperate straits because of the government's bungling of the live cattle exports issue. I suspect that some of these people have spent their last pennies to come down and make their views known here in Canberra.


It is very sobering, and quite moving and emotional, to see all these people, some of whom have driven trucks 2½ to 3,000 kilometres. One of the speakers was just saying to the crowd that he gets about two kilometres to the litre of fuel in one of his big trucks. You can imagine what it has cost him to come 2½ thousand kilometres—money he does not have. He is from the north west. The whole of the north of Australia—rural Northern Australia—are struggling because of the live cattle ban. They are in absolutely desperate straits. We are going to see the bankruptcies come in the not-too-distant future. These people are making a last-ditch effort to try and make their government listen on things like live cattle exports and, more importantly, on things like the carbon tax. Out there, there are a lot of trucks, a lot of truckies. If Senator Sterle were in the chamber he would agree with me on this. There are people who understand that their livelihoods are about to be destroyed by the carbon tax brought in by this government whose leader promised us just a year ago that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. And here we are a year later with these people. 


It is quite emotional to be out there. They are making a last-ditch effort to come down and try and make people in this building, this government, understand just how they are hurting and how the decisions of this government have impacted so badly on ordinary Australians. I would hope, Minister, that you would have the courage and perhaps the time to go out and speak with these people, because the more you interacted with them the more you would understand the hurt that you have caused by a stupid decision, a poorly thought-through decision made on the balance of what you thought was a political opinion from GetUp! and the left-wing parties around the world. Your original decision was correct, Minister, but why you changed we in this parliament know: because you were done over by the left of your party and the Greens and the GetUp! group and some of the unions.


But I have distracted myself from the debate before the chamber. On Wednesday, Minister, I was making a plea again on behalf of some northern agricultural people. I was asking you about the banana industry, which your carbon tax will have a very heavy impact upon because they use a lot of electricity in their coldrooms and ripening rooms and they use a lot of fuel in bringing bananas, a bulky product, from Tully down to Sydney and Melbourne. I was saying that they are really getting it in the neck. I asked you, you might recall, whether this Carbon Farming Initiative that we are debating would perhaps give them something back. You assured me, yes, it will be good for them.


Coincidentally, a couple of banana growers, in fact a couple of horticulture growers, from my state of Queensland—and your state of Queensland too, of course—have been in touch with me and they say that this Carbon Farming Initiative is not going to help the horticultural industry one iota. They rightly point out that if you have a banana farm of 100 hectares, to take 20 per cent of that farm and put on trees for under the Carbon Farming Initiative will mean that that is 20 per cent fewer bananas they can grow and so their income would fall by far more than they might ever achieve from this Carbon Farming Initiative bill and the good things that are supposed to come from it. I am a bit naive. I said: 'But if you are growing banana trees, isn't that like growing trees? Won't that help, won't that qualify?' I am told no, that banana trees are business as usual and if you are growing things in a business as usual style you will not be able to take advantage of anything this bill might make available to you. So the information you gave me on Wednesday is quite wrong, unless some of the facts that I have mentioned are not correct, in which case I am sure you would take the opportunity of the debate today to tell me that the banana industry can in fact get some positive outcome from this Carbon Farming Initiative.


Also on Wednesday I asked you about whether all of those graziers, those cattle owners up in the north of Australia, many of them Indigenous people, I might say, Indigenous enterprises, might be able to get some advantage from this Carbon Farming Initiative. That is problematic as well. I am told by some of the people I was speaking to earlier today that a lot of them could reduce some of their costs in their cattle farming operations if they were able to plant some sorghum, some silage crops, and feed their cattle. But as you know, Minister, thanks to your Labor Party colleagues in the Queensland state government, you cannot chop a tree down. I know you, Madam Acting Deputy President, have been up that way and have seen trees everywhere across the north of Australia. They are not allowed to chop one of them down. So the opportunity of reducing their costs to try and make their industries a bit more viable is taken away from them.


I have just mentioned a couple of things, but if you walk outside there are about 5,000 people outside trying to make your government understand the hurt that is being imposed upon the people of rural and regional and remote Australia. I do hope you are able to spend some time with those people today, Minister. I thought you were fairly courageous in going to Mount Isa to address angry farmers not long after you made those silly decisions. I am told from people who were there that, whilst you at least had the courage and courtesy to go there, you did not answer any questions. People kept wanting to ask you things, wanting to get answers from you at those meetings, but they got absolutely nothing. I understand the mayor of Carpentaria Shire, Fred Pascoe—a very competent and able mayor; a very quietly sounding sort of fellow who never gets excited—was asking the minister a lot of questions which, again, he gave the politician's answer to. The minister never answered the question. But Mr Pascoe kept coming back to you and saying, 'That was all very well, Minister, but could you please answer the question.' I understand that everyone went away disappointed. 


This is happening right around Australia. In front of Parliament House today there are some timber workers from Tasmania. The timber industry used to be one of Australia's greatest industries. If any of you have been to Tasmania, you will know that there are millions and millions of old growth forest trees in that state. Thanks to the Greens, there is no industry in that state anymore. There is no way in the world you could interfere with the sustainability of the Tasmanian forests. Hundreds and hundreds of workers are now without a job. Those sort of people are out the front protesting. These are hardworking, decent, genuine Australians. They are not after a government handout—all they want is the right to work in what has been, for as long as Australia has been going, a very sustainable industry, the timber industry, particularly in Tasmania. There are some Tasmanian senators here. As Senator Milne would know, some of these forests have been logged for over 150 years. But they are the forests that the Greens go and put a placard in, saying, 'Save these virgin native forests.' Those forests were cut down 120 years ago and have regrown. That is why this industry is so sustainable.


This is relevant to the debate before the chamber because in certain instances land in Tasmania could be used for the Carbon Farming Initiative. I raise the matter in the context of the hurt around Australia that is demonstrated out the front of this building as I speak. That hurt will get worse when the Gillard Labor government brings in the carbon tax. I can talk about the carbon tax, because the Carbon Farming Initiative bill is one of a suite of bills that we will be dealing with in this chamber this year concerning the carbon tax that will be imposed upon Australians—that tax that just a year ago the Labor leader, Julia Gillard, promised hand on heart would not be introduced under a government she led. While some people might say perhaps she made a mistake, perhaps she did not mean to say that, we have on record the Treasurer, the deputy leader of the Labor Party, who said I think on no less than a dozen locations that Tony Abbott was being hysterical when he kept saying to people before the last election that Labor and Greens in alliance after the next election would bring in a carbon tax. Wayne Swan said Tony Abbott was off his brain—how dare he suggest that; they were not going to bring in a carbon tax. Wayne Swan said Tony Abbott was being hysterical. We have the leader and the deputy leader of the Labor Party both just a year ago, before the election, promising Australia there would be no carbon tax under this government and here we are, a year later, debating one of a suite of bills which will introduce a carbon tax.


Senators might also recall that before the last election Ms Gillard told the Australian public that she would not be doing anything on climate change until there was consensus. Do you remember that? A year ago there was consensus—99 per cent of the candidates standing for election a year ago promised that there would be no carbon tax. What more consensus can you get than that—99 per cent of all candidates promised there would be no carbon tax. Yet here we are, just a year later, dealing with this bill which is part of a suite of bills to introduce this toxic tax that is going to destroy even more Australians and which those many thousands of people out the front of this Parliament House at this very moment are expressing their concern about.


Unfortunately I have cut myself short of time to actually address the amendment. As Senator Birmingham says, we will support it. (Time expired)




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
):  The question before the chair is that amendments (3) and (4) on sheet 7118 moved by Senator Xenophon be agreed to. A division having been called, I remind honourable senators that divisions cannot take place before 12.30 pm on Mondays. The debate is adjourned accordingly.

(9)   Clause 76, page 101 (line 24), omit ""5 years"", substitute ""3 years"".


These amendments reduce the offsets reporting period maximum from five years to three years. Currently there is a period of 12 months to three years. There is a concern that a five-year period is too long. I can indicate that I will not be seeking to divide on these amendments but I would like an explanation from the government about the upper limit of five years and whether it acknowledges concerns about having such a long period. I think three years would constrain the offsets reporting period to what some would consider a more reasonable period, rather than five years.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:59):  What it would do, as you have correctly identified, is shorten the maximum reporting period. But a five-year maximum reporting period provides flexibility. For example, it avoids reporting costs at the beginning or end of a project when forest growth rates are slow. So what you would be doing is having three years creating churn. Five years provides that flexibility. The scheme integrity continues to be maintained because credits are only issued after abatement has been achieved, therefore the scheme continues with integrity. Five years is the appropriate period. It gives certainty, it gives flexibility within that period and it ensures that credits are only issued after abatement has been achieved. What it does not do, given what yours does, is create a greater churn in that period. In other words, what you do is you add to administrative cost.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:01):  Temporary Chairman Cameron, I am not sure I have had the pleasure of noticing you in the chair before. It will be a great temptation to many people in this place to test the will of the chair, I suspect, whilst you are there. But I will not be one of those. I congratulate you on your ascendancy to this very significant office.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Birmingham, this will be more a pleasure than a test.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am sure that it will at times be both and that you will exercise the office with the aplomb to which we are so accustomed. In regard to this amendment moved by Senator Xenophon to the reporting requirements within this bill, the opposition are not inclined to support this particular amendment. I think we probably share some of the concerns that the minister has just outlined. In regard to the eligible offset projects that we are talking about, a period of reporting for them of between 12 months and five years is probably an appropriate time line. Whilst five years has the potential to be a long period of time, equally, in regard to the establishment of and the progress of these sorts of projects, it is not necessarily an inordinate period of time. It is going to be a matter of balance. Different projects will have different time lines which it will be most appropriate for them to meet, but obviously where it is possible and sensible for projects to meet a five-year time line then that is probably wise. The well-established projects may need fairly minimal work to make their reports. It is going to be argued in either direction whether they should report more often or less often, but well-established projects probably need less oversight and checking once they are well established and their credentials have been acknowledged. So we think that shortening, in a sense, the mandatory reporting period to less than three years would not aid the efficient running and efficient management of this scheme and as a result we would join with the government in thinking that the five-year time line is appropriate to maintain.

I am confident that, whilst you are in the position that you are in, this place will not degenerate into a rabble. As to this matter, I think it is a genuine concern. Let us see how this goes in terms of the five-year period. I accept what the government and the opposition have said. I think we need to monitor this in terms of the length of the reporting period. Of course, we will have a vote on it now. I understand it is lost but I can understand the reasons given by both the government and the opposition.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:05):  I move amendment (10R) on sheet 7122 revised, which is standing in my name:


(10R) Clause 112, page 146 (after line 8), after subclause (14), insert:


(14A) Within 28 days of giving a notice under subsection (14), the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee must publish on its website the reasons for the endorsement of the proposal or the refusal to endorse the proposal, as the case may be.


Under this amendment the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee must publish on its website the reasons for its endorsement of the proposal or its refusal to endorse the proposal. Currently the bill provides that the minister must 'as soon as is practical' cause a decision to be posted on the department's website. This amendment inserts a 28-day requirement and also says that reasons for a proposed methodology being refused must also be published. It is effectively a transparency provision, and I am grateful for the discussions that I have had with the government and the opposition in relation to this. I think it would improve the legislation to have that benchmark of transparency and accountability in the legislation.

The opposition thanks Senator Xenophon for moving this amend­ment. We concur with the arguments that he has put in regard to providing further transparency to the process and the assessment and recognition of offset entities and, in particular, to the work of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. We hope that this amendment will provide not just further transparency but also the further benefits of confidence, being that of those who participate in this scheme, and certainty as to the way that the DOIC works and undertakes its considerations.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:08):  by leave—I move amendments (11R), (11A) and (11B) on sheet 7124:


(11R) Clause 255, page 271 (after line 16), after paragraph (c), insert:(ca) to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and to advise the Minister about best evidence in relation to permanence;


(11A)   Clause 255, page 271 (line 7), before ""The"", insert ""(1)"".


(11B)   Clause 255, page 271 (after line 18), at the end of the clause, add:(2)   If the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee gives advice to the Minister under paragraph (1)(ca) about best evidence in relation to permanence, the Minister must, within 28 days after receiving the advice, cause a copy of the advice to be published on the Department's website.


These amendments relate to the issue of permanence. This is something that was looked at closely by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and there is a discussion about this in some detail at pages 34 to 36 of the committee's report. There is a concern that a number of submitters argue that the requirement to maintain carbon stores for 100 years was too long and would discourage some potential proponents from participating in the scheme. Michael Kiely, the Chairman of the CFTA, stated, as reported on page 35 of the Senate committee report:


No farmer would be silly enough to agree to 100 years for soil carbon or 100 years for anything. A finance lender would want to know seriously the impact on the value of the property of agreeing to such a thing. We did some research into the 100 years thing and discovered it was a policy decision, not a scientific measure … We believe that 100 year is a perverse outcome. The result is said to be necessary so buyers can be confident they are getting value—that is, genuine abatements—so they get nothing. There is nothing available for them. We have found examples where the IPCC and the Verified Carbon Standard have allowed other periods of time recently—20, 25, 30-odd years. We believe we could work within that sort of time frame. 


Recommendation 3 of the entire committee at clause 2.49 of the committee report at page 6 states:


The committee recommends the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter.


This amendment adds to the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee a function that it monitor all scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and advise the minister of best evidence in relation to permanence. This was a recommendation of the Senate committee and I think it is important that DOIC as the responsible agency continue to look to update, amend and improve the scheme into the future. This amendment also provides that the advice by the committee be published on the website of the department within 28 days. 


There is an issue here about the continued monitoring of permanence, given the quite serious reservations expressed in its current form. It does not seek to change the permanence provision, but it does seek to ensure that there is ongoing or continuous scrutiny of the permanence provision, looking at the best available scientific evidence.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:12):  As Senator Xenophon has rightly highlighted, this issue was considered in some depth by the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation, an inquiry which you Mr Temporary Chairman Cameron chaired. So you would well recall the bipartisan recommendation that the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter. 


The bill does put in place a basic permanence obligation regarding the maintenance of carbon stores where credits have been issued. That is an important feature of the bill. There needs to be some certainty in this regard. However, as Senator Xenophon has highlighted, a number of submitters were critical of the 100-year permanence obligations and the impact that would have on the scheme. Senator Xenophon highlighted the evidence of one of the submitters to the inquiry. There were others. Ausveg in their submission made a very strong appeal on what the impact of this 100 year requirement may be. They indicated in the extract from their submission that appears in the Senate inquiry report:


… it would take a very brave farmer to agree to 100 year permanent arrangements in which they (and their children and grandchildren) will be held accountable for ""natural disturbances such as drought that may cause carbon to be released from the soil"".


Equally, placing all risk and costs as the growers' responsibility for ""bushfire … drought, or actions by neighbours, or third-parties"" belies the Government's own commitments to meeting its Kyoto obligations.


Given these serious challenges and immense uncertainty of carbon markets, it is quite unrealistic to expect vegetable and potato growers to sign 100 years commitments (with the threat of civil and criminal prosecution), undertake major investments, and change generational farming practices without any firm guarantees on the price they will be paid.


Those types of concerns are the concerns which are likely to manifest themselves and potentially make this legislation ineffectual in terms of its uptake. It is not just the farming or agricultural groups who have highlighted their concerns about this. It is not just the industry bodies; the committee also highlighted the evidence of the Climate Institute. The committee report stated that the Climate Institute agreed that the 100-year permanence provision was:


… likely to be perceived by many landholders as a substantial, even insurmountable barrier to participation in the scheme.


For these reasons, the opposition will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments, which put in place obligations on the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and to advise the minister about best evidence in relation to permanence. We think that is an appropriate course of action which will hopefully provide some continual evaluation of this issue. 


Importantly, as he so often does, Senator Xenophon has provided a transparency provision in this regard as well, a provision which requires that advice provided to the minister by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee on this matter of permanence must be published on the department's website so that it can be scrutinised, assessed and debated. I would expect there to be a feedback loop—that, once such scientific assessment and evaluation undertaken by the DOIC is published on the website, scientists and other experts will scrutinise the findings of the DOIC and provide further feedback to it, informing the DOIC's further deliberations on this issue. For these reasons, the opposition will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments and we hope that other parties within the chamber will do likewise.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:17):  The government does not support the amendments moved by Senator Xenophon. Members of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee have expertise with offset projects. The functions of the DOIC are described in proposed part 26, paragraph 255, 'Functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee': 


The Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee has the following functions:


   (a) the functions that are conferred on it by this Act and the regulations;


   (b) to advise the Minister about matters that:


      (i) relate to offsets projects; and


      (ii) are referred to the Committee by the Minister;


That is the role and function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. Senator Xenophon's amendments effectively confer on the committee the function of monitoring scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. Nothing prevents, on my reading of the bill, the minister referring these matters to the committee. But their work is primarily about offset projects. They are there to look at the methodologies and then give independent assessments of those. 


Permanence is about the length of time that carbon dioxide remains in the atmos­phere and its radiative forcing effect. Separate from the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, the government will continue to keep the permanence issue under review in light of developments in the Intergovern­mental Panel on Climate Change. I know that you have an interest in the issue of permanence, but we should not use the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee as the vehicle to maintain that interest. It is inappropriate to use it in that way. That is why we do not support the amendments. 


Permanence has been set at 100 years. We have set it at 100 years because carbon dioxide cycles between the atmosphere, oceans and land biosphere and its removal from the atmosphere involves a range of processes with different timescales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that around 50 per cent of the increase in CO2 will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years. A further 30 per cent will be removed within a few centuries. The remaining 20 per cent may take longer. In this context, 100 years has become the internationally accepted time frame for ensuring that sequestration is equivalent to, and can be used to offset, emissions. Under the CFI, sequestration projects can be terminated after 100 years without having to pay back carbon credits because it is then considered that permanence has been achieved. 


Even without these amendments, the government will continue to monitor international developments on the issue and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international scientific and policy consensus. It is not for the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to give advice to the minister about the best evidence in relation to permanence. Government will continue to monitor this issue and to look at international developments, but it is not a function that you should confer on the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. 


Just as an aside, it should also be noted that the CFI permit obligations allow significant flexibility. Landholders would be able to cancel their sequestration projects at any time by relinquishing the number of credits issued for the project. That will of course mean that projects will have a much higher value if they represent a permanent abatement. The integrity of the scheme is maintained by having permanence because there is no genuine abatement if carbon stores are subsequently released back into the atmosphere. You need permanence. All of those who want to make an effort in reducing our carbon, all of those who want to make an effort in ensuring that there can be carbon sequestration and all of those who want to make an effort to move towards a clean energy future require permanence. Landholders will be able of course to terminate sequestration projects at any time provided they hand back the same number of credits. If they do want to terminate, the flexibility is there.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:23):  I will not be supporting these amendments, either, for many of the reasons that the minister has just outlined. For the Greens it is essential that the permanence obligations stand very clearly as they are in current legislation. I remind the coalition and Senator Xenophon of one of the big concerns people have with the whole Carbon Farming Initiative. It has been outlined by Senator Joyce in his run around the country, saying that the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin will be covered in trees if you turn around twice and so on and so forth. We need to not only guarantee permanence but also give people very clear signals so that we do not end up with the simultaneous crises that we have leading to perverse outcomes. The simultaneous crises we have are a climate crisis, a water crisis, a food security crisis and an energy crisis. If you do not look at all of those in a holistic way, you will get perverse outcomes. If you suddenly decide that you are going to go with carbon sink forests everywhere without any concern about water or about food production, you will end up with a complete mess in rural and regional Australia. It is what essentially happened with the managed investment schemes, and we absolutely do not want to see that happen again.


Equally, we do not want to see food production pushed out of the way by energy crops. We do not want to see a massive investment from managed investment schemes mark II with the planting of carbon sink forests in areas which should be maintained for food production. Equally, we do not want people going into a gambling framework where they basically say they will put trees in, they will get the carbon credits for 25 years and then at the end of that the next generation can cut the lot down, rip it up, do what they like and go back to a different regime. By putting in 100 years, we are acknowledging that the task here is to put in the carbon and maintain it for 100 years. Every farmer will sit there and say, 'Right, I am going to look at this piece of my property and determine that.' That means there will be parts of people's properties that they cannot use for anything other than, for example, putting in a biodiverse planting. It will improve their property; it will improve the biodiversity on their property. It will not take anything else out of production. It is a good thing to do and it will store carbon, and it is being planted as a biodiverse planting because it is meant to be there for 100 years. That is what you would do if you were planting something to last 100 years—you would build resilience, get local seed and local species, and actually have that part of your property like that for 100 years. But it is not going to be a substantial part of your property if you can make more from doing other agricultural pursuits on that land.


Similarly with soil carbon, one of the issues—it is an issue that Australia is engaged with daily in the talks in Durban, and has been over the last several years in negotiations—is drought. Every time we have a major drought in Australia we lose massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. Australia is saying we are not going to sign up to the forest management provisions of the treaty because we run the risk in a major drought of having to pay a massive amount on loss on our target because of the carbon we lose to the atmosphere. So Australia has been arguing that we want force majeure provisions so that in the event of extreme events that are beyond what would be classified as normal Australia would not have that immediately taken off the target. There are a whole lot of complexities in the UN negotiations around permanence. One thing we have succeeded in doing here is sticking with the spirit of the international agreement and understanding on permanence, but this is also a very clear signal to rural and regional Australia that permanence means permanence and if you make these decisions they last for 100 years. That will lead to more balanced land use in rural and regional Australia.


We have also put in this bill the need to consult natural resource management plans and the natural resource management groups in any particular catchment to make sure we do not get perverse outcomes where too much of the catchment is turned over to one carbon farming alternative or another. We are trying to give rural and regional Australia the opportunity to take up the benefits of creating permits by putting carbon in the landscape on a permanent basis or restoring carbon in the landscape if they have a degraded bit of forest on their land that they want to restore or a piece of forest that they can bring up to its full carbon carrying capacity with assistance in various ways. We are providing people with the opportunity to do good things and giving them an incentive to do so, a payment to do so. But we are making sure that we do not end up with the perverse outcomes we see when we incentivise something in a way that does not take into account all the other issues like water, food production and energy. We are dealing with all these crises at once.


I wholeheartedly support the notion of permanence being 100 years. I recognise there is an ongoing discussion in inter­national negotiations. I am also cognisant of what the minister is saying, that that advice coming back through the international negotiations will obviously be taken into account by the government, is being taken into account every time there is one of these international meetings and will continue to be taken into account—but the DOIC is not the place to do it. Having said that, I think this is the most sensible way to proceed because it will give people a reality check. As the minister said, if they proceed on the basis that it is 100 years and then determine that there is more money to be made or there is a separate issue of ownership or for whatever reason they decide to get rid of the carbon that they have stored in this way, they will have to give up the permits. The reality is that that will be the consequence. It does not prevent them using that part of their property in the future in a different way but there will be a financial penalty incurred just as there is a financial benefit gained because you have done this in the first place. So that is going to be a commercial decision for people on the land, but I am confident that under this provision what we are going to get at last is a whole lot of biodiverse plantings on properties in places where it is appropriate to have them, where there will be decisions to avoid land clearance, where there will be decisions to restore degraded systems and improve biodiversity at the same time. 


I actually think this carbon farming initiative bill in the way that it has now been developed is an extremely good thing for rural and regional Australia and I think farmers are pretty desperate to have it out there because it is the first time that marrying concepts of stewardship with the financial outcome is going to be able to happen on the ground. I think that has been one of the really positive things we have achieved through this negotiation.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I am pleased to hear Senator Milne and the Greens party wanting to do something for rural and regional Australia. If you go and ask some of the 5,000-odd people out the front of the building now, most of whom are from rural and regional Australia, they will tell you that the Greens political party is the worst thing that has ever happened to rural and regional Australia. I might suggest to Senator Milne that if she is interested in helping rural and regional Australia not only should she do what she can in relation to this carbon farming initiative, but if she wandered outside and spoke with people from rural and regional Australia and found out what really concerns them that would show some real commitment to rural and regional Australia. If you go out there and ask those people, the things that really concern them are the carbon tax that is being imposed upon us by the Greens-Labor alliance. People out the front, people from rural and regional Australia, people from my town in country Australia, people right across the north of Australia, know that the carbon tax will be bad for them. It is a toxic tax. It is going to increase their cost of living but particularly for those in rural and regional Australia because of the greater reliance we have on transport and fuel and the greater impact that the carbon tax will have on those of us who live in rural and regional Australia. 


So I am pleased to hear Senator Milne at least mouthing the words about support for rural and regional Australia. I just wish she would go outside and hear the real problems of rural and regional Australia and adjust her party's approach accordingly. Give up this government that has been so devastatingly bad for all in rural and regional Australia, in fact all Australians. Slip down and ask BlueScope Steel workers. None of them have much confidence in this government, which is being propped up by the Greens political party.


Getting on to the amendment before the chamber, which is as I understand it for the independent domestic offset integrity committee to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permits and to advise the minister about best evidence in relation to permits, Senator Birmingham on behalf of the coalition has indicated that the coalition would be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. I just raise the issue, though, that I hope this independent domestic integrity committee is independent. I hope that it will monitor all scientific research. This is a concern I have with this amend­ment. You would be aware, Mr Temporary Chairman, that we set up an independent climate change commission to oversight so-called climate change and appointed Professor Flannery to lead that group, appointed him to a position in which he gets $180,000 a year for two or three days a week work—much more than you, Mr Temporary Chairman, as a member of this Senate gets every year. I know that you and most people in this chamber work seven days a week and many of them work anything from 12 to 15 or 20 hours a day seven days a week. They do not get the sort of pay that Professor Flannery is getting to run this so-called independent Climate Commission on behalf of the government.


This is my point in relation to this amendment. The government appointed to that independent commission only those people who had a scientific view or had a view of science that the government supported. So in this amendment this domestic offset integrity committee is being asked to monitor scientific research. I just hope that if the amendment is passed and the integrity committee is looking at and monitoring scientific research that it monitors all research and not just, as in the case of the Climate Commission, research which the government agrees with. In Professor Flannery's case and in the case of the Greens-Labor alliance, all of those scientists who do not agree with Professor Flannery's view on climate change are just ignored. I am not saying they should be believed. I have often said in this chamber before, with thousands of scientists believing one way and thousands of scientists believing another way, that I am not a scientist and I do not form an opinion when it comes to the cause of climate change. We all accept that the climate is changing. But the scientists cannot agree and so I put myself in the category that simply says if a scientist cannot agree what chance have I got?


In Australia we do not have the totalitarian, fascist governments of the middle of the last century when you had to believe what Hitler or Mussolini thought or you were put to the sword. There was only one view and that was Hitler's or Mussolini's and if you disagreed with that it was off with your head. We are a democracy and we are not like that, yet in this case the Labor-Greens alliance government is saying there is only one view of climate science and if you do not agree with it not only will you be ignored but also they will make sure that you never get any research funding. That is to the extent where a lot of respected scientists in Australia are now not game to raise the alternative view because they know that they—and their associates and colleagues who might be seen to support that view—will simply not be funded for research which keeps scientists in operation. That is the sort of thing that happened under the fascist governments and the communist govern­ments of the last century: you have got to believe what the government believes or you are finished. Let us hope that, with this amendment, the independent Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee looks at all scientific research, not just research that the government wants it to look at to come up with a view that the government has already preordained.


In relation to the climate change commission, we know that Professor Flannery and all his colleagues on that were only appointed because they shared the government's view. They refused to look at any other scientific work on the issue because that did not accord with what the government wanted Australians to believe. As for Professor Flannery, we know he is the one that has been warning us about tidal increases but then we find—and I did so with absolute amazement—that, contrary to what he is telling everybody else about tides rising, he goes and buys a property or two right on the edge of the Hawkesbury River, so clearly he cannot believe that the tides are going to rise by as much as he has been predicting around the place. Perhaps we will hear more about that at estimates and perhaps the government will come clean in their supposedly open and accountable paradigm about Professor Flannery's conflict-of-interest statements. I understand from last estimates that he put one in but no-one has been able to see it. That is another secret of this very secretive government. We are told that he has indicated his interests that might be in conflict with his duties. But while the government knows that, nobody else in this chamber does. We are not being taken into the confidence of Professor Flannery or of the government. It is another secretive deal by this government that has really become renowned for its lack of accountability and lack of openness. So, whilst as Senator Birmingham has indicated, we support this amendment, I do hope if the amendment is passed that the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will be a committee of integrity—unlike, I suggest, the climate change commission, which seems to me to lack integrity because you are only appointed because of your view on things—and that, if it is going to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence, it will actually monitor all scientific research and not just the research that the government wants it to look at.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:42):  I want to address some of the contributions made so far to the debate on this amendment. I thank Senator Macdonald for a valuable contribution that has highlighted not just the importance of this amendment but some of the broader issues around the continual scrutiny and analysis of science in this debate. Senator Milne, in outlining hers and the Green's opposition to this amendment, was emphatic that we must keep the 100-year benchmark. Nothing about this amendment, in and of itself, seeks to step away from 100 years. Nothing suggests that 100 years, as the time line for permanence under the carbon farming scheme, will not be the ongoing figure. All it does is say that, if relevant international scientific research suggests that a different approach to permanence is warranted, that research should be brought to the attention of the minister and should be published on the department's website. It is a pretty straightforward amendment in that regard. It is not, in fact, an amendment—even were the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to find that there is over­whelming scientific research that would warrant a change in the definition—that does not mandate that change. All it does is say that the DOIC must advise the minister of that finding and they must publish the evidence. That is where it starts and ends. Then we can have a debate about how the minister may respond to that change in evidence. So I think to portray this amendment as an amendment that in some way seeks to undermine the 100-year benchmark as it currently exists is not accurate. It is purely an amendment that seeks to ensure there is genuine ongoing analysis of the science.


Senator Milne said that permanence needs to be permanence, and the minister emphasised the international discussions that continue with regard to permanence. We have semantic debates about words in this place sometimes. Obviously, in this case we all accept that the word 'permanence' is being used with a definitional period and would, in any other debate, be a description of duration rather than permanence. When you say something is for 100 years, that is 100 years duration not 100 years of permanence, because in all the usual approaches permanence means permanent, not 50 years, 100 years or a trillion years. But I understand that this is a case of accepting international language in that regard.


What does disturb me, though, about the minister's contribution is that he emphasised it is not the role or function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to undertake this work. That is right to a point, Minister, but it is a bit of a circular argument because the functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee are laid out by clause 255 of the bill, and the amendment we are debating seeks to change and add to those functions. If we pass this amendment and it goes into law then indeed it will be the function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to look at and monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. So the argument is: who should be responsible for looking at that? Who should be the responsible party to provide some advice to the government about up-to-date scientific information on permanence as it relates to the operation of the carbon farming scheme?


Whilst in the way the government envisioned this scheme operating it may not have been the DOIC's core role to look at this, the DOIC does appear to be the best fit as to who should most logically look at and provide ongoing advice to government about these matters of permanence. Rather than accepting a 'trust us' attitude—and we have had, as I have emphasised at other times in this debate, serious concerns time and time again when this government has said, 'Trust us; she'll be right, mate,' in its approach to things—the opposition believes, and is keen to support Senator Xenophon in this regard, that it makes a lot of sense to mandate some ongoing analysis of the science in regard to permanence and to ensure that somebody with particular responsibility for how the scheme will work has an ongoing brief to look at international developments with regard to permanence. That makes perfect sense.


We think the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee are the obvious parties to do so when it comes to this legislation. We do not want just to leave it up in the air—that is, the minister of the day will be advised by the department of the day about the matter. We do not want to leave it on a 'trust us' platform that, should those international standards evolve, change or be informed by better science, the minister will respond to that in an unprompted way. We want to make sure the prompting process is in place, and these amendments of Senator Xenophon provide very specifically for the prompt to be given that the scientific consensus or research has shifted and there is a better understanding of how permanence may be treated. This relatively simple amendment provides for a very clear process by which the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will monitor the science around permanence and tell the minister what they have seen, what they know, what they understand it to be. They are the people, after all, who ultimately are looking at the methodologies for the operation of the scheme and any issues that come up in relation to programs that operate under this scheme. They are the people who are tasked and equipped to provide good oversight. With regard to the practical—where you bring the science together with the practical operation of the scheme—they are the people who are going to have to make those decisions and mould it together, so they are equally well placed to advise on this matter.


The minister rightly said that in the clause as it is written there is probably nothing to prevent the committee providing information to the minister if they think it relevant in relation to this issue of permanence and scientific research on it. I agree with the minister—there probably is nothing to prevent them doing that. Certainly subclause 255(d) provides for them to have a function:


to do anything incidental to or conducive to the performance of the above functions.


And those above functions themselves are relatively broad about providing advice to either the secretary or the minister in relation to offset projects. If in the course of providing advice about a project matters of permanence come up, it is obvious that it would not just be prohibited but probably be a responsibility of the committee to provide some advice to the minister in relation to those matters of permanence and the scientific advice that surrounds them. So the potential and the likelihood are already there that, at some points in time, the DOIC will be looking at matters of permanence. Given at some points in time they will be looking at those matters of permanence, we think it is quite appropriate that in fact all of the time in an ongoing manner they should have an obligation to ensure they are up to date with the science and across it and, where there are changes in that science, inform the minister of them and, where there are relevant changes in that science, having informed the minister of them inform other stakeholders and the public of them so that we get that feedback loop that I talked about previously that ensures we are continually apprised of developments in this regard.


I struggle with the government's arguments against this. I am not sure why the government is so emphatically against it. I understand the arguments that Senator Milne has made, but once again I think she is attempting to read more into these amend­ments than they will actually achieve. She is attempting to believe that these amendments will somehow undermine the standards that have been set from day one. There is nothing in these amendments that will undermine those standards. There is nothing in these amendments that will see anything change in the 100-year time line any time soon. There is nothing in these amendments that will provide increased powers or scope for the minister or the government of the day to arbitrarily change that. These amendments are about the provision of advice and the publication of that advice. That seems to us to be perfectly sensible and rational, and to be perfectly entitled to our support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:54):  I want to emphasise that this does not seek to change the 100-year provision, but it does seek that there be ongoing monitoring. So if there is further evidence that it needs to be modified in any way for certain types of use, perhaps then it can be looked at. It is just a requirement for there to be monitoring of the scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. I think the government are saying, 'We'll do that, but not through this committee.' But if this committee is entrusted with dealing with the issue of carbon farming to provide objective evidence, to look at the scientific evidence and to look at the administration of the scheme, I would have thought it appropriate for this committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to look at this issue. It does not actually seek to change the 100 years, but it does seek for the committee to advise itself or to give advice to the government and for that advice to be published. I think that is the right thing to do for such a piece of legislation. Therefore, I will be persisting with these amendments and I am grateful to the opposition for their support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:56):  I move amendment (12) on sheet 7118:


(12)    Clause 306, page 303 (after line 6), after subclause (1), insert:


(1A)   Any review under subsection (1) must be conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in conjunction with the Productivity Commission.


(1B)   The Minister must ensure that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Productivity Commission are provided with sufficient additional resources to conduct any such review.


This amendment relates to the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission conducting reviews. Under the current deal, there is a review of the act, the regulations and other instruments every three years. It is important to ensure that this initiative continues to improve. However, it is crucial that this review be independent and, as such, this amendment requires that every three-year review be conducted by the CSIRO, which has already done research into carbon farming, in conjunction with the Productivity Commission.


I believe it is important that the review include consideration of how the carbon credit market operates and how Australian farmers and industry are participating in the trade of carbon credits, and that is why I believe the Productivity Commission should be involved in any review. I note that the Productivity Commission has recently conducted a review on carbon pricing mechanisms. I think that was a very useful exercise. I think the Productivity Com­mission did a very thorough job of adding to the public debate and our knowledge of this area. Furthermore, this amendment requires that both agencies be provided with the adequate additional resources to enable them to conduct such reviews. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:57):  We have already stated in the House that the government will seek the advice of the CSIRO, as it is a valuable organisation and we value their advice, when reviewing the adequacy of the risk of reverse buffer adequacy. But let us be clear: the government's plan for the Clean Energy Future includes the establishment of a climate change authority which will review the CFI. The government will continue to, and always have, value the advice of the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission in relation to climate change policies. They will have an opportunity when the CFI is reviewed. But the government do not agree with putting it in the legislation in the way outlined by Senator Xenophon. It calls for the CSIRO to undertake the review in conjunction with the Productivity Com­mission, so there is no choice about that. They would both have to undertake the review. It does not say how they would do that. It does not say what the terms of reference would be. It does not say what they would be looking at, such as the terms of reference and, of course, it does not give them any underpinning to undertake it.


It is a much better course for the government to follow its plan—that is, for the Clean Energy Future—which includes the establishment of the Climate Change Authority, independent of government, which will review the efficacy of the CFI. In 1B you have also included:


The Minister must ensure that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Productivity Com­mission are provided with sufficient additional resources to conduct any such review.


But it does not say how that would be done. These would be budget decisions. They may not amount to much in financial outlay; nonetheless, I can see you are trying to set up a scheme which provides a type of review which, the government says, creates too much specificity and does not allow an appropriate review to be done at the appropriate time. In that way, even if your amendment were successful, the Climate Change Authority would still undertake a review of the CFI. In doing that, you would also be creating additional work that the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission would need to do and you could end up, effectively, with a double-up. For all those reasons, we do not support the amendment.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:02):  The opposition does support Senator Xenophon's amendment. We think it is important that there be appropriate organisations tasked with undertaking this review. I have listened to the minister carefully, and he has said that Senator Xenophon's amendment does not provide for what the terms of reference are or how the review would be undertaken. Of course we need to understand that Senator Xenophon's amendment to mandate that the review be undertaken jointly by the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission does not stand in isolation; it is an amendment to the existing clause 306 of the bill. The government themselves are proposing that this review occur and that it be a review into the operation of the act and the regulations and other instruments made under the act. They have already set out to some extent the broad framework of what the review would be expected to do. They have set out that there will be public consultation, they have set out that there will be a report and they have, thankfully, set out that that report will be made public and tabled in the parliament. They have set out the time lines for the review, which is the subject of subsequent amendments, and of course they have set out that there will be further reviews. So they have set out almost everything in relation to this review process except who is to undertake it.


If I am correct in what I think I heard the minister say, he indicated that the Climate Change Authority will be tasked with undertaking this review and that that was the intention of the government. The minister is nodding, so I take it that I did hear him correctly. I appreciate the minister telling us who the government intends to undertake this review; of course that is not stipulated in the bill. But of greater concern is that the Climate Change Authority does not at present exist. The structure of it is not at present known; exactly what its powers, remit, skills et cetera will be are not currently clear. The CSIRO, from a scientific stand­point, and the Productivity Commission, from a regulatory and economic standpoint, have proven track records. They have known skills and a clear ability in working together to undertake a review of a scheme such as this one. That will require a mix of scientific understanding and an appreciation of best practice and lowest cost regulation, which the Productivity Commission of course has.


The minister was critical that the amendment does not specify how the two are to undertake it together. I would have thought that they are grown-up organisations and that, just as at present, it is open for the minister of the day to stipulate someone to undertake the review. Under the current framework of the bill, the minister of the day could ask Mickey Mouse to undertake the review and that would comply with the bill. He has indicated that it will be the as yet unestablished Climate Change Authority that will undertake the review. Were the Climate Change Authority to have been in operation for a period of time, or were it in fact to be in operation full stop, we might be comforted by that information. But I am not comforted by the information when I do not know fully how that authority is going to work. Its establishment is probably to be the subject of future debate by this place, unless it is to be established purely under the executive powers of government.


We know CSIRO and the Productivity Commission have independence; we know they have integrity; we know they have capability; we know they have experience; we know they have the skills; we know that we can have confidence in the work that they produce. They are the sensible bodies to look at something as complex as this scheme and to provide sound advice on how it will operate in the future and on how this parliament may wish to consider improving it in the future to get the type of outcomes to which we all aspire. 


With all of that, the opposition is strongly supportive of Senator Xenophon's amendment here, and we would hope that the government might reconsider or, if not, that the Greens might see some benefit in these proven expert bodies being tasked to undertake this very important function and review.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:06):  The Australian Greens will not be supporting the amendment proposed to require the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission to conduct a review of the carbon farming legislation. As has been devised in the whole clean energy package, the Climate Change Authority is to be appointed not only to set the targets, if you like—the budget of greenhouse gas emissions that need to be reduced each year through to an 80 per cent target at 2050—but also to conduct a review of these specific pieces of legislation that are part of the package. The Productivity Com­mission is already going to be signi­ficantly expanded and it will have a much larger workload put on it because its job will be specifically to review the level of compen­sation provisions that have been made to the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. It will have a major role in doing all that, and it will need expanded resources to do so. At the same time, the CSIRO is working with a number of farmers and farming organisations right now on soil carbon issues and is trying to work through the development of an appropriate methodology that may be applied in the future to enable the permits to be granted and so on. The CSIRO is very firmly engaged in this space at an operational level and at a consultative level with the farming community. 


The Climate Change Authority will oversee all of these particular pieces of legislation in a big-picture way and will need to consult with, as the minister has just suggested, both the Productivity Commission and the CSIRO and no doubt a number of other institutions who are doing various aspects of work. In a structural way you have an oversight authority who will oversee all of it and then drill down how they actually conduct each of the assessments of those pieces of component legislation. This was thought through very carefully, because you cannot have an organisation which is part and parcel of working out the assessments and the methodologies reviewing itself in that context as to the effectiveness of the legislation. But certainly all the work that it has done will feed into that assessment that will be done by the Climate Change Authority. 


The question becomes, do we think that the Climate Change Authority is going to have sufficient rigour to do this job? That is entirely dependent on, in the end, who is appointed to the Climate Change Authority and that is a matter that everybody with an interest in climate change in Australia will take a keen interest in as this develops over time. I appreciate the difficulty here because at the time these amendments were developed the whole clean energy package had not been announced, the whole procedure of how everything would fit together and who would oversee what and how they would be involved had not been announced, and so, in the absence of having any authority with the rigour to oversee this, I can understand why you would choose CSIRO and the Productivity Commission. But now the government has announced the clean energy package and there is a very clear role for the Climate Change Authority to look at all the legislation and make sure it is delivering on the objective of reducing emissions in the context of the emissions reduction target that will be based on the 80 per cent reduction by 2050. That is why the Greens are not supporting this amendment—there is a different structure in place now but it does not exclude either the Productivity Commission or the CSIRO, who will feed into that review process of the Carbon Farming Initiative.


There is a following amendment in relation to time frame for review, and Senator Xenophon has said within 12 months of legislation being passed or 2014. Within 12 months of the legislation being passed, assuming that it is going to be passed in the second half of this year, means that we would be doing the first review next year and that is just not feasible given that it will hardly have got started by that time. In the government's timetable, 2014 is the timeline proposed for the first review, by which time you would have some results on the ground to review. I want to foreshadow that the Greens will not be supporting the amend­ment on the timeframe for that reason. Again I say that at the time the amendments were developed the other package had not been announced and there was no way of knowing that. I make clear where the Greens will be standing on that and also indicate that the Greens will not be proceeding with the last amendment on the sheet as it currently stands.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:13):  I am worried by this statement of the government, supported by the Greens, that the Climate Change Authority is the body to undertake this review. This really is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We have the amazing situation where the government is proposing that a review of a bill that it hopes to have passed by the Senate today will be undertaken by an authority that is not yet in existence.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Xenophon says it is not satisfactory at all. This is an authority that is going to be brought into existence as part of the government's planned carbon tax package. It is on the record that the opposition will be opposing the carbon tax package, and in opposing the carbon tax package we will be opposing the establishment of this Climate Change Authority. Understandably we think it is unsatisfactory to agree to a proposal that a review will be undertaken of the operation of this bill, or act if it is passed, and of the operation of the carbon farming scheme by an authority that we will fight and hope to stop being established. That would of course leave meaningless the minister's promise that it will be the Climate Change Authority, because we hope that it will not be there. We hope it will not be there because it is part of some $400 million worth of administration that the government is proposing to create under the carbon tax regime. This is one of the great and amazing things about the government's carbon tax package. Such is the money-go-round that is the carbon tax package, it is going to establish a climate change authority and a raft of other regulatory bodies that just over the life of the forward estimates will churn through $400 million of taxpayers' money in administrative costs for the carbon tax. Anybody who pauses to think about that should be gobsmacked and horrified. This comes on top of the forward estimates costs for the continuing operation of the existing Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and so on. All up, we are talking about more than half a billion dollars in regulatory and administrative oversight for these schemes over the forward estimates—$400 million alone specifically identified within the carbon tax package that the government has released.


All Australians could find better ways to spend that sort of money. The opposition certainly believes that it could find better ways to spend that sort of taxpayer money. Taxpayers could find better ways to spend that sort of money rather than having to part with it in a tax in the first place. So it is anathema to us that we would be asked to agree that this review be undertaken by a new regulatory body, a new statutory authority, that is going to be part of, frankly, squandering some $400 million of taxpayers' money on a bigger bureaucracy. That is where the carbon tax is leading us to—this great giant new bureaucracy that churns money around. It takes in around $9 billion a year in new tax revenue for the government, spits some of it back out to households and to industry and churns up $400 million of it over the forward estimates in new public servants, new authorities, new regulators and new carbon cops out there on the beats—all of these bodies put in place just churning the money around as only this government is capable of doing.


Despite putting in place the new $9 billion a year tax, the government will still manage to lose money on it. They will still manage to run a deficit on it, as only they can do. Once they have churned all that money around through their giant new bureaucratic arrange­ments and they have spit it out to those they think most worthy, not only will they leave millions of Australian households worse off and thousands of Australian businesses of all sizes struggling and thousands of Australian jobs in jeopardy and send billions of dollars overseas for the purchase of carbon permits but also eventually they will increase the size of the deficit to fund all of this activity. That is the madness of the scheme they are proposing. It is the madness of the scheme that will be debated in this place during the second half of the year. 


We think that it makes no sense at all to agree that the review of the Carbon Farming Initiative should be undertaken by a yet-to-be-established, yet-to-be-proven, yet-to-be-tasked, yet-to-be-staffed regulatory body—an authority which is yet to be given the time to establish their expertise and which is part of this carbon tax money-go-round and part of this great big new $400 million expenditure in bureaucracy by this govern­ment. It is particularly ridiculous to do so when the skills are already there in existing agencies to do the job properly. The skills are there in CSIRO to provide a rigorous and thorough examination of the scientific issues in the carbon farming legislation, the matters of permanence we have just debated, the impact on the water tables and water flows, the impact on biodiversity that we have debated already and the environmental and scientific impact. Quite clearly, CSIRO already has the skills and expertise to undertake the review we are talking about in best practice regulation, in lowest cost regulation, in ensuring that this scheme does not have perverse or adverse consequences to overall abatement targets and measures and in ensuring that, should the carbon tax have gotten through, it operates in a sensible way with the carbon tax regime. We think that obviously the policy skills and the independence of the Productivity Com­mission is equally the right place and has those skills already in place to be able to deliver on this.


Why on earth you would propose sending it off for review by an untested, unknown, unestablished authority is beyond me. This is a very sensible amendment of Senator Xenophon's. It will ensure that the most able people to provide the most independent of advice and review are the ones who do so and give advice back to the government. That is why we support this. It is very disappointing to hear not just that the government will not be supporting it but equally that the Greens will not be supporting it. I would have thought that they would want to see the type of rigour and robust approach that we know CSIRO and the Productivity Commission can achieve. I would have hoped that they would have seen the wisdom in this. Frankly, I believe that at one stage in another parliament they would have, but they now are in a situation where most of the detail on these things is probably worked out behind closed doors with the government. Most of the agreement on 'We'll let you have this amendment but we don't want to see any of the other amendments go through' is done behind closed doors with the government rather than, as perhaps they once did, going through and seeing sensible amendments for what they are and then supporting sensible amendments, particularly sensible amendments like this one that only go to improving the long-term integrity, credibility and operation of this carbon farming scheme. It is an amendment that should be supported and it is a disappoint­ment to see that it does not appear to have the numbers in chamber to enjoy support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I will briefly refer to the contribution that Senator Milne made a few moments ago. I listened to her arguments in relation to my subsequent amendment—I note that we are not dealing with it now—and see that her argument has some considerable merit, so I will not be proceeding with amendment (13) on sheet 7118. I foreshadow that in relation to the first review, as I think there is a legitimate point there. I take that on board and I accept it. Therefore, I will not be proceeding with that amendment.


On this particular amendment, though, it is critical that it is supported for a number of reasons. If you look at the bill at page 303—the very final page of this bill—and at clause 306, 'Reviews of operation of this Act etc', you see it states:


(1) The Minister must cause to be conducted reviews of the operation of:


(a) this Act; and


(b) the regulations; and 


(c) other instruments under this Act.


He must make provision for public consultation. He must cause a report to be prepared of a review under subsection (1). A report of the review must be tabled in parliament. It needs to be tabled before the end of 31 December 2014. But it does not say who will do that review. As I understand it, the government is foreshadowing that it will be the Climate Change Authority. That authority has not been established. It does not provide for terms of reference of that review, not even broad parameters for that. That concerns me. The Productivity Commission has already done tremendous work looking at the whole issue of appropriate mechanisms for the pricing of carbon. I would have thought that this would segue, if you like, into the work they have already done. They clearly have the capacity to do so.


In relation to Senator Milne's point about the CSIRO—that it has already provided advice and it may not be appropriate for it to look at this—I think it is valuable that Senator Milne raised that point. But the CSIRO has looked at this issue. I think it is in a perfect position to be part of the review. You could have perhaps a Chinese walls mechanism so that there isn't any potential conflict, but clearly the expertise of the CSIRO would be valuable.


The very thrust of this amendment is that there ought to be an independent process to review the operations of this act. The Climate Change Authority is part of the executive arm of government. You do not have independence. I believe you will not have the robustness of purpose to the review process that is required. Therefore I think it is important that you have an independent body to do this. This mechanism is the best way forward. The current legislation is deficient in that it provides a mechanism for a review but it does not provide the basis for such a review, the broad terms of reference or the independence of such a review. That is why I am very grateful to the coalition for its support for this.


The carbon farming initiative is a huge change that has been proposed. I want it to work effectively and to work well. But I think we ought to seek independent advice when reviewing this legislation. The Climate Change Authority is not the appropriate body. What has been proposed in this amendment is far superior for dealing with the very important issue of a review.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (12) on sheet 7118, moved by Senator Xenophon, be agreed to. It being not yet 12:30, the division will be postponed to a later hour.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (12:27):  Whilst we move to 12:30 shortly, it might be worthwhile dealing with two government amendments. They are technical amendments to the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011. I seek leave to move the two amendments together.


Leave granted. 




Senator LUDWIG:
  I move government amendments (1) and (2) on sheet BR232 together:


(1) Clause 66, page 56 (lines 20 and 21), omit “Australian carbon credit”, substitute “non Kyoto international emissions”.


(2) Clause 82, page 63 (table item 2), after “section”, insert “36 or”.


Clause 66, is a technical correction to make it plain that it is non-Kyoto international emissions rather than the Australian carbon credit. It has been picked up as a technical correction; it may be a drafting issue. Clause 82 is the reviewable decision. Rather than a technical correction, there was an oversight with reviewable decisions in that one of the clauses which is reviewable was omitted. We are now putting it back in to ensure that both those provisions are reviewable under the legislation. With those short words, I am sure no-one will object—though I may be surprised—to the government making sure the legislation is both technically correct and properly reviewable.

 (South Australia) (12:29):  I thank the minister for his explanation of these amendments as technical amendments or matters of correction. Of course we all wish to see that the technical aspects are correct in the final legislation and that where small errors may have occurred in the drafting process they are rectified and picked up before we reach the final point of passing the bill and then having to deal with insignificant amendments at a later time. The opposition appreciates the minister bringing those to our attention. We will not stand in the way of the government making what he assures us are technical amendments.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:55):  Because this has been a very long and drawn-out debate, before we proceed to vote on these carbon bills I want to ensure that the coalition's position on this is well understood and is clear for those who have attempted to follow this debate which, given the parliamentary recess, has stretched for not just hours or days but indeed weeks. 


It is with deep regret that the opposition casts a vote against this legislation but, sadly, this has been a botched process by the government from day one. The coalition supports the principle and has long been a champion of it and an advocate for the concept that we should pursue and encourage the increased abatement of carbon through our soils, through our landholders and through better practices of our farmers. We believe that is a sensible approach. But we regret that the development of this legislation has been terribly mishandled by the government of the day. We need only look at the fact that, from the very early days of these bills being released for comment and being considered by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Com­mittee, it was clear that there were a lot of gaps pertaining to the regulations that underpin these bills. There were a lot of gaps as to the methodologies that would be applied to different areas of abatement. Those gaps are serious matters that should have been resolved before this matter came to a final vote. 


We should have seen the final copies of the regulations as they relate to the composition of the positive list, the list that will determine what activities will definitely be included within the scope of this carbon farming legislation. We should have seen the final copies of the regulations as they relate to the negative list, the list of those areas of activity that will not be allowed to participate in or proceed under the Carbon Farming Initiative. Sadly, we have not seen either of those. We saw some draft regulations tabled just last week by the Minister for Agricult­ure, Fisheries and Forestry in this regard. At the last minute he brought in some draft regulations around the positive and negative lists. That is just not good enough. Those regulations should have been there for the committee to consider. They should have been there for stakeholders to comment on. All along, we should have been looking at a complete and final package. But, no, we have been looking at something far from a complete and final package. Instead, we have been looking at a package that, as this government so often says, is simply built on the basis of 'Trust us.'


Well, we do not trust the government. We do not trust them to get things right. We believe that if legislation is going to pass through this place with so much that is so dependent on the regulation and that if an approach is adopted within that legislation under this government, then we need to see everything in detail beforehand. We need all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed. We need to see it all, because we cannot trust the government to deliver things that they promise they will deliver.


In this regard we need to see certainty around the methodologies that are to be applied. We had an extensive debate, stretching from last week into today's debate, about the landfill gas sector, a sector that has abated more than 4½ million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2009. They make a huge contribution in terms of the work. Many of those businesses and activities were early movers. They were people who got into this industry, got into the sector and started to do their bit to abate carbon emissions at the very early stages. And yet they are at risk under this legislation, at risk under this approach, of suffering adverse consequences, of being left stranded high and dry. They are at risk, which we will see, particularly in regional areas, of landfill gas processes being shut down that have been there for a long, long period of time. That would be a very perverse outcome.


The minister has provided some comfort and some assurances to the industry and to the chamber that that will not be the case, but, again, that comfort and those assurances came just at the last minute. They came only by discussions with industry at the end of last week that were reported back to the chamber today. They were discussions that would not have happened were it not for the work of Senator Xenophon, the opposition and industry in bringing it to the attention of the government and the Greens and ensuring that there was a discussion and a dialogue to try to provide some certainty. The industry is willing—dare I say it?—to trust the government on this matter. I hope the landfill gas industry's trust is validated. We cannot provide such blank cheques or open-ended trust to the government, but I hope their trust is validated. I hope that they do get the outcome that will ensure those important projects can continue into the future. I hope they do get that outcome in the time line that the government has promised.


But they are not the only ones who are waiting for a methodology determination under this. They are not the only ones who would have been far better off making sure that we got this right—if all those matters had been resolved before this came to a final vote in this place. We just cannot sign these types of blank cheques with the 'trust us' approach. It is not that the opposition and the Australian community have been once bitten by this government—far from it; the opposition and the Australian community have many times been bitten by this government and are many times shy of the 'trust us' approach of this government. We have seen a litany of failures. These are not just failures such as their chronic failure of budget management and the failures of infrastructure projects such as the school hall scheme; there is a chronic litany of failures in the very space that this legislation pertains to, a chronic litany of failures in the space of climate change programs and their operation. We can rattle off a long list of them. The gold star award for these failures goes to the pink batts scheme, the home insulation scheme which wrought havoc on an industry and which had severe consequences for homeowners, industry, individual lives and for taxpayers who saw not just hundreds of millions of dollars but billions of dollars wasted under the program.


We saw the Green Loans program, another classic failure. If it were not for the home insulation scheme, the Green Loans program would have been the gold star winner for failure in terms of climate change policies by this government. Once again, the Green Loans scheme wrought havoc on the lives of thousands of people who wanted to do the right thing and provide environmental assessment but who saw a government get it so wrong. The government's 'trust us' approach simply let those people down.


We have seen the government's flawed judgment in its other policies in this space. It was not so long ago—in fact, only 12 months ago—that the Australian people were being asked to re-elect this Gillard Labor government on a platform of policies such as the cash-for-clunkers scheme and the citizens' assembly on climate change. These ridiculous policies show the flawed judgment that those opposite have and what errors they are capable of making. They show the ridiculous decisions this government wants to put in place. That is why we cannot just sign a blank cheque and accept the 'trust us' approach of this government. We cannot go along with the approach of 'We'll fill in the blanks later when it comes to the regulations and methodologies that apply under this legislation,' because the judgment of this government is flawed, and it has been proven time and time again that when it comes to the crunch it gets these things wrong. And the consequences of getting this wrong will be too great. 


We have just had a debate about matters of permanence during the committee stage, and that highlighted the fact that projects undertaken in the scheme will, in instances, be subject to 100-year time lines. It is not often in this place that we debate 100-year projects. It is not often we look at things with consequences that will stretch so far into the future. That is why we need to make sure that we get every aspect of this right. Should the government get it wrong, the conse­quences—consequences to access to land for agricultural production; consequences to water rights, water access and water availability; consequences to biodiversity management and land management; conse­quences to employment and economic activity in local communities; the conse­quences in all those areas that have been debated during a very lengthy committee stage—would be serious and have long-term implications. That is why we cannot just allow this government to go through and fill in the blanks later.


As I said at the beginning, we support efforts to encourage farmers and landowners and others to increase abatement of carbon. We would like to see, and hope, that ultimately this scheme works. We hope that is the case. We would have liked to have seen a scheme that, when we walk out of here today, we could have had 100 per cent confidence in, and we cannot have that; we do not have that. We do not know about too many aspects of this. It is the lack of that 100 per cent confidence that sees us having to vote against this scheme, with regrets. Even at the end of the debate we had during the committee stage, the final amendment that we debated and voted on addressed the review of the operation of this scheme. The government proposes that that review be undertaken by the Climate Change Authority. Senator Xenophon wisely pro­posed with the support of the opposition that instead it should be undertaken by a joint task force coopted from the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission. We felt that was the right way. Why? Because the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission are proven experts, have proven independence, have proven skills, have a long track record and enjoy the trust of legislators, the Australian community, policymakers, commentators and others. They are the people who could, of course, have ensured that we actually had a review that was comprehensive, that balanced the scientific and environmental aspects with the regulatory and efficiency aspects, and came up with advice to ensure that this scheme worked effectively in the long term.


But that sensible amendment was rejected and rejected in favour of the as yet unestablished, unproven and untested Climate Change Authority to instead under­take the review—an authority the opposition believe is part of an unnecessary $400 million new bureaucracy that the government are going to create as part of their carbon tax regime. Of course this is just more gross waste by this government in their approach to the expenditure of taxpayers' money. We think this is another example of government legislation that is based on a wrong approach by the government and another example of their flawed judgment.


In closing, let me restate that it is regrettable and disappointing that we find ourselves in this position. Had the government taken a more thorough and more diligent approach from day one, it would not have come to this. Had the government ensured that there was adequate consultation and engagement with all stakeholders from day one, it would not have come to this. Had the government provided final copies of all the regulations required by this bill for consideration throughout the process, it would not have come to this. Had the government provided certainty to those sectors such as the landfill gas sector about the methodologies that would be applied, it would not have come to this. But they have failed on all those counts. They failed to address a number of recommendations that their own senators made in the committee inquiry into this report. There has been a litany of failure and a botched process from day one by this government. We will see this bill pass—and I accept the numbers in the chamber. It will pass with our best hopes that it will work out, that it will not have adverse consequences and that it will not have perverse outcomes. Sadly, it will not pass with our confidence that all those things will occur and that is why we cannot support its final passage.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:10):  I rise to say how pleased I am that the Carbon Farming Initiative is going to pass the Senate. I wish to convey to the Senate how much so many people in rural and regional Australia are looking forward to this initiative. Recently I was in Darwin speaking with Indigenous communities and they see this as the best hope for a very long time for longstanding, permanent jobs, particularly in remote communities. The methodology for the different savanna burning regime is already underway and those communities can see there is enormous opportunity. Already people are moving into the Northern Territory and changing the manner in which they manage large areas of land. That too will provide Indigenous communities with work.


I am very pleased that the government accepted the Greens amendment to extend the carbon rights beyond exclusive native title holders to non-exclusive native title holders so that we expand the number of Indigenous people who not only will be able to get work as part of the Carbon Farming Initiative but will actually benefit as part owners or full owners of the carbon rights associated with the development of some of these projects. I have been in other parts of Australia where for years farmers have lamented that they cannot get any support for stewardship programs that they want to undertake on their own land. They want to restore degraded forest on their land. They want to be supported to plant biodiverse plantings. They want to be able to deal with feral animals and weeds. This Carbon Farming Initiative will enable them to develop projects where they can actually do those things.


I have just heard the coalition talk about a litany of failure. I am glad that Senator Birmingham is now on the record opposing this bill. He says that he hopes there will not be perverse outcomes. If it had not been for those of us in this chamber supporting this legislation, the perverse outcomes would be everywhere because the coalition moved to remove the negative list so that there would not be anything on the negative list. If you want to avoid perverse outcomes with this bill then you need the negative list in order to do it. Furthermore, the coalition are out there in rural Australia saying, 'Let's go with soil carbon.' What is their proposal for actually getting the methodology work done? Where is their regulatory authority that will impose the methodology and work out how those carbon permits, or whatever they are going to call them, and how the tonnes of carbon in the soil are going to be measured and rewarded? Who is going to measure and monitor permanence? 


The coalition do not want a climate change department. It does not want to have a regulatory authority. It has said it will abolish those. They will have no department, no regulatory authority, no monitoring and no assessment, just a lot of hot air with farmers saying: 'Look at us. We're coming to buy your soil carbon out of your landscape.' If you speak to Mr Greg Hunt from the lower house, he does not know what this is going to cost—but it will come out of the budget anyway. The coalition are going to raid the budget. Having abolished the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and having abolished the regulatory authority, they will take the money out of the budget to pay for the soil carbon so the polluters can keep on polluting. There will be no payments from the polluters; it will come out of the budget.


Once the coalition have abolished those public servants, the money will come out of the health and education funding because that is the majority area of the budget. Australians will realise that the coalition are not going to charge the polluters, that they are actually going to take it from taxpayers to pay for these things so the polluters can keep on polluting. And we have those people who stand in here and say, 'What a litany of failure.' For the last several months the Greens worked extremely hard with the government, the bureaucracy and a number of constituents from across Australia on the Carbon Farming Initiative because we wanted to make sure that we did not get perverse outcomes. That is why there is a negative list. That is why it precludes managed investment schemes. That is why it says that plantings for harvest cannot be included. I know Senator Colbeck wanted them included. Well, they are not, and for very good reason: we want to maintain permanence in the landscape. We do not want to have the next rush of managed investment schemes and people ripping off the system. What we want is long-term investment in carbon in the landscape. I can tell you that NRM groups across the country are delighted because they are now going to get money to bring their NRM plans up to a certain standard, and those NRM plans are going to be consulted when Carbon Farming Initiative projects are put into the scheme. Local communities will be able to say, 'Our NRM plan would preclude that; we need to have a discussion,' and so on.


For the last several months we have sat down and consulted with people to try to avoid the perverse outcomes. Meanwhile, the coalition have been out there saying nothing. There has been no policy development—not a policy that can stand up. There is no funding for a policy, no capacity to develop a methodology and no capacity to employ that methodology in rural and regional Australia. It is a lot of hot air. Telling people that 60 per cent of the coalition's effort in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is going to come from soil carbon when they have none of those things in place—not a methodology and not likely to have one in the foreseeable future—and the whole idea that they are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent by 2020 is a joke. It is an absolute joke in carbon terms and people know it. That is why they cannot get out and defend it. That is why every time Mr Hunt gets up to try to defend it, he gets himself into trouble because he cannot actually identify how much they are going to pay for this 60 per cent of the effort coming from soil carbon, or where the money is going to come from.


This legislation is now internally consistent, it has addressed the issue of perverse outcomes and it recognises that there are at the moment simultaneous crises—a water crisis, a climate crisis, a food security crisis and an energy crisis. This legislation recognises all those things are happening at once, and it has built in a number of ways to address those tensions so that you do not have a disproportionate level of funding for one against the others and the perverse outcomes that happened under the coalition's pushed and promoted 2020 forest plantation plan and the managed investment schemes that went with it.


Who has put the work into policy development? Who has put the work into consulting rural and regional Australia? Who has given thought to improving Australia's biodiversity outcomes at the same time as creating jobs in the regions? Who has put the thought into long-term productivity in rural and regional Australia in terms of managing the landscape for productive outcomes? It is the people who have worked on this Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill and who are putting it through here today. The people who have opposed it at every turn are still opposing it. When we get to see this rolled out in rural and regional Australia, we are going to find people standing up and saying this is a good thing. Yet, this is another one of the things that the coalition will abolish and roll back, according to them, if they ever get into government. I will be very interested to see how many people in rural and regional Australia think it will be a good thing to abolish the Carbon Farming Initiative. It will be the only source of funding available to people in rural and regional Australia to give them long-term income from the stewardship of the landscape and the enhancement of carbon in the landscape that they have been asking for for so long. 


I am really pleased to stand here today and support the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill and to make very clear to rural and regional Australia that they need to look at the detail and ask the coalition this: how are you going to deliver on your 60 per cent effort of the five per cent reduction coming from soil carbon in the absence of methodology or of monitoring or of any of the rigour that is associated with actually achieving it in the manner that you say you can? Further, it is time they went and told rural and regional Australia exactly how much is going to come out of the budget to pay for that 60 per cent effort on soil carbon, and where it is going to come from? Those are the questions that people really need to have answered.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:20):  More hypocrisy from the Greens political party—more inconsistency! To suggest that the Greens political party are looking after rural and regional Australia! I invite Senator Milne to slip down to the front of Parliament House and talk to real people from rural and regional Australia. She will see what they think about the Greens and their mates in the Labor Party in this dysfunctional govern­ment. For Senator Milne, as part of the Greens Labor alliance, to talk about where the money is coming from for some of the modest initiatives that the coalition has for the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions! Fancy the Greens political party asking those questions when they are part of a scheme that will raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the taxpayers in this carbon tax that we are about to be subjected to.


I also remind Senator Milne that it was her party that joined with the Labor Party to tax ordinary Australian men and women with a flood tax that they did not impose on BHP, Rio Tinto, Coles or Woolworths. They all got off scot-free, those huge multinational companies, thanks to the Greens and the Labor Party, while mums and dads and individual Australians, the corner butcher, the baker and the candlestick-maker had to pay the tax. Their competitors, Coles and Woolworths, did not have to do that, thanks to the Greens and the Labor Party. So the hypocrisy of the Greens to come in here and argue on carbon credits, the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill or any other bill on the grounds that the alternatives will cost taxpayers dollars is just breathtaking.


I do not want to delay the Senate on finalising this bill. As Senator Birmingham has said, the coalition supports the principle of carbon farming. In fact, it is something that we initiated in different forms in government. It is something that Greg Hunt has done a lot of work on and it is something that will be done properly. But doing it in the way of this bill, where it is left to this government to bring in regulations to fill in the gaps that there so obviously are in this legislation, is something that the coalition cannot take the risk of. This is a government saying, 'Trust us,' when we simply do not trust this government.


Why don't we trust this government? I could spend the rest of the day telling you about that, but suffice it to say that this Labor government is led by a leader who just a year ago said, 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and here we are, one year later, dealing with a whole series of bills associated with this carbon tax. Before the Senate rises at the end of the year we will be dealing with the carbon tax legislation. This is the legislation that the Labor Party and the Labor leader and the Labor deputy leader, Mr Swan, promised us, just a year ago, would not be introduced under a government that Ms Gillard led. So how can we trust them on the Carbon Farming Initiative? How can we say, 'We accept you will bring in regulations to fill in the obvious gaps,' when we cannot trust Ms Gillard with anything? A year ago the Australian public trusted her when she said, 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She broke that promise with impunity so why would anyone in Australia believe anything this government and its leader, Ms Gillard, say or promise in the future?


That is why there are thousands of people who have come here, some in front of Parliament House and some, I understand, being held in convoys—and one must get to the bottom of why this happened—not allowed into this area. Apparently the ACT government or the federal government, who deal with the surrounds of this building, would not allow them in. There are thousands of people outside of this place and thousands of people all around Canberra who have come from rural and regional Australia, Senator Milne. Why do you think they are here? Because they like paying $400 or $500—or $4,000 or $5,000 in many cases—for fuel to get here to protest against this government, a government that Senator Milne says with this legislation, with her Greens-Labor alliance, is looking after rural and regional Australia? What absolute hypocrisy! What absolute stupidity! What an absolute lack of truthfulness in saying that! Slip outside, Senator Milne! Senator Feeney, hop out the front! See what rural and regional Australia think about your govern­ment and its Greens alliance partners and you will quickly see that people are in many cases spending their last cent to get here to try and make their voice heard so that the deaf people in this government might open their ears just a little and realise what is happening.


Senator Milne said that she was in Darwin a couple of weeks ago talking to Indigenous people and that they are looking forward to all the jobs that they are going to get out of the Carbon Farming Initiative. I am not sure where Senator Milne went in Darwin or anywhere in the north but I am sure if she had walked around anywhere in the north she would have been told by Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians that their futures and their jobs have been ruined by this government's stupidity on that live cattle export ban. What is the biggest employment generator for Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, in the north of Queensland and in the north of Western Australia? It is the cattle industry. A lot of very good cattle properties are owned by Indigenous groups and they employ a lot of people. They will not be in the future because they will go out of business.


Most of the cattle owners, the cattle producers, in the north are struggling. I have heard figures like 90 per cent of cattle businesses in northern Australia being in default to their banks. This was said at a conference between the industry and bankers in Georgetown and Cobbold Gorge just last week. Ninety per cent of northern Australian cattle interests are in default to their banks as a result of Senator Ludwig's stupidity. Can you believe that? It is difficult to believe. So they are in default to the banks and the banks are not being very supportive or very understanding and a lot of people are looking at where they will be this time next year. They may well have lost everything because of a decision of this government—and Senator Milne comes in here and tells us that she and her Labor mates are looking after rural and regional Australia and that Indigenous groups in Darwin are just waiting for this carbon farming initiative bill to come into force so they can get jobs! What about the jobs that Senator Milne and the Labor Party have destroyed in the beef cattle industry in northern Australia? What about the number of jobs in Indigenous com­munities? Indigenous organisations have been destroyed by the decisions of the Labor Party-Greens alliance.


We have heard during this debate, and I thank Senator Birmingham and Senator Colbeck for so ably leading it on behalf of the coalition, stories coming out about new bureaucratic organisations to be established such as the climate change authority and I think I heard in the debate of $400 million being set aside for that. Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, with no disrespect to you or to others opposite, this is the philosophical difference between Liberals and Labor: Liberals believe that people are best placed to spend their own money; people should be encouraged to get ahead, work hard, reap the rewards of their efforts and spend them how they want to—subject of course to putting aside a bit for those in our community who are more disadvantaged than they are and who need some help; and that is fair enough. But the Labor Party and the Greens, and all socialist parties the world over, believe that government, Big Brother, knows better what to do with your money. 'Don't you spend it on that car. We'll tell you what car you can buy. Give us your money and we will spend it for you.'



Government senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  A market solution? A tax of billions and billions of dollars is a market solution?



Government senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And, I might say, it will make absolutely no impact whatsoever on the changing climate of the world. We were told all of these taxes are going to reduce Australia's emissions by five per cent, yet the figures in the government's own documents show that we are actually going to be emitting more tonnes of carbon at the end of the five years than we are now. We are introducing this enormous tax on everybody, increasing everybody's costs of living, making Australia uncompetitive so that we are sending workers' jobs over to Asia and to places where there is no carbon tax. 



Government senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Hang on. We will get there. They are your figures. Have a look at your documents. You are imposing this tax on everyone, and at the end of the period, by 2020, the amount of carbon emissions will have increased. That is in your document. That is in the document that your Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the Treasury have modelled. They have put out the figures. They are out there. You are increasing the output and putting a huge tax on everybody. 


It has little to do with climate change. You know, with Australia emitting less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, that reducing them by even five per cent, if you were to get there, is going to make absolutely no difference whatsoever. I challenge you: tell me how five per cent of 1.4 per cent is going to make one iota of difference. After going around and warning everyone in Australia that they should not be going near the seashore because the tide is going to rise and their houses will be inundated, what does Professor Flannery, your very highly paid person personally selected to lead the Climate Commission, do with the $180,000 you people are giving him for two days work a week? He buys some property right on the banks of the Hawkesbury River in one of the wealthiest areas of Australia. Great socialists! Great for the workers! Great for the underprivileged! Give Professor Flannery $180,000 a year for two days work a week and tell everybody: 'Don't buy near the water.' If you were a conspiracy theorist you might almost think: 'Why would you tell other people not to buy and then slip into the market when it falls because of the climate change boss's warnings on tidal increases?' Nobody else would want to buy those properties, would they? They would be inundated by the water! But suddenly Professor Flannery does not mind taking that little bit of risk. I think he said he will have moved on by the time the tide comes in and takes his house. But, come on—let's get serious about all this. We are going to set up this new Climate Change Authority—another $400 million.


The other thing I have to tell you, sitting opposite—and I mean no disrespect in this, either—is that when I look around I note everyone on this side of the chamber has worked in their own business. If you did not work you did not get a cheque at the end of the year. In your business, if you spent more than you earned and then you borrowed from the bank, the bank interest plus the repayments eventually caught up with you if you kept borrowing. There is a difference, with respect. It is no reflection on the fact that for all of your senators their whole life's work experience has been working for the Labor Party, working for the unions or working for another politician. The cheque comes in at the end of the month; it does not matter whether you work hard or you do not work hard. And if you have a problem in government you say, 'Let's just spend another $400 million and set up another bureaucracy.' If I did that in my business, if I said, 'Things are going bad. I think I'll spend'—in proportion—'a couple of hundred thousand dollars to set up a new element of my agency', where was I going to get that money from? Hey, if I borrow that I have to pay it back. But the Labor government just spends another $400 million. Where do you get it from? You write out a cheque to the Treasury and when the Treasury runs a bit dry you just put on another tax like the carbon tax. 


Money means nothing. It is so easy to spend other people's money. It is so easy to spend money when you never have to be responsible for paying it back. Whenever my colleagues and I borrowed money we actually had to pay it back. That is why we understand what thrift is about. We understand that you just cannot keep borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending—because in my business I eventually had to pay it back. But, in government business, the Labor Party just borrows, spends, borrows, spends, borrows, spends. Somebody will pay for it—the poor old mug taxpayer. As they did in the Whitlam and Keating days, the Labor Party will run up debt. In those days we used to think it was outrageous—$96 billion of debt. They did not care. They knew that the Liberals would eventually come along and pay off the debt, pay off the $96 billion, and put the Treasury in credit to the extent of—what was it?—$60 billion. The Liberals left the incoming Labor government with a $60 billion surplus, having paid off the previous Labor government's $97 billion deficit. We go a couple of years into it, and the Labor Party has wasted the $60 billion we set aside in surplus and they have run up—what?—$120 billion extra in debt. Have a look at Greece. Have a look at Portugal. Have a look at Spain. Have a look at Ireland. Senator, give it long enough and that is where your government will have Australia. Those socialist governments who did not understand the value of money would, if there was a problem, just throw money at it. They would borrow the money. Someone else will provide it. The Greeks are now finding out that they have got to pay it back some day.


Labor are lucky because they know that at the next election the Liberals will be back in power. They know that we will be prudent and fiscally responsible. They know we will pay back all of their debt. It is going to cost us both in money and in political terms because we have to take the razor out and slash their extravagance. I can assure them—and it is not my area of the coalition to be making these commitments on the run, but I will have a fairly good bet—the Climate Commission, the Climate Change Authority and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency will be the first to go. There is a saving of a billion dollars over a few years.



An opposition senator:  $70 million.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That is a fairly good start, and I have identified it without any research! I have identified that in 30 seconds. It is going to be so easy to get rid of the waste, duplication, bureaucracy, red tape and regulation of your government, Senator, whilst, at the same time, looking after those people who cannot look after themselves. We will be spending our money on the defence of the country and disadvantaged people who need our help. We will be spending it on them. We will not be spending it on public service edifices like the ones that you have. The Climate Change Authority and the climate change depart­ment—that is just for a start. Good heavens! Sit me down with a pencil and paper for 10 minutes and I will give you a list of wasteful things. For example, we will not be spending $14 billion on putting in pink batts and then paying another $14 billion on removing them. There is a start. They are the sorts of things that a prudent, fiscally responsible government would do.


I have been deflected from my discussion on the carbon farming initiative bill by the interjections. Suffice it to say, as Senator Birmingham has clearly pointed out, we like the principle but the legislation is too open-ended and it has too many holes in it. There is also the fact that trusting this government to do anything is too high a risk, and we are not going to do that.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (13:40):  I too have watched with great interest as the debate on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 has moved from committee and now to third reading. I can assure you, Madam Acting President, there are no two countries watching this outcome more carefully or closely than China and India. They do so because they have absolutely vested interests—their vested interests being that both of them are running out of coal and both of them see Australia as a very, very successful and long-term supplier of the best quality coal in the world. From a carbon farming point of view, I think they would be looking at farming Australia for its product, and that is the coal. We saw only recently in India that one of its greatest concerns is its capacity to see its industries progress and to bring its populace from a lower socioeconomic to a middle-class level, and the way to do that is through the supply of power. I will come back to that from Australia's point of view, because we have been there.


What did we see just recently when the carbon tax was first announced? We saw the giant American company Peabody and none other than the largest steel manufacturer in the world, Mittal Steel, immediately leap in to purchase Macarthur Coal. This was parroted and trumpeted as being a great vindication of the carbon tax decision of this government. Of course, the truth lies elsewhere. The truth lies in the fact that Macarthur is already exporting the vast majority, if not all, of its coal. What might be the reason for Mittal and Peabody to want to jump in and buy Macarthur at a premium price?


Madam Acting Deputy President, time does not allow me to share with you my 10 years of experience of doing business in India and there would not be enough tissues or handkerchiefs in the chamber at the end of my presentation. So I will confine myself to the fact that, if Mr Mittal, the world's largest steel maker, wants to buy Macarthur Coal for a premium price, we had better believe that he has a very good reason to do so. His reason to do so is the statement by the current government that there will be a phasing out of coal powered electricity generation in this country. Therefore, where might be the opposition of the Foreign Investment Review Board or anybody else for that matter into the future for these companies to continue escalating the mining and exporting of our coal to those countries. There will be none.


One must then, of course, examine from a global perspective the morality of the question of why we would be making initiatives, with our little 1.5 per cent of the world's carbon, to reduce and cease the generation of power from coal whilst opening the floodgates so that the two giant countries of China and India can be unfettered in taking more and more of our coal to use in their coal fired generators to generate electricity for their communities. At the same time, this will be adding to the world's now demonised carbon dioxide. Where is the benefit of a little 1.5 per cent country stopping its generation of power from coal whilst accelerating the sale of its coal to other countries so that they can add to the world's carbon dioxide is absolutely and utterly beyond me.


To come back to my point about India: the Indians have always got a very good reason for doing anything. In fact, in my 10 years of doing business in India, I cannot recall anyone ever offering us a premium over and above what we actually undertook to do work for. I must put on record the fact that, as a small Western Australian IT company in the oil and gas industry, we are unique in our success in being able to deliver on the projects we did for Indian government companies. It did not, however, translate into us ever being paid in a timely fashion. So I am intrigued when I see Mittal Steel offering a premium for that particular activity.


But I go to a question that I have posed to young people when they have come into my office in recent times, remonstrating with me and asking me why we are not on board with this question, and I pose this question to anybody: how is it that our population of 23 million, in a landmass the size of the United States of America, is at the stage of per capita wealth that it is when compared with other countries, compared with high-popu­lation countries without a large landmass and compared with the United States of America, which is equal in landmass but with 10 times the number of people? Has anybody ever addressed themselves to that question in this debate? Has it been high iron ore prices? Of course it has not. It has been in only the last seven or eight years that we have seen an elevation in iron ore prices. Has it been gold? No; we are a reasonable producer of gold. What about grain? The United Kingdom produces more wheat than Australia does. We might be a large exporter of wheat in relation to what we produce but in terms of our production, one or two tonnes to the hectare for wheat production is a good figure in my state of Western Australia. If you did not get nine or 10 tonnes to the hectare in the United Kingdom and in Europe you would be regarded as a non-grower. Therefore, is it wool? Well, it once was wool. We grew on the sheep's back. But it is a long, long time since we grew on the sheep's back.


So I come back to the question in all seriousness and I ask: how is it that this small country in terms of population but with a massive landmass is so wealthy per capita? Two words: cheap energy. Cheap energy generated from coal is the one economic benefit that this little country down in the bottom right-hand corner of the world has. We have always had cheap energy from the generation of power from coal. But what are we trying to do? We are trying to diminish and stop the great economic benefit this country has always had. We are trying to pass that benefit on to countries that would dearly love our coal reserves and are willing to pay for them at a discounted price because they know that, should this tax be successful, should this government be successful in its drive, there will not be any imposition, unlike gas, for example, where our government says, 'You must keep some gas for domestic consumption but you can export the rest.' We now have a government that is saying: 'We don't want our coal. You are free to dig it out of the ground and put it on ships and sell it.' I ask the question again: why is it in this so-called smart country that we are digging up our iron ore and selling our coal so that other countries, particularly China but increasingly India, and one day Africa, will be able to turn our iron ore into steel, using our coal, and sell it back as a value-added product and we have no interest in that coal?


What are we doing to the economic benefit that for the last three or four generations has presented us in this country with the standard of living that we enjoy, with the capacity to help other nations and with the capacity to provide the sorts of social security underpinnings and umbrellas that we do for so many people in Australia? Why is it that we are such an attractive country? It is because we currently have cheap energy.


Look at the alternatives. Do we want to see alternative renewable sources? Of course we want to see alternative renewables. I say with some small degree of pride that I was running an island off the coast of Perth when wind generators were first introduced in Western Australia and someone said, 'There are four or five different products; let's put them all in the one place where the wind blows.' So all four of them were put there, and I had the undeniable pleasure of overseeing their management. The first two were eggbeaters, and they failed immediately. The third was the type of wind generator that we see now; its blades fell off and it never, ever generated power. The fourth one had exactly the same challenges we are seeing today—that is, when the wind blew we could actually collect some power from it, but at the times we needed it, lo and behold, the wind never blew. The other interesting thing, which has a similarity today—although this was in the early 1990s—was that, to be able to take this power on board from this renewable source from wind power, we had to turn our generators down to a level of inefficiency, where the efficiency lost exceeded the benefit of the actual wind turbine. It had its conclusion when a tourist bus with 35 overseas visitors was going past and one of the blades sheared off in a high wind and landed 200 metres in front of the bus. That was when I said to the renewable energy group within Western Power at the time, 'Just take it away.' So I do have some affinity with wind power.


Whilst that was a distraction, the point I want to make is that it will be a long time before renewables will ever replace the baseload demand for electricity generation. Having been a party to it, however small the island was—it is just a microcosm of the big one to the east of it—you still had to have your baseload generating capacity. You cannot say to the households and businesses: 'I'm sorry, all of the meat in the freezer has been spoiled because the wind didn't blow,' or the sun did not shine or we could not store the power.


I for one am very keen to see Australia continue particularly in the storage technology and long-distance transmission. Those are the two areas where Australia should make a contribution to global conditions. It is not digging coal out of the ground and sending it to China and to India, where they themselves will use our coal to take advantage and try to simulate what we did by way of cheap energy. Our contri­bution is to use our research and development skills to address those two issues: (1) the efficient long-distance transmission of generated power and, (2), storage. Until we get on top of those two, the contribution by renewables will not be great. What are we doing in this move that we are contemplating and debating in this chamber? It has been said before, and I am sure it will be said again before the debate is finished, that the first outcome will be to hamstring Australian industry and Australian business as they try to compete with overseas competitors upon whom no tax is placed. All of a sudden, if we are exporting, we are at a disadvantage with our competitors. If competitors are importing, they have an advantage because they do not have this particular impost. We threaten the jobs of Australian workers. I do not need to dwell on that because we see so much evidence of it here at the moment.


We place insurmountable hurdles on Australian farmers. Why Australian farmers? Because, as I alluded to a moment ago, we are such a big exporter of what we produce, especially in my state of WA. Here in the Eastern States you consume somewhere between 50 and 60 per cent of the grain that you produce. My colleague Senator Williams would have those figures immediately. We in WA export 95 per cent of the grain. We cannot pass those costs on. Fertiliser costs, insurance costs, transport costs: all of these go up but the farmer cannot pass them on. They are insurmountable challenges.


We place at risk the financial security of those depending on superannuation insurance—pensioners, self-funded retirees, indeed everybody who is in the super­annuation insurance industry, and that is all of us. Why? Because we have a preference in Australia to actually invest in our own companies and our own businesses. In that particular case where we see these businesses placed at a disadvantage, we must inevitably see their economic wellbeing disturbed.


The other problem is commodity prices for our own consumers. We know very well that we are going to see electricity prices driven up even higher. Every state Premier has said this. Labor's Premier Bligh has said it. Premier Barnett has been saying so. Premier Baillieu and the Premier of New South Wales have said the same thing in this area. We have a circumstance in which there are no winners yet. Industry does not win. Employees do not win. Business does not win. Pensioners do not win. Self-funded retirees do not win. I want to reflect particularly on the future generations. As I alluded to earlier, it has been cheap energy that has made this country great. The intention, as I see it, is to remove the legacy that we have enjoyed and that our parents enjoyed. We are going to fail to pass it on to the next generation.


Whilst I was in East Timor recently I was asked by a young military officer, 'What is the impact of all this carbon tax and carbon farming?' There was a beautiful spray of flowers in the airport lounge, so I said to her: 'Imagine you are a producer and an exporter of Australian wildflowers. You have a wonderful business going. You have plenty of employees and plenty of contractors. All of a sudden, for whatever reason, a govern­ment imposes a tax on you to make your flowers less competitive. You are an exporter of wildflowers; therefore your competitors overseas have a free kick. Those competitors bring their product into Australia. All of a sudden they are at a price advantage to you. What do you do as this flower producer? You take jobs offshore and lose jobs in Australia, you close your business or you go into bankruptcy.' None of those activities are of any value to this country.


Worse than that in the flower analogy is the fact that overseas competitors then come to see our product and they start to say, 'If Australia is not providing it anymore, what might be the case for me?' We have seen this in horticulture with Israel. Sometime in the past they found that their production of our wildflowers exceeded our own capacity to produce wildflowers, so they became a net exporter of our product in competition with us. There is absolutely and utterly no validity to this activity. This carbon tax initiative as it is being presented to us will not work and for that reason I am pleased to make this contribution to the debate.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (13:57):  I just want to add a few comments to the end of this debate about this piece of legislation and its effectiveness. Senator Milne made some quite spurious claims about coalition policy and coalition intention in relation to this piece of legislation, even to the extent of making up suggestions about what amend­ments we may or may not have moved, which shows how poorly she has followed the debate in this place. She made allegations about one amendment that we were supposed to have moved, but we did not actually move it. That just gives a demonstration of how poorly the Greens are actually following this debate. They would rather be out spreading their prejudice against some of Australia's wonderful industries.


Right from the outset the opposition has expressed concerns about the design of this legislation and the way that it will effectively work, or more importantly effectively will not work. That is one of the major things I see will be a result of passing this legislation. I am genuinely concerned that the govern­ment and the Greens are raising expectations in the community. We heard Senator Milne talking about the huge opportunities, the bonanza, that might flow from the passing of this legislation. I would caution her against making such broad claims because one thing that we do know is that the regulations that sit around this piece of legislation can be quite restrictive, even to the extent that the National Farmers Federation said as part of their submission that you cannot grow a shelter belt. If you want to put in a windbreak, because it is common practice, it does not fit within the regulations. Some of the things that Senator Milne was talking about, such as savanna burning, may not fit within the process, depending on how it is done, because it is common practice.


The issues around additionality and common practice are very important elements that the coalition were concerned about with this legislation, bearing in mind that we, as Senator Milne correctly said, support the concept of sequestering carbon dioxide in our natural environment. That is an important part of our policy. But we are really concerned about the design of the legislation. We do not believe that it will actually sequester much CO2 at all. In fact it will be very lucky to have sequestered a gram of CO2 by the time we get to the next election because of the processes that still have to be gone through before we get to the stage of accepting a methodology.

There was a concern that early adopters for landfill management would be penalised. I am very grateful for the work of Senator Milne in bringing the parties together to reach a sensible compromise so that there will be certainty for early adopters. I have not had an opportunity to speak to my colleague Senator Birmingham, with whom I moved this amend­ment. If the government could indicate, firstly, that progress has been made and, secondly, that it is satisfactory to the two key stakeholders, LMS and EDL, that could be quite satisfactory.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:03):  We are picking up from the debate on Friday in relation to this amendment for the landfill gas sector. I have done one better than to speak with Senator Xenophon. I have had the fortune this morning of speaking with Evelyn Ek from his office, who from time to time provides great guidance to many of us in this place on serious issues. Let us remind ourselves that this is an amendment which Senator Xenophon and the coalition have pursued to ensure the landfill gas sector is protected from any perverse or adverse outcomes under this legislation. It is a big issue. We are talking about more than 4,500 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent gases that were recovered or destroyed in 2009 from waste in landfills. Many of those projects could be at risk or at threat of discontinuance should we get this legislation wrong or should the government get the implementation of this legislation wrong. We want to make sure that that outcome is avoided. 


I join with Senator Xenophon in thanking Senator Milne for her initial support of the issues raised and ensuring that industry was able to engage in some discussions with the government. It is equally my understanding, having spoken to some of the industry players as well as Ms Ek, that the industry has had further discussions with government, that there is an agreed pathway forward for how the methodology and the time line will be developed and the base lines that will be considered as part of that process. 


We want as many guarantees and as much information on the record as the minister is able to provide as to what the guarantees provided to industry are. I posed some questions to the minister on Thursday about how he thought he could achieve the timing that Senator Milne had alluded to and that he had alluded to in the debate on Thursday. If he could for the benefit of the chamber and the record provide us with the detail of the time line for discussions with industry and finalisation of the methodology, the approach that is going to be applied to the base line in this regard and the government's understanding of what this will mean for the existing projects, that would certainly assist us in hopefully proceeding with this debate, dealing with this amendment and, most importantly, providing certainty for early adopters and early movers who have invested significantly and done so much to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas that comes off landfill gas facilities.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:07):  People have been very busy working on this issue over the ensuing period since we last met on Thursday. I think that all within the chamber see this as an important matter that does need to be resolved.


From the government's perspective, we have released a revised draft methodology to the landfill technical working group that includes standardised baselines for GGAS and greenhouse-friendly landfill projects. Landfill companies have indicated that they support the proposed approach. That is what I indicated on Thursday—that is, going back and working through the draft methodologies and then going to the independent assessor, which, to all intents and purposes, we now refer to as DOIC, for those who are interested in acronyms. The government will continue to work with the industry to implement the methodology following its assessment by the DOIC.


Let us be clear that what we now have is a draft methodology for the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas, and the companies have indicated they support the proposed approach, which is to take the draft methodology, move it into assessment by the DOIC and, then, following that assessment, the independent assessor will make the decision in relation to it to establish those issues, including the baseline. So it effectively means that the integrity of the system is maintained and the legislation continues to provide a framework that has integrity that continues to deliver for all areas, including this one, which we have now proposed a way forward with.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:09):  I thank the minister for the information and his response. Certainly, the landfill gas sector have said to me, and I am sure they have said it to Senator Xenophon as well, that they are eager to ensure that the integrity and equity of the system is maintained, as well. But they also want to make sure that there is as much certainty for them as possible.


I pose two areas of questioning, first in relation to the draft methodology that is being finalised and will be presented to the DOIC. Is there an understanding of how that will approach the baseline figures and, if so, how is it going to approach those? Are you able to inform the chamber of that? If you are not able to inform the chamber perhaps you could tell us why you are unable to do so. Secondly—this is a matter I raised on Thursday—in regard to timing I understand that there is an expectation that the finalisation of the independent assessment should all be done within the space of about a month. I think you, Minister, alluded to that on Thursday. Is that your understanding? Perhaps to educate me, if not anybody else, could you inform the Senate how it is possible that that timeline is going to be met in such a short period of time. Is the DOIC already operational, notwithstanding the fact that it appears to have its rules and mandate laid out within this legislation? Is there a process already underway to ensure that those timelines to provide certainty can in fact be met?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:12):  Dealing with the timeline, we do expect it to be dealt with in the one month. Why? Because the govern­ment has established an interim process—that is, the DOIC—that is in place. One of the issues you raised last Thursday was that you imagined—hypothetically—that it would take a lot longer. What I did not have an opportunity to tell you at the time was that there is in fact a DOIC in place. So, all of the work that you, hypothetically, envisaged had to be done is done. There is an interim DOIC in place and the draft methodology has been prepared and is ready for the interim DOIC to assess in a very short space of time. So all of that work is in train and can be done in a matter of a very short space of time—less than a month, I am advised, and probably sooner, depending of course on people's work commitments. But it is expected within that period and that is why we were confident in making that original assessment.


The draft methodology includes a standardised baseline of 30 per cent of projects transitioning from GGAS and zero for projects transitioning from greenhouse-friendly. In addition to that the draft methodology contains the baselines for both GGAS and for greenhouse-friendly projects as well. This means it is now likely to go to the interim DOIC within the month. Therefore, depending on how long the interim DOIC takes, we do not expect it to take particularly long. We are confident that the landfill sector can have confidence in the process.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:14):  I appreciate the minister's explanation and response to those two questions. I have one just one subse­quent question that flows from the minister outlining the establishment of the interim DOIC and the manner in which the interim DOIC will work. When this legisla­tion is enacted and the permanent DOIC is established, as against the interim DOIC, will that permanent body equally have to review all of the determinations of metho­dologies that the interim body has ticked off? If so, what guarantees are there for industries which think they have certainty once it has been ticked off by an interim body that the permanent body may not undo that? Is it expected that the memberships of the two will be consistent, or what guarantees are there? Obviously the minister is turning to a page of the bill which may well address that very question. Could the minister make sure for the benefit of completeness on the record and certainty for this industry sector, given the government's commitments, that this is dealt with as quickly as possibly—certainly in less than a month, which is important to the industry—so that the industry does not see serious negative financial consequences? What certainty or guarantee is there for them as this issue progresses beyond the interim stage and into the permanent stage?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:16):  Yes, you have correctly identified the bill in my hand. At 131, 'Transitional—pre-commencement application for endorsement of proposal' the bill contemplated that there would be an interim DOIC in place and how we would then deal with transitional arrangements. Effectively that section means that a person applies to the interim offsets integrity committee for the endorsement of a proposal or a methodology determination and the committee either endorses the proposal or refuses to endorse the proposal—avoid doubt. Then 132 deals with pre-commence­ment endorsement of proposal and indicates how each is to be effectively dealt with. Then, as you are aware, the methodologies are disallowable instruments. So once they are set in train, the short answer is that they are flipped over into the new DOIC as methodologies that will be picked up—that is the easiest way to explain it. That allows all of that work to commence prior to the establishment of the permanent DOIC and to be utilised and continue in operation.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:17):  Minister, thank you for humouring me and ensuring that all of that detail is clearly on the record. I want to indicate that, following discussions with Senator Xenophon, it is our intention to withdraw this amendment. Having spoken to the industry sectors involved and having got the information on the record from the minister this morning, we are of the belief that the government is intending to do the right thing by this industry. I want to make it clear once again that the last thing we want to see is a perverse outcome where projects that were early movers in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions are somehow penalised, where projects that were early movers are facing a situation of financial disadvantage or where projects that were early movers in fact close down and we have the perverse situation that a bill designed to encourage further abatement and new abatement activities has the consequence of causing early abatement activities to cease to operate. 


The industry is taking the government at their word that this process will avoid that outcome and will provide appropriate certainty for the sector. I hope that is the case. We are placing that trust in the government rather than the chamber seeking to exercise its will. We are placing that trust in the process of this legislation. We hope that that trust is not ultimately proven to be misplaced. Once again, we emphasise that this was an issue highlighted by the Senate inquiry. It is a shame that it has taken until this last moment of the legislative debate to solidify a pathway forward on it to ensure that there is some level of certainty for the sector. Hopefully, this is the end of the uncertainty and that they are able to proceed within the month knowing exactly where they stand. Hopefully, that will ensure that the projects, especially the many regional projects in the landfill gas sector, are able to continue and to be supported by this scheme, just as they were previously under a greenhouse-friendly arrangement or the New South Wales government's GGAS scheme. 


I again place on the record my thanks to Senator Xenophon for his work with the coalition on this matter, to industry for making sure that we all had this matter brought to our attention and to the Greens and the government for trying to come up with an appropriate resolution. We hope that this resolution sticks and works for the benefit of industry. We will certainly be watching very closely from here.


I seek leave to withdraw the amendments.


Leave granted.

(3)   Clause 56, page 81 (line 19), after ""Act"", insert ""and subject to subsection (1A)"".


(4)   Clause 56, page 81 (after line 21), after subclause (1), insert:


(1A)   Notwithstanding subsection (1), if a project:


   (a)   was established as, or as part of, a managed investment scheme; or


   (b)   is determined by the Minister, on the advice of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to have an adverse impact on:


      (i)   the availability of water; or


      (ii)   land and resource access for agricultural production;


the project is deemed to be an excluded offsets project.


(1B)   A determination under paragraph (1A)(b) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.


(1C)   In this section:



managed investment scheme has the same meaning as in section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001.


I remind my colleagues that the position with this is that the government was to provide details of the risk management principles and guidelines. I am grateful to the government for providing those. This is AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management—Principles and guidelines. My question to the government is that, on the face of looking at these risk management guidelines, I do not understand how it will work in the context of this amendment, which relates to the negative list, and setting out criteria for a project that will have an adverse impact on the availability of water or on agricultural production. How does the government envisage that these guidelines, which, with annexures, run into some 23 pages, will work? For instance, on page 17, item 5.4.2, which is headed 'Risk identification', states:


The organization should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events (including changes in circumstances) and their causes and their potential consequences.


I have a genuine question. What on earth does that mean in the context of how the government proposes these risk management guidelines will operate?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  I think we are in fact all in screaming agreement. What you are proposing concerns doing it project by project, which would create unnecessary work and would, I think, also slow the process down and create a logjam. We are proposing types of projects. The reason we use that is so that you can characterise them all within a group and in doing so allow those types to be proceeded with in the process of maintaining the integrity of the process—that is, the ability for methodolo­gies to come forward and be independently assessed and then put in place.


The real difference between us here is between projects and types of projects. The reason we use the ISO code is that it allows DOIC to have a way for everyone to understand that the way they do their assessment is in accordance with accepted practice—that is, ISO guidelines. This means that there is integrity in the system and that integrity is underpinned by the independence of the DOIC, as well. All of this means that projects that come forward will be assessed with methodologies under the type they fit within. So there is a broad ability for people interested in particular types of projects to know that they have got certainty. Using as an example the one we have just been talking about—the draft methodology for the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas—the draft methodology is broader than an individual project. It is the type that fits within it, the type being the capture and combustion of methane in landfill gas. That is the breadth of it. It then provides the draft methodologies we would use and the issues that we have been talking about, including how it would apply. But it is not an individual project. It is not one company saying, 'Here is one landfill. This is the project we want.' This means that all of those firms that deal with the combustion of methane in landfill gas have certainty that once that methodology is independently assessed and approved by DOIC any similar project coming forward will fit within that framework. Therefore they have certainty. They also then have the ability to utilise the scheme and they do not have to come up, as individual projects, and go through the whole issue again, which would cause both unnecessary cost and delays.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:28):  Perhaps we could look at it in another way, and I appreciate the spirit in which the minister answered the question. I think the issue is this—and this is a question I posed on 16 August in this place—how will it be assessed whether a project reduces the production of a particular type of food or grain in a particular area? How does the government take these matters into account? The government is saying that they agree that these are important matters, but that this is not the way to do it. The government is saying, 'Don't assess this on an individual basis.' But I ask for an assurance about how the methodology would work in individual cases. In other words, it seems to me that the risk management process would be irrelevant. I am still not sure how it would apply and that is why I will still maintain this amendment.


I am not sure what the coalition's point of view is in respect of this amendment. But I would have thought that if there is a clear statement of principle in the legislation that if there were to be an adverse impact on the use of water and on fruit production that would place it clearly in the negative list. I do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily. If the government could explain what assurances they can give in the context of these risk management guidelines about how the methodologies would be individually assessed and what level of transparency and scrutiny there will be, then I guess we can get on and vote on this particular amendment. I am concerned that we are not giving the priority that is required to water security and food production.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:30):  Perhaps you will forgive me for using an example. One type of weed in one paddock might be a threat to food production. One project is to eliminate that weed in that paddock. It may or may not be a threat to food production. It may be specifi­cally a threat to that farm's food production, but when you look broadly at all the arable land, if that weed is only in that one paddock, it is not a threat because it is one weed in one paddock. If you aggregate that you can say: 'This weed in many paddocks across all the arable land might be a material risk. Therefore we need to address it.' I am trying to describe that what you are talking about, as I understand it, is individuals, whereas I am talking about types—a type of weed aggregated across. In other words, that is the only way you can assess whether or not it has an impact. That is a poor way of trying to make it concrete.


The challenge always is that—forgive this analogy—if you look within the weeds, you will not see the bigger picture. The bigger picture is the aggregation across this area. That is why we use types. A type of weed may not be a material risk to food production, but the aggregation of that—in other words, a significant number—then may be. I am trying to use a different way of explaining it to you to give you some confidence that this is the way forward, not the way that you have sought to put in your amendment. I am trying to show why we have chosen the path that we have chosen, why we have confidence in the way the negative list will work and why you cannot use individual circumstances. Each of them on their own may not actually amount to a material risk, whereas if you aggregate it and look at the type it may in fact do that. I will pause there and see if we can progress it.

 (South Australia) (10:32):  I think it boils down to this: there are different paths to achieve this. I think the path that I have suggested in this amendment is a clearer, unambiguous path. I appreciate what the government is saying. I feel more comfortable with the amendment. My concern is that the way the process will operate may be subject to a number of ambiguities and uncertainties where we will end up with certain projects being approved where there is an overall adverse impact on water security and food production. I understand it is a question of approach and which path will be more effective. I think there ought to be a legislative approach. I am not certain what the opposition's view is in relation to this. That may determine whether we have a division in relation to this or not. If this amendment fails, as appears likely, I am sure that there will be ongoing scrutiny of the methodology and of how the risk management principles are used. Again, it is a question of different paths presumably to reach the same objective. I believe the objective could be reached more easily with an unambiguous approach such as the one set out in this amendment.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:34):  In the earlier debate on this amendment before we postponed it, I indicated that the opposition is sympathetic to the issues that Senator Xenophon is attempting to address with this amendment and that we are inclined to support this amendment. That position has not changed in the days that have followed or as a result of the advice that the minister has given. I understand the point the minister is attempt­ing to make in terms of the differentiation between kinds or types of projects and broad criteria and the potential of this amendment to capture and require analysis of specific projects. However, the types of projects that are likely to flow from this bill are of course going to have very specific effects and impacts in very different areas as they are applied right across the country, especially when it comes to water availability or agricultural production. We spent quite a period of time debating another amendment that had been championed by the opposition in relation to providing some security over land access for agricultural production. We think that in this regard it is important that we do not allow a system where loopholes in broader regulations can be exploited by specific projects. Whether they are exploited deliberately or otherwise, the potential is there for these specific projects to potentially have an adverse impact on water or agricultural production even under the type of regulations that the government is proposing under the existing section. Indeed, we have seen it in those draft regulations and in the earlier debates on the amendment about land access for agricultural production. I expressed quite strongly and passionately at that stage the concern that the government appeared to be treating land access for agricultural production as a side issue. The government appeared to not take into account the amendment that has now been made to insert new subclause 56(2)(e) to provide for consideration of land access for agricultural production. The government appeared to have no intention to revise the regulations relating to the negative list to reflect any guidelines in that regard.


I understand that there are challenges in preparing guidelines for that such as: what is your prime agricultural land and how do you go about defining it? These are issues the minister has to tackle in a number of different areas. But in this regard we think there is value in Senator Xenophon's amendments, which provide the potential for some case-by-case scrutiny and provide the potential for projects that may sneak through the types of project regulations to be addressed under a specific project-by-project regulatory approach.


To that end, we are supportive of these amendments. They may not be perfect. The challenge with any legislation is whether or not we can make it perfect. However, as is so often the case—and will probably be the case with this bill—I am sure that, whether this amendment passes or otherwise, the bill will be back before us in a year or two so we can tidy up things that have problems in the way they operate. If this clause were to have such problems then I am sure it will be addressed equally. It is possible that by not passing this clause, we will find in a couple of years that we are back, perhaps inserting something like this to provide greater discretion and greater powers to the minister to disallow certain projects or put them on the negative list.


I think it is important for the government to take this matter seriously. As I said, I understand the arguments the minister has made. But we think, as Senator Xenophon has outlined, that there is a continuing risk at the end of this process that if the bill passes in its current form we may see projects proceed that have an adverse impact on water availability, or we may see projects proceed that have an adverse impact on agricultural production. They may be one-off projects, but those one-offs add up to create a problem. It is that type of adverse impact and inadvertent consequence of a bill like this that we want to make sure is avoided. That is why we are inclined to support and will be supporting these amendments. 


We urge the government, if these amendments fail, to once again take a good look at the regulations it is proposing, to once again take a good look at that draft and, particularly, to once again revise that draft with regard to the new clause, 56(2)(e), which was inserted the other day; it does at least provide for some consideration of any adverse impact in regard to land access for agricultural production. I urge the govern­ment to take a look at that again and be particularly mindful of what the stakeholders have to say during consultation on this. I am accepting the likely political reality that this amendment will fail, but I hope the govern­ment at least takes into consideration the principles that this amendment is seeking to pursue. If it will not do that, then I urge the government to make the regulations for the negative list as tough and as stringent as possible. That is what is absolutely important—to make sure that the credibility of this system and the credibility of the assurances the government has given to farmers and to all those stakeholders in the industry stack up and are seen through. With that, I again thank Senator Xenophon for proposing these amendments and once again indicate the opposition's intention to support them.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:42):  As Senator Birmingham said, the opposition support amendment (3) and (4), proposed by Senator Xenophon. I will come back and say a couple of words about the amendments, but before I do that I want to raise a couple of issues that came up in this debate last Wednesday, I think it was.


I must say, Senator Ludwig is an important person! I have just been out to the rally at the front of Parliament House, and his name is being mentioned quite a lot out there. I might also say, though, that his name is not being mentioned very favourably. A lot of the people out there are the sorts of people who are now in desperate straits because of the government's bungling of the live cattle exports issue. I suspect that some of these people have spent their last pennies to come down and make their views known here in Canberra.


It is very sobering, and quite moving and emotional, to see all these people, some of whom have driven trucks 2½ to 3,000 kilometres. One of the speakers was just saying to the crowd that he gets about two kilometres to the litre of fuel in one of his big trucks. You can imagine what it has cost him to come 2½ thousand kilometres—money he does not have. He is from the north west. The whole of the north of Australia—rural Northern Australia—are struggling because of the live cattle ban. They are in absolutely desperate straits. We are going to see the bankruptcies come in the not-too-distant future. These people are making a last-ditch effort to try and make their government listen on things like live cattle exports and, more importantly, on things like the carbon tax. Out there, there are a lot of trucks, a lot of truckies. If Senator Sterle were in the chamber he would agree with me on this. There are people who understand that their livelihoods are about to be destroyed by the carbon tax brought in by this government whose leader promised us just a year ago that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. And here we are a year later with these people. 


It is quite emotional to be out there. They are making a last-ditch effort to come down and try and make people in this building, this government, understand just how they are hurting and how the decisions of this government have impacted so badly on ordinary Australians. I would hope, Minister, that you would have the courage and perhaps the time to go out and speak with these people, because the more you interacted with them the more you would understand the hurt that you have caused by a stupid decision, a poorly thought-through decision made on the balance of what you thought was a political opinion from GetUp! and the left-wing parties around the world. Your original decision was correct, Minister, but why you changed we in this parliament know: because you were done over by the left of your party and the Greens and the GetUp! group and some of the unions.


But I have distracted myself from the debate before the chamber. On Wednesday, Minister, I was making a plea again on behalf of some northern agricultural people. I was asking you about the banana industry, which your carbon tax will have a very heavy impact upon because they use a lot of electricity in their coldrooms and ripening rooms and they use a lot of fuel in bringing bananas, a bulky product, from Tully down to Sydney and Melbourne. I was saying that they are really getting it in the neck. I asked you, you might recall, whether this Carbon Farming Initiative that we are debating would perhaps give them something back. You assured me, yes, it will be good for them.


Coincidentally, a couple of banana growers, in fact a couple of horticulture growers, from my state of Queensland—and your state of Queensland too, of course—have been in touch with me and they say that this Carbon Farming Initiative is not going to help the horticultural industry one iota. They rightly point out that if you have a banana farm of 100 hectares, to take 20 per cent of that farm and put on trees for under the Carbon Farming Initiative will mean that that is 20 per cent fewer bananas they can grow and so their income would fall by far more than they might ever achieve from this Carbon Farming Initiative bill and the good things that are supposed to come from it. I am a bit naive. I said: 'But if you are growing banana trees, isn't that like growing trees? Won't that help, won't that qualify?' I am told no, that banana trees are business as usual and if you are growing things in a business as usual style you will not be able to take advantage of anything this bill might make available to you. So the information you gave me on Wednesday is quite wrong, unless some of the facts that I have mentioned are not correct, in which case I am sure you would take the opportunity of the debate today to tell me that the banana industry can in fact get some positive outcome from this Carbon Farming Initiative.


Also on Wednesday I asked you about whether all of those graziers, those cattle owners up in the north of Australia, many of them Indigenous people, I might say, Indigenous enterprises, might be able to get some advantage from this Carbon Farming Initiative. That is problematic as well. I am told by some of the people I was speaking to earlier today that a lot of them could reduce some of their costs in their cattle farming operations if they were able to plant some sorghum, some silage crops, and feed their cattle. But as you know, Minister, thanks to your Labor Party colleagues in the Queensland state government, you cannot chop a tree down. I know you, Madam Acting Deputy President, have been up that way and have seen trees everywhere across the north of Australia. They are not allowed to chop one of them down. So the opportunity of reducing their costs to try and make their industries a bit more viable is taken away from them.


I have just mentioned a couple of things, but if you walk outside there are about 5,000 people outside trying to make your government understand the hurt that is being imposed upon the people of rural and regional and remote Australia. I do hope you are able to spend some time with those people today, Minister. I thought you were fairly courageous in going to Mount Isa to address angry farmers not long after you made those silly decisions. I am told from people who were there that, whilst you at least had the courage and courtesy to go there, you did not answer any questions. People kept wanting to ask you things, wanting to get answers from you at those meetings, but they got absolutely nothing. I understand the mayor of Carpentaria Shire, Fred Pascoe—a very competent and able mayor; a very quietly sounding sort of fellow who never gets excited—was asking the minister a lot of questions which, again, he gave the politician's answer to. The minister never answered the question. But Mr Pascoe kept coming back to you and saying, 'That was all very well, Minister, but could you please answer the question.' I understand that everyone went away disappointed. 


This is happening right around Australia. In front of Parliament House today there are some timber workers from Tasmania. The timber industry used to be one of Australia's greatest industries. If any of you have been to Tasmania, you will know that there are millions and millions of old growth forest trees in that state. Thanks to the Greens, there is no industry in that state anymore. There is no way in the world you could interfere with the sustainability of the Tasmanian forests. Hundreds and hundreds of workers are now without a job. Those sort of people are out the front protesting. These are hardworking, decent, genuine Australians. They are not after a government handout—all they want is the right to work in what has been, for as long as Australia has been going, a very sustainable industry, the timber industry, particularly in Tasmania. There are some Tasmanian senators here. As Senator Milne would know, some of these forests have been logged for over 150 years. But they are the forests that the Greens go and put a placard in, saying, 'Save these virgin native forests.' Those forests were cut down 120 years ago and have regrown. That is why this industry is so sustainable.


This is relevant to the debate before the chamber because in certain instances land in Tasmania could be used for the Carbon Farming Initiative. I raise the matter in the context of the hurt around Australia that is demonstrated out the front of this building as I speak. That hurt will get worse when the Gillard Labor government brings in the carbon tax. I can talk about the carbon tax, because the Carbon Farming Initiative bill is one of a suite of bills that we will be dealing with in this chamber this year concerning the carbon tax that will be imposed upon Australians—that tax that just a year ago the Labor leader, Julia Gillard, promised hand on heart would not be introduced under a government she led. While some people might say perhaps she made a mistake, perhaps she did not mean to say that, we have on record the Treasurer, the deputy leader of the Labor Party, who said I think on no less than a dozen locations that Tony Abbott was being hysterical when he kept saying to people before the last election that Labor and Greens in alliance after the next election would bring in a carbon tax. Wayne Swan said Tony Abbott was off his brain—how dare he suggest that; they were not going to bring in a carbon tax. Wayne Swan said Tony Abbott was being hysterical. We have the leader and the deputy leader of the Labor Party both just a year ago, before the election, promising Australia there would be no carbon tax under this government and here we are, a year later, debating one of a suite of bills which will introduce a carbon tax.


Senators might also recall that before the last election Ms Gillard told the Australian public that she would not be doing anything on climate change until there was consensus. Do you remember that? A year ago there was consensus—99 per cent of the candidates standing for election a year ago promised that there would be no carbon tax. What more consensus can you get than that—99 per cent of all candidates promised there would be no carbon tax. Yet here we are, just a year later, dealing with this bill which is part of a suite of bills to introduce this toxic tax that is going to destroy even more Australians and which those many thousands of people out the front of this Parliament House at this very moment are expressing their concern about.


Unfortunately I have cut myself short of time to actually address the amendment. As Senator Birmingham says, we will support it. (Time expired)




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:58):  by leave—I move amendments (8) and (9) together:


(8)   Clause 76, page 101 (line 11), omit ""5 years"", substitute ""3 years"".


(9)   Clause 76, page 101 (line 24), omit ""5 years"", substitute ""3 years"".


These amendments reduce the offsets reporting period maximum from five years to three years. Currently there is a period of 12 months to three years. There is a concern that a five-year period is too long. I can indicate that I will not be seeking to divide on these amendments but I would like an explanation from the government about the upper limit of five years and whether it acknowledges concerns about having such a long period. I think three years would constrain the offsets reporting period to what some would consider a more reasonable period, rather than five years.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:59):  What it would do, as you have correctly identified, is shorten the maximum reporting period. But a five-year maximum reporting period provides flexibility. For example, it avoids reporting costs at the beginning or end of a project when forest growth rates are slow. So what you would be doing is having three years creating churn. Five years provides that flexibility. The scheme integrity continues to be maintained because credits are only issued after abatement has been achieved, therefore the scheme continues with integrity. Five years is the appropriate period. It gives certainty, it gives flexibility within that period and it ensures that credits are only issued after abatement has been achieved. What it does not do, given what yours does, is create a greater churn in that period. In other words, what you do is you add to administrative cost.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:01):  Temporary Chairman Cameron, I am not sure I have had the pleasure of noticing you in the chair before. It will be a great temptation to many people in this place to test the will of the chair, I suspect, whilst you are there. But I will not be one of those. I congratulate you on your ascendancy to this very significant office.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Birmingham, this will be more a pleasure than a test.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I am sure that it will at times be both and that you will exercise the office with the aplomb to which we are so accustomed. In regard to this amendment moved by Senator Xenophon to the reporting requirements within this bill, the opposition are not inclined to support this particular amendment. I think we probably share some of the concerns that the minister has just outlined. In regard to the eligible offset projects that we are talking about, a period of reporting for them of between 12 months and five years is probably an appropriate time line. Whilst five years has the potential to be a long period of time, equally, in regard to the establishment of and the progress of these sorts of projects, it is not necessarily an inordinate period of time. It is going to be a matter of balance. Different projects will have different time lines which it will be most appropriate for them to meet, but obviously where it is possible and sensible for projects to meet a five-year time line then that is probably wise. The well-established projects may need fairly minimal work to make their reports. It is going to be argued in either direction whether they should report more often or less often, but well-established projects probably need less oversight and checking once they are well established and their credentials have been acknowledged. So we think that shortening, in a sense, the mandatory reporting period to less than three years would not aid the efficient running and efficient management of this scheme and as a result we would join with the government in thinking that the five-year time line is appropriate to maintain.

 (South Australia) (11:05):  I move amendment (10R) on sheet 7122 revised, which is standing in my name:


(10R) Clause 112, page 146 (after line 8), after subclause (14), insert:


(14A) Within 28 days of giving a notice under subsection (14), the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee must publish on its website the reasons for the endorsement of the proposal or the refusal to endorse the proposal, as the case may be.


Under this amendment the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee must publish on its website the reasons for its endorsement of the proposal or its refusal to endorse the proposal. Currently the bill provides that the minister must 'as soon as is practical' cause a decision to be posted on the department's website. This amendment inserts a 28-day requirement and also says that reasons for a proposed methodology being refused must also be published. It is effectively a transparency provision, and I am grateful for the discussions that I have had with the government and the opposition in relation to this. I think it would improve the legislation to have that benchmark of transparency and accountability in the legislation.

We concur with the arguments that he has put in regard to providing further transparency to the process and the assessment and recognition of offset entities and, in particular, to the work of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:08):  by leave—I move amendments (11R), (11A) and (11B) on sheet 7124:


(11R) Clause 255, page 271 (after line 16), after paragraph (c), insert:(ca) to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and to advise the Minister about best evidence in relation to permanence;


(11A)   Clause 255, page 271 (line 7), before ""The"", insert ""(1)"".


(11B)   Clause 255, page 271 (after line 18), at the end of the clause, add:(2)   If the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee gives advice to the Minister under paragraph (1)(ca) about best evidence in relation to permanence, the Minister must, within 28 days after receiving the advice, cause a copy of the advice to be published on the Department's website.


These amendments relate to the issue of permanence. This is something that was looked at closely by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and there is a discussion about this in some detail at pages 34 to 36 of the committee's report. There is a concern that a number of submitters argue that the requirement to maintain carbon stores for 100 years was too long and would discourage some potential proponents from participating in the scheme. Michael Kiely, the Chairman of the CFTA, stated, as reported on page 35 of the Senate committee report:


No farmer would be silly enough to agree to 100 years for soil carbon or 100 years for anything. A finance lender would want to know seriously the impact on the value of the property of agreeing to such a thing. We did some research into the 100 years thing and discovered it was a policy decision, not a scientific measure … We believe that 100 year is a perverse outcome. The result is said to be necessary so buyers can be confident they are getting value—that is, genuine abatements—so they get nothing. There is nothing available for them. We have found examples where the IPCC and the Verified Carbon Standard have allowed other periods of time recently—20, 25, 30-odd years. We believe we could work within that sort of time frame. 


Recommendation 3 of the entire committee at clause 2.49 of the committee report at page 6 states:


The committee recommends the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter.


This amendment adds to the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee a function that it monitor all scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and advise the minister of best evidence in relation to permanence. This was a recommendation of the Senate committee and I think it is important that DOIC as the responsible agency continue to look to update, amend and improve the scheme into the future. This amendment also provides that the advice by the committee be published on the website of the department within 28 days. 


There is an issue here about the continued monitoring of permanence, given the quite serious reservations expressed in its current form. It does not seek to change the permanence provision, but it does seek to ensure that there is ongoing or continuous scrutiny of the permanence provision, looking at the best available scientific evidence.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:12):  As Senator Xenophon has rightly highlighted, this issue was considered in some depth by the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation, an inquiry which you Mr Temporary Chairman Cameron chaired. So you would well recall the bipartisan recommendation that the government continue to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international consensus on this matter. 


The bill does put in place a basic permanence obligation regarding the maintenance of carbon stores where credits have been issued. That is an important feature of the bill. There needs to be some certainty in this regard. However, as Senator Xenophon has highlighted, a number of submitters were critical of the 100-year permanence obligations and the impact that would have on the scheme. Senator Xenophon highlighted the evidence of one of the submitters to the inquiry. There were others. Ausveg in their submission made a very strong appeal on what the impact of this 100 year requirement may be. They indicated in the extract from their submission that appears in the Senate inquiry report:


… it would take a very brave farmer to agree to 100 year permanent arrangements in which they (and their children and grandchildren) will be held accountable for ""natural disturbances such as drought that may cause carbon to be released from the soil"".


Equally, placing all risk and costs as the growers' responsibility for ""bushfire … drought, or actions by neighbours, or third-parties"" belies the Government's own commitments to meeting its Kyoto obligations.


Given these serious challenges and immense uncertainty of carbon markets, it is quite unrealistic to expect vegetable and potato growers to sign 100 years commitments (with the threat of civil and criminal prosecution), undertake major investments, and change generational farming practices without any firm guarantees on the price they will be paid.


Those types of concerns are the concerns which are likely to manifest themselves and potentially make this legislation ineffectual in terms of its uptake. It is not just the farming or agricultural groups who have highlighted their concerns about this. It is not just the industry bodies; the committee also highlighted the evidence of the Climate Institute. The committee report stated that the Climate Institute agreed that the 100-year permanence provision was:


… likely to be perceived by many landholders as a substantial, even insurmountable barrier to participation in the scheme.


For these reasons, the opposition will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments, which put in place obligations on the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence and to advise the minister about best evidence in relation to permanence. We think that is an appropriate course of action which will hopefully provide some continual evaluation of this issue. 


Importantly, as he so often does, Senator Xenophon has provided a transparency provision in this regard as well, a provision which requires that advice provided to the minister by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee on this matter of permanence must be published on the department's website so that it can be scrutinised, assessed and debated. I would expect there to be a feedback loop—that, once such scientific assessment and evaluation undertaken by the DOIC is published on the website, scientists and other experts will scrutinise the findings of the DOIC and provide further feedback to it, informing the DOIC's further deliberations on this issue. For these reasons, the opposition will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments and we hope that other parties within the chamber will do likewise.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:17):  The government does not support the amendments moved by Senator Xenophon. Members of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee have expertise with offset projects. The functions of the DOIC are described in proposed part 26, paragraph 255, 'Functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee': 


The Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee has the following functions:


   (a) the functions that are conferred on it by this Act and the regulations;


   (b) to advise the Minister about matters that:


      (i) relate to offsets projects; and


      (ii) are referred to the Committee by the Minister;


That is the role and function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. Senator Xenophon's amendments effectively confer on the committee the function of monitoring scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. Nothing prevents, on my reading of the bill, the minister referring these matters to the committee. But their work is primarily about offset projects. They are there to look at the methodologies and then give independent assessments of those. 


Permanence is about the length of time that carbon dioxide remains in the atmos­phere and its radiative forcing effect. Separate from the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, the government will continue to keep the permanence issue under review in light of developments in the Intergovern­mental Panel on Climate Change. I know that you have an interest in the issue of permanence, but we should not use the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee as the vehicle to maintain that interest. It is inappropriate to use it in that way. That is why we do not support the amendments. 


Permanence has been set at 100 years. We have set it at 100 years because carbon dioxide cycles between the atmosphere, oceans and land biosphere and its removal from the atmosphere involves a range of processes with different timescales. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that around 50 per cent of the increase in CO2 will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years. A further 30 per cent will be removed within a few centuries. The remaining 20 per cent may take longer. In this context, 100 years has become the internationally accepted time frame for ensuring that sequestration is equivalent to, and can be used to offset, emissions. Under the CFI, sequestration projects can be terminated after 100 years without having to pay back carbon credits because it is then considered that permanence has been achieved. 


Even without these amendments, the government will continue to monitor international developments on the issue and adjust permanence obligations in the CFI to reflect international scientific and policy consensus. It is not for the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to give advice to the minister about the best evidence in relation to permanence. Government will continue to monitor this issue and to look at international developments, but it is not a function that you should confer on the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. 


Just as an aside, it should also be noted that the CFI permit obligations allow significant flexibility. Landholders would be able to cancel their sequestration projects at any time by relinquishing the number of credits issued for the project. That will of course mean that projects will have a much higher value if they represent a permanent abatement. The integrity of the scheme is maintained by having permanence because there is no genuine abatement if carbon stores are subsequently released back into the atmosphere. You need permanence. All of those who want to make an effort in reducing our carbon, all of those who want to make an effort in ensuring that there can be carbon sequestration and all of those who want to make an effort to move towards a clean energy future require permanence. Landholders will be able of course to terminate sequestration projects at any time provided they hand back the same number of credits. If they do want to terminate, the flexibility is there.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:23):  I will not be supporting these amendments, either, for many of the reasons that the minister has just outlined. For the Greens it is essential that the permanence obligations stand very clearly as they are in current legislation. I remind the coalition and Senator Xenophon of one of the big concerns people have with the whole Carbon Farming Initiative. It has been outlined by Senator Joyce in his run around the country, saying that the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin will be covered in trees if you turn around twice and so on and so forth. We need to not only guarantee permanence but also give people very clear signals so that we do not end up with the simultaneous crises that we have leading to perverse outcomes. The simultaneous crises we have are a climate crisis, a water crisis, a food security crisis and an energy crisis. If you do not look at all of those in a holistic way, you will get perverse outcomes. If you suddenly decide that you are going to go with carbon sink forests everywhere without any concern about water or about food production, you will end up with a complete mess in rural and regional Australia. It is what essentially happened with the managed investment schemes, and we absolutely do not want to see that happen again.


Equally, we do not want to see food production pushed out of the way by energy crops. We do not want to see a massive investment from managed investment schemes mark II with the planting of carbon sink forests in areas which should be maintained for food production. Equally, we do not want people going into a gambling framework where they basically say they will put trees in, they will get the carbon credits for 25 years and then at the end of that the next generation can cut the lot down, rip it up, do what they like and go back to a different regime. By putting in 100 years, we are acknowledging that the task here is to put in the carbon and maintain it for 100 years. Every farmer will sit there and say, 'Right, I am going to look at this piece of my property and determine that.' That means there will be parts of people's properties that they cannot use for anything other than, for example, putting in a biodiverse planting. It will improve their property; it will improve the biodiversity on their property. It will not take anything else out of production. It is a good thing to do and it will store carbon, and it is being planted as a biodiverse planting because it is meant to be there for 100 years. That is what you would do if you were planting something to last 100 years—you would build resilience, get local seed and local species, and actually have that part of your property like that for 100 years. But it is not going to be a substantial part of your property if you can make more from doing other agricultural pursuits on that land.


Similarly with soil carbon, one of the issues—it is an issue that Australia is engaged with daily in the talks in Durban, and has been over the last several years in negotiations—is drought. Every time we have a major drought in Australia we lose massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. Australia is saying we are not going to sign up to the forest management provisions of the treaty because we run the risk in a major drought of having to pay a massive amount on loss on our target because of the carbon we lose to the atmosphere. So Australia has been arguing that we want force majeure provisions so that in the event of extreme events that are beyond what would be classified as normal Australia would not have that immediately taken off the target. There are a whole lot of complexities in the UN negotiations around permanence. One thing we have succeeded in doing here is sticking with the spirit of the international agreement and understanding on permanence, but this is also a very clear signal to rural and regional Australia that permanence means permanence and if you make these decisions they last for 100 years. That will lead to more balanced land use in rural and regional Australia.


We have also put in this bill the need to consult natural resource management plans and the natural resource management groups in any particular catchment to make sure we do not get perverse outcomes where too much of the catchment is turned over to one carbon farming alternative or another. We are trying to give rural and regional Australia the opportunity to take up the benefits of creating permits by putting carbon in the landscape on a permanent basis or restoring carbon in the landscape if they have a degraded bit of forest on their land that they want to restore or a piece of forest that they can bring up to its full carbon carrying capacity with assistance in various ways. We are providing people with the opportunity to do good things and giving them an incentive to do so, a payment to do so. But we are making sure that we do not end up with the perverse outcomes we see when we incentivise something in a way that does not take into account all the other issues like water, food production and energy. We are dealing with all these crises at once.


I wholeheartedly support the notion of permanence being 100 years. I recognise there is an ongoing discussion in inter­national negotiations. I am also cognisant of what the minister is saying, that that advice coming back through the international negotiations will obviously be taken into account by the government, is being taken into account every time there is one of these international meetings and will continue to be taken into account—but the DOIC is not the place to do it. Having said that, I think this is the most sensible way to proceed because it will give people a reality check. As the minister said, if they proceed on the basis that it is 100 years and then determine that there is more money to be made or there is a separate issue of ownership or for whatever reason they decide to get rid of the carbon that they have stored in this way, they will have to give up the permits. The reality is that that will be the consequence. It does not prevent them using that part of their property in the future in a different way but there will be a financial penalty incurred just as there is a financial benefit gained because you have done this in the first place. So that is going to be a commercial decision for people on the land, but I am confident that under this provision what we are going to get at last is a whole lot of biodiverse plantings on properties in places where it is appropriate to have them, where there will be decisions to avoid land clearance, where there will be decisions to restore degraded systems and improve biodiversity at the same time. 


I actually think this carbon farming initiative bill in the way that it has now been developed is an extremely good thing for rural and regional Australia and I think farmers are pretty desperate to have it out there because it is the first time that marrying concepts of stewardship with the financial outcome is going to be able to happen on the ground. I think that has been one of the really positive things we have achieved through this negotiation.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:31):  I am pleased to hear Senator Milne and the Greens party wanting to do something for rural and regional Australia. If you go and ask some of the 5,000-odd people out the front of the building now, most of whom are from rural and regional Australia, they will tell you that the Greens political party is the worst thing that has ever happened to rural and regional Australia. I might suggest to Senator Milne that if she is interested in helping rural and regional Australia not only should she do what she can in relation to this carbon farming initiative, but if she wandered outside and spoke with people from rural and regional Australia and found out what really concerns them that would show some real commitment to rural and regional Australia. If you go out there and ask those people, the things that really concern them are the carbon tax that is being imposed upon us by the Greens-Labor alliance. People out the front, people from rural and regional Australia, people from my town in country Australia, people right across the north of Australia, know that the carbon tax will be bad for them. It is a toxic tax. It is going to increase their cost of living but particularly for those in rural and regional Australia because of the greater reliance we have on transport and fuel and the greater impact that the carbon tax will have on those of us who live in rural and regional Australia. 


So I am pleased to hear Senator Milne at least mouthing the words about support for rural and regional Australia. I just wish she would go outside and hear the real problems of rural and regional Australia and adjust her party's approach accordingly. Give up this government that has been so devastatingly bad for all in rural and regional Australia, in fact all Australians. Slip down and ask BlueScope Steel workers. None of them have much confidence in this government, which is being propped up by the Greens political party.


Getting on to the amendment before the chamber, which is as I understand it for the independent domestic offset integrity committee to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permits and to advise the minister about best evidence in relation to permits, Senator Birmingham on behalf of the coalition has indicated that the coalition would be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. I just raise the issue, though, that I hope this independent domestic integrity committee is independent. I hope that it will monitor all scientific research. This is a concern I have with this amend­ment. You would be aware, Mr Temporary Chairman, that we set up an independent climate change commission to oversight so-called climate change and appointed Professor Flannery to lead that group, appointed him to a position in which he gets $180,000 a year for two or three days a week work—much more than you, Mr Temporary Chairman, as a member of this Senate gets every year. I know that you and most people in this chamber work seven days a week and many of them work anything from 12 to 15 or 20 hours a day seven days a week. They do not get the sort of pay that Professor Flannery is getting to run this so-called independent Climate Commission on behalf of the government.


This is my point in relation to this amendment. The government appointed to that independent commission only those people who had a scientific view or had a view of science that the government supported. So in this amendment this domestic offset integrity committee is being asked to monitor scientific research. I just hope that if the amendment is passed and the integrity committee is looking at and monitoring scientific research that it monitors all research and not just, as in the case of the Climate Commission, research which the government agrees with. In Professor Flannery's case and in the case of the Greens-Labor alliance, all of those scientists who do not agree with Professor Flannery's view on climate change are just ignored. I am not saying they should be believed. I have often said in this chamber before, with thousands of scientists believing one way and thousands of scientists believing another way, that I am not a scientist and I do not form an opinion when it comes to the cause of climate change. We all accept that the climate is changing. But the scientists cannot agree and so I put myself in the category that simply says if a scientist cannot agree what chance have I got?


In Australia we do not have the totalitarian, fascist governments of the middle of the last century when you had to believe what Hitler or Mussolini thought or you were put to the sword. There was only one view and that was Hitler's or Mussolini's and if you disagreed with that it was off with your head. We are a democracy and we are not like that, yet in this case the Labor-Greens alliance government is saying there is only one view of climate science and if you do not agree with it not only will you be ignored but also they will make sure that you never get any research funding. That is to the extent where a lot of respected scientists in Australia are now not game to raise the alternative view because they know that they—and their associates and colleagues who might be seen to support that view—will simply not be funded for research which keeps scientists in operation. That is the sort of thing that happened under the fascist governments and the communist govern­ments of the last century: you have got to believe what the government believes or you are finished. Let us hope that, with this amendment, the independent Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee looks at all scientific research, not just research that the government wants it to look at to come up with a view that the government has already preordained.


In relation to the climate change commission, we know that Professor Flannery and all his colleagues on that were only appointed because they shared the government's view. They refused to look at any other scientific work on the issue because that did not accord with what the government wanted Australians to believe. As for Professor Flannery, we know he is the one that has been warning us about tidal increases but then we find—and I did so with absolute amazement—that, contrary to what he is telling everybody else about tides rising, he goes and buys a property or two right on the edge of the Hawkesbury River, so clearly he cannot believe that the tides are going to rise by as much as he has been predicting around the place. Perhaps we will hear more about that at estimates and perhaps the government will come clean in their supposedly open and accountable paradigm about Professor Flannery's conflict-of-interest statements. I understand from last estimates that he put one in but no-one has been able to see it. That is another secret of this very secretive government. We are told that he has indicated his interests that might be in conflict with his duties. But while the government knows that, nobody else in this chamber does. We are not being taken into the confidence of Professor Flannery or of the government. It is another secretive deal by this government that has really become renowned for its lack of accountability and lack of openness. So, whilst as Senator Birmingham has indicated, we support this amendment, I do hope if the amendment is passed that the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will be a committee of integrity—unlike, I suggest, the climate change commission, which seems to me to lack integrity because you are only appointed because of your view on things—and that, if it is going to monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence, it will actually monitor all scientific research and not just the research that the government wants it to look at.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:42):  I want to address some of the contributions made so far to the debate on this amendment. I thank Senator Macdonald for a valuable contribution that has highlighted not just the importance of this amendment but some of the broader issues around the continual scrutiny and analysis of science in this debate. Senator Milne, in outlining hers and the Green's opposition to this amendment, was emphatic that we must keep the 100-year benchmark. Nothing about this amendment, in and of itself, seeks to step away from 100 years. Nothing suggests that 100 years, as the time line for permanence under the carbon farming scheme, will not be the ongoing figure. All it does is say that, if relevant international scientific research suggests that a different approach to permanence is warranted, that research should be brought to the attention of the minister and should be published on the department's website. It is a pretty straightforward amendment in that regard. It is not, in fact, an amendment—even were the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to find that there is over­whelming scientific research that would warrant a change in the definition—that does not mandate that change. All it does is say that the DOIC must advise the minister of that finding and they must publish the evidence. That is where it starts and ends. Then we can have a debate about how the minister may respond to that change in evidence. So I think to portray this amendment as an amendment that in some way seeks to undermine the 100-year benchmark as it currently exists is not accurate. It is purely an amendment that seeks to ensure there is genuine ongoing analysis of the science.


Senator Milne said that permanence needs to be permanence, and the minister emphasised the international discussions that continue with regard to permanence. We have semantic debates about words in this place sometimes. Obviously, in this case we all accept that the word 'permanence' is being used with a definitional period and would, in any other debate, be a description of duration rather than permanence. When you say something is for 100 years, that is 100 years duration not 100 years of permanence, because in all the usual approaches permanence means permanent, not 50 years, 100 years or a trillion years. But I understand that this is a case of accepting international language in that regard.


What does disturb me, though, about the minister's contribution is that he emphasised it is not the role or function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to undertake this work. That is right to a point, Minister, but it is a bit of a circular argument because the functions of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee are laid out by clause 255 of the bill, and the amendment we are debating seeks to change and add to those functions. If we pass this amendment and it goes into law then indeed it will be the function of the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee to look at and monitor scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. So the argument is: who should be responsible for looking at that? Who should be the responsible party to provide some advice to the government about up-to-date scientific information on permanence as it relates to the operation of the carbon farming scheme?


Whilst in the way the government envisioned this scheme operating it may not have been the DOIC's core role to look at this, the DOIC does appear to be the best fit as to who should most logically look at and provide ongoing advice to government about these matters of permanence. Rather than accepting a 'trust us' attitude—and we have had, as I have emphasised at other times in this debate, serious concerns time and time again when this government has said, 'Trust us; she'll be right, mate,' in its approach to things—the opposition believes, and is keen to support Senator Xenophon in this regard, that it makes a lot of sense to mandate some ongoing analysis of the science in regard to permanence and to ensure that somebody with particular responsibility for how the scheme will work has an ongoing brief to look at international developments with regard to permanence. That makes perfect sense.


We think the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee are the obvious parties to do so when it comes to this legislation. We do not want just to leave it up in the air—that is, the minister of the day will be advised by the department of the day about the matter. We do not want to leave it on a 'trust us' platform that, should those international standards evolve, change or be informed by better science, the minister will respond to that in an unprompted way. We want to make sure the prompting process is in place, and these amendments of Senator Xenophon provide very specifically for the prompt to be given that the scientific consensus or research has shifted and there is a better understanding of how permanence may be treated. This relatively simple amendment provides for a very clear process by which the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee will monitor the science around permanence and tell the minister what they have seen, what they know, what they understand it to be. They are the people, after all, who ultimately are looking at the methodologies for the operation of the scheme and any issues that come up in relation to programs that operate under this scheme. They are the people who are tasked and equipped to provide good oversight. With regard to the practical—where you bring the science together with the practical operation of the scheme—they are the people who are going to have to make those decisions and mould it together, so they are equally well placed to advise on this matter.


The minister rightly said that in the clause as it is written there is probably nothing to prevent the committee providing information to the minister if they think it relevant in relation to this issue of permanence and scientific research on it. I agree with the minister—there probably is nothing to prevent them doing that. Certainly subclause 255(d) provides for them to have a function:


to do anything incidental to or conducive to the performance of the above functions.


And those above functions themselves are relatively broad about providing advice to either the secretary or the minister in relation to offset projects. If in the course of providing advice about a project matters of permanence come up, it is obvious that it would not just be prohibited but probably be a responsibility of the committee to provide some advice to the minister in relation to those matters of permanence and the scientific advice that surrounds them. So the potential and the likelihood are already there that, at some points in time, the DOIC will be looking at matters of permanence. Given at some points in time they will be looking at those matters of permanence, we think it is quite appropriate that in fact all of the time in an ongoing manner they should have an obligation to ensure they are up to date with the science and across it and, where there are changes in that science, inform the minister of them and, where there are relevant changes in that science, having informed the minister of them inform other stakeholders and the public of them so that we get that feedback loop that I talked about previously that ensures we are continually apprised of developments in this regard.


I struggle with the government's arguments against this. I am not sure why the government is so emphatically against it. I understand the arguments that Senator Milne has made, but once again I think she is attempting to read more into these amend­ments than they will actually achieve. She is attempting to believe that these amendments will somehow undermine the standards that have been set from day one. There is nothing in these amendments that will undermine those standards. There is nothing in these amendments that will see anything change in the 100-year time line any time soon. There is nothing in these amendments that will provide increased powers or scope for the minister or the government of the day to arbitrarily change that. These amendments are about the provision of advice and the publication of that advice. That seems to us to be perfectly sensible and rational, and to be perfectly entitled to our support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:54):  I want to emphasise that this does not seek to change the 100-year provision, but it does seek that there be ongoing monitoring. So if there is further evidence that it needs to be modified in any way for certain types of use, perhaps then it can be looked at. It is just a requirement for there to be monitoring of the scientific research relevant to the issue of permanence. I think the government are saying, 'We'll do that, but not through this committee.' But if this committee is entrusted with dealing with the issue of carbon farming to provide objective evidence, to look at the scientific evidence and to look at the administration of the scheme, I would have thought it appropriate for this committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, to look at this issue. It does not actually seek to change the 100 years, but it does seek for the committee to advise itself or to give advice to the government and for that advice to be published. I think that is the right thing to do for such a piece of legislation. Therefore, I will be persisting with these amendments and I am grateful to the opposition for their support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:56):  I move amendment (12) on sheet 7118:


(12)    Clause 306, page 303 (after line 6), after subclause (1), insert:


(1A)   Any review under subsection (1) must be conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in conjunction with the Productivity Commission.


(1B)   The Minister must ensure that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Productivity Commission are provided with sufficient additional resources to conduct any such review.


This amendment relates to the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission conducting reviews. Under the current deal, there is a review of the act, the regulations and other instruments every three years. It is important to ensure that this initiative continues to improve. However, it is crucial that this review be independent and, as such, this amendment requires that every three-year review be conducted by the CSIRO, which has already done research into carbon farming, in conjunction with the Productivity Commission.


I believe it is important that the review include consideration of how the carbon credit market operates and how Australian farmers and industry are participating in the trade of carbon credits, and that is why I believe the Productivity Commission should be involved in any review. I note that the Productivity Commission has recently conducted a review on carbon pricing mechanisms. I think that was a very useful exercise. I think the Productivity Com­mission did a very thorough job of adding to the public debate and our knowledge of this area. Furthermore, this amendment requires that both agencies be provided with the adequate additional resources to enable them to conduct such reviews. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:57):  We have already stated in the House that the government will seek the advice of the CSIRO, as it is a valuable organisation and we value their advice, when reviewing the adequacy of the risk of reverse buffer adequacy. But let us be clear: the government's plan for the Clean Energy Future includes the establishment of a climate change authority which will review the CFI. The government will continue to, and always have, value the advice of the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission in relation to climate change policies. They will have an opportunity when the CFI is reviewed. But the government do not agree with putting it in the legislation in the way outlined by Senator Xenophon. It calls for the CSIRO to undertake the review in conjunction with the Productivity Com­mission, so there is no choice about that. They would both have to undertake the review. It does not say how they would do that. It does not say what the terms of reference would be. It does not say what they would be looking at, such as the terms of reference and, of course, it does not give them any underpinning to undertake it.


It is a much better course for the government to follow its plan—that is, for the Clean Energy Future—which includes the establishment of the Climate Change Authority, independent of government, which will review the efficacy of the CFI. In 1B you have also included:


The Minister must ensure that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Productivity Com­mission are provided with sufficient additional resources to conduct any such review.


But it does not say how that would be done. These would be budget decisions. They may not amount to much in financial outlay; nonetheless, I can see you are trying to set up a scheme which provides a type of review which, the government says, creates too much specificity and does not allow an appropriate review to be done at the appropriate time. In that way, even if your amendment were successful, the Climate Change Authority would still undertake a review of the CFI. In doing that, you would also be creating additional work that the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission would need to do and you could end up, effectively, with a double-up. For all those reasons, we do not support the amendment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:02):  The opposition does support Senator Xenophon's amendment. We think it is important that there be appropriate organisations tasked with undertaking this review. I have listened to the minister carefully, and he has said that Senator Xenophon's amendment does not provide for what the terms of reference are or how the review would be undertaken. Of course we need to understand that Senator Xenophon's amendment to mandate that the review be undertaken jointly by the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission does not stand in isolation; it is an amendment to the existing clause 306 of the bill. The government themselves are proposing that this review occur and that it be a review into the operation of the act and the regulations and other instruments made under the act. They have already set out to some extent the broad framework of what the review would be expected to do. They have set out that there will be public consultation, they have set out that there will be a report and they have, thankfully, set out that that report will be made public and tabled in the parliament. They have set out the time lines for the review, which is the subject of subsequent amendments, and of course they have set out that there will be further reviews. So they have set out almost everything in relation to this review process except who is to undertake it.


If I am correct in what I think I heard the minister say, he indicated that the Climate Change Authority will be tasked with undertaking this review and that that was the intention of the government. The minister is nodding, so I take it that I did hear him correctly. I appreciate the minister telling us who the government intends to undertake this review; of course that is not stipulated in the bill. But of greater concern is that the Climate Change Authority does not at present exist. The structure of it is not at present known; exactly what its powers, remit, skills et cetera will be are not currently clear. The CSIRO, from a scientific stand­point, and the Productivity Commission, from a regulatory and economic standpoint, have proven track records. They have known skills and a clear ability in working together to undertake a review of a scheme such as this one. That will require a mix of scientific understanding and an appreciation of best practice and lowest cost regulation, which the Productivity Commission of course has.


The minister was critical that the amendment does not specify how the two are to undertake it together. I would have thought that they are grown-up organisations and that, just as at present, it is open for the minister of the day to stipulate someone to undertake the review. Under the current framework of the bill, the minister of the day could ask Mickey Mouse to undertake the review and that would comply with the bill. He has indicated that it will be the as yet unestablished Climate Change Authority that will undertake the review. Were the Climate Change Authority to have been in operation for a period of time, or were it in fact to be in operation full stop, we might be comforted by that information. But I am not comforted by the information when I do not know fully how that authority is going to work. Its establishment is probably to be the subject of future debate by this place, unless it is to be established purely under the executive powers of government.


We know CSIRO and the Productivity Commission have independence; we know they have integrity; we know they have capability; we know they have experience; we know they have the skills; we know that we can have confidence in the work that they produce. They are the sensible bodies to look at something as complex as this scheme and to provide sound advice on how it will operate in the future and on how this parliament may wish to consider improving it in the future to get the type of outcomes to which we all aspire. 


With all of that, the opposition is strongly supportive of Senator Xenophon's amendment here, and we would hope that the government might reconsider or, if not, that the Greens might see some benefit in these proven expert bodies being tasked to undertake this very important function and review.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-22,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:06):  The Australian Greens will not be supporting the amendment proposed to require the CSIRO and the Productivity Commission to conduct a review of the carbon farming legislation. As has been devised in the whole clean energy package, the Climate Change Authority is to be appointed not only to set the targets, if you like—the budget of greenhouse gas emissions that need to be reduced each year through to an 80 per cent target at 2050—but also to conduct a review of these specific pieces of legislation that are part of the package. The Productivity Com­mission is already going to be signi­ficantly expanded and it will have a much larger workload put on it because its job will be specifically to review the level of compen­sation provisions that have been made to the emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. It will have a major role in doing all that, and it will need expanded resources to do so. At the same time, the CSIRO is working with a number of farmers and farming organisations right now on soil carbon issues and is trying to work through the development of an appropriate methodology that may be applied in the future to enable the permits to be granted and so on. The CSIRO is very firmly engaged in this space at an operational level and at a consultative level with the farming community. 


The Climate Change Authority will oversee all of these particular pieces of legislation in a big-picture way and will need to consult with, as the minister has just suggested, both the Productivity Commission and the CSIRO and no doubt a number of other institutions who are doing various aspects of work. In a structural way you have an oversight authority who will oversee all of it and then drill down how they actually conduct each of the assessments of those pieces of component legislation. This was thought through very carefully, because you cannot have an organisation which is part and parcel of working out the assessments and the methodologies reviewing itself in that context as to the effectiveness of the legislation. But certainly all the work that it has done will feed into that assessment that will be done by the Climate Change Authority. 


The question becomes, do we think that the Climate Change Authority is going to have sufficient rigour to do this job? That is entirely dependent on, in the end, who is appointed to the Climate Change Authority and that is a matter that everybody with an interest in climate change in Australia will take a keen interest in as this develops over time. I appreciate the difficulty here because at the time these amendments were developed the whole clean energy package had not been announced, the whole procedure of how everything would fit together and who would oversee what and how they would be involved had not been announced, and so, in the absence of having any authority with the rigour to oversee this, I can understand why you would choose CSIRO and the Productivity Commission. But now the government has announced the clean energy package and there is a very clear role for the Climate Change Authority to look at all the legislation and make sure it is delivering on the objective of reducing emissions in the context of the emissions reduction target that will be based on the 80 per cent reduction by 2050. That is why the Greens are not supporting this amendment—there is a different structure in place now but it does not exclude either the Productivity Commission or the CSIRO, who will feed into that review process of the Carbon Farming Initiative.


There is a following amendment in relation to time frame for review, and Senator Xenophon has said within 12 months of legislation being passed or 2014. Within 12 months of the legislation being passed, assuming that it is going to be passed in the second half of this year, means that we would be doing the first review next year and that is just not feasible given that it will hardly have got started by that time. In the government's timetable, 2014 is the timeline proposed for the first review, by which time you would have some results on the ground to review. I want to foreshadow that the Greens will not be supporting the amend­ment on the timeframe for that reason. Again I say that at the time the amendments were developed the other package had not been announced and there was no way of knowing that. I make clear where the Greens will be standing on that and also indicate that the Greens will not be proceeding with the last amendment on the sheet as it currently stands.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:13):  I am worried by this statement of the government, supported by the Greens, that the Climate Change Authority is the body to undertake this review. This really is a case of putting the cart before the horse. We have the amazing situation where the government is proposing that a review of a bill that it hopes to have passed by the Senate today will be undertaken by an authority that is not yet in existence.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Xenophon says it is not satisfactory at all. This is an authority that is going to be brought into existence as part of the government's planned carbon tax package. It is on the record that the opposition will be opposing the carbon tax package, and in opposing the carbon tax package we will be opposing the establishment of this Climate Change Authority. Understandably we think it is unsatisfactory to agree to a proposal that a review will be undertaken of the operation of this bill, or act if it is passed, and of the operation of the carbon farming scheme by an authority that we will fight and hope to stop being established. That would of course leave meaningless the minister's promise that it will be the Climate Change Authority, because we hope that it will not be there. We hope it will not be there because it is part of some $400 million worth of administration that the government is proposing to create under the carbon tax regime. This is one of the great and amazing things about the government's carbon tax package. Such is the money-go-round that is the carbon tax package, it is going to establish a climate change authority and a raft of other regulatory bodies that just over the life of the forward estimates will churn through $400 million of taxpayers' money in administrative costs for the carbon tax. Anybody who pauses to think about that should be gobsmacked and horrified. This comes on top of the forward estimates costs for the continuing operation of the existing Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and so on. All up, we are talking about more than half a billion dollars in regulatory and administrative oversight for these schemes over the forward estimates—$400 million alone specifically identified within the carbon tax package that the government has released.


All Australians could find better ways to spend that sort of money. The opposition certainly believes that it could find better ways to spend that sort of taxpayer money. Taxpayers could find better ways to spend that sort of money rather than having to part with it in a tax in the first place. So it is anathema to us that we would be asked to agree that this review be undertaken by a new regulatory body, a new statutory authority, that is going to be part of, frankly, squandering some $400 million of taxpayers' money on a bigger bureaucracy. That is where the carbon tax is leading us to—this great giant new bureaucracy that churns money around. It takes in around $9 billion a year in new tax revenue for the government, spits some of it back out to households and to industry and churns up $400 million of it over the forward estimates in new public servants, new authorities, new regulators and new carbon cops out there on the beats—all of these bodies put in place just churning the money around as only this government is capable of doing.


Despite putting in place the new $9 billion a year tax, the government will still manage to lose money on it. They will still manage to run a deficit on it, as only they can do. Once they have churned all that money around through their giant new bureaucratic arrange­ments and they have spit it out to those they think most worthy, not only will they leave millions of Australian households worse off and thousands of Australian businesses of all sizes struggling and thousands of Australian jobs in jeopardy and send billions of dollars overseas for the purchase of carbon permits but also eventually they will increase the size of the deficit to fund all of this activity. That is the madness of the scheme they are proposing. It is the madness of the scheme that will be debated in this place during the second half of the year. 


We think that it makes no sense at all to agree that the review of the Carbon Farming Initiative should be undertaken by a yet-to-be-established, yet-to-be-proven, yet-to-be-tasked, yet-to-be-staffed regulatory body—an authority which is yet to be given the time to establish their expertise and which is part of this carbon tax money-go-round and part of this great big new $400 million expenditure in bureaucracy by this govern­ment. It is particularly ridiculous to do so when the skills are already there in existing agencies to do the job properly. The skills are there in CSIRO to provide a rigorous and thorough examination of the scientific issues in the carbon farming legislation, the matters of permanence we have just debated, the impact on the water tables and water flows, the impact on biodiversity that we have debated already and the environmental and scientific impact. Quite clearly, CSIRO already has the skills and expertise to undertake the review we are talking about in best practice regulation, in lowest cost regulation, in ensuring that this scheme does not have perverse or adverse consequences to overall abatement targets and measures and in ensuring that, should the carbon tax have gotten through, it operates in a sensible way with the carbon tax regime. We think that obviously the policy skills and the independence of the Productivity Com­mission is equally the right place and has those skills already in place to be able to deliver on this.


Why on earth you would propose sending it off for review by an untested, unknown, unestablished authority is beyond me. This is a very sensible amendment of Senator Xenophon's. It will ensure that the most able people to provide the most independent of advice and review are the ones who do so and give advice back to the government. That is why we support this. It is very disappointing to hear not just that the government will not be supporting it but equally that the Greens will not be supporting it. I would have thought that they would want to see the type of rigour and robust approach that we know CSIRO and the Productivity Commission can achieve. I would have hoped that they would have seen the wisdom in this. Frankly, I believe that at one stage in another parliament they would have, but they now are in a situation where most of the detail on these things is probably worked out behind closed doors with the government. Most of the agreement on 'We'll let you have this amendment but we don't want to see any of the other amendments go through' is done behind closed doors with the government rather than, as perhaps they once did, going through and seeing sensible amendments for what they are and then supporting sensible amendments, particularly sensible amendments like this one that only go to improving the long-term integrity, credibility and operation of this carbon farming scheme. It is an amendment that should be supported and it is a disappoint­ment to see that it does not appear to have the numbers in chamber to enjoy support.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:22):  I will briefly refer to the contribution that Senator Milne made a few moments ago. I listened to her arguments in relation to my subsequent amendment—I note that we are not dealing with it now—and see that her argument has some considerable merit, so I will not be proceeding with amendment (13) on sheet 7118. I foreshadow that in relation to the first review, as I think there is a legitimate point there. I take that on board and I accept it. Therefore, I will not be proceeding with that amendment.


On this particular amendment, though, it is critical that it is supported for a number of reasons. If you look at the bill at page 303—the very final page of this bill—and at clause 306, 'Reviews of operation of this Act etc', you see it states:


(1) The Minister must cause to be conducted reviews of the operation of:


(a) this Act; and


(b) the regulations; and 


(c) other instruments under this Act.


He must make provision for public consultation. He must cause a report to be prepared of a review under subsection (1). A report of the review must be tabled in parliament. It needs to be tabled before the end of 31 December 2014. But it does not say who will do that review. As I understand it, the government is foreshadowing that it will be the Climate Change Authority. That authority has not been established. It does not provide for terms of reference of that review, not even broad parameters for that. That concerns me. The Productivity Commission has already done tremendous work looking at the whole issue of appropriate mechanisms for the pricing of carbon. I would have thought that this would segue, if you like, into the work they have already done. They clearly have the capacity to do so.


In relation to Senator Milne's point about the CSIRO—that it has already provided advice and it may not be appropriate for it to look at this—I think it is valuable that Senator Milne raised that point. But the CSIRO has looked at this issue. I think it is in a perfect position to be part of the review. You could have perhaps a Chinese walls mechanism so that there isn't any potential conflict, but clearly the expertise of the CSIRO would be valuable.


The very thrust of this amendment is that there ought to be an independent process to review the operations of this act. The Climate Change Authority is part of the executive arm of government. You do not have independence. I believe you will not have the robustness of purpose to the review process that is required. Therefore I think it is important that you have an independent body to do this. This mechanism is the best way forward. The current legislation is deficient in that it provides a mechanism for a review but it does not provide the basis for such a review, the broad terms of reference or the independence of such a review. That is why I am very grateful to the coalition for its support for this.


The carbon farming initiative is a huge change that has been proposed. I want it to work effectively and to work well. But I think we ought to seek independent advice when reviewing this legislation. The Climate Change Authority is not the appropriate body. What has been proposed in this amendment is far superior for dealing with the very important issue of a review.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (12) on sheet 7118, moved by Senator Xenophon, be agreed to. It being not yet 12:30, the division will be postponed to a later hour.

(2) Clause 82, page 63 (table item 2), after “section”, insert “36 or”.


Clause 66, is a technical correction to make it plain that it is non-Kyoto international emissions rather than the Australian carbon credit. It has been picked up as a technical correction; it may be a drafting issue. Clause 82 is the reviewable decision. Rather than a technical correction, there was an oversight with reviewable decisions in that one of the clauses which is reviewable was omitted. We are now putting it back in to ensure that both those provisions are reviewable under the legislation. With those short words, I am sure no-one will object—though I may be surprised—to the government making sure the legislation is both technically correct and properly reviewable.

 (South Australia) (12:29):  I thank the minister for his explanation of these amendments as technical amendments or matters of correction. Of course we all wish to see that the technical aspects are correct in the final legislation and that where small errors may have occurred in the drafting process they are rectified and picked up before we reach the final point of passing the bill and then having to deal with insignificant amendments at a later time. The opposition appreciates the minister bringing those to our attention. We will not stand in the way of the government making what he assures us are technical amendments.

 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


I am not sure if that can really be called an explanation. I appreciate Senator Ludwig was caught on the hop by the fact that Senator Conroy, who was given notice of this matter, was not in the chamber, but his explanation hardly warrants that description. This is a process laid down in the standing orders for senators to be able to find out why questions have not been answered. Those questions were asked nine months ago. I think senators are entitled to answers to those questions well within that nine months, particularly given that the same question, effectively, was asked of a number of other ministers. Thirty days is how long they have to answer these questions. Senator Ludwig, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, was able to answer his same question to that effect on 12 January, only two months after it was asked. Other ministers were able to answer in January, February and March, but this minister seems to have taken nine months in order to do so. I think the Senate is entitled to know why. This is the appropriate time to raise it. It is the appropriate form to raise it in. I suspect any senator who has had to wait nine months for an answer to a question would be very keen to raise the question, as I have done. I think, with respect, that to tell the Senate that you will have an answer 'in due course' is not within the spirit of standing order 74(5), which provides for questions to be explained to the Senate at this point in the day's proceedings if answers have not been provided in a timely way.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Sport (Senator Arbib) and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ronaldson and  Fierravanti-Wells today relating to the House of Representatives Member for Dobell, Mr Thomson.


Last week, on three consecutive days during question time, the Prime Minister asserted her full confidence in the member for Dobell, Craig Thomson. She asserted that Mr Thomson was, in her opinion, doing a fine job. She asserted that she hoped that Mr Thomson would remain in parliament for many years to come. By that very act, she made the integrity of Craig Thomson the standard of the integrity of her own government. She made the credibility of Mr Thomson's denials the standard of the credibility of her own government. Mr Thomson's credibility and integrity are now the very slender threads by which the Gillard government hangs.


One thing that has emerged as a feature of this burgeoning and rather distasteful scandal has been the way in which the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party was forced to try to cover up what was going on during Mr Thomson's days as the national secretary of the Health Services Union by paying his costs and the costs of the defendant, Fairfax Media Pty Ltd, in the defamation claim that he commenced against them—perhaps the most disastrous defamation action since Oscar Wilde sued the Marquess of Queensberry. It has now been revealed by Mr Thomson's belatedly lodged declaration of interests that more than $150,000 from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party was provided to Mr Thomson to settle that case. Although Mr Thomson claimed that the matter had been resolved on his terms, we know that was not true; we now know that the action was discontinued and he had to pay Fairfax's lawyers' costs. We also know, as has now been disclosed, that the Minister for Sport and the former general secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Mark Arbib, was the central figure in organising that very shabby deal.


Like me, Mr Deputy President, you were present before the winter recess when we heard the valedictory speech of former senator Steve Hutchins. In his parting words, former senator Steve Hutchins was at pains to remind the Senate of the depth of the sleaze, corruption and dishonesty that is the rotten core of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, particularly the New South Wales Right—the area of Australian politics of which the member for Dobell is a protege and a favourite son. Who is the other protege and favourite son of the New South Wales Right? The former general secretary, Senator Arbib, who brokered the deal. So the Gillard government and Prime Minister Gillard herself are not only tied, hand and foot, to the integrity of Craig Thomson but also bound, hand and foot, to the integrity of the New South Wales Labor Party machine—the machine that former senator Steve Hutchins described in such palpable and descriptive terms in his parting words to the Senate. Let the Prime Minister be judged by the standards of Mark Arbib and the New South Wales Right.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:11):  I just want to remind the Senate that Minister Arbib answered the questions put to him during question time today. In fact, he reiterated that the questions were not within his area of portfolio responsibility as the Minister for Sport and his answers are on the record. I am going to take this opportunity to take note of Senator Evans' answer to the first question that Senator Abetz asked him today—that is, the record of the Gillard Labor government.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: there is a question before the chair. The question is that the Senate take note of two nominated answers to two nominated questions. Senator Crossin is not at liberty to raise other questions which are not the subject of the question before the chair.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Crossin, I do remind you of the question. The motion is that the Senate takes note of the answers given by Senators Arbib and Evans in response to questions by Senators Ronaldson and Fierravanti-Wells.




Senator CROSSIN:
  That is the problem that we have in this chamber. We have on record the answer from Minister Arbib where he quite clearly said that the questions asked of him did not come within his area of portfolio responsibility. Therefore, what we really have is an opposition that are not prepared to debate the real policy issues, because they have no policies—that is the issue. What I was trying to helpfully do was redirect the opposition's attention to matters of substantial policy—the issues to which Minister Evans referred to today in his answers—but instead we are going to spend half an hour debating answers to questions which Minister Arbib repeatedly said he could not answer because they did not come within his area of portfolio responsibility. What we have is an opposition that cannot ask any questions at all about sport. They have never asked any questions at all about how fantastically well the Australian netball team did in Singapore to win an international trophy. They cannot ask any questions at all about how fantastically well the cycling community is doing—




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy President: Senator Arbib did not say that he could not answer those questions; he said that he would not answer those questions.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, we are moving into a debating point.




Senator Ludwig:
  I will just say on the point of order that there is no point of order. Senator Brandis is now debating the point.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ludwig. Senator Crossin is now addressing the question, after being reminded a first time.




Senator CROSSIN:
 What I am trying to highlight again is that the opposition have no matters of policy they want to debate, because they are a policy-free zone. They have time and time again shown to us in this community, particularly in the last 12 months, that all they are good at is saying no, no, no, no. They have no positive policies at all, except of course that if they got elected they would rip $70 billion out of the coffers of the federal government. In order to do that they would need to cut services, cut public service jobs, cut access to Medicare, cut access to pension payments, cut access to the family tax benefits and cut access to programs. So what they want to do is ensure that we talk about anything in this chamber except their policies, because they have none. They cannot come up with anything at all that they could use to get out there and positively say to the Australian public: 'If we were elected as a government, this is what you could get from us as a benefit.' They are saying, 'In fact, all you are going to get from us is a ripping away of $70 billion of services and benefits that are already provided.' So this opposition is going to go to any lengths, any means at all, to ensure that we debate anything other than alternative policies, because there are no alternative policies.


So what are their alternative sports policies? I do not think I have heard the opposition ask Senator Arbib one question in relation to his sports portfolio—not one question, as I said, about the Australian netball team's triumph in Singapore, not one question at all about the cycling fraternity's success or celebrating Cadel Evans's success in France, not one question at all about World Cup soccer, not one question at all about what the AFL are doing to promote the game overseas. There have been no questions about sport at all from the opposition to Senator Arbib, and how disappointing is that? I think once upon a time—




Senator Brandis:
  I never got a single question all year when I was the minister for sport.




Senator CROSSIN:
  History will tell us that Senator Brandis was the minister for sport once upon a time, so you would think he would be in the best position to now be able to ask Senator Arbib a whole raft of questions in relation to his portfolio of sport, but there have been none—no questions, not at all. Maybe they do not care about sport. Maybe they do not care about the contribution of sporting fraternities and clubs to our community.




Senator Fifield:
  You've got to keep it going for another 30 seconds. Come on! You can do it!




Senator CROSSIN:
  I can certainly do it. I am happy to stand here and debate you all day, every day and every minute of every day. I find that speaking for five minutes is totally easy because all we have to do is reiterate time and time again that you cannot ask questions of decency in this chamber. You cannot ask questions of policy as an opposition. You have to scramble in the race to the bottom— (Time expired)

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:17):  I also rise to speak on the motion that the Senate take note of the answers of Senator Arbib and Senator Evans. I want the record to show that in five minutes the name that was not mentioned by the good senator was that of the member for Dobell. Not one second was devoted to defending the member for Dobell. There was not even the mention of his name in five minutes.




Senator Brandis:
  The member that dare not speak his name!




Senator RONALDSON:
  Exactly, Senator Brandis. What we saw today, and in fact we saw it in relation to Mr Thomson's defamation proceedings and we saw it again with Senator Arbib and with the Prime Minister in the other place today when the Manager of Opposition Business moved a motion for Mr Thomson to come in and make an explanation, is that every time the key players in this debacle, this murky affair, are given the opportunity to come and defend themselves they refuse to do so. The member for Dobell wrote to his colleagues prior to the defamation proceedings being discontinued where he had to pay the costs—so two and two still equals four—and said: 'I am innocent of these matters. I am completely innocent.' We had a media report today where the member for Dobell looked a senior New South Wales ALP figure in the eyes and said, 'I didn't do it.' The member for Dobell had the opportunity in court to have his view of these claims tested and he squibbed it.


Senator Arbib had some extremely grievous allegations made against him over the weekend in various newspapers. Today he had two minutes to answer every one of those claims. You would think that if Senator Arbib were not guilty as charged he would have taken those two minutes, and then the next minute and the next minute after that, to say, 'I am not guilty of these charges.' Did he do so? No, he did not. Did he have the opportunity to clear his name today? Yes, he did. Has he had the opportunity since the weekend to clear his name in relation to these charges? Yes, he has. He has chosen not to do so.


Every single person listening to this debate in the last week knows that this matter has gone from the seat of Dobell to the seat of power in this country. This matter has gone from Mr Thomson to the Prime Minister. Everyone in this chamber knows that it is completely untenable for the Prime Minister of this country to make a claim as late as last Monday afternoon that she had not had any in-depth discussion with Mr Thomson in relation to this matter. This has been in the public domain for in excess of 12 months. This involves one of her own members of parliament being accused of misappropriating funds. Misappropriating funds is about as serious an allegation as you can make against an elected member of parliament, and she was trying to tell the Australian people that she had not had, to use her words, 'detailed discussions' with Mr Thomson about this matter as late as last Monday. 


There are two reasons for that. There can only be two rational reasons: either she is going to defend this man to the absolute death to maintain her position as Prime Minister or she did not want to be told the truth because she might have been forced to act against him. There was a demonstration outside this place today. It was a demonstration by people who have spent thousands upon thousands of their own money to come here and protest against the way this country has been run, to protest against the behaviour of the Prime Minister of this country. It is completely inappropriate and continues to be completely untenable for the leader of a political party to sit back and watch a member destroy her party. It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister of this country will sit back and watch a member tear her prime ministership apart as well. The Prime Minister has no choice but to act. The Prime Minister is now completely and utterly implicated in the payment of money by the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party to Mr Thomson to protect him from bankruptcy and it is about time she came clean.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:23):  I rise this afternoon to partake in this debate on taking note of those answers that have been provided to questions asked of Senator Evans and Senator Arbib. The previous government senator spoke about the need for discussing policy in this chamber. I think that is quite a relevant matter on this particular date and at this time. Senator Ronaldson spoke about protesters out on the lawns of Parliament House, claiming they were protesting about certain issues they have with this government. Surely they have also come here to listen to what policy the opposition has? When it comes to policy, we hear silence. Those policies that they have put forward are not going to deliver.


If I reflect on one of their policies on climate change, it is going to deliver nowhere near its intention and what is claimed. In fact, we know now it will cost this country $70 billion. There is a $70 billion black hole created by those opposite as a result of their thoughts on creating a policy on how they will deal with climate change. That is the sad reality in this particular matter. When it comes to Mr Thomson, I do not know a great deal about this gentleman—




Senator Fifield:
  Never met him!




Senator FURNER:
  but I do know some of the work that he has achieved—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Furner, can I ask you to resume your seat for a moment. Senators on my right have given a fair hearing to senators on the left, so I ask senators on my left to do the same for Senator Furner.




Senator FURNER:
  I do know a bit about his work in the time that he has been in parliament. I would like to reflect on his work as the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. One particular inquiry I had an interest in was on the bill—and it was certainly a bill that was well defeated in this chamber—to overturn Queensland legisla­tion dealing with the wild rivers declaration. If you recall, we as a government were quite successful, with the support of former Senator Fielding, in opposing a private member's bill of Mr Tony Abbott and, I think, a senator from the Northern Territory. Mr Thomson quite comfortably, approp­riately and competently dealt with the inquiry on that particular matter and demonstrated the commitment and the respect that he has from this government to lead such committee. It is important that people have the opportunity to understand that his work has been appropriately achieved and has been respected by this parliament.


One of the telling points about policy of the opposition was made by one of their senators, Senator Helen Coonan, who I do have a degree of respect for. I have witnessed some of the work that she has done in some of the inquiries that I have been involved in. In an interview last Thursday she was questioned about the likelihood of an election some years down the track and she took a poignant position on the need for the opposition to start rolling out policy. If that poignant point she made an issue about is the case, I would wonder why she is resigning from the Senate. Surely, if there is a need to create policy as an opposition, now is the time to have people like Helen Coonan in this chamber to put forward good policy as the alternative government? But that is not going to be the case because she is leaving this place, and that tells a story about the opposition. There is no opportunity for them to deliver on policy.


We know some of the policy that they have put forward is going to cost this country $70 billion and no doubt cost jobs. It is already out there in the media that the opposition are going to sack 12,000 public servants. We already know because it is on the record in the media that they are not going to discount making some changes to the pension. These are the policies that they are not putting forward but that we hear about in the media. That is where they deliver their policies—in the media. They do not come into this chamber and debate them. They do not come into this chamber and put forward policy that can be debated. They put it out in the media. We should not ever forget the underlying policy that brought them to defeat in the last election, and that was Work Choices. We know that is going to be on the agenda next time around to strip away workers' rights and conditions. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:28):  Wasn't that a sterling defence? I would love to have Senator Furner on my side! I would like in the time available to me to reflect somewhat on the member for Dobell. I have gone back to read his maiden speech. His maiden speech is very interesting because it tells us a lot about the member for Dobell.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I will not go there, Senator Brandis, on the issue of maidens! The speech starts off—surprise, surprise!—by saying:


At this stage, I need to acknowledge the fantastic advice and assistance I received from—


none other than—


Mark Arbib, Karl Bitar and Sam Dastyari from the New South Wales ALP head office.


Of course Senator Arbib is the most likely person for the member for Dobell to have consulted with on this issue. If I had to put my money on the person who is most likely to have brokered the deal to pay the legal costs then I think that I would be safe in putting my money on Senator Arbib. Of course, there are a number of other issues. I know that Senator Ronaldson and Senator Brandis have been pursuing these matters, but it is interesting to note, just on the legal costs, the belated declaration in the register of members interests that:


In May 2011, the Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch) paid a sum of money this in settlement of a legal matter to which I was a party …


We have seen reports of $40,000, we have seen reports of $90,000 and we have seen reports of $150,000. But the person who could actually tell us how much the legal fees really were—they could be $150,000, they could be $200,000, they could be a quarter of a million dollars—is most likely, given what we have read in the newspaper, to be Senator Arbib. Not much happens in the New South Wales Right without Senator Arbib knowing about it or being the puppet master. He may now be quietly tucked away in sport and recreation, but he is still pulling some of those strings.




Senator Ronaldson:
  Absolutely.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Absolutely, Senator Ronaldson.




Senator Brandis:
  We know what his recreation is!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Yes. Then we have Mr Dastyari. Senator Arbib has referred us to the New South Wales Right. Mr Dastyari, tell us the deal that was brokered. Tell us how many people in head office actually know. There is not only Mr Dastyari, who runs the show there, there are also the financial controllers and the assistant secretaries—somebody must have authorised this money. Come clean and tell us how much it was and who did the deal.


In my remaining time, I will reflect on one other aspect of the maiden speech of the member of the Dobell. He was pontificating. He was having a go at the Howard government, talking about messages. He was having a go at the Howard government because of its workplace policies. He said:


I started by saying that the language we use as politicians should be simple, straightforward and honest, easy to understand—childlike, one might say. That had me thinking about messages we teach our children as to what is good and bad, from an early age. A lot of these messages are based on our religious beliefs.


He told us that we should:


Do unto others as you would have them do to you.


He also told us:


If you have done the wrong thing, say you are sorry.


Well! Then he went on to talk about aged-care staff and healthcare workers, and how they are downtrodden. Mr Thomson, how do you think they feel about their hard earned union fees being used in this manner? Their fees have been trawled through and totally misappropriated. They have been used in brothels, been used for trips, been used for all sorts of things. How do you think those workers feel, today? You keep talking about standing up for the workers, but this is an absolutely appalling example. The Prime Minister needs to answer some serious questions. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN:
  I thank the Senate. I do not have any objection in principle to the amendment that has been moved by Senator Bob Brown. Incidentally, the amendment was not communicated to me as the mover of the motion before the Senate sat today. For the information of the Senate, this matter arose during Senate estimates and it relates to the specific issue of the respon­sible minister approving act of faith payments when acting against the advice of the department. The question on notice had been on the Notice Paper for more than 70 days by the time the government finally provided an answer which was not to provide an answer. Effectively, the government said, 'Well, we're not going to answer that question,' which is, of course, why I have moved this motion today. The scope in time which Senator Brown has moved in his amendment is so large that I suspect the government will take that as another excuse as to why it will not be able to comply with providing the information that was originally sought. We have been trying to seek this information for the last 75 days now. Perhaps the Greens could move a separate motion along those lines if they are genuinely interested in information going all the way back to 1996. I am concerned that the government is going to use this as an excuse in the context of workload not to provide any information at all. Maybe the Greens could think about a more reasonable time frame—perhaps going back three or four years prior rather than going back 11½ years. But on that basis I would argue against the amendment, just because it actually prevents us from getting the information we have now been trying to get out of this government for the last 75 days.

      (i)   WIN Television in 2010 celebrated 50 years of television history in the state, but in its 51st year WIN has cut the 'guts' out of its local coverage with no weekend news services, resulting in a loss of 28 per cent of the weekly news coverage, local news, local sport and local politics,


      (ii)   Tasmanian viewers, some of whom have been loyal to WIN Television for the full 50 years of its existence, are now being served up an irrelevant news service, broadcasting Victorian news on Saturdays and Sundays; and

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (16:35):  I take this opportunity to refer the chamber to an interview by Michael Smith from 2UE with the member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, on Monday, 1 August. I suggest that anyone who needs some good, hearty reading go and get a copy of this interview and have a very close look at it. I will just take the chamber through some of the matters in this interview:


Smith: OK. Did you take the matter to the police if you believe the credit card was used improperly, did you go and report it to the police?


Thomson: The union reached a settlement with another gentleman who paid back $15,000 in relation to use of credit cards at an escort agency.


Over the weekend what did we hear from the former Victorian Health Services Union secretary, Jeff Jackson, in relation to this matter? Mr Jackson identified himself as the man who had paid back $15,000, but what was the rider that he put on it? The rider was that Mr Thomson had made a 'risky' implication in claiming that a $15,000 repayment was linked to escort service bills. So one of the defences last week from Mr Thomson has been blown out of the water by one of his former colleagues at the HSU. Mr Thomson wanted the listeners of 2UE to believe that it was not him who had paid this money but someone else, and that person was required to repay those escort agency bills. Mr Jackson, the person involved in the repayment, has made it quite clear that that was a risky implication. Well, 'risky implication' means it is not true. Mr Thomson's interview was remarkable because, as we all know, it is an interview that has now been taken up by former senator Graham Richardson, who has made it quite clear that it is an interview which will once and for all damn the member for Dobell.


I will follow on in relation to the claims about this particular gentleman, which we now know are untrue:


Smith: Did he forge your signature?


Thomson: I don't know whether he forged my signature or who forged my signature …


He was asked if he took the matter to the police, Mr Thomson said:


Our handwriting expert believes there were a number of different signatures.


What I say to the member for Dobell is: release the outcome of your handwriting expert's inquiry and put it on the table. Last week, that was the second part of Mr Thomson's new defence in relation to these matters. We have had the $15,000 mystery man. The mystery man has come out and made it quite clear that he is no mystery man and that he repaid money which most certainly was not in relation to escort services. The second part of the new defence from Mr Thomson last week was in relation to the handwriting expert. Mr Thomson should bring in the handwriting expert's report, lay it on the table of the House of Representatives and say, 'This is my ultimate defence to the charges that I was paying for and using these escort services.' This was one opportunity that the member for Dobell had, amongst many. He had another opportunity today in the other place and again he chose not to take it. He had the opportunity to put the handwriting expert on the witness stand and have them say what Mr Thomson has been saying—that they were different signatures and that his signature was forged—but he squibbed it. At the door of the court he pulled out of this much vaunted defamation action. This was the defamation action that Mr Thomson had written to his colleagues about. I have seen the letter and those opposite know that in that letter he pleaded his innocence in this matter. It was the perfect opportunity to go into court and put all of this information on the table and say, 'This is the proof of my innocence', but Mr Thomson squibbed the opportunity to do a whole lot of things and at least put on the witness stand the one person who could prove his innocence, if Mr Thomson was correct.


What does the community take out of this? What is the only realistic thing the community can take out of this? What they will take out is that the handwriting expert did not support Mr Thomson. The hand­writing expert did not say that these signatures were forged. The handwriting expert actually said that it was Mr Thomson's signature. That can be the only rational explanation for this matter not proceeding to court. This was a defamation action that Mr Thomson was speaking publicly with his colleagues about and it was going to be his day in court, but when he had the chance he pulled out.


Not only did he pull out of the pro­ceedings but also he pulled out and was required to pay either some or all of Fairfax's costs. Who paid for those costs? Did Mr Thomson pay for those costs? No, he did not. The people who paid his costs were the rank and file members of New South Wales Labor who had trusted that their funds to the Labor Party in New South Wales would be put towards the betterment of the Australian Labor Party. I disagree that it is going to make the party any better but those members were entitled to put that money there and they were entitled to know that it would be for the betterment of the Australian Labor Party. They were not putting their funds in there to protect the Craig Thomsons of this world. The people who Mr Thomson had ripped off during his time in charge of the HSU were the mums and dads who do the most menial and dirty jobs in this country, such as cleaning hospitals. He has treated them with complete and utter contempt.


There was a motion in the other place today moved by the Manager of Opposition Business which would have allowed the member for Dobell to come into the chamber and explain his actions once and for all. If everything he said was true then that would have been the end of the matter for him. He chose not to do so. In this chamber today the Minister for Sport had the opportunity to refute serious allegations of his involvement and the involvement of the Prime Minister's office in the payment of these funds towards Fairfax's legal costs. If you were Senator Arbib, who is at arm's length in this matter to the extent that he was not involved in the defrauding of union funds, and you were very publicly being dragged into this in the weekend papers, wouldn't you take that opportunity?


The first opportunity would have been to put out a press release. He did not take the first opportunity. The second opportunity would have been today when I asked him the question: were you involved and what was the involvement of the Prime Minister's office? He refused to answer. He refused to answer not on the back of the question being ruled out of order, because it was not ruled out of order. It was not on the back of that. He refused to do it for one reason and one reason only. Here today we had further proof of the absolute—




Senator Cormann:
  The answer was yes.




Senator RONALDSON:
  The answer was yes. We had absolute proof that Senator Arbib, New South Wales Labor and the Prime Minister's office were involved in the discussions about the payment of these legal costs. As I said in an earlier contribution, this has gone from the seat of Dobell to the highest seat in this country, and that is the Prime Minister's seat. As a result of the refusal of Senator Arbib today to deny the press reports, this Prime Minister is now absolutely and totally implicated in the payment of Fairfax's legal costs. She is totally implicated in the discussions surrounding the payment of those costs with Mr Thomson and New South Wales Labor. This Prime Minister stands utterly condemned.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:46):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to this matter of public importance as well, conversely to Senator Fifield's proposal. As a senator I am really proud of our govern­ment's achievements in this area. The past year has seen many achievements by the Gillard government. Not only did we secure minority government in September last year but we have also delivered policies which have provided tax cuts for our working families. On 1 January 2011 we introduced Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, where parents are able to stay home with their newborns or adopted children for 18 weeks at the minimum wage while retaining ties with their workplaces and easing the financial pressure on working families—a policy the opposition leader never would have implemented.


We began our rollout of the National Broadband Network, which will provide faster internet connections and allow those in rural areas to access high-speed internet—something the opposition left our country behind in. The NBN will bring affordable high-speed broadband to all Australians, no matter where they live. The NBN is creating jobs right here, is already being used in Tasmania and Armidale and will shortly be in other states. A new era of communication is arriving with better services and more competitive prices for Australians and Australian businesses. The NBN will change the way we live and work, ensure our economy keeps up with the rest of the world, give our children access to world-class educational resources and give us access to better health care. It will close the distance between our regions and cities and will give local businesses the opportunity to expand into markets anywhere in the world instantly.


The Prime Minister and Minister Conroy announced a $9 billion agreement with Telstra on the NBN. The agreement provides for the reuse of suitable Telstra infrastructure and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network and broadband HFC network capability during the NBN fibre rollout. This means less disruption to communities and less use of overhead cables.


We will shortly be introducing bills related to the minerals resource rent tax. The taxes on the enormous profits made by big mining companies will go towards building superannuation savings, allowing the government to increase the superannuation guarantee, which every worker is entitled to, from nine to 12 per cent. This means that a 30-year-old worker earning $65,000 annually today will have an extra $108,000 in superannuation savings at retirement. We have also succeeded in separating Telstra into retail and wholesale telecommunications businesses.


After injecting money into the economy, we stopped Australia from feeling the brunt of the global financial crisis. Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, you would be aware of the numerous ambassadors who appeared before the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade who overwhelmingly acknowledged the fiscal competence of our government compared to what they have experienced globally. We implemented the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which injected money into schools infrastructure and the Australian taxpayer. Today we are seeing the rollout of many of these infrastructure projects, and it is amazing to see what schools, local councils and other organisations would have missed out on if it were not for this government's swift action during the global financial crisis.


Though our strong economic management has kept 200,000 extra Australians in jobs, jobs are important to the Australian Labor Party. Since we took office in 2007 almost 750,000 jobs have been created. Almost 190,000 jobs were created in the last year. Nine out of 10 jobs created in the last 12 months are full-time positions. Our jobless rate is 5.1 per cent, compared with that of the US of 9.1 per cent, Canada on 7.2, the UK on 7.7, Germany on seven and New Zealand on 6.5 per cent. So you can see we have achieved in numerous areas and I will talk further in this discussion about a lot of other areas that we have delivered on as a govern­ment. At the start of the GFC Australia had the same unemployment rate as the US. If that were still the case, an extra 480,000 Australians would be jobless rate now. This government's swift and decisive policy response to the GFC helped safeguard tens of thousands of Australian jobs.


In the past year on one of our projects, Building the Education Revolution—a hallmark, in my opinion—I have been privileged to open over 100 school buildings, whether they were libraries, science centres or halls. It has been a marvellous project and is still delivering and being rolled out throughout our state of Queensland, as you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. I have heard nothing but praise during those openings, whether from principals, parents, P&C presidents, teachers or even the children of those schools. They come up and say, 'We thank the federal government for delivering on its promises.' They are overwhelmed by the new hall, the new library or the new science centre they are standing in and the facilities and the benefits they have got. There is no better benefit than the gift of education. For some schools, it was the first time they had a multipurpose hall and the very first time they were able to fit the whole school in one area. For some, it was the first time they had an actual library and no longer had to share a classroom with a room full of books. I have seen new kitchens to complement participation in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program, another fantastic government initiative. I have seen new music rooms and dance studios. For some schools, this was the biggest thing to happen in their school in years. As I said, principals, P&C presidents and students alike have praised the BER project and, on many occasions, have asked me to send my regards and thanks to the Prime Minister and Minister Chris Evans for making sure that the new halls, libraries, classrooms and science centres were completed.


I have a quote from the principal of Mount Mee State School. It says: 'The Building the Education Revolution has provided us many opportunities that we would not have received any other way.' There is no other way that a small school like Mount Mee would have at any point in time achieved a building like their new one or any of the other refurbishments that have taken place over the last 12 months. Another example is from Dr Regan Neumann, the principal of Kelvin Grove State College. It says: 'Thank you to the federal government for contributing the funds to make this happen at Kelvin Grove. We know that our place is a better place because of the financial contribution that was made to our college during 2010-11.' There are other examples, such as from Bronwyn Campbell from Albany Hills State School. It says: 'We thank you very much, Senator Furner, because this sort of opportunity has never come to primary schools in many years in education and it has been a wonderful gift to us. We appreciate that.'


The Gillard government also provided assistance to those who needed it in Queensland during the most devastating time of our lives, during the significant floods and Cyclone Yasi, and also in Victoria. We implemented a one-off levy which will assist in rebuilding our disaster affected areas, and those directly affected are exempt from paying the levy. Despite the injections into our economy and the costs of the natural disasters, the Gillard government has stuck to its promises and will deliver a surplus by 2013.


Not only are we delivering for our working families; we are also delivering effective policy. Despite a hung parliament, the government has secured the passage of 130 bills through the House of Representatives. The opposition leader, Mr Tony Abbott, has not provided a positive contribution to this government since becoming leader. We all know his position when it comes to policy and that is the single word of no. He says no to everything, even good policy. He opposed the stimulus package. He opposed all those school halls, libraries, science centres and areas of important needs for education in our schools around the country for the sake of who knows what. He opposed the flood recovery package to help Australians most in need. At their time of most need, he opposed it. He opposed our health reform package. Instead, while in government, he ripped $1 billion out of the health area. He has opposed our GP superclinics, which are seeing quality health care delivered to areas of need. One of those GP superclinics is just down the road from me and it is delivering marvellous outcomes for the residents in the seat of Dickson. The list goes on. There is a continual list. Time does not allow me to talk about all the achievements of this Gillard government. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (16:56):  On a day when so many hardworking Australians, particularly Western Australians, have travelled up to almost 4,000 kilometres to come to Canberra to express their lack of trust, faith and confidence in this Gillard government, it gives me no pleasure to talk about the trust, integrity and honesty of this Gillard government. Many, many Australians—the vast majority of Australians—have come to the conclusion in the last 12 months that this government is untrustworthy. That this government is not trusted by Australians is almost a universally accepted truth. Why is that? Why is it that Australians do not trust this government or this Prime Minister? Look no further than the calibre of its ministers and the leadership of the Prime Minister.


This Prime Minister has a very significant problem with one important aspect of public life. Some might say that this ability is an imperative in public life, a condition precedent to public life, a fundamental element in public life. And that is the capacity to tell the truth. The capacity to tell the truth is the most fundamental thing any individual can bring to parliament. On Kevin Rudd's leadership, she said, 'There is more chance that I would be full-forward for the Dogs than leading the Australian Labor Party.' She said at the time of the last election, 'We will have an East Timor processing centre,' and of course 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and 'Petrol will be exempt under the carbon tax.' Every Western Australian knows they receive their petrol via a truck weighing more than 4.5 tonnes. Are those truck drivers going to carry that cross? Of course they are not, and the Prime Minister knew it when she said that. There will be a carbon tax on petrol, and people living in regional Australia will be paying it through the nose. She well knows it. The Caltex refinery is one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide in Australia. They are unhappy with the compensation. What does that mean? It means they will pass the costs on. There will be a cost on petrol.


Of course the crowning glory of this last fortnight was when she said that she has confidence in Mr Craig Thomson. No, she has not. She has no confidence in Craig Thomson, but she has to say she does to cling with her fingernails to power. That is what she has to say. She has got no confidence whatsoever in this man, against whom the facts and the evidence are accumulating day by day, minute by minute. As set out by my colleague Senator Joyce, someone broke in, stole his credit card and forged his signature and then broke back in and put it back again. These are fundamental issues of trust, integrity and honesty. The recent history of this Prime Minister is such that she is failing those tests, day by day, minute by minute, hour by hour.


When we talk about maladministration we talk about one fundamental quality that ministers can bring to the parliament—a degree, a small iota, of competence. That is all we ask for: just a hint, just a sniff, of competence. This government delivers nothing of the sort—just the opposite. Peter Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, has established new lows in lack of confidence. The pink batt home insulation scheme was so good that people would fly into Australia, get a phone book and a book of the application forms, fill them out and send them off, the money would arrive in a post office box and then they would fly back to somewhere in South-East Asia. That is how good that scheme was. Then we had to pay billions of dollars to fix up those homes and make them fireproof. The most interesting fact of all is that 10,000 of those installers never lodged a tax return. It was the craziest, stupidest and most poorly administered scheme in the history of good governance. The BER had the same problem. The tax commissioner is flat out trying to find out who is paying tax for the BER. The returns are down. 


This government, through its incompetent ministers, has wasted somewhere between $5 billion and $7.5 billion. The Leader of the Government in the Senate mentioned the Super Seasprite in question time today. There were six Super Seasprites—unbelievable! We have the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry giving precedence in Australian public policy to a television program. This is a news-cycle-led government, a government that responds only to Four Corners, so the minister banned live exports to Indonesia with the stroke of a pen, leaving thousands of cattle in pens at ports around Australia having to be fed and managed—$320 million worth of industry chopped off at the knees overnight, with no notice, no consultation and no compensation. The government has no understanding. As I say, the minister brings massive amounts of incompetence to the table. These animals cannot be returned to pasture, because the pastures have faded in the seasonal nature of animal husbandry in the north of Australia. He took no advice from his department. A thousand or more jobs evaporated overnight on the end of his pen, many of them Aboriginal jobs. As precious as those jobs are, he just struck them out. If incompetence were an Olympic sport we would be red-hot favourites for the gold medal. We would be at our TVs, watching day in, day out.


Who is paying for all this mess? Who is paying for the $7 billion that has been just flushed down the drain? All those hard-working Australians who get up out of bed every day, go to work and pay their taxes, and particularly those in the booming, hard-working state of Western Australia—the powerhouse economy. That is who is paying for all of this. What do they get for their trouble? A mining tax. If you are successful under Labor, what does it do with you? It taxes the living daylights out of you. Magnetite is a huge industry for Western Australia. The magnetite industry does not want any handouts—it just wants government off its back—but the mining tax has spelt significant capital raising difficulties for the industry. The government knows this and has set about the task of killing the industry. What does it do to the mining industry? In addition to the mining tax, the government brings in a carbon tax. For people living in regional Australia, their fuel and groceries and everything else they freight into their towns will be much more expensive because every truck over 4.5 tonnes will have to pay the carbon tax. How do they come up with these schemes? This public policy fiasco is just typical.


I turn lastly to the absolute disgrace of border protection. This government cannot even protect our borders. Most of our Navy ships do not work. But, apart from that, we have people coming in in droves. In 2010, 85 boats carrying 4,939 people came in an unauthorised way to our shores. It is costing us $1.75 billion. No trust, no competence.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:26):  I congratulate Senator Fawcett on his first speech to the Senate, but I return to the matter being debated prior to Senator Fawcett's inaugural comments. I indicate, as a new senator, that I am completely dumbfounded and blown away this afternoon by just how out of touch those opposite are in seeking to raise this issue in the Senate. They seek to criticise the government for maladministration and for its handling and management of our economy during the global financial crisis. This is from a coalition who went to the last election campaign with a promise to cut services. It was a promise based on an $11 billion black hole in their budget costings. Just when you thought you had seen and heard it all—the height of hypocrisy from those opposite—we now learn that they seek to go to the next election with a promise of $70 billion worth of cuts to government services. This perfectly highlights the hypocrisy of those opposite and just how out of touch they are.


Labor came to government in 2007 with a significant reform agenda after a decade of stagnation and wasted opportunity under a coalition government. It was a program to move our country forward, to modernise our economy, to deliver better education services, to restore fairness to workplaces and to protect the environment for the next generation of Australians. This program was developed during the years in opposition in consultation with the Australian people. I, personally, was involved in travelling around New South Wales and meeting with workers, families, businesses and community organisations about their wishes from a Labor government. They told us that they wanted fairness restored to workplaces. They were sick and tired of having their children exploited—the vulnerable workers in our society—by individual contracts that cut award conditions and reduced their take-home pay. Labor heard their message, and in government we have delivered. We got rid of Work Choices and instituted the Fair Work Act, which has seen 740,000 jobs created in the Australian economy, a reduction in industrial disputes and an increase in the number of enterprise agreements made between employers and their workers. We have delivered on that promise. They wanted improved educational standards. They wanted a better opportunity for their children, and Labor heard their message. In government we are delivering a national curriculum that sets new, modern standards of educational attainment. That is being delivered by Labor in government.


They were sick and tired of out-of-date infrastructure in many schools throughout the country. Labor heard their pleas, and we are delivering. We are delivering modern infrastructure in each and every school throughout Australia—$16.2 billion being invested in the Building the Education Revolution program: 24,000 projects throughout this great nation of ours, 9½ thousand schools, new libraries, new computer and science facilities, new sporting and cultural facilities and new computer laboratories.


They wanted increased funding for universities, and Labor in government is delivering that. They wanted a skills base that delivered a better opportunity for manufacturing in the future. Labor heard their calls, and we are delivering. We are delivering trade training centres in 927 schools throughout Australia and 97,000 apprenticeships, a record for the last decade. That is all being delivered by Labor in government.


Australians, particularly those in rural and regional areas, told me that they were sick and tired of slow internet and web services, that they were sick of seeing Australia lingering at the bottom of the world league tables when it came to internet speed. Labor heard their pleas, and in government we are delivering on those commitments. We are rolling out the NBN in rural and regional Australia, delivering world-class broadband services for 93 per cent of households and businesses throughout the country and increasing speeds for those remaining seven per cent. This will revolutionise Australia's communication system, increase productivity and, most importantly, break down that tyranny of distance that exists in rural and regional areas—again, being delivered by Labor in government.


Australians told me that their family members are too important to be played around with when it comes to health care—that they were sick of health care being used as a political football. They were sick of the blame game between the states and the federal government. Labor has responded and listened to their concerns, delivering federal healthcare agreements that will see record investment in hospital funding, delivering GP superclinics to reduce the burden on our hospital emergency waiting rooms.


This Labor government is delivering a program of reform based on the wishes and concerns of Australians that we heard during our period in opposition. Contrast that with the program and policy offerings of those opposite. The opposition went to the last election with a promise to cut services. I have mentioned already that its program involved cutting trade trading centres. That would have affected 1,800 schools; 1.2 million students throughout this country would have had their opportunity at skills training diminished by an Abbott led government. For 11½ years those opposite failed to invest in a national curriculum. For rural and regional Australia, they had a plan to axe the $6 billion regional infrastructure fund. Their promises in relation to increasing speeds for broadband are there on the public record. They will rip up the National Broadband Network and rob rural and regional Australians of faster broadband. In health, the record of the Leader of the Opposition speaks for itself: cut $1 billion from our hospital system, equivalent to 1,025 beds across Australia.


When it comes to the biggest economic and social challenge facing our generation, the Leader of the Opposition has been all over the place. During the time John Howard was the leader of the party, he supported an ETS. When Malcolm Turnbull was the leader he initially supported an ETS, but then he changed his mind; he saw a vote in it. Now he does not support an ETS. One day he supports a five per cent cut in emissions by 2020; the next day he says that this is a crazy target.


The biggest example of maladministration in Australian politics in the last 20 years was the opposition's costings at the last federal election. Not only had they promised to cut services and cut programs, but their costings came up short—to the tune of $11 billion. Not even their accountants would give an unqualified audit of their figures. And they have the hide to criticise this government for its record on economic management, particularly in a period in which the Rudd-Gillard government has managed the largest economic crisis our country has seen in the last 50 years.


When the global financial crisis hit, the Rudd-Gillard government acted quickly and decisively in response to the threat to the Australian economy. We implemented a stimulus program that protected Australian workers' jobs. We protected communities and we protected our economy, so much so that Australia now has one of the best-performing economies in the world. We have an unemployment rate that is half that of the United States and the United Kingdom. We have a record terms of trade, and levels of net debt 6½ times below the OECD average. And we do this with a plan to increase superannuation and a plan to cut the company tax rate. In all respects, this government is delivering on behalf of the people of Australia, and it is a cogent plan for the future.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-08-22,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:36):  As I move around my electorate, the ACT, and travel to other places around Australia, I have to say that there is one sentiment that comes through almost universally, almost without fail. And it comes through even from people who I know have been supporters of the Labor Party in the past. It is a theme that recurs again and again—that is, that this Gillard Labor government has lost its way, that the government cannot be trusted, that the government she leads cannot be believed in what it says to the Australian people. And it is not difficult to see why. This government has systematically, comprehensively trashed its authority. You could not script a fall from grace, in the eyes of the Australian people, as perfectly as this government has executed it. If the polls are to be believed, no government in the history of Australian politics has spent so much on so many half-baked schemes to so little electoral benefit.


Why is this? Why is it that this government has so comprehensively lost its way and lost the confidence of the Australian people? It has lost their trust. Why? It is not hard to see why. The Australian people now see these examples recurring again and again before their eyes and they have become almost axioms in the eyes of many people.


Of course, the previous government, the Rudd government, broke such a long list of promises, such a litany of commitments to the Australian people, that their lack of trustworthiness on the question of keeping their word became almost legendary. The 10 minutes or so I have in this place does not give me a chance to even scratch the surface of those broken promises. They promised to cut the number of consultancies the federal government used; they in fact increased the number of consultancies. They promised a laptop on the desk of every school student; most of that scheme is yet to be delivered. They promised 260 childcare centres; only 38 were ultimately delivered. They promised 36 GP superclinics; I think only three have been delivered so far. They promised to stop whaling in our waters by Japanese whaling boats, a promise not delivered on. They promised a department of homeland security. They promised an election debates com­mission. They promised an Auditor-General review of government advertising. They promised to make sure all major projects would be subject to cost-benefit analyses. They promised a grocery choice scheme. They promised Fuelwatch. And the list goes on and on and on. It is not difficult to understand why people, who I suppose are already inured, to be frank, to a certain level of suspicion of politicians, would so compre­hensively believe that this government has reached the gold standard when it comes to breaking promises.


Ms Gillard was the deputy leader of the Rudd government and, since taking the reins of this government herself, has perfected the technique of breaking election promises. She has a host of broken promises to her own name. But of course one stands out, in a way which is in a sense a little hard to understand. It is the promise that she broke with respect to the carbon tax. It is a promise that was, in a sense, less audacious than many of those broken by her predecessor. But the fact is that this broken promise, the particular promise she made that there would 'be no carbon tax under the government I lead', has crystallised the Australian public's view of this government. This broken promise has told the Australian people more than any other broken promise made by this government that it cannot be trusted. It is a government not true to its word. And the government's shallow and unconvincing attempts to direct the ire of the Australian community away from that broken promise have been singularly unsuccessful. That is why today, a month or more after some of the details of this government's carbon tax have been laid on the table, it is still failing to reap much benefit from the delivery of this carbon tax and the details of this carbon tax because, frankly, far too many Australians have ceased to listen to this government, are no longer interested in what this government has to say, because they simply do not believe what they hear.


The recent events surrounding the member for Dobell reinforce yet again the sense that this government is a government that is not prepared to live by its word. A government that promised transparency in government, a government that promised a higher standard with respect to the behaviour of ministers and members than the previous government had exhibited, has delivered what I think can fairly be described as the most conspicuously disgraceful piece of cover-up that this community has seen for a very long time.


The opposition acknowledges that the member for Dobell may face proceedings, and he is absolutely entitled to the presumption of innocence with respect to those proceedings. But there are other matters that the member for Dobell has faced which are not on-foot, which are concluded and about which the parliament deserves an explanation—and neither the public nor the parliament has received that explanation. Again, even if the Prime Minister were to offer an explanation as to, for example, why $90,000 of funds of members of the Australian Labor Party has been put to settling a defamation action which was promptly then cancelled and the money used to disburse legal costs, even if the Prime Minister were to account today for why that occurred, I doubt that many Australians would be listening to hear—because they have ceased to trust her and her government.


The matter of public importance motion that has been moved today again draws attention to this government's maladministra­tion. Again, in just a few minutes it is impossible to do more than scratch the surface of that—broken promise after broken promise, botched execution of a scheme after botched execution of a scheme. The figures entailed in these failures of administration almost boggle the mind. On the govern­ment's own appointed assessor's view, for example, of its BER scheme, the Building the Education Revolution scheme, we hear that waste in public schools in New South Wales and Victoria alone cost $1.53 billion—a loss of effectiveness of $1,530 million has been squandered by this government on their own independent commissioner's assessment.


Yet these days it almost does not register with the Australian community because its level of waste and mismanagement is of such a scale that that figure almost means nothing. The $50 million wasted on the pink batts scheme is small fry in comparison with that; the $67 million wasted on the set-top box program; the concern in the community about the $25 million to sell a carbon tax before the scheme has even passed the parliament and even before people understand what is entailed in the scheme; and there is the $7 million wasted on market research testing federal government policies. We do not need market research to know what is happening to federal government policies. Then there is the abject failure, the smoking ruin, of a policy that the government's so-called Malaysian solution represents. This has again simply reinforced the sense that this government has reached a gold standard when it comes to broken promises and maladministered schemes.


I am concerned about these things because the value of Australian government, the authority of Australian government, is an important asset that everybody in this chamber ought to protect. At the end of the day, whoever takes responsibility for the Treasury benches needs to be able to deliver a certain number of programs and actions through the credibility of being the government of the country. I do not know that anybody can occupy the Treasury benches of this country anytime soon and look the Australian people in the eye and command that kind of respect, precisely because of the way in which this government has trashed that authority and debased that currency.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:46):  This matter of public importance has again demonstrated the fact that Her Majesty's opposition really is just a one-trick pony. All they offer is relentless negativity and carping criticism of the government. And of course the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, is relentlessly and exclusively negative. I have to say that as each day passes he becomes more extreme, more reckless and more inconsistent in what he says.


I give Mr Abbott great credit for being an absolute expert in rewriting history. He is very good at it. Look at what he said about a carbon tax, or an emissions trading scheme. He said he never supported one. But on Star FM Gippsland on 19 July 2011 he said, 'I mean, that is my position and that has always been my position. But I've never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme and what the coalition is proposing to do is to take what some people call ""no regrets"" action.' Well, what about when he supported a tax, like on Sky News on 29 July 2009:


I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax.


Or what about when he supported an emissions trading scheme, like on 2UE on 29 November 2009: 'You cannot have a climate change policy without supporting this ETS at this time.' Or on ABC Lateline on 2 October 2009: 


We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS.


That is just out of Mr Abbott's own mouth.


But it is an incredible thing that Mr Abbott is so negative he is now even against himself, and that takes some doing. He reckons his own ETS target is crazy, although it depends on who the audience is. For example, on 18 July 2011 on mamamia.com he said:


Both the government and the opposition accept that Australia should reduce our emissions by 5 per cent by 2020.


But, at a seniors forum on the same day he said: 'And the other crazy thing about this is that at the same time that our country is proposing to reduce its emissions by five per cent, just five per cent, the Chinese are proposing to increase their emissions by 500 per cent.' It is a remarkable thing when somebody is so negative that they are even against themselves, and Mr Abbott of course has achieved that.


Those with an interest in the history of cinema might remember Groucho Marx singing Whatever It Is, I'm Against It, which was composed by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, in that famous 1932 Marx Brothers film, Horse Feathers. It struck me that, if the Liberal Party are looking for a campaign jingle or Mr Abbott would like to have a theme song, there it is: Whatever It Is, I'm Against It from Horse Feathers.


I thought today I might take the opportunity on this matter of public importance to share some of those lyrics with you. Of course, unlike some senators I will not be singing the lyrics!


The first verse is this:


I don’t know what they have to say, 


It makes no difference anyway—


Whatever it is, I’m against it! 


No matter what it is or who commenced it, 


I’m against it. 


It is very Mr Abbott, don't you think? The second verse seems as relevant today for Mr Abbott as it was when Kalmar and Ruby penned it 80 years ago. Let me share that with the Senate:


Your proposition may be good 


But let’s have one thing understood—


Whatever it is, I’m against it! 


And even when you’ve changed it or condensed it, 


I’m against it. 


Then if you did not like the first two verses there is always the third verse—and you are smiling, Madam Acting Deputy President Coonan, so I assume you did like my rendition of it.




Senator Colbeck:
  The tempo is wrong.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I have not sung the words; I have merely read them into the Hansard. The third verse goes on:


I’m opposed to it—


On general principles I’m opposed to it! 


The third verse finishes with some perfect lyrics which my friends in the Liberal Party can take to the party room when it meets tomorrow morning. This is the chorus:


He’s opposed to it! 


In fact, in word, in deed, 


He’s opposed to it! 


I would commend any interested senator, or anybody else who might like to take a closer look at this, to listen to Groucho Marx perform the original in Horse Feathers. It is just uncanny if you shut your eyes and listen. You would think it was not Groucho Marx 80 years ago but that it is Tony Abbott today. That is the Liberal Party for you. On the other hand, the government is continually doing what is necessary to keep Australia's economy strong, to look to the future, to provide opportunity to all, to have the determination to do what is right, even if there are some costs from time to time in short-term popularity. 


Look at what has happened in the last few weeks. The government has finalised national health reform arrangements which will deliver a better deal for patients including a $16.4 billion investment in the health system. Also the government has made great progress in major reform of disability services in Australia to lay the foundation of a national disability insurance scheme. The Productivity Commission has recommended that, like Medicare, Aust­ralians should be insured against significant disability. The government has taken up that report and has committed an additional $10 billion this year to build the foundations for reform. And in aged care, the government has released the 2011 Productivity Commission report Caring for Older Australians. The government is determined to make the necessary reforms to our aged care system as part of a broader aged care agenda that will deliver positive outcomes for older Australians and also for those who care for them. In the face of relentless negativity, I would say the government continues to do what is necessary to keep Australia's economy strong and to make positive reforms for the future.

CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ANTI-DUMPING IMPROVEMENTS) BILL 2011


I am pleased to present the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011, representing the first tranche of legislation implementing the Government’s improvements to Australia’s anti-dumping system.  


The package of improvements announced by the Gillard Government on the 22nd of June 2011, are the most important changes to Australia’s anti-dumping regime in more than a decade.  These changes will improve the way we administer global anti-dumping rules in Australia, and better align our laws and practices with other countries.


These changes overall will improve the anti-dumping system’s effectiveness and they are vital because, even though our economy is strong, some local industries are vulnerable to dumping.  


The Government’s package of improvements to the anti-dumping system will help keep our economy strong and provide greater certainty and support for our local industries, workers, families and communities against unfair dumping practices.


The package of improvements announced by the Government on June the 22nd include the Government’s response to the Productivity Commission’s Report into Australia’s anti-dumping system. These changes also respond to issues identified by Senator Xenophon, in a Private Member's Bill introduced into the Senate in March, and also take account of important issues that have been raised by stakeholders in relation to the operation of Australia’s anti-dumping system.


The improvements that I am introducing today capture four key themes which have been at the heart of the Government’s detailed examination of how the existing anti-dumping system can be improved.


First, these changes improve the timeliness of the anti-dumping system through the imposition of a time-limit on Ministerial decision making. 


Second, we will improve decision-making by clarifying that all appropriate and relevant factors which may indicate material injury to an Australian industry are specifically listed as factors to which the Minister may have regard. 


Third, these changes aim to provide greater comparability of Australia’s anti-dumping system with those of other jurisdictions, and further implement the relevant World Trade Organization Agreements which provide the basis for  internationally agreed anti-dumping rules. 


Fourth, these changes will clarify that  parties with a clear interest in anti-dumping matters are expressly given an opportunity to participate in anti-dumping investigations.


These amendments were developed after consultation with industry, and subsequently drafted in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Department, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in order to ensure that they are consistent with Australia’s international legal obligations.


Timeframe for Ministerial decision making.


In relation to the improved timeliness of the system, these amendments provide that the Minister will exercise decision-making powers within 30 days of receiving a report or recommendation on which to make a decision.  


Unlike all the other decisions and processes in the anti-dumping system there are currently no legislative time constraints governing the Minister’s decision. 


The responsible Minister has a large range of decision-making functions in the anti-dumping system and may make decisions following:


an investigation to determine whether anti-dumping or countervailing measures should be imposed, 


a continuation inquiry to determine whether anti-dumping or countervailing measures should continue beyond the specified expiry date, 


a review of measures to determine whether measures should be varied to reflect contemporary market conditions, or revoked where they are no longer justified, or 


a review (appeal) to the Review Officer of an earlier Ministerial decision, including where relevant, where a re-investigation has been performed by Customs and Border Protection.  


The amendments provide that, subject to extenuating circumstances, the Minister will make a decision within 30 days of receiving the relevant report/recommendations.


There are clear benefits in imposing a time limit on Ministerial decision-making, providing greater certainty for parties, and ultimately reducing the overall timeframe to conclude an investigation. Maintaining Australia’s comparatively brief investigative timeframes is important because anti-dumping investigations affect the commercial operations of a range of stakeholders.  




Consideration of injury factors



In relation to improved decision making, these amendments provide that, in determining whether material injury to an Australian industry has been or is being caused or is threatened, the Minister may consider any impacts on jobs and any impact on investment in the domestic industry producing like goods to the goods the subject of the investigation. 


The Customs Act currently contains a list of relevant economic factors which the Minister may have regard to when determining material injury, however, certain injury factors could be more adequately considered when assessing whether dumping or subsidisation has caused material injury. 


The impact on jobs and investment in an industry are two such factors. 


The amendments provide that the Minister can consider any impact on jobs in the domestic industry producing like goods, not just the effects currently specified. As well as the wage rate and the number of workers employed, the Minister would be able to consider all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment, including the number of hours worked and the incidence of part-time employment. 


The amendments also provide that the Minister can examine any impact on investment in the industry, to again ensure that a broad examination of the factors affecting investment is permitted. 




Expanding the list of actionable subsidies



In relation to ensuring that Australia’s anti-dumping system is in step with comparable administrations, these amendments ensure that Australian industry can apply for countervailing duties on the full range of actionable subsidies provided by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. 


These WTO Agreements specify the types of government subsidies that can be actioned by another country.  Australian legislation has not reflected the fact that some subsidies were excluded on a temporary basis. As a result, Australian companies cannot currently seek remedies in relation to these subsidies.


These amendments update the Customs Act to reflect all countervailable subsidies under the WTO including certain assistance:


for research activities conducted by firms or by higher education and research establishments


for disadvantaged regions pursuant to a general framework of regional development


to enable firms to adapt to new environmental requirements, and for a variety of government programs that provide services or benefits to agriculture.


These amendments ensure that Australian companies can take action against subsidies of this nature where such subsidies cause material injury.  Australian companies will therefore be operating on a level-playing field compared to manufacturers and producers in other jurisdictions, as they are no longer disadvantaged by restrictions associated with out of date legislation.




Expanding the definition of “interested party” 



In relation to accessibility, these amendments ensure that all relevant parties are expressly recognised as having rights to participate in anti-dumping and countervailing investigations as an “interested party”. 


An “interested party” to an investigation is currently defined in section 269T of the Customs Act to comprise, in broad terms, domestic manufacturers and producers, importers, exporters, trade organisations and foreign governments.


Submissions to Government suggest that in the present system some stakeholder groups, who should be engaged, are not properly engaged in anti-dumping investigations. 


The amendments clarify that industry associations, trade unions and downstream industry (whether or not they are an importer) who have a direct interest in a particular matter can be treated as interested parties.  The amendments further confirm that these parties can participate in an investigation. 


This change will not affect the present standing requirements determining who can bring an application for anti-dumping or countervailing measures.  Rather, the amendments make it clear who has a right to participate in investigations once an application is initiated.  


These amendments will facilitate the provision of relevant information to Customs and Border Protection during the investigation phase and ensure that reports and recommendations made to the Minister take account of the views and interests of this broader range of stakeholders.




Concluding remarks



The Government is committed to ensuring that we have an effective, accessible anti-dumping system that complies with WTO obligations. The first tranche of changes set out in this Bill, directly respond to concerns expressed by stakeholders about the accessibility and timeliness of the anti-dumping system.  These amendments will further strengthen the anti-dumping system by improving decision-making in relation to how material injury to an Australian industry is assessed. 


It will also improve accessibility by ensuring that interested parties with a stake in  an anti-dumping matter will have the opportunity to participate and be heard in anti-dumping investigations. 


The Government believes that better support can be provided to our local industries and workforce with a streamlined, rigorous and better resourced anti-dumping system.  The Government’s package of improvements, of which this Bill is the first tranche, will provide more certainty for local manufacturers and primary producers resulting in more confidence to invest in the future.  Indeed, the rules against unfair dumping practices will be more effectively applied.


This Bill will result in better access to the anti-dumping system; improved timeliness; improved quality of decision making and greater consistency with other countries, in line with WTO guidelines.


INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT (INVENTORY) BILL 2011


I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment (Inventory) Bill 2011 which amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 (the Act). 


The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act establishes a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals used in Australia to aid in the protection of human health and safety and the environment, to provide for registration of certain persons proposing to introduce industrial chemicals and to enable making of national standards for cosmetics manufactured or imported into Australia. The National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), administers the Act. The activities of NICNAS therefore underpin essential advice to other Government agencies which collectively make up Australia's regulatory system for industrial chemicals


The Bill presents amendments that continue to deliver on the Government's commitment to decreasing regulatory burden and efficiently using resources while maintaining health and environmental safety.


The Bill does this by implementing important parts of NICNAS's continuing reform program, namely, the completion of the reforms to the cosmetic therapeutic interface and making technical, but no less important changes to enhance the administration and efficiency of the scheme's assessment processes. 


The Bill underpins completion of the cosmetic regulatory reforms largely implemented through amendment of the Act in 2007 as part of the Low Regulatory Concern Chemicals reform initiative.


In 2007, in order to facilitate the transfer of regulatory responsibility for certain low-risk products at the therapeutic-cosmetic interface from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (the TGA) to NICNAS, changes to the Act resulted in the introduction of the NICNAS Cosmetics Standard. The Standard enabled NICNAS to regulate certain cosmetics by prescribing minimum standards for these products in Australia and imposed penalties for non-compliance. However, a mechanism to transfer the chemicals in these cosmetic products from the TGA onto the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS) had not been developed at that time. 


In the absence of the transfer mechanism, some introducers of the chemicals have to meet the requirements of the new chemicals framework with the associated notification and assessment costs or reporting obligations. 


The proposed Bill will make the necessary changes to the Act to address this regulatory gap in the protection of public health and enable proper regulation of chemicals in these cosmetics products through entry of the chemicals on the national Inventory.


This regulatory mechanism used to transfer chemicals in cosmetics (which have been transferred from the TGA to NICNAS) can also be used for other chemicals. This means that chemicals in products previously regulated by other Commonwealth agencies can be smoothly transferred to NICNAS.


The power to place chemicals that have been transferred to NICNAS onto the AICS will be open and transparent. As some chemicals to be transferred to NICNAS may not have been assessed by the other Commonwealth agency, the transfer procedure will allow public submissions on a proposal to include or not include a transferred chemical onto the AICS. The Director's decision to include or not include a transferred chemical on AICS is also reviewable by the AAT.


In cases where transferred chemicals have been assessed and controls have been implemented by the other agency, the controls will be able to be maintained, ensuring that legal obligations to comply with pre-existing controls are preserved.




For example, the cosmetic reforms in 2007 included the transfer of regulatory responsibility for secondary sunscreen products which are applied to the skin (for example, moisturisers containing a sunscreening chemical). Currently, NICNAS assesses the UV filter chemicals in these products by requesting, on a case by case basis, the additional data required for sunscreens under the TGA.





The Bill addresses the more efficient collection of these data by creating a new section in the schedule of data requirements to include those requirements that are specific to UV filters. 




The intent of this amendment to the Schedule is to formalise current arrangements and maintain a consistent approach to the assessment of these chemicals across regulatory schemes. 



The Bill also makes technical amendments to the Schedule to the Act to improve clarity and consistency to other data requirements for new chemicals assessments. These proposed technical amendments will not place any significant additional requirements on the industrial chemicals industry. 


One technical amendment removes the current requirement for NICNAS to publish summary assessment reports. 


The need to publish summary reports was originally included in the Act at a time when NICNAS assessment reports were only available in hard copy and had to be purchased. As a result, a summary report was made available free of charge. With the advent of the Internet, the NICNAS assessment reports are now freely available on the NICNAS website, rendering the publication of summary reports obsolete. However, to facilitate public access to these reports, NICNAS will publish a short notice outlining the key content of new assessment reports in the Chemical Gazette, with a link to those reports.


These amendments have been developed in response to industry and community concerns and in close consultation with industry, government and the community. The proposed amendments enable NICNAS to properly regulate chemicals used in cosmetics (and any other chemicals transferred from other Commonwealth regulatory schemes) and improve current data requirements and administrative processes to provide a more efficient process and make more information available to stakeholders. The Bill does this while, of course, maintaining existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards. 


These amendments therefore represent an important step in improving the operation of Australia's framework for regulating chemicals and reflect the Government's commitment to ensure the most efficient regulatory system is in place for industrial chemicals, including those in cosmetics.


NATIONAL HEALTH REFORM AMENDMENT (NATIONAL HEALTH PERFORMANCE AUTHORITY) BILL 2011


Today I am introducing legislation that will form part of the new backbone of a modern, integrated, high performing health system.


It is a result of the Government’s historic agreement with all states and territories to undertake fundamental reform of our health and hospitals system.


Today I am taking a critical step with the introduction of this legislation to create a National Health Performance Authority – the new watchdog for Australia’s health system.


The performance authority will work to:


open up the performance of the health and hospital system to new levels of national transparency and accountability


allow for the identification of high performing parts of the health system so those successes can be transferred to other areas


identify areas of the health system that require improvement so that action can be taken; and


improve the health care choices of Australians in making key decisions about their own health care needs


This forms one critical element of a new health system – one that is sustainable, transparent, efficient, high-performing and well resourced.


The reform of Australia’s health system is one of the most important public policy challenges of this generation.


In many ways we are lucky that Australia has one of the most impressive public health systems in the world – our doctors and nurses are world class, our public system provides free hospital care for all and it delivers outcomes such as low infant mortality and long life expectancy. 


But we’re faced with a health system that is fragmented, costly, under resourced, unsustainable, overly focused on acute care and with constant pressure to deliver for more patients with more complex needs.


And our access is not truly universal – improving the health of Australia’s first peoples remains a massive challenge.


All of this would be challenge enough – but add to this the fact that Australia’s ‘baby boomers’ are now starting to retire. This population bubble will place more pressure on our hospitals as doctors and nurses retire, and more people require acute care.


We’ve attacked these challenges ferociously since we entered office in 2007. We’ve taken the short term measures that have been needed to avert pressures becoming crisis while we’ve worked to reshape our health system for the long term. 


Hospital funding increased by $20 billion, over 70,000 more elective surgery operations have been delivered, the cap on the number of GPs being trained has been lifted with 475 new doctors now in training, the number of nurse places in universities has increased by over 1,000 a year, and primary care and preventative health is a renewed focus for government. And just this week I have announced 518 trainee specialist places - a ten fold increase compared to 2007. 


But truly putting our health system on a sustainable path requires fundamental reform. A genuine national deal was needed to make the changes necessary to ensure our health system is not overwhelmed by the rising costs of health treatment, to provide safer and higher quality services, to manage the demand for health services from an ageing population and the need for effective reporting and monitoring on the performance of health service providers.


The Government is now delivering this. Our 13 February agreement with all Australian states and territories on health reform creates a genuine partnership that will deliver much needed change to our health system.  


The partnership that this Government has entered into with the states and territories demonstrates our commitment to action on health reform, and most importantly, to take decisive action to deliver a better deal for patients, and a better deal for communities.


It means more money for hospital beds, increased local control of health services, greater transparency and less waste.


One of the greatest challenges facing our health system is ensuring it has enough money into the future.


Therefore, the Government will inject an extra $19.8 billion into public hospitals, on top of the extra $20 billion we have already provided, and develop robust national standards to make sure that money is directed straight to hospitals and patients.


The Government will meet 45 per cent of the growth in efficient hospital costs by 2014-15 and 50 per cent from 2017-18.  From that point, the Commonwealth and the states and territories will meet the cost of efficient hospital funding growth on an equal basis.  The Commonwealth’s contribution will include funding of no less than $16.4 billion towards public hospital funding growth over the next decade, and $3.4 billion extra for emergency departments, elective surgery and 1,316 sub-acute hospital beds over the next four years.


A new national funding pool will be created which will deliver unprecedented transparency in the way hospitals are funded.  These changes to the funding arrangements will provide security for hospital services into the future, combined with important changes in the delivery of vital health services.


But in order to drive improvements in patient outcomes, it is vital that patients have access to better information about the performance of hospitals and other key health care providers.


This Government is committed to increasing the transparency of government and the services it delivers.


We firmly believe that with transparency comes a greater chance of improving public services and empowering the public to make decisions based on the best information.


There’s no better example of that than our reforms to the way that parents can make decisions about their children’s education through the MySchool website.


Building on this success in the health portfolio we have also implemented the MyHospitals website which for the first time allows all Australians to see the performance of their individual hospitals including waiting times for elective surgery procedures and emergency department care.


Our health reforms will drive this further. We’ve listened to the advice of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission that said performance reporting would “promote a culture of continuous improvement” and improve consumer literacy of the health system. .


They recommended the development of national access targets, performance reporting that compares the clinical performance of hospitals and health services (both public and private) and reporting on safety and quality performance and patient satisfaction. 


Our health reform agreement delivers on that reporting, targets and transparency to improve health services.


This includes:


new national standards for emergency department care and elective surgery to improve waiting times for patients in our hospitals; and


a new Performance and Accountability Framework so that hospitals will have to measure and report on a range of performance, safety and quality and output measures.


This work to improve transparency will not happen by itself. It requires dedicated resources and an independent authority to oversee the work.


So the Bill I am moving today will establish an independent body to drive this performance and transparency agenda. The National Health Performance Authority will exist to improve quality, increase transparency and drive value for money in the health system.


It will drive transparency in the health system by improving Australian’s access to vital health information. Australians will have more access to information on their local hospitals, health services, primary health care and community health services. 


The Authority will monitor and report assessments on the new Local Hospital Networks, public hospitals, private hospitals, and Medicare Locals. 


The Authority will publicly report this information through new Hospital performance reports and Healthy Community Reports – that will be available for Australians to see on the Internet.


These reports will show how each Local Hospital Network and Medicare Local is performing – as well as individual hospitals, private hospitals and other organisations.


To achieve this the Authority will collect, analyse and interpret performance information and promote and conduct research into new and existing performance tools. Where performance needs to be measured in a new way – the authority will have the ability to develop new measurements to assess performance.


Other performance related tasks may also be referred to the Authority.


Its independence will ensure that Australians know that nationally comparable information will be available and that it has been independently analysed.


It will mean that Australians will have a much better picture of how their health services are performing – and the differences in performance between big cities, outer metropolitan areas, regional centres and remote services. That will give further impetus to improve the equality of service provision. 


To ensure the Performance Authority’s membership has the necessary degree of health care expertise in rural and regional health issues, at least one member must have substantial experience and standing in the health care needs of people living in regional or rural areas, and must understand the challenges of providing first class health care services to these Australians.


Seven members of the authority will be ministerially appointed in line with the health reform agreement – a chair from the Common­wealth, a Deputy Chair from the states and territories and five members to be appointed with the agreement of the Commonwealth and the states and territories.


Consistent with COAG’s original decision in April 2010, the Performance Authority is to be established as a statutory authority under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, or FMA Act.


A Chief Executive Officer will be ministerially appointed after consultations with the National Health Performance Authority.  The Chief Executive Officer will manage the Authority and will be directly accountable to the Common­wealth Health Minister for the financial management of the Agency.  The Chief Executive Officer will serve on a full time basis for a period of up to five years, and is eligible for re-appointment.


Through this Bill, Australia can take another large leap on the path to a modern, high-performing health system. One that prioritises continuous improvement and accountability to the patients it serves.


This will be a powerful independent watchdog body that by using the power of accurate information will push our hospitals to deliver better services and push our primary health sector to develop and improve. 


It will guide policy makers to develop better solutions that give greater account to our regional differences – and will help patients to make better decisions on their own care.


This is one of the first steps of our major national health reforms. Reforms which are critical to delivering for Australians a health system that delivers the services to Australians that we deserve and expect.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (18:04):  When this debate was interrupted by question time, I was just making some final comments on the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 to express the opposition's concerns about some of the elements of the bill and to express our concern at the unwillingness of the government to listen to what are genuine concerns that the opposition holds that the government is effectively held captive, particularly by the relationships that it has with the Greens in relation to some of the measures in the legislation and in the drafting of the regulations.


As I was saying just before question time, the reality is that there is a very significant likelihood that, as far as sequestration of carbon is concerned, the effect of this legislation will be very minimal because it is so restrictive. According to the National Farmers Federation, you will not even be able to plant a windbreak. That is obviously a common practice, and it will be ruled out under this process. A lot of the opportunities for reintroducing vegetation back into the landscape—which is one of the objectives of this piece of legislation—like the replanting of riparian reserves and putting some native vegetation back around those sensitive zones, because they are common practice will be ruled out by the additionality test. Under the methodologies, they will be restricted.


We are also concerned that the govern­ment has not been prepared to listen to what I think were very sensible suggestions of behalf of the opposition around the risk of reversal test. As I have said in a number of contributions on this piece of legislation, a blanket five per cent really does not make sense given the significant variability in the risks of reversal for different forms of sequestration, whether it be through native vegetation and trees or soil sequestration, which is something that is obviously still being developed. The fact that there is a range of risk factors in the risk of reversal process indicates to the opposition—which the government is unfortunately not prepared to take up—that the risk of reversal process should be included in the methodologies for the various plans, because that is where they are best assessed and dealt with.


The other issue is water. For the first time that I can recall, the government has placed in the legislative process a requirement to have a high-security water licence for growing trees, particularly in high rainfall areas. The government has just placed blanket ranges for those required high-quality water rights. Again, that is something that should be much better developed and dealt with in the methodologies because it is very dependent on the species, the location in the catchment and the topography of the land that it is being developed on. Here we have a very fixed approach to dealing with issues that have significant sensitivities and variabilities across different methods. It is really disappointing that we still do not have some of the information that assesses the impacts of this legislation. We expressed concerns about that during the Senate inquiry process. Obviously we still do not have information that we could use to assess the impacts of these measures.


We can talk about what the government is trying to achieve with this legislation versus what it is doing in other policy processes. For example, something that went ahead with the agreement of the opposition was the attempt to ensure that the right things were planted in the right places on agricultural land, but in Tasmania, in a backdoor deal with the Greens, the government is looking to lock up significant areas of Tasmanian native forests and replace that resource with plantations. Under the projections that I have seen, this will take up 100,000 hectares of Tasmania's agricultural land, which is something like 10 per cent of the area.


The government is seeking to reduce carbon emissions but under its carbon tax it is ruling out biomass, which could reduce by 96 per cent something of the order of 8,000 gigawatt hours of electricity generation. Bear in mind that on a life-cycle basis, biomass produces only four percent of the emissions released when generating electricity by using coal. So in one circumstance the government says that it is looking to reduce CO2 emissions but its actions in another are doing the opposite.


We expressed our concerns about the stated intentions of the government versus what its actions really are. As I have said, with the restrictions that are placed around this piece of legislation the opposition is concerned that it will not sequester much carbon at all. Because of the lack of work that has been done and the amount of work that remains to be done to get this particular program operational, it probably will not have sequestered anything by the time we get to the next election, which is a pity. Also, the operation of this mechanism will change significantly if we get to the stage of operating it in conjunction with an emissions trading scheme.


I will conclude my remarks by expressing disappointment that the government seems to be held hostage by the Greens in its decision making processes rather than taking a sensible approach. I think some of the opposition's suggestions in and around the methodologies are quite sensible. We could have a piece of legislation that would be effective in sequestering carbon, be of use to farmers and have some effect, but because of the sensitivities and the impositions of the Greens we are going to have something that really does not do much for farmers at all.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (21:51):  In June this year the 60th anniversary of the Australian Local Government Women's Association was held with a particularly wonderful celebration at Old Parliament House. We had a cocktail party with the Governor-General followed by a dinner. A couple of days before the event I received a phone call from Kaele Way, a woman I had met several times previously in her role as an activist for women in local government and an activist for women generally. I had met her a number of times through the Australian women's secretariat and also the National Rural Women's Coalition. Kaele had rung me to say that she was not very well, that the battle with cancer that she had been raging very strongly for a particularly long time was coming to an end. She was concerned that I would be upset if I saw how ill she was when she came to this event. I think that shows the kind of woman that Kaele Way was. She cared more for others than she did for herself. Tonight I particularly want to pay my respect to this genuinely inspirational woman.


I only knew Ms Kaele Way in her role in the local government area and I found out that she was elected to local government in 1997. She spent six years as a councillor in the City of Whitehorse, where she became active in the Australian Local Government Women's Association. She was a founding member of the Women's Participation in Local Government Coalition and a member of their steering committee. She produced a 'gender agenda', a guide for women seeking election in local government in Victoria, a candidate information pack. Kaele believed that it was important for women to have options in their careers and options in moving into local government.


She was a passionate advocate for strong, representative local government and she wanted to ensure that many more women had the experience that she had had in that form of government. She understood the need for mentoring. In fact, on a number of the times I met her she talked so effectively about the way that women who had had success would then be able to share so that they could bring other women greater options and greater opportunities.


She enjoyed her work representing her community so much, and then she took on a greater role in the various groups that support local government and our com­munity. She served as the Victorian state president of the Australian Local Govern­ment Women's Association from 2002 to 2005. I think largely due to her own passionate advocacy, the branch increased its membership from 13 members to 110 members. In that period she also felt that there was a need to review the national board's constitution. She was vice-president of the national board from 2002 to 2004 and the National President of the Australian Local Government Women's Association from 2004 to 2009. As I have said, she actually understood the importance of effective mentoring and was particularly passionate in this aspect of her support for women's participation. Under her steward­ship as the national president, the importance and the growth of the Australian Local Government Women's Association spread throughout the country. I think one of her proudest moments was when she was made a life member of the ALGWA just before she died.


During the 2005 local government election campaign, she conducted her own campaign, which is always very stressful. Naturally she won that clearly. But at the same time she mentored three other women candidates to successful election to office in local government. They understood the work that Kaele had done and they respected the passion that she had for the organisation and the personal support that she gave to each of them.


In 2007, she was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women—one of only 20 women to have that honour. In 2008, which was a really important year for Victorian women, she won a Victorian Centenary of Suffrage grant to produce and co-author the article 'Taking up the challenge' in the 2008 candidates' hand­book—again, sharing experience and knowledge and opening the door for other women.


She was the chair of the Australian Local Government Women's Association national steering committee for the implementation of the national framework for women in local government and in 2009 was appointed deputy chair of the Victorian regional development Australia committee for the east metro region. This woman just did not know how to say no when there were requests for more help. She saw that by working effectively together there could be better local government, better representation and more clarity for women in these roles. I think one of the proudest moments for Kaele, her family and so many of the women she helped was in 2009 when she was granted an Australian AM for her work for women in local government.


Many people were able to talk with Kaele because she made herself available personally and by phone and email to women across our country and, I believe, inter­nationally on the issues of local government mentorship and leadership. When she was asked at one stage to give her opinion on what was the greatest challenge for women that she had encountered in her lifetime, she said:


Working environment—acceptance of dual roles of motherhood and career path. Equal opportunity—although it remains an issue in regard to equal pay, career paths, decision making especially on boards.


She understood the need for work-life balance, but she knew that women could support other women in their roles and the best possible support was for that sharing to occur.


She further advocated in the same interview for work-life balance and said that there was a genuine commitment needed across all organisations. She desperately wanted to see a greater recognition of younger women in their career achievements as well as an acknowledgement of older women's skills and experience and their right to continue in the workplace. She wanted to ensure that women were in decision-making positions, particularly in corporate and political organisations, and that they were able to be represented on all boards and committees across all levels of government—local, state and federal.


Kaele was a gracious, passionate advocate for women in local government. Her work in the Australian Local Government Women's Association is legendary and inspirational. When we lost her in early July 2011, my friend Darriea Turley, who is the current national ALGWA president, paid tribute to Kaele and her family and said that all members of the organisation were saddened by Kaele's passing. She went on to say:


Kaele had such a strong work ethic and set a bench mark that we can all only aspire to reach. Kaele was a catalyst for the Australian Local Government Women's Association and her efforts ensured that ALGWA as a national body did have a 'Way Forward'.


It was a great evening when we gathered together at Old Parliament House to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Australian Local Government Women's Association. I think I will always have a memory of Kaele, beautifully dressed and groomed as always, with her partner, Alan. Kaele at that stage was in a wheelchair. She was proudly wearing the AM medal that she got for her work with local government and talking with the Governor-General about why it is important that women have oppor­tunities. I was truly inspired by this gracious lady. I know that her words and work will continue to inspire other women as they make their own choices about levels of representation. I think it is so important that we remember the work of women such as Kaele Way. We acknowledge her work and we acknowledge her family. I particularly want to pay my respects to her family, to Alan and her children, and say thank you to all of them for allowing us to share Kaele Way in as many ways as we possibly can. I know that her words and work will continue to inspire many into the future. Vale Kaele.
