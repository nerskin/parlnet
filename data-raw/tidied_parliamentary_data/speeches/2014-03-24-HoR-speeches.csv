Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (10:08):  I rise to present a report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the 2012-13 annual reports of bodies established under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act.


Section 243 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act specifies the duties of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which include to examine each annual report that is prepared by a body established by the ASIC Act. The report on the 2012-13 annual reports has been prepared in accordance with section 243 of the ASIC Act.


For this report, the committee examined the 2012-13 annual reports of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the Companies, Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, the Financial Reporting Council, and the Takeovers Panel.


The committee examines the annual reports prepared by ASIC as part of the committee's ongoing oversight of it. Accordingly, the annual report of ASIC is not considered in this report.


The committee has made a number of observations and recommendations in this report. Several of the bodies did not implement changes to annual reports previously requested by this committee and the Senate Economics Committee. The committee has therefore made explicit recommendations to the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, the Takeovers Panel, the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee has implemented suggestions from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.


Amendments to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 2012 significantly changed the Financial Reporting Council's role within the financial reporting framework, repealing its auditor independence functions and refocusing it to provide strategic policy advice. In addition, the Financial Reporting Council's strategic analysis of Australia's financial reporting framework identified significant changes to threats and weaknesses faced by Australia's financial reporting system. The committee will continue to monitor the new role and changing environment of the Financial Reporting Council.


In its annual report, the Financial Reporting Council identified deficiencies in the financial literacy of some cohorts of Australian directors. The committee is pleased the Financial Reporting Council has initiated measures to mitigate those deficiencies. The committee has recommended that the council also implement regular surveys in order to monitor the effectiveness of the measures. The committee is pleased that the Takeovers Panel annual report indicates a substantial reduction of time between a panel decision and the publication of reasons. These improvements are likely to be due to the recent changes to the ASIC regulations.


The committee also noted the following trends which it will continue to monitor: firstly, a continuing increase in the number of applications being dismissed by the Takeovers Panel; secondly, a decline in the caseload of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board; and, thirdly, a surge in projects being undertaken by the Australian Accounting Standards Board as a result of the work program developed by the International Accounting Standards Board.


I would also like to note the wind-up of the Financial Reporting Panel in October 2012. As the Financial Reporting Panel had no activity to report for 2012-13, all operations were covered in its final 2011-12 report. The committee considered the final annual report for the panel in its previous report on annual reports.


In reviewing the annual reports, the committee also considers whether there are opportunities to strengthen the operations of the corporations legislation, however, no changes are recommended at this time. The committee considered the 2012-13 annual reports generally satisfactory and we would like to thank officials of the organisations involved for their continuing cooperation, and the secretariat for their assistance in preparing the report. The committee holds its next oversight hearing with ASIC and the Takeovers Panel this Friday, 28 March, and will continue to pursue a number of the issues discussed in these reports and raised today. I commend this report and its recommendations to the House.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowraâ€”Chief Government Whip) (10:13):  This is one of the most pleasurable opportunities for me as a member of the House of Representatives, to move a motion commending the government for fulfilling a promise it took to the people at the last federal election with the announcement of the $3 billion plan for the M1-M2 link, to be named NorthConnex. I move:


That this House:


(1) commends the Government for fulfilling the promise it took to the people at the last federal election with the announcement of the $3 billion M1-M2 Link, â€˜NorthConnexâ€™;


(2) notes that:


(a) investment in infrastructure is a crucial component for economic growth; and


(b) the Government:


Â Â Â (i) is delivering on its commitment to build the M1-M2 Link; and


Â Â Â (ii) gives credit to the New South Wales Government and Transurban for their role in this development; and


(3) recognises:


(a) that the M1-M2 Link is a greatly needed piece of infrastructure and is the missing link in Sydneyâ€™s transport system;


(b) the benefits that the link will provide in reducing travel time, traffic congestion and pollution, and providing safer roads; and


(c) that this infrastructure will not only benefit the people of North-West Sydney and the central coast, but will have a flow on effect to all areas of Sydney.


This motion notes that investment in infrastructure is a crucial component to economic growth, that the government is delivering on its commitment to build the M1-M2 link and gives credit to the New South Wales government and Transurban for their role in this development. It recognises that this is important and greatly-needed infrastructure that provides benefits in reducing travel times, traffic congestion and pollution and provides for safer roads. This infrastructure will not only benefit the people of North-West Sydney and the Central Coast but will allow a flow-on effect to all areas of Sydney.


Isn't it a great day when you can move a motion commending major infrastructure of this type that will be delivered in the next five years or so? I have been waiting for a long time to be able to comment in this positive way. I note that on 27 May last year I was still complaining in this House about the lack of action in relation to addressing Pennant Hills Road, as I know it. When I first moved to Pennant Hills Road 50 or 60 years ago or more, there were a mere two lanes running through Pennant Hills in each direction. It was still the only major way of reaching the Central Coast and north of Sydney, but the amount of traffic that was carried required little more. But over the years we have seen a growth in traffic. We have seen a major piece of infrastructure required that should have been built years ago, yet it has been left.


I always suspected that one of the reasons it was left may have been that the area supported me and my predecessors so strongly that governments, maybe, felt they did not need to put money into this development. It may be that they saw the national interest. It may be that, as with the Labor Party when they started to focus on this, it was relevant to marginal seats on the Central Coast. But, whatever it is, this is a very significant and important development. It affects my electorate, which carries the burden of this piece of infrastructure. It affects electorates surrounding me: Mitchell, Bradfield, Dobell and Robertson. I notice the member for Reid here. His constituents who travel north would be very much affected by the lack of opportunity to be able to move other than on a congested highway where they have to traverse numerous traffic lights and are frequently held up by trucks breaking down or involved in major accidents.


The problem is that this has been the missing link in infrastructure in our great city of Sydney. I often used to speak on this, and I look at the speech that I gave back in May last year. I would talk about the way in which roads cross Sydney north to south and south to north. The M7 freeway, the Cumberland Highway, Woodville Road and Silverwater Roadâ€”each of these major pieces of infrastructureâ€”joined at one place: the junction of the M2 and Pennant Hills Road at West Pennant Hills. Then there were the mere three lanes in each direction on Pennant Hills Road that everybody would have to traverse. There is no other route. There was only this route. To address it was a major missing link in the critical infrastructure for Sydney and, so far as I am concerned, unless this were addressed Sydney was going to be a major block to trade between Melbourne and Brisbane. It is the only real thoroughfare for vehicles to be able to traverse this passage through Sydney.


While the Labor Party were in officeâ€”I forget for how long, but decades in the New South Wales government and another 11Â½ years or so in which they were in office federallyâ€”I always lamented that nobody was prepared to turn their mind to this issue. When the Labor Party came into office in 2007, I thought when they wanted to spend money on critical infrastructure that they might have wanted to do something about Pennant Hills Road. If the plans had been developed and were ready, they might have been able to do so, but nobody had seen fit to do any of the engineering or design work or, essentially, to settle on what might need to be done. Instead of expending money on pink batts and the like, we could have had critical infrastructure pursued if the Labor Party had been ready.


The only time I heard the Labor Party talk about Pennant Hills Road was when the former minister, Mr Albanese, identified it as possibly relevant to the Central Coast seats. So, before an election they were about to lose they suddenly discovered that there might be a need to do something about Pennant Hills Road. I must say that the Howard government, back in 2007, made a commitment to a $1.5 billion investment to address this problem. It was not unknown to the Howard government that this is something that needed to be addressed. For my part I was particularly pleased that in August last year, under Tony Abbott as leader, the coalition committed to this missing link and is now delivering on it. We have a situation where the coalition government, the New South Wales government and Transurban, who have identified this as a major shortfall in the infrastructure in New South Wales, have committed to a joint public-private partnership to build this long-awaited link. It was an important matter for me when the Prime Minister announced in the last few weeks that construction would begin within at least 12 months, and possibly this year.


This proposal means there will be a tunnel that could take something like 5,000 trucks a day off Pennant Hills Road. It will reduce the travel time for travellers on that road by something in the order of 15 minutes. It will cut out something like 21 sets of traffic lights on Pennant Hills Road. The building of the tunnel on this link will mean that people can drive from Newcastle to Melbourne without a traffic light. It will make travelling on Pennant Hills Road much safer for my constituents. We have had numerous accidents on this road that have been life threatening. The tunnel will be good for the environment as there will be fewer cars and less pollution, because the cars will be able to travel much more quickly. I am pleased that the proposal is for three lanes. While it initially will not be used in that wayâ€”one of them will be a breakdown laneâ€”the way in which it can be expanded in the future is particularly important.


I want to thank our Prime Minister, Minister Warren Truss, Barry O'Farrell and my colleagues who represent seats in and around this area for their support in ensuring that this important development is going to be able to proceed. For those who have been suffering for so long this is a worthwhile advance, a very significant improvement in the amenity of north-west Sydney, and I am delighted that it is going to be delivered by coalition governments in New South Wales and Canberra.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (11:15):  I move the motion relating to deregulation in the terms in which it appears in the Notice Paper:


That this House:


(1) notes:


(a) that in April 2007, the previous government promised to lift Australia's productivity performance by implementing a 'one regulation in, one regulation out' policy, but instead, between 2007 and 2013 it added over 21,000 new regulations and repealed 105;


(b) the findings of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's 2012 National Red Tape Survey which showed that:


Â Â Â (i) 44 per cent of businesses spend between one and five hours a week complying with government (federal, state or local) regulatory requirements (filling out forms, applying for permits, reporting business activity);


Â Â Â (ii) 72 per cent of businesses say the time they are spending on red tape has increased in the last two years; and


Â Â Â (iii) 54.3 per cent say that complying with government regulations has prevented them from making changes to grow or expand their business; and


(c) that in 2013, Australia was ranked 128 out of 148 nations on the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index in terms of its regulatory burden;


(2) recognises:


(a) the need for significant deregulation and the removal of burdensome red and green tape to allow businesses in the Australian economy to grow;


(b) that the Government has a plan to cut regulation across all areas of government, including on the Parliament's first repeal day scheduled for 26 March 2014;


(c) that the House Standing Committee on the Environment is currently inquiring into the impact of 'green tape' and issues related to environmental regulation and deregulation; and


(d) that identifying other obsolete and outdated legislative instruments and removing them from the statute books will reduce the regulatory burden on the Australian economy; and


(3) commends the Government for undertaking this approach to deregulation to boost productivity in the Australian economy.


I rise today with great pleasure to note and move this motion in relation to the government's deregulation agendaâ€”an agenda I believe is probably the single most important deregulation agenda taken at federal level in the history of the Commonwealth. It comes on the back of a government that benchmarked its success by passing lawsâ€”that is, that the volume of laws somehow had some significance to its effectiveness, which of course we know to be a complete furphy.


It is actually a shameful record that in 5Â½ years Labor introduced more than 975 new or amending pieces of legislation and more than 21,000 additional regulations. It speaks to a government out of control and which says that every response of government must first be a legislative response. If there is a problem, we must legislate. If there is a challenge that is faced by business or the community, we must alter a regulation, amend an act, put more paper into parliament, and that will somehow fix our problems. But of course that is not the best way to govern a society, and the fact that the Commonwealth has accumulated so much unnecessary regulation over so many years speaks to a need for urgent deregulation.


This is not just the government's view. It is also the view of the not-for-profit sector and the major business sector, and importantly, of the small and medium enterprises around our countryâ€”the many millions of small and medium businesses that struggle to compete against bigger business, that struggle to create, innovate and do the job of powering the economy day in and day out. So the first point of this motion is to note that the government has a strong deregulation agenda, and I want to commend the Prime Minister for his determination to see deregulation at the forefront of government. I also want to commend my friend the parliamentary secretary responsible for deregulation, Josh Frydenbergâ€”a man of vision and great leadershipâ€”who is driving this agenda. And I think that as the member for Grayndler walks out it is important to note that every time he would get up in the last government and say, 'We have achieved success; we have passed hundreds of bills; today it is now 200'â€”or 300 or 400â€”it would send a chill down the spine of most Australians, because what we do not need is simply more laws; what we do not need is simply more regulation.


Labor likes to have its little red books. Well, the parliamentary secretary responsible for deregulation has produced a little red book of red tape reduction, which I can highly recommend to all members. This little red book of red tape reduction is perhaps one of the most important documents we have seen in Commonwealth history. It acknowledges that as a society we have gone too far in over-regulating and in making large, small and medium business comply with processes not onceâ€”and sometimes not even just twiceâ€”but multiple times, for the same effect and for no purpose other than regulationâ€”no outcome that is different from any different layer of government, and not just simply a function of our federalist system but also a product of multiple acts in the same area, multiple triggers requiring different processes for the same outcome.


This is a process that has to come to an end. That would bring great productivity improvements for our country. It would give people the capacity to spend more time working for themselves in their business, not just the government, which would enable people to produce and make more money in their business That would mean more opportunities for jobs, growth, investment and prosperity for Australians. It is the government's fundamental agenda to ensure that the economy is rebooted, and there is no better way to start than with getting our own house in orderâ€”and that is government and this parliament. That is why this motion today is so important. It notes that Australian commerce and industry put out a great red tape survey in 2012, which had horrific, damning statistics in it. These showed that 44 per cent of businesses spend between one and five hours per week complying with federal, state or local government regulatory requirementsâ€”just filling out forms, applying for permits, reporting business activity. Yet 72 per cent of businesses said the time they are spending on red tape has increased in the past two years; 54.3 per cent say that complying with government regulations has prevented them from making changes to grow or expand their business.


And then there was the damning rating Australia received in competitivenessâ€”128 out of 148 in terms of our regulatory burden. That is 128th in the world. It is not a hallmark of a competitive economy, and in the modern era we must be able to compete. We cannot compete on many of our cost structures, but we should be a competitive jurisdiction internationally in relation to our regulatory burdens. We know that major projects can fail if they are not timely. We know delay can be fatal to hundreds of billions of dollars of investments. We have seen, for example in South Australiaâ€”and I note the sad return of a Labor government thereâ€”that we lost a critical project, and I would cite delay as one of the key reasons that project never came through. Delay can be fatal to a major project. Delay is the No. 1 reason that cost structures go up in a major project and can cause those things to fail. We have to be competitive internationally.


That is why it is great to see a government that is prepared to go forward and reduce red tape in such a substantial way. We have seen the previous government's approach, and I think it was Chassidus who said, 'The more numerous the laws, the more corrupt the government'. He had something back then, but of course he could not have envisaged a complex and modern society like we have today. And he was not just referring to volume: the more corrupt the government, the more numerous the laws. Every response was legislative in the past government.


I have Labor members looking at me in a bemused fashion. They do not know what I am talking about. They think a new law is the answer to everything; they think a new regulation will solve every problem. It will not. We have heard a chorus of strange reactions from the Labor to this: 'This was actually our idea'. Well, I can attest that the previous government had several ministers for deregulation, and you could not identify what any of them had been doing. We know the facts. We know it was 975 new or amending pieces of legislation, 21,000 additional regulations and the repeal of only a few hundred. So it certainly was not their idea. If it was their idea, they never implemented itâ€”another great Labor idea never implemented. It certainly would never have happened under a Labor government. They simply do not understand the weight of burden on a small business and a medium enterprise that is struggling to compete but has to work for the government. Time spent working for the government is not time well used for a small business; it is dead time. That is why I am very pleased to have my friend and colleague the member for Reid following me. He has commercial experience and has run businesses. He understands how much time is taken up working for the government when it could be better placed in the business, when it could be better placed growing and expanding, and when it could be better placed employing.


We have reached a necessary junction in our history: we need to deregulate. We need to have less regulation and more efficient regulation, and that is also the driverâ€”not just to remove pieces of redundant legislation, which we are doing in up to 10,000 cases, but to go through those existing regulations and say that we can reduce the cost structures of so many of these. If you go through the material that the Parliamentary Secretary for Deregulation has provided, and I recommend it to members, especially those opposite, you will find each individual measure by portfolio and the specific reductions in cost-structures for business that come from this deregulation. This is real, it is quantifiable and it will mean a great boost to our productivity and competitiveness.


The cost-structures amount to the staggering sum of almost $700 million. If you really want to get business moving, if you really want growth and if you really want jobs to be created, you have to work with business to ensure they are able to grow and employ. Each of these specific measuresâ€”there are too many to read today, and I am pleased there are too many to read today, because there are over 80 hereâ€”is a winner in terms of deregulation cost.


Members opposite want to take objection to one or two of them. Even in relation to the Future of Financial Advice, when you had serious criminality and evidence of a criminal matter their first instinct was to treat the whole sector like criminals. Their first instinct is to say this is a problem with everybody, that commissions lead to criminality, which is very collectivist Labor thinking. It is not the case that because you take a commission you are somehow a criminal, or that somehow your behaviour is led down the line of becoming a criminal. You are blind to the cost structures of these industries and sectors and the complexities of how they work. It is not an adequate response to simply say, 'We are changing the law across the whole board, because everybody that might be involved in taking a commission is therefore somehow motivated to be a criminal.' That is not correct. We should address the criminality, we should address the details of what went wrong, but we should not necessarily baulk at removing this burden on so many financial advisers. We need to ensure that people have the flexibility needed in their business to compete.


I will finish by commending this motion to the House. It is a very important motion, probably one of the most important we have seen in many years. It is on the back of the Prime Minister's determination to make this a government that is about getting the shackles off business and off the not-for-profit sector to allow them to be productive parts of our society. We have come to an era in government and our society where government is too pervasive, involved in too many things, passing too many laws, and trying to do too much for too many people. We need to wind it back, we need to make sure our businesses can grow, compete, employ, and do the jobs they are supposed to do. The number one way we can do that is by deregulation in government.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:25):  It is important for all of us to talk about red tape reduction and deregulation. What is more important than talk, though, is to actually see it through over long periods of time, which is exactly what Labor did in government. I take the opportunity to speak on this motion, because I want to set the record straight. This motion does not reflect fact or reality and it is peppered with inaccuracies. The contribution from the previous member was an unintelligible rave of a collection and series of phrases, slogans and words that any year 12 student writing an assignment would string together without any knowledge of what he is actually talking about.


Let us stick with facts and what happens in reality and what this so-called red tape reduction and deregulation the Liberals and the Nationals are going to foist on the Australian public actually is. Right at the outset I want to make it very clear that we support red tape reduction and we support deregulation. The Liberals and Nationals admit that we actually had a minister for deregulation. The fact is, according to the Parliamentary Library, while in government we repealed more than 16,000 pieces of legislation and other instruments, 7,500 of them last year. That is a record we are very proud of.


There is this furphy that does the rounds that we introduced 21,000 new pieces of something, but they do not go into the detailâ€”sometimes they say 21,000, sometimes 22,000, they just make up the number. The reality of what those 21,000 were about, if you look at them, is that 3,400 of them were air safety certificates. I am sure if the opposite side had the chance they would have said, 'there are 3,400 pieces of red tape and regulation we do not need in Australia'. Those are air safety certificates. Another 4,200 were regulations to relax tariff concessions to make life easier for small business. Perhaps they would not have done that. But we know that what they actually did do the moment they got into government was to take away from small business $4 billion worth of direct assistance. We know that for a fact. The Prime Minister, how is beyond me, crows that getting out of the road of small business by taking money away from them makes life easier. I am sure some people could argue that is not actually the case. The fact is, and these are facts, that we did more of this in government than the other mob are dreaming about doing on their stunt dayâ€”which is all it is. The normal course of government ought to be that you turn up here and you do not make a song and dance about it every single day. It is actually your job. Getting rid of red tape and making life easier for consumers and small business is your job. It is not a stunt to turn up here every day and crow about it and make it sound as though you are doing something new and unusual that nobody has ever done in the past.


The facts are evident when you check with the Parliamentary Library, or Fact Check, or anywhere you want to check. In fact, check with big business, the mates of the Liberals and the Nationals. Check with them on their own graphs. Check what they say about regulations and who introduced the most. Surprise, surprise, it was done under the Howard governmentâ€”the great bastion of regulation and red tape. They put mountains of it in place. When Labor got in office there was this peak. We had to siphon through it all to start trying to get rid of some of it. We did, and we did a good job. At the same time, as a government we faced one of the biggest economic challenges this country had seen for 75 yearsâ€”a global financial crisis, not something dreamt up by small-minded Liberals and small-minded Nationals, those bastions of small business. The first thing they do as the friend of small business is to attack small business directly by taking away $4 billion, and then they smile at them and say, 'But we're your best friends.' That makes me think, 'Oh, boy, if that's what a best friend does to someone, I'd hate to see these guys if they don't like someone.'


Let us get a few things right and look at some facts. There are 21,000 pieces of legislation that supposedly we introduced and they are made up of a range of different things, including thousands of things that were repealing bits of regulation. Of course, those opposite count those in. So we will be running a ruler across them to see how much legislation they actually introduce. What Labor did was beyond this argument about red tapeâ€”this argument about bits of paper, bits of blank paper. They are talking about a bonfire of regulationâ€”50,000 bits of paper. They may as well go down to some paper seller, grab 50,000 pieces of paper and burn them because that is about how useful it will be to ordinary people, ordinary consumers and small business. They think that somehow repealingâ€”

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Order! I know the member for Oxley can look after himself very well, but I remind the parliamentary secretary and others that if they are out of their place they are disorderly.




Mr RIPOLL:
  Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, from that unruly and disorderly mob. Perhaps they would like to get rid of the rules in this place as well. Perhaps they think there is a heap of regulation that we do not need in this placeâ€”and I would support them. But I can certainly defend myself.


In government, we implemented the Seamless National Economy agenda to reduce costs for business, to reduce compliance and to reduce the unnecessary and inconsistent regulation across jurisdictions. This is the hard lifting and the hard yakka that takes years, not some stunt where you grab a regulation from 1954 or some other outdated piece of law that has not been used for 50 years that just sits there, that barely anyone knows exists, and burn it and say that you have done your job as a government. They should do something a little more real.


The members on the other side think they are so clever. This is what they have come up with: let's burn a whole heap of regulations, including the Acts Interpretation Act 1954 and the amendment about the minimum size of the star on the Australian flag. I do not know how much money small business is going to save by these guys burning the amendment to the Flags Act. This is going to save people a fortune! I can see them now: small business ramming down the parliamentary secretary's front doorâ€”he shakes his head. But there are thousands of examples like that. You are getting rid of stuff that no-one even knows exists or has zero impactâ€”monetary, economic, ethicalâ€”




Mr Frydenberg:
  What about FoFA?




Mr RIPOLL:
  I am glad he threw that one in. FoFA is the great catch in all this. That is in the middle of those 50,000 empty pages of nothing that will fan the flames and create lots of smoke. We will see lots of smoke coming out of those guys over there on the other side but not too much that is real except when it going to hurt people. I am not going to go into all the details of FoFA here, but, simply, FoFA is about professionalising and lifting the standards in the financial services sector, something that they have been asking for for two decades. They want the standards lifted. They want to be professional. They want to be recognised as professional. We want to help them do it.


The other thing to note here is that we want to protect consumers. If you are a retiree or you are saving for your financial independence at retirement, you need a little protection, a little regulation and a little law. Whether you are young or old, or in the middle, it does not matter. There are scams out of there and unfortunately there are people who will do the wrong thing. That is why we need good, consistent and strong consumer protection laws when it comes to financial advice. Why? Because (a) you might not know that it is happening to you (b) by the time you find out, it is too late, and (c) if you lose your life savings, you need a little help. We have seen $4 billion wiped off the funds and life savings of pensioners following the Storm collapse and Westpoint and Trioâ€”there is a list as long as your arm, the so-called non-criminals that some of the members on the other side seem to want to protect. I do not know why they want to protect those guys, some of whom have gone to jail for ripping off pensioners. I will take the side of pensioners any day. I will take the side of people saving for their retirement any day. I can tell you that those on the other side of this House do not have too many friends. When it comes to it, National Seniors are against them and everybody is lining up, as well as all the consumer groups and even big businessâ€”and those opposite are the friends of big business; they are in their pockets.


People will understand that this is the government of insiders. They are the great insider traders of government. They are inside big business. They are inside cabinet. They are inside the Liberal Party. They are insiders. They do not care about consumers. They do not care about retirees. They do not care about ordinary folk. When they are in the middle and they get an opportunity to jump, they ask: 'Which way will I jump? Do I side with big business in making sure they get millions of dollars of extra fees or do I side with ordinary people? Do I go for the hard lift? Do I do the hard work, not just the stunts on repeal day, or do I do the good stuff?' I will tell you where the Labor Party will always be. Regardless of the popularity and regardless of the cost, we will side with consumers. We will side with senior Australians. We will protect their life savings. We will stand there for them. We will be there for the workers, moving their superannuation minimum from nine per cent to 12 per cent. We will do all that regardless of where we end up politically. We will do all that and we will continue to do that. We are not going to jump into bed with big business just because it suits somebody's particular agenda. In putting in place the standard business reporting which pulls together business activity statements, tax file numbers, declarations and a whole range of things, we will do the heavy lifting. We are the ones who will stand up for small business. We are the ones who will stand up for medium-sized enterprises. We will stand up for consumers when those opposite will not.

"Laundy, Craig, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (11:35):  There is nothing quite like following a commercial giant and, unfortunately, I do not have that option today; I am following the member for Oxley. Firstly, I commend the member for Mitchell for proposing this motion. Secondly, I want to talk about the structure of the way the government is attacking this. I notice I will be followed in this debate by the member for Parramatta, who I believe is the shadow parliamentary secretary for small business and does have small-business background. I imagine she is lonely in the committee meetings, because, if a tree falls in the Labor forest, no-one would hear it. I would like to praise the way the Prime Minister has attacked this agenda. It will make a difference to the small-business sector. And I want to focus on SMEs.


We have an employment and an underemployment problem in this country. It will not be solved by big business, to which the member for Oxley repeatedly referred. I do not blame him, because he comes from a union backgroundâ€”and they engage with big business day in, day out. This will be covered by SMEs, as it always has been and always will be. That is why this reform agenda is so important. The Prime Minister has seen fit to run this agenda out of his own portfolio. In doing so, he has found the most capable man in the member for Kooyong. He has made him parliamentary secretary and tasked him solely with this responsibility. It is an honour to be able to work with him on the New South Wales side, as I have done over the past six months, to make a real difference. Seventy per centâ€”the most recent figuresâ€”of the employment in this country is carried out by SMEs. They are not unionised. Eighteen per cent of the workforce is unionised, and that deals with big business.


The underemployment and unemployment problems that we face in this country will not be solved by government, they will not be solved by big business and they will not be solved by unions. They will be solved by small and medium-sized businesses. The best way that government can treat the sector is by getting out of their way and giving SMEs an environment in which they can, with confidence, take on bank debt, back themselves and employ people.


As someone that comes from a small and family business background, I can speak definitively on the topic instead of just read it from a textbook like the former member of this House and doctor of economics, Craig Emerson, who in 2008 promised to take a giant pair of scissors to red tapeâ€”and we all know what happened. If you want to see what happens on the ground and how this plays out, the best example is the carbon tax. It attacks every expense in the profit-and-loss statement of every business in this country, irrespective of size. And it has a multiplier effect. It passes through the supply chain so that the eventual supplier of the service to the consumer is in a position where costs are ratcheted up on a multiplied basis.


Traditionally, business would treat expense increases by raising their pricesâ€”that is, maintaining their margins. However, we have come through six years where, at the same time as expenses ratcheting up under the former government, consumer confidence has been shot to pieces. What has happened? Small and family business cannot pass these price rises on. What happens as a result is they absorb the cost, they lose margin, their EBIT dataâ€”their earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisationâ€”decreases and employment suffers. I will tell you how it plays out on the ground in Reid: small and family business people work longer hours themselves, they augment their trading hours and they do things that are criminal by nature, unfortunately, and pay cash. This is how it plays out on the ground. This reform agenda is so important because it lessens time businesses spend on compliance and on regulation, which is multiplied through state and through local government.


I am pleased to say that the member for Kooyong has identified this and, I believe, is working hard with the Prime Minister to make this a COAG reform item agenda. It is so important that we work with our state and local government counterparts. As someone that has faced red tape and regulation at all three levels of government over the past 23 years, I commend not only the member for Mitchell on what he is doing but also, more importantly, the Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister for the agenda. For those opposite to sit here and belittle what we do shows their ignorance of the sector that we promote and will get out of the trouble it finds itself in.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (11:41):  Over recent years there has been quite a bit of chest beatingâ€”from both sides, I must sayâ€”on this issue of reducing red tape. But I have to say that I think it is really a bit of a childish argument. It is somewhat of a red herring. All governments want to reduce unnecessary burdens on Australian businesses and the Australian public. But, if we are going to be in touch with the needs of the Australian people, what we should be doing is putting in place appropriate laws that protect their interests in cases of fraud, scams and unconscionable behaviour, while allowing them to go about their business and to make their own decisions about how to live their lives.


This week is the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Storm Financial. When that particular investment unit went into liquidation five years ago, 14,000 Australians lost their savingsâ€”$3 billion in total. Many of them lost their whole life savings. In the wake of that came Trio Financial, which collapsed and many mum and dad investors lost the lot. I was a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services when it travelled to Wollongong, where a lot of these investors were based. They were people who had worked their whole lives as miners in the steel mills and had retired, and, on the advice of a particular accountant in Wollongong, had invested in Trio Capital. Because of fraud, they lost the lotâ€”they lost it all.


To have to listen to those stories was heartbreaking. Some of those retirees had remortgaged their houses on the advice of these accountants, who said that this was a fail-safe investment. Because of fraud, the money disappeared and they lost the lot. They lost not only their lives savings but their kids' inheritance. Because of that, there were suicides, an increase in the level of depression and a reduction of public health in Wollongong. We have an obligation to protect people in those circumstances, as representatives of the community. That is what Labor in government did. That is the basis of the FoFA reformsâ€”the Future of Financial Advice.


These reforms were aimed at ensuring that accountants cannot give dodgy advice to mum and dad investors without them knowing the full picture. So we introduced a best interest duty. We introduced a duty that said that financial advisers have to act in the best interests of their clients. What does that mean? That means that there is a checklist that financial advisers have to go through to make sure that they are properly advising their clients, most of whom would not have any inkling of the trailing commissions and the fees that are paid to product developers by financial advisers simply for providing those products. If that is described as red tape, then you can blow me over. I think that is a government doing its jobâ€”protecting the Australian public from unscrupulous people. We also introduced an opt-in provision so that clients actually have to sit down with their financial adviser every two years. The financial adviser has to explain to them the fees and commissions they are paying to the financial adviser and, importantly, offer approval to that financial adviser to ensure that they are aware of those fees, commissions and conditions they are entering into with the financial adviser.


I do not believe that that is burdensome. I do not see that as red tape, but those opposite do. The government do. Last week they introduced into this parliament reforms to water down the best-interest test in the Future of Financial Advice reforms and to get rid of the opt-in provision. I say to those opposite: go back and read the transcript of the corporations and financial services committee hearings in Wollongong. Hear those harrowing stories of those retired Australians who invested the lot in those financial products that went bad and then lost the lot. Then make another assessment of whether or not you believe that that is red tape and that it should be removed by this government.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:46):  I am very pleased to be speaking in favour of this terrific motion moved by my friend the member for Mitchell and so passionately and ably seconded by the member for Reid. This matter really opens up a very clear fault line between the position of those opposite and the position of the government. This is really fundamental stuff. On the one hand over there you have a government-knows-best, bureaucracy-knows-best, 'We know that what's required is more regulation, more legislation, more forms for businesses to fill out,' philosophy, and what you have over here is the opposite. That is a philosophy that says the best thing we can do as a government is unshackle and free the people and small businesses of Australia to be their best. That is the difference.


We do not believe that the government is well placed to tell small businesses what to do about every aspect of their daily lives. We believe that, whilst there is a place for limited regulation, the right word is 'limited'. I have had quite a bit of experience in small and large business and so perhaps can speak on this from both sides of the equation. I would have to say that one of the worst experiences of my career in business was the burden you have in small business of filling out forms for the government. There is nothing worse after spending 10, 12 or 14 hours a day working on the thing that actually matters for your businessâ€”selling a product, developing a product and hiring your staff, all of which is hard and uncertain, and you never know what is going to happen six or 12 months down the track. And you work your guts out. Sometimes you have people relying on youâ€”people whose mortgages depend on the success of the business you are managing. And the worst thing is getting home at the end of that 12 or 14 hours and then spending a whole bunch of time filling out forms for government. We believe that that sort of intervention by government should be as limited as possible.


There are some fantastic examples of deregulation that the member for Kooyong has shepherded through this place in recent weeks. One of them I wanted to speak aboutâ€”shepherded very ably through the Houseâ€”affected my electorate in particular in recent weeks. It is the change for Chinese business visitors, who contribute an enormous amount to our economy, especially in my electorate of Banks. Previously, every 12 months they had to fill out another form for a visa. As you can imagine, many of these people are in frequent contact in my electorate and across Australia. It is a huge burdenâ€”lots of red tape every 12 months. There is a sensible form now: a multiple-entry three-year visa for Chinese business visitors. That is a very simple and sensible reform.


What about the standard agreement template? It is hard enough to get your mind around one government form, let alone 50 of them. Government forms using the bureaucratic language of which they are fond are not always the easiest things to deal with, but we had a situation previously where there were dozens of very confusing forms. The standard agreement template, which has been pushed through by the member for Kooyong, is a terrific initiative.


What about the credit card change? Previously, if it was over $10,000, you had to go through the whole invoicing procedure. Obviously there are credit checks involved. There is a whole lot of complexity there. Now payments up to $20,000 can be done by credit card. It is simple, it is what happens in the real world and it is what should happen with the government as well.


The Kung-Fu Panda story I probably do not need to describe again: 3D classification. It was just silly, and it is good to see that important reform.


The paid parental leave reform was championed by the Minister for Small Business. Getting rid of that penalty is, again, taking away these processes that do not add value, get in the way and make life harder for small business. That is what we believe in.


And what about ACMA? Previously ACMA had to investigate every single complaint no matter how absurd or dated. I have seen some of those complaints, and they can be absurd and dated. It is very good that there is now discretion around whether or not to proceed with complaints.


It is a terrific initiative by the member for Mitchell to move this motion, and I commend it to the House.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:51):  It is really clear from listening to the Liberal Party for the last week or so that they are trying to build a story that the Liberal Party is the great deregulator and the Labor government in its day was the great regulator. I want to deal with both of those untruths now. For a start, figuresâ€”provided by the Department of Finance and Deregulation, by the way, in case you do not want to believe themâ€”show that the net increase in legislative instruments was higher under the last two years of the Howard government than it was under the Labor government for its entire term. It was higher under Howard in 2006 and 2007 than it was under the Labor government.


I have heard the member for Mitchell. I have read his motion and thought, 'He really should have put this through fact check before he moved itâ€”or maybe he is not very good with maths.' When you are dealing with comparisons, you are supposed to compare like with like. What the member has done here is compared one kind of legislative instrument with legislation.


The reality is quite different. The Labor government had introduced 21,000 new and amended regulations in its six years in office, as the shadow minister said, including 3,500 airworthiness directives and 4,200 instruments for tax concession orders. But it also repealed 16,000, not 100 as the member untruthfully says in his motion, but 16,000. It also embarked on a COAG reform agenda which, according to the chairman of the COAG Reform Council, the Hon. John Brumby, would result in a $6 billion increase in productivity to GDP and up to $4 billion cost savings for business each year. 


We dealt with some of the appalling legacy of the Howard government. In 2007, if your business crossed state boundaries, you had to register your business name up to six different times. Tradies and medical professionals had to register in each state. If a finance company used personal property for security, there were 23 registries and 70 acts of parliament when we came to government in 2007. We addressed all those through 31 largely completed reforms in COAG with a further eight partially concluded, which again will result in up to $4 billion cost savings for business each year. We did it the hard way. 


This new lotâ€”I find it hard not to laugh when I look at their repeal day agenda. They did the kinds of things that you do when you have nothing else to do. There are seven weeks to the budget and the government have had staff in the departments going through amending 11 different pieces of legislation to omit the word 'e-mail' and replace it with 'email'. One of the journalists refers to this as 'the war on hyphens'. This is an incredible waste of time for a government which said just a few months ago that there was an emergency and everything had to be done fast, but the government departments are spending time on this. In 16 pieces of legislation they have replaced the words 'facsimile transmission' with 'fax'. Incredibly goodâ€”small businesses all over the country will be rejoicing at this incredible reduction of red-tape! The word 'trademark' has been substituted with 'trade mark'. 'Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory' has been substituted by 'Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory'â€”that is, 'of' instead of 'for'. Also, there is an omission of the phrase between 'a state or territory' and substitution of between 'a state and a territory'. Again, this is an incredible waste of the department's time. 


There were also 1,001 billsâ€”in their 8,000 or 9,000 or 10,000, depending on which day they are doing the additionâ€”that repealed other bills before 1969. How many people in how many departments were looking for those 1,001 bills over how many weeks? It is the kind of thing you do when you have nothing else to do. Talking about these repeals for a week demonstrates that they have nothing else to do in this place. 


In the childcare area, in order to get the numbers up for child care, in spite of the great rhetoric, they actually brought forward automatic repeals. There is a bill that actually automatically repealsâ€”called a sunset provisionâ€”bills which are no longer relevant. They bought those bills forward in order to get the numbers up. The childcare centres all across the country will be rejoicing! There is some nasty stuff in this but essentially this is a fraud and this motion is profoundly untrue.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (12:07):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's second report of 2014 Referrals made December 2013.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mrs ANDREWS:
  by leaveâ€”This report deals with five referrals, with a total estimated cost of $446.6 million.


The first referral was from Defence Housing Australia, for the development and construction of housing for defence at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory. The project cost is $89.4 million.


Defence Housing Australia proposes to construct 50 tropically designed dwellings and associated supporting roads and infrastructure for use by Defence personnel and their families at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory.


The committee visited RAAF Base Tindal and held hearings in Katherine in late January. The committee subsequently sought additional information on the project from DHA and has also requested a further public and in camera hearing. The committee will report again on the project after the additional hearings have been conducted.


The second inquiry in this report examined the construction of a new Australian High Commission in Nairobi, in the Republic of Kenya. The project cost is $57.6 million.


DFAT told the committee that Australia's engagement with Kenya, and Africa more broadly, has grown significantly in recent years as has Australia's representation in Nairobi. The current chancery, which is leased, no longer meets the department's security requirements and has significant building and fire-compliance deficiencies. The proposed purpose-built complex will serve as Australia's ongoing permanent mission to Kenya.


The committee is satisfied that there is a need for the new purpose-built high commission complex in Nairobi and recommends that the project proceed.


The third inquiry being reported on examined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's proposal to relocate its research capabilities and staff from its site at Highett in Victoria to its site at Clayton, Victoria. The project includes the provision of a new building at Clayton for the 'CSIRO Science Education Centre' and a 'Factories of the Future Innovation Centre'. The project cost is $32 million. The cost of the works will be offset by the sale of CSIRO's Highett site.


The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.


The fourth inquiry examined the Reserve Bank of Australia's proposal to construct a National Banknote Site adjacent to the Bank's existing facilities in Craigieburn, Victoria. The project cost is $72 million.


Construction of the National Banknote Site would enable the transition to the 'Next Generation Banknote' series and it would meet the Reserve Bank's storage, distribution and processing requirements for the next 25 years. It will also allow for the relocation and expansion of the existing National Note Processing and Distribution Centre and will include storage capacity to accommodate the Reserve Bank's banknote holdings that are currently held at the bank's Melbourne site.


The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.


The fifth and final inquiry being reported on examined the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's proposal to consolidate its Australian Capital Territory property holdings by relocating staff from various leased premises in the ACT to CSIRO's own site at Black Mountain.


The consolidation project includes construction of two new science research and support facilities on the Black Mountain campus and the eventual demolition of several buildings at Black Mountain which are old, which do not meet current standards for health and safety, have high maintenance costs and which present operational risk. The project cost is $195.6 million.


The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.


I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries and also thank the secretariat for their work. I commend the report to the House.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:12):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 and to support the amendments moved by the shadow minister for infrastructure.


The Howard government was well remembered for its regional rorts. The Howard government minister at the centre of much of those rorting allegations is the very same minister who now oversees this legislation. At the time he made decisions about where money was to be spent, which projects were given the go-ahead and which projects were rejected. Having billions of dollars at your disposal to spend gives one considerable power. Therefore, not surprisingly, what we see in this bill is a transfer of decision making and with it a transfer of power from Infrastructure Australia to the minister.


Now why would you do that when there is no evidence, whatsoever, that the existing arrangements are flawed or problematic? Why even have an independent body like Infrastructure Australia if they are stripped of their authority? The value of an independent body comprised of a cross-section of skilled people is, in fact, to ensure that government funds are expended efficiently, wisely, in a justifiable priority and free of political interference. It was to stop the political interference and the rorting that the independent Infrastructure Australia was created. I suspect that this issue is not just about power but also that the changes are being made for other reasons. Those other reasons were to enable the Abbott government to deliver on election promises that they know did not stack up and which they know an independent body like Infrastructure Australia would not give priority to and, therefore, would very likely not be recommended for funding by that body.


I refer to projects like the South Road at Darlington project in Adelaide. The project was promised by the Abbott government in the lead-up to the 2013 election to shore up the vote of the member for Boothby. It is a major piece of infrastructure but, as worthy as it may be and as needed as it is, it is not Adelaide's highest priority infrastructure project. In fact, an alternative project for the very same road is considered a much higher priority project by the South Australian government's department of infrastructure andâ€”I strongly believeâ€”by the South Road commuting public. I refer to the alternative project of widening South road between Torrens Road and the River Torrens. What is more, a cost-benefit analysis of the two projectsâ€”that is, the South Road at Darlington upgrade and the South Road Torrens Road to River Torrens wideningâ€”shows that the return on the Torrens to Torrens widening is $2.40 for every dollar expended; compared with a return of 66c for every dollar spent on the Darlington project. That is why an independent body like Infrastructure Australia is unlikely to recommend the project, and it explains why the minister, through this legislation, seeks to and needs to sideline Infrastructure Australia. The Abbott government knows that it would otherwise be embarrassed in terms of the priority it gives its projects, because they are based not on merit but rather on political election promises. I believe that it is in order to avoid the embarrassment of having an independent body saying to the government: 'This is not the priority project that you should be funding,' that the independent body is being stripped of its power.


I raise another matter in respect of South Australia's share of local roads funding. Members opposite claim that this is the infrastructure Prime Minister that we now have in Australia, and that we have historical amounts of money being expended on national infrastructure. For the last two decades, South Australia has been receiving less than its fair share of local roads funding. South Australia has over 11 per cent of the nation's roads; it has over seven per cent of the nation's population; yet it receives over five per cent of road funding from the federal government. Each year, because of that injustice, the amount of money that is given to South Australia been supplemented. In fact, in the last government's budget the supplement was in the order of about $17 million a year for the next three years. South Australia is given that supplementary funding in order to make up the shortfall that it would otherwise be entitled to if it were to be given what we believe to be a reasonable share of the national road fundingâ€”a reasonable share being somewhere between the population quota of seven per cent and the total proportion, 11 per cent, of the country's roads. It is interesting to note that under the Roads to Recovery program the amount that South Australia gets is over eight per cent. In respect of that allocation, the quota seems quite reasonable and certainly much fairer than what it is under the other formula.


Given that, if South Australia is to get an increased share of local roads funding, it would come at the expense of allocations to other states, I can understand the difficulty in the past, with ministers saying, 'If South Australia gets an increased allocation, someone has to lose out.' The way to correct the anomalyâ€”it is an anomaly that dates back about 20 years; I do not understand the historical context of itâ€”is to increase the quantum of money that goes into road funding. You could then increase South Australia's allocation without decreasing the amounts that go to each of the states. My question to members opposite is this: if this is a historical amount of funding that is being provided to infrastructure, is this now not the time to correct the imbalance and give South Australia, once and for all and permanently, its fair share of national road funding from the federal government? I believe the opportunity is before us right now with this legislation and I would urge members opposite to consider correcting what has been a long-term anomaly and to restore South Australia's fair share of local roads funding.


This legislation has other aspects to it that are also of concern. I note with interest that the reference to climate change in Infrastructure Australia's guidelines is totally removed in this legislation. I find it unusual and perplexing that a government would think that just because you remove a reference to climate change it means the issue will go away. The truth of the matter is that it will not go away just because you remove references to it in your guidelines or in your legislation. That is a retrograde step on the part of the government. The reference to climate change is in there for a very good reasonâ€”that is, to ensure that projects take into account the possible effects of climate change into the future, when they are prioritised in terms of whether they should or should not get funding.


It is also interesting to see that the tax concessions for private investors in infrastructure are also being excluded from this legislation. We know that within Australia there is a deficit of infrastructure funding and infrastructure spending throughout the country. We know that the only way that that deficit will ever be made up is if we go into joint partnerships with private investors from time to time. In order to do that, there has to be an incentive for those investors. To take away the tax concessions that previously existed in legislation is a retrograde step, because it means that you will no longer attract the level of private investment in major infrastructure projects that you might otherwise have done, and in turn that means that infrastructure will either be delayed or never be built. As members opposite have quite rightly pointed outâ€”and members on this side have pointed out the sameâ€”efficient infrastructure adds to national productivity. It is as simple as that. In turn, national productivity not only adds to the nation's income but also adds to business efficiency and viability. We need to do all we can to ensure that we have the infrastructure that we need to serve this country, and not do the opposite by taking away the tax concessions which were put in place for a very good reason.


I return to my initial point, about transferring authority back to the minister, from a different perspective. A number of national bodies, including the Business Council of Australia, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Urban Development Institute of Australia, all support Labor's amendment to restore authority to Infrastructure Australia. They do so because they understand that Infrastructure Australia will always act independentlyâ€”free of politicsâ€”to argue the case about which projects need to be funded first.


We are dealing with considerable expenditures in infrastructure. It was the last Labor government that made infrastructure spending a major priority in this country. Under Labor we went from being about 20th in infrastructure spending amongst OECD countries to being first. That was the difference Labor made, ensuring sufficient public funds were dedicated to infrastructure in this country. To its credit, the Abbott government has maintained a high level of infrastructure spending. However, it is important not only to maintain a high level of infrastructure spending but also to ensure that it is spent in accordance with the priorities that best serve this nation. If bodies like the Business Council of Australia can say to the government that allocating funds to projects needs to remain independent of politics then the suggestion that Infrastructure Australia needs to remain independent is not simply some sort of left-wing conspiracy.


The independence of Infrastructure Australia will ensure the projects that are truly deserving of priority get the priority they need and hopefully the minister will, in turn, support them through the final determination. I do not doubt that ultimately these decisions always will be made by government, but the transparency of having an independent body put up a list of recommendations will be welcomed by the public. If the minister, having seen the recommendations from Infrastructure Australia, determines not to support the priorities then it will be necessary to explain that determination. If there is a justifiable argument then so be it, but if there is no justifiable argument then the public will have a right to know why a project was funded ahead of another project that everyone else knew full well would have given the taxpayers a better return for their dollars. At the end of the day, these are Australian taxpayer dollarsâ€”in the order of $50 billion to $60 billion over the next three or four years. These are substantial funds. The public have a right to know that those funds will be spent not in accordance with the political priorities of a government, regardless of which government is in office, but in accordance with national priorities where those funds will provide the Australian people with the best return on their dollars. 


For those reasons, I believe that the amendments moved by the shadow minister should be considered by the government. I believe that they are appropriate. With those comments, we broadly support the expenditure in this bill but I hope that members opposite take the opposition's amendments into consideration.

"Wilson, Rick, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (12:26):  I rise today to support the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, which details the government's injection of $35.5 billion to infrastructure priorities. There are a number of areas that this funding will benefitâ€”$300 million will go to the Black Spot program addressing road sites that are high risk areas for serious crashes, $300 million to the bridges renewal program to restore dilapidated local bridges, and various other major infrastructure projects across the country. But, today, I would like to endorse the commitment of $1.75 billion to the Roads to Recovery program to ensure its future for another five years, through to 30 June 2019.


On 27 November 2000, the Howard government introduced a four-year road funding package worth $1.6 billion. Of this, $1.2 billion would be spent on the Roads to Recovery program. At this time the program was available because of a strong budget position. The Howard government acknowledged road funding infrastructure would be the best investment of these surplus funds as it would be of long-term benefit to the nation. In the second reading speech it was indicated that government was serious about the renewal of local roads. It recognised they were an essential element to the economic and social infrastructure of Australia's communitiesâ€”rural, regional and metropolitan. The Howard government was aware that local councils, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, were faced with significant problems of maintaining local roads from within existing funding. They also noted that the economic and social importance of local roads was increasing with the expansion and emergence of rural industries.


Having lived my whole life in Katanning, some 280 kilometres from Perth, I can tell you that local roads are an essential feeder to other parts of the transport system, especially between rural, regional and urban areas. They are vital to the sustainability and recovery of rural and regional Australia. Access to education, health care, commercial shopping and other amenities is dependent on local roads. Although the program has gone through several phases, all the key features from its introduction in 2000 are still current in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Warren Truss, said:


We are moving to deliver the infrastructure Australia critically needs â€¦ which, over six years, will build the vital road and rail projects to improve efficiency, boost productivity and drive Australia's economy forward.


This cannot happen without funding to maintain local roads in rural and regional areas. With an electorate that covers over 900,000 square kilometres, road infrastructure is very important to the people living in O'Connor, mainly because there are very few alternatives to driving everywhere. As an example, to drive from Perth to Esperance, a tourist destination within the electorate, you must drive 715 kilometres on a single-lane highway. In travelling to Esperance, you will drive through six local council areas just in the O'Connor electorate. Those councilsâ€”Brookton, Corrigin, Kondinin, Kulin, Lake Grace and Ravensthorpeâ€”are all responsible for the maintenance of the roads in their area. 


On top of this, transport infrastructure is vital to Australian agriculture, with the industry relying on an efficient and well-connected network to move livestock and grain. The O'Connor electorate has agriculture such as cattle, sheep, wheat, canola and barley, which all require roads for transport. If we are to enhance Australia's economic growth and productivity, open up opportunities for jobs and access to markets, and improve the efficiency and safety of our transport and freight networks, then infrastructure investment is critical.


The Roads to Recovery program is an essential element in local government's ability to maintain and upgrade local roads. It is an outstanding example of a partnership between national and local governments and of providing direct funding to local communities. The cost of maintenance on local roads is immense and, although largely met by rates, requires extra funding. A number of roads are now reaching the end of their economic life and their replacement costs cannot be met by local governments alone. 


Since 2000, the much needed Roads to Recovery funding has helped local government begin to address the backlog of local road maintenance, improving safety and transport efficiency and stimulating economic development across the country. Under the program, direct funding to local councils is distributed according to a formula based on population and road length set by the local government grants commission in each state. The funding through the Roads to Recovery program is untied grants, which provide the freedom for local governments to make their own decisions. 


The O'Connor electorate has 43 local governments, which were awarded a combined total of $18,952,000 in the 2013-14 Roads to Recovery funding allocations. I will take this opportunity to tell you about just a few projects that have only been made possible through Roads to Recovery funding. In the 2013-14 funding allocation, the Shire of Esperance was awarded $1.26 million in untied funding, which has allowed the council to fund six projects ranging in cost from $48,000 to $650,000. One project was the Coolinup Road upgrade, a project of $650,000, which was required as the road had reached the end of its design life. To ensure a safe road for drivers, 4.6 kilometres of the road had a full-width reconstruction completed, and the road was widened to 7.4 metres. A further $300,000 was required to upgrade two kilometres of the Gibson East Road because the existing road surface had cracked and was starting to pothole, due to it reaching the end of its design life. The road had a full-width reconstruction and was widened to 7.4 metres. Without the Roads to Recovery program, the Shire of Esperance would not be able to fund either of these projects, nor the other four projects that I have not specified. With close to $1 million spent on these two projects alone, there is no way the Shire of Esperance could fund this out of their own resources. This would mean the people living and travelling in this area would be seriously disadvantaged. 


The City of Albany has used their 2013-14 funding allocation of $1.94 million on eight separate projects, including the Willyung Road upgrade. Due to expansion and development, the traffic along this 1.7 kilometre stretch of road increased, and subsequently the pavement was wearing out. The road was also of insufficient width. So, with this funding, the City of Albany was able to reconstruct the pavement and widen the road to seven metres. The total cost of the project is estimated at $600,000, with $200,000 coming from the Roads to Recovery program.


The City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has used their Roads to Recovery allocation of $1.1 million to fund five reconstruction projects. The five projects include: the Bourke Street reconstruction; the Connolly Street reconstruction, the Cheetham Street reconstruction, the Moran Street reconstruction and the Hampden Street reconstruction. Although these five projects might not be considered glamorous, they are much-needed asset management replacement to serve the needs of the community and the city's infrastructure replacement backlog. 


At the Shire of Pingelly, the $994,000 they were allocated through the 2013-14 Roads to Recovery program has


been spent on two separate projects. Funding of $697,037 went towards bridge refurbishment and maintenance works. The remaining Roads to Recovery funding was allocated to a road sealing program.


The Shire of Dundas has used their Roads to Recovery allocation to put in place a resealing program in Norseman. This program is based on resealing all the existing town streets in Norseman and Eucla over a 10-year period, to maintain the current level of service to residents and visitors in these towns. Barry Gibbs, the works manager for the Shire of Dundas has said: 'If this funding was not available for the shire, the shire would be looking at sealing one or two streets a year. The level of maintenance and reconstruction would then compound and increase, which would lead to the shire having to use more rates money on roadworks. This means less money would be available for other community projects like youth services and grants to community groups that are an important part outback life.'


The Shire of Dundas bitumen sealing works for 2013-14, made available by the Roads to Recovery program, has seen 21 projects undertaken. That is a far cry from the one or two that the shire would be able to complete on rates income alone. These projects, along with many others in the O'Connor electorate, were all funded by the Australian government through the Roads to Recovery program. The funding has been a huge help to the local councils involved. It is also a great example of how local councils are working closely with the Australian government to deliver projects that make a real difference locally.


In the 14 years that the Roads to Recovery program has been running, there have been various reviews undertaken and academic papers written on the program. The Auditor-General has also undertaken two separate


performance reviews. In the academic paper, Bang for the Buck? An Evaluation of the Roads to Recovery Program (2013), the report concluded: 


Taking stock of the available evidence there is little doubt that the R2R Program provided a much needed injection of funds, which has helped to alleviate the severe financial distress facing Australia local government and therefore ameliorate the deterioration of local road infrastructure. 


Separately to this, a key success factor for the Roads to Recovery Program is the simple administrative system which allows the maximum funding to go to roadworks, as determined by local councils, who know local transport needs and priorities. Without the Roads to Recovery program, the people of O'Connor would miss out on $18 million worth of road infrastructure upgrades and would be severely disadvantaged. There is already a lack of public transport and rail infrastructure in the electorate. We can alleviate this by providing the funding to ensure safer and more efficient roads. 


The Roads to Recovery Program will not be able to continue without the amendments to the NBP act in this bill as the act specifies the Roads to Recovery funding period as ending on 30 June 2014. The government is committed to supporting Australia's regions and to delivering funding where it is best needed. Another five years of Roads to Recovery funding will allow local councils to continue to maintain their road infrastructure, facilitate economic growth and diversity, and enhance liveability across regional Australia. I commend this bill to the House.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:37):  Whenever I listen to this debate about infrastructure and the number of times the Prime Minister has talked about it in the House, I get a sense of deja vu. I am hearing things that leave me trying to work out where I have heard them before. It seems that our Prime Minister must have a fascination with everything that the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, does, because in so many instances they are literally carbon copies of each other in their approach. For example, back in 2011 I saw a document circulating in New South Wales called 'A contract with New South Wales' to be entered into by Barry O'Farrell which referred to the party that was in favour of individual contracts bringing a collective agreement with the people of New South Wales. Congratulations on thatâ€”



Mr Chester interjectingâ€”




Mr HUSIC:
  I'll get to it, don't you worry, Member for Gippsland. It was a contract with New South Wales obviously designed because members of the coalition know that the public suspects that they fail to bring the public along with them in believing that they will actually keep their promises. So in 2011 we had a contract with New South Wales. Then what happened in last year's federal election? We have a contract with Australia signed by the Prime Minister. So it goes from New South Wales to the national level. We have it here and it is signed by Tony Abbott, so it must mean that he is going to follow through on what he says. 


I keep hearing the Prime Minister talk about how he is going to be the infrastructure Prime Minister, so I go back in time again and I see a reference in 2010 to someone trying to equate themselves with leadership and the provision of infrastructure. Who was it? It was the then opposition leader in New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, who said in December 2010 that he wanted to be seen as the infrastructure premier and that he would 'forfeit his leadership' if he could not deliver on his key promises. I fast-forward in time after Barry O'Farrell said that and I get to another document, which was released on 5 September last year, member for Gippsland. It was released by your illustrious leader, Tony Abbott, who said, 'If elected, I want to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister.' So everything that Barry O'Farrell does, Tony Abbott copies. I note that he did not say he would resign if he does not fulfil his commitments at the federal level, but on everything else he copies him. Tony Abbott to Barry O'Farrell is sort of like Marmite to Vegemiteâ€”it tries hard but it just cannot make it. People just cannot sign up to the original being replicated in this case. 


But it does not stop there; it just keeps on going. For example, Barry O'Farrell comes up with the idea of WestConnex. Notionally, you would agree with the idea to extend the M4 and make sure that it goes on into the city, because people in Western Sydney know that this has plagued transport, it has been the missing link in trying to get people moving more. But the O'Farrell government not only does not extend it all the way to the airport or into the city, they also impose a toll on parts of the M4 that were already paid for by Western Sydney motorists. That is scandalous, because the people in Western Sydney who dug into their pockets and paid for that roadway should not be hit again by this government. But they do it, and at the federal level Tony Abbott supports it.




Mr Chester:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Chifley has been here for long enough to know that he should refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Yes.




Mr HUSIC:
  The Prime Minister backs this notion of WestConnex reimposing a toll on the people of Western Sydney and does not explain to people that that funding is contingent on the toll. Then what happens? There is a suggestion that we will do an extension from the M2 to the F3. And what do they propose calling it? This will not be called WestConnex; now it is going to be called NorthConnex. Yet another example of original thinking from the coalition! 


What was even better was that two Sundays ago we had the coalition at the federal level turn up with the coalition at the state level and try to suggest that this was something that they came up with. Wrong. What actually happened was that they picked up a previous idea and claimed it as their own, and we saw the member for Wide Bayâ€”




Mr Chester:
  The Deputy Prime Minister.




Mr HUSIC:
  or, should I say, the Prime Minister, announcing this NorthConnex link. The issue is that the former Labor government actually spent quite a deal of time working with the New South Wales government to ensure that the money was put there so we could get started on that. We worked constructively with Transurban, who runs much of Sydney's road network and who is also responsible for the M2 and M7, and we will be proud to see a project that will see significant congestion avoided by getting rid of 21 sets of traffic lights. We dedicated significant government investment towards that, with an agreement from each level of government. It was about $400 million originally and we had to go back to augment that, but the key thing was that this was included in the 2013 budget as a result of extensive negotiation. So, again, we have the federal coalition copying and claiming credit for ideas that were someone else's and trying to pass them off as their own. 


The pressure is truly on this government to decide whether they are going to simply adopt a cut-and-paste approach to policy formulation and if they will also sidestep the errors of history. Bear in mind that there were two things that plagued the Howard government which this government needs to be mindful of, and they were particularly around the issue of capacity constraints that were brought on by skill shortages and, importantly, by infrastructure blockages. People saw the problems that were occurring around the country in terms of roads, rail and ports, and they will see whether this government will continue in the same vein as the Howard government or actually address infrastructure issues as they arise. This bill seeks to address a number of issues, including continuing funding for Roads to Recovery; acquiring a power to determine a Roads to Recovery list; distinction between national, network and off-network projects; and transport research funding criteria. That is all well and good, and, as the member for Makin indicated, our position will be to support the bill, but with amendments made to it.


We had a number of Labor achievements that had sought to address the failings of the Howard government when it came to infrastructure blockages. That is why, for example, our investments while in government were akin to rebuilding or upgrading 7,500 kilometres of road or 4,000 kilometres of railway lineâ€”and these all have major economic benefit. We had a legacy that Labor could be proud of. In six years in office we delivered record investment in the land transport system, including doubling the roads budget to $46.5 billion, which allowed us to build or upgrade those 7,500 kilometres of road. We also boosted Commonwealth road grants to councils by 20 per cent, and we put in historic levels of investment into the rail systemâ€”and again I make reference to the 4,000 kilometres of track. As the member for Makin indicated in his contribution, infrastructure spending across the economy rose to record levels. Australia rose from 20th in the 34 OECD nations in terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP to first under Labor's watch in the 2012 calendar year. That is something we are right to be proud of.


When you look at this whole issue of infrastructure, and particularly from a Western Sydney perspective, there is a big reason we would be focused on that. I would commend to the House a terrific speech that the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank delivered in November last year to the IARIW-UNSW conference 'Productivity, Measurement Drivers and Trends'. He talked about the important role of investment in infrastructure in boosting productivity and our standard of living, because we do face challenges in terms of trying to boost productivity in the years ahead. He said that few would disagree with the idea that improving infrastructure is important if we are to compete internationally and that investments in infrastructure transport would yield a social rate of return greater than the cost of financing, which he is absolutely right about. He talks about how effective transportation deepens markets and brings new opportunities to businesses. He highlights three challenges, the first being governance of project selection, saying that there needs to be quite a degree of strong governance in place about the way projects are selected. He also talks about the financing of projects and, importantly, he talks about capacity constraints, which again rear their head in this debate around infrastructure and the way in which the coalition will manageâ€”or mismanage, as is the concernâ€”infrastructure rollout. He says we need to find a way to identify the best projects and to find a way to finance them into the future.


On that issue of financing, I might make the point that a lot of people rush to talk about the need to impose tolls as a way of financing road development, but I would be one of those people who says that Western Sydney in particular pays its fair share of tolls. There is no doubt we need to find a way to finance roads. But, for example, if someone in the electorate of Chifley was to drive from Chifley into the city they would pay a toll of $5.25 the minute they got on to Power Street, Doonside, to get to the M2. They would pay another toll, of $6.11, at the M2, a toll of $3.06 at the Lane Cove Tunnel and another toll, of $4.00, when they crossed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. For two trips per dayâ€”bearing in mind that you do not necessarily pay the bridge toll on the way backâ€”people living in Western Sydney are paying more than $30 in tolls. So while road financing itself is certainly a challenge, the people of Western Sydney are already paying a fair share of tolls and are looking to pay an additional toll when it comes to WestConnex for roads they have already paid off and then paying for anything else this government might be planning for infrastructure down the tack in terms of roadways. The one that comes to mind is getting the M9 in Western Sydney done.


The speech from Philip Lowe, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, is also important because he makes the connection between infrastructureâ€”particularly transport infrastructureâ€”and housing affordability. He says that when house prices are high it is largely because land prices are high, and that happens when there is a shortage of well-located land, which is very important. We cannot do much about the physical supply of land, he says, but investment in transportation infrastructureâ€”making it easy to move around the cityâ€”can increase the supply of well-located land, which is an important point. In Western Sydney we need to ensure that transport infrastructure helps to liberate the movement of people across our region, one of the biggest and fastest-growing regions in the country. And we need to be able to do it in a way that is mindful of the fact that Western Sydney residents are already paying a very high price for that roads infrastructure.


The other thing that will be interesting to see in terms of well-located land is the issue of where Sydney's next major CBD within will be. Parramatta often claims it is the second CBD of Sydney. But in fact I think Parramatta is set to lose that mantle in timeâ€”and it should, because if we want to have the break between the exodus of people from Western Sydney to the east and back again, we should be looking to set up another CBD not to the east of where the bulk of people live but in the south-west growth centres, where it is likely to emerge that people will live. A lot of the grid structures of the old CBDsâ€”be they in Parramatta, Blacktown or Penrithâ€”are from the 18th century and have well and truly outlived their purpose. What is needed is for government and business to work together in establishing a CBD in the south-west growth centre, where 300,000 people are likely to move. Again, you can look at old CBDs, like the Church Street Mall in Parramatta or High Street in Penrith, which David Borger from the Sydney Business Chamber cites as 'urban failures' because they do not have natural movement corridors. I do not necessarily agree with a lot of things David Borger says these days, but I do agree with him that we need to sidestep the errors of the past and think of a CBD that is in the south-west of Sydney and that can be designed properly with natural movement corridorsâ€”and have the infrastructure to support it. This is what Western Sydney needs. It needs to have some vision applied to it, with government and business working in concert, to find a way to break the nexus of west to east travel, to be able to split the movement of people, and to ensure there are jobs in our area, where they are needed most. As the Draft Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney to 2031 points out, we will need quite a significant number of jobs in the years ahead. So, I commend this bill. I do not commend any notion that they will just cut and paste from previous policy. I certainly hope that they will make genuine inroads into improving transport infrastructure in this country.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (12:52):  I am pleased to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. Infrastructure is being prioritised by the coalition, as it should be. For too many years we have had infrastructure backlogs that have not been processed. In fact previous state governments were given money and never seemed to spend it on road and other development projects. One of the saddest things about the waste of the last six years was how the money spent was not invested in things that were to do with production and would give the taxpayer a return for their money. We are paying for that, and we have paid for that to a large degree.


I note this bill will pave the way for over $35 billion over the next six years to deliver an intricate infrastructure programâ€”and road and rail infrastructure is what matters. The first job of road and rail is to promote trade and production, and, personally, I think the carriage of people after that is a bonus. The main issue must be allowing your country to develop, to create jobs, and to get stuff to port, because we are a trading nationâ€”two-thirds of our agriculture a heck of a lot of our mining production goes overseas. I believe that in road and rail infrastructure people are a bonus rather than being what we should think about first.


The states and the territories obviously have to work with youâ€”and we nearly have a totally cooperative state system, but not quite, as of yesterday. We still have one recalcitrant state down there in the south, but of course it is not your state, Deputy Speaker.


There are a number of big ticket items in this bill, but I want to focus on the things that are particularly important to Calare, in New South Wales. This includes inland rail, Roads to Recovery, the Black Spot Program, and the Bridges Renewal Program, which is actually very important in our part of the world. There are another couple of issues I will bring up that are enormously important. It is about having the guts to look to the future. It is about having the leadership to make things happen. One thing happening is the Bells Line of Road upgrade, which will open up the whole of western New South Wales and central-western New South Wales, if we get a freeway through the mountain from Sydney. The other is a new dam, which is desperately needed by two-thirds of my electorate, and that must happen.


But firstly, in regard to inland rail, we are seeing progress on this, after a hiatus. It is an ambitious and vital project that will connect Brisbane to Melbourne, and do so very quickly. The provision of $300 million will allow plans, engineering and the environmental assessment to be finalised and allow the various authorities to get on with it. It will also encourage the private investment that will be a huge part of it.


Over the next 50 years the north to south movement is going to be enormous, as will the east to west movement. That is why this needs to be tied with a freeway through the mountains and a better rail system from Sydney heading west, which links up with Perth and Adelaide, and all the rest, on the transcontinental line.


I have heard people make the mistake of saying that this will take a million semitrailer loads off the road over time. It will not do that. What it will prevent is another million going on them. Nothing is going to stop what is currently being carried on the roads. The issue is how we prevent the roads getting more overloaded, and that is what rail can do. It will not lower the number currently on the road. Under our plans the standard gauge line, which runs from Melbourne to Illabo, near Cootamundra, will finish its nearly 2,000 kilometre journey at the Port of Brisbane.


In my electorate the town of Parkes has a population of over 10,000 people and it will be a key part of the inland rail. It is already a key part of the transfer and transport system that affects not just eastern Australia but the whole of it. Inland rail will make Parkes the crossroad of eastern Australia, linking Adelaide to Brisbaneâ€”it already links Perth and Adelaide with Sydney. It will become an obvious link, particularly for Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Sydney, but even for Melbourne. It is an enormous opportunity, not just for Parkes but for the surrounding region, including the central-west of New South Wales. It gives the production from that region the opportunity to go straight to the three ports of Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, not to mention the other grain ports down around Wollongong. It opens Melbourne and Brisbane up. Whether it is mining or agriculture or forestry it will make the opportunities much better. There is nothing surer for a country that allows the transport systems to its ports, particularly a country like Australia, which is so export oriented in its primary industry.


There was a time when Brazil nearly came to a grand stop because of their transport system. It is a similar country to us, productivity wise, but it is just bigger, with a heck of a lot more people. When Brazil ignored its transport system it nearly brought their whole economy to a stop, and if we are not careful it will happen to us. People like Parkes mayor Ken Keith and his predecessor, and the previous general manager Allan McCormack and the current general manager in Parkes have all worked very hard to keep this alive, and I know we helped make it possible for $300 million to go towards that.


The bridges renewal program is very important in my part of the world. East of the Brumbeysâ€”not so much west of the Brumbeys out around Parkes, Forbes and further westâ€”around Cabonne, Blayney and the eastern side of the electorate there are any number of wooden bridges. They are very expensive to repair in this day and age. They talk about 30,000 across Australia. There are a heck of a lot of them in my part of the world and a heck of lot of them that do need renewing. Cabonne, for example, do have one heck of a lot of work to do over the next few years and have worked out how to fund most of theirs. It is a big issue. Timber bridges have to be in good condition to be used. There are a heck of a lot in the electorate of Calare that need to be upgraded or replaced.


I remember when the Roads to Recovery program was establishedâ€”I think it was around 1998 when John Anderson was the Deputy Prime Minister and roads minister. It is a fantastic program. The last Labor government were not game enough to rename it and it still has the name it started off with. That program is worth $8 million to the various councils in the electorate of Calare. The injection of $1.75 billion over the next five years will ensure that it will continue to upgrade those roads for which councils do not get direct funding. Allowing councils to decide entirely themselves how to spend the funding has been a huge part of the program's success and the fact that we fund it directly and do not allow state governments inâ€”not that I would accuse them of doing anything they should not do, but they are a little prone to getting their heads in the till when we give them money to pass on.


The Black Spot Program is another area where we are able to help councils. I must admit I am not entirely happy with the way it works in New South Wales. I think it is used for too many state roads rather than being used for council roads, which I think should be the main beneficiary. That is something that we need to look at. I am pleased to chair the panel in New South Wales. This program helps councils deal with roads where there has been a history of injury and death.


This bill is there to get on with infrastructure, road and rail, but infrastructure goes beyond road and rail. One of the main issues I have already mentioned is not just putting in an inland rail from Melbourne to Brisbane through the western part of my electorate, Parkes and other electorates but also providing access to Sydney and the country that Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson found 200 years ago on 31 May 1813, when they crossed the mountains and discovered Calareâ€”the best place to discover first. The area really does need a freeway. Governments are trying to ignore it and simply spend money on the Great Western Highway. There are 17 schools between Hartley and Penrith on the Great Western Highway. Would you seriously want to turn that into a freeway? No, you would not. Who would dream of having a freeway going past 17 schools. Basically that is what is happening at the moment. Yes, a lot of money is being spent on the Great Western Highway but they are not turning it into a freeway. Speed limits mean it is terribly slow. It is a terribly expensive project. While some overtaking lanes are being put on the old Bells Line of Road, a freeway is what we need and something that the state must do. They have to have the guts to get up and reserve the corridor to allow that express to happen. We all know where it should be. All they need to do is reserve the land and at least people will then know where it is going to go so it is ready to go. 


More immediate than most of those things is that the western two-thirds of my electorateâ€”in fact, beyond my electorate, including places like Grenfell, Cowra and further west down the Lachlanâ€”need water storage. State Water have identified the Needles dam as a magnificent sight, but it needs $3 million spent on it. It is not the first time I have mentioned this in this place and it certainly will not be the last until it happens. This project is absolutely necessary. It must happen and we must have the guts, the fortitude, the foresight and the leadership within the coalition to make it happen and make it happen in a couple of months time.


Calare is one of the engine rooms of Australia, certainly of New South Wales. The industries include energy, forestry, agriculture and very good coal. It exports all of those things. But you cannot go beyond a certain point without water. I am not talking about more irrigation. I am certainly talking about something that will give irrigation more security and I am certainly talking about the needs of industry, mining, development and urban development. It all has to happen and it needs to happen soon.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,8,1
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-03-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:07):  If there is one thing that is clear from this bill, it is that this government is very good at repealing acts, removing protections and tearing things down but, when it comes to building the public transport infrastructure that this country is going to need for the 21st century, it is missing in action. One would have expected that in one of the few significant pieces of infrastructure legislation that has come in here, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, it would be an opportunity to respond to the fact that our cities and the greater city areas in places like Melbourne, where I come from, are groaning under the weight of a growing population without a public transport plan to meet it.


If one were to come to the eastern edge of my electorate at peak hour in the morning, as the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, invited people to do, and look down the Eastern Freeway, what they would see is cars bumper to bumper and people spending hours in traffic jams wanting to come into the city or, perhaps, to the suburbs south of the city to go to work. What you would also see as you look down the Eastern Freeway from Clifton Hill outward is a great big swathe of land down the middleâ€”a reserve that, at the moment, is largely a green area set aside. It is a reserve going most of the length of the Eastern Freeway. That reserve was set aside some 30-odd years ago for a train line. If you go back and look in, I think, the 1979 or 1980 Melways street directory, what you see is, in fact, train stops marked out along that reserve down the middle of the Eastern Freeway. People were told at the time, 'Yes, we are going to build a freeway out there so that people who have no alternative but to drive can go to work in their cars but there will also be a train line out there.'


If you look at Perth, for example, you will see that with the freeways north up to Joondalup and south down to Mandurah they have done a very sensible thingâ€”which is, as the freeway was being built, they put a rail line down the middle. What you find is that it takes hundreds of thousands of cars off the road each year. And it is no surprise. I have been there myself. My parents spend some time down at Mandurah, and I have driven down to visit them. As you are driving down the freeway, all of a sudden a train whizzes past and overtakes you, and you think, 'Gee, I should have been on that because that would get me to my destination quicker.' When you have those rail lines going down the middle of the freeway, you find people make the choice because people want to do the right thing if the opportunity is presented to them. People know that petrol prices are just going to go up and up, and that building more roads to cure congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity. All it means is that in another few years time those roads will be full up as well and you are going to be stuck spending hours in traffic, in the morning or in the evening, that you could be spending at home with your family. That is why, when it comes to debating land transport infrastructure, the focus needs to be not what this bill is on but on improving our public transport.


In Melbourne, greater Melbourne and Victoria at large, the situation did not get much better after 11 years of state Labor government. Despite having 11 years to build that rail line out to Doncaster, where one train would take 800 cars off the road, they did not do that either. Instead, we saw under the previous, Labor government the hatching of the plan to build more roadsâ€”the East West Link. That plan is now being brought to fruition under the state Liberal government. One would have hoped that in this bill we might have seen some greater scrutiny on how Australian taxpayers' money is being spent. But, sadly, that is not happening, because we know that the current government is prepared to take $1.5 billion from the aid budget and put it into the East West Link. What we also know from the business caseâ€”not that the government want to tell us because they are fighting tooth and nail against releasing the business caseâ€”is that, for every dollar that the Australian taxpayer puts into the East West Link in Melbourne, you are going to get 80 cents back. It is a loss-making project. The only way that you can make it, on paper, look like it will make money is by fudging the figures and by putting pressure on people to include all kinds of other external benefits to bump it up so that, at least, in some sense, it makes money.


This is going to be Victoria's next desal plant, where everyday Victorians will be paying year after year for a piece of land transport infrastructure that should not be there. The winners will be the large private consortia that are going to get their risk underwritten by the public. The losers will be the Victorian public and the Australian public if they are forced to pay for this white elephant. It is going to increase pollution at a time when we should be cutting it, and it will wreck our inner-city parkland and homes. The East West Link will destroy what is good about Melbourne. It will destroy some of the reasons that people come to visit and live in those inner-city suburbs in Melbourne.


If it is built, we can forget about that rail line out to Doncaster, because what is clear, according to reports in the media in Melbourne, is that the only way this project can be close to being viable is by taking over that middle strip of land down the Eastern Freeway and turning it into extra lanes of traffic. If the East West Link goes ahead, you can forget about public transport out to the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. That is something that I do not think people in those marginal electorates out in the east have quite had explained to them yetâ€”that this means the end of the train line out so that you can get into the city. It is not just that the space will not be there; the money will not be there either. If we pour billions into a loss-making road project, that is money that is not there to build the rail line out to Doncaster or to build the metro that needs to be built in Melbourne.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have been lucky enough to travel around the world, you know you have been to a good city if you can get around without having to use a car. With the right planning, there is absolutely no reason why Melbourne or Sydney cannot be one of those cities or why Australia cannot be a world-class public transport country, but it is not in this bill. This bill does create a new capacity for a new eligible project type to allow funding of research and investigation of projects funded under the act, so you can submit innovative projects for consideration. Here is one for the government: why not put more money into public transport? Why is it that we are one of the few OECD countries that do not have a dedicated national line of funding and strategy for improving public transport in our big cities, where the majority of the population lives?


If in my state of Victoria there is a change of government at the election in November, and if the opposition climb down off the fence and agree that they will not proceed with the East West Link, then we have the possibility of saving Australian and Victorian taxpayers an enormous amount of money. I hear much said at times about the question of sovereign risk. It is said that we could not possibly rip up the contracts because that would be sovereign risk. It is not often that I would urge people to take a leaf out of the book of the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, but this is one such occasion. Over the last three years I sat in this place and watched the current Prime Minister, then opposition leader, in this parliament and everywhere else around the country saying, 'Don't sign up to any contracts or projects that depend on us putting a price on pollution, because I'm going to rip it up when we get into power.' We know that the approach of the current Prime Minister had the effect of pressing the pause button on a lot of investments in renewable energyâ€”investments that would otherwise have created jobs and cut pollution in this country. Perhaps state Labor should do the same thing. If they made it clear now that they would not go ahead and build the East West Link in Melbourne, I predict that it would not be built, that the Premier in Victoria would not proceed with his plan to sign contracts before the state election and that we would have a very different outcome after the election.


It is disappointing that, in dealing with land transport infrastructure legislation, we have nothing about public transport before us, but it is not surprising. This bill is a reflection of how out of step this government is with what people actually want from their governments. People want a bit of long-term planning. People want Australia to become a world-class public transport country and our cities to be places that you can get around without having to have a car. People do not want their houses bulldozed simply to fund a loss-making car project. People do not want Royal Park ripped up for on- and off-ramps. People do not want inner city Melbourne to become a magnet for traffic, which is what it will be if East West goes ahead.


I pay tribute to the community groups in Melbourne who, unlike the government with this piece of legislation, understand that we need a long-term plan and that successful, productive, livable cities in the 21st century will be those that are well served by public transport. The various groups in my electorate and more broadly that are campaigning against the East West Link and for more trains to get the people from the eastern suburbs into the city know that the economics do not stack up. As good as the western side of Melbourne isâ€”including the bit where I liveâ€”the drivers of those cars that are coming in on the Eastern Freeway do not want to go there. They do not want to go to Flemington or Footscray; they want to get into the city or the southern suburbs to go to work. The best way of cutting our pollution, reducing congestion on the roads and allowing people in Melbourne to spend more time at home with their families is to build public transport. This bill takes us in the opposite direction.


Debate interrupted.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,8,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:12):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 and to support the amendments moved by the shadow minister for infrastructure.


The Howard government was well remembered for its regional rorts. The Howard government minister at the centre of much of those rorting allegations is the very same minister who now oversees this legislation. At the time he made decisions about where money was to be spent, which projects were given the go-ahead and which projects were rejected. Having billions of dollars at your disposal to spend gives one considerable power. Therefore, not surprisingly, what we see in this bill is a transfer of decision making and with it a transfer of power from Infrastructure Australia to the minister.


Now why would you do that when there is no evidence, whatsoever, that the existing arrangements are flawed or problematic? Why even have an independent body like Infrastructure Australia if they are stripped of their authority? The value of an independent body comprised of a cross-section of skilled people is, in fact, to ensure that government funds are expended efficiently, wisely, in a justifiable priority and free of political interference. It was to stop the political interference and the rorting that the independent Infrastructure Australia was created. I suspect that this issue is not just about power but also that the changes are being made for other reasons. Those other reasons were to enable the Abbott government to deliver on election promises that they know did not stack up and which they know an independent body like Infrastructure Australia would not give priority to and, therefore, would very likely not be recommended for funding by that body.


I refer to projects like the South Road at Darlington project in Adelaide. The project was promised by the Abbott government in the lead-up to the 2013 election to shore up the vote of the member for Boothby. It is a major piece of infrastructure but, as worthy as it may be and as needed as it is, it is not Adelaide's highest priority infrastructure project. In fact, an alternative project for the very same road is considered a much higher priority project by the South Australian government's department of infrastructure andâ€”I strongly believeâ€”by the South Road commuting public. I refer to the alternative project of widening South road between Torrens Road and the River Torrens. What is more, a cost-benefit analysis of the two projectsâ€”that is, the South Road at Darlington upgrade and the South Road Torrens Road to River Torrens wideningâ€”shows that the return on the Torrens to Torrens widening is $2.40 for every dollar expended; compared with a return of 66c for every dollar spent on the Darlington project. That is why an independent body like Infrastructure Australia is unlikely to recommend the project, and it explains why the minister, through this legislation, seeks to and needs to sideline Infrastructure Australia. The Abbott government knows that it would otherwise be embarrassed in terms of the priority it gives its projects, because they are based not on merit but rather on political election promises. I believe that it is in order to avoid the embarrassment of having an independent body saying to the government: 'This is not the priority project that you should be funding,' that the independent body is being stripped of its power.


I raise another matter in respect of South Australia's share of local roads funding. Members opposite claim that this is the infrastructure Prime Minister that we now have in Australia, and that we have historical amounts of money being expended on national infrastructure. For the last two decades, South Australia has been receiving less than its fair share of local roads funding. South Australia has over 11 per cent of the nation's roads; it has over seven per cent of the nation's population; yet it receives over five per cent of road funding from the federal government. Each year, because of that injustice, the amount of money that is given to South Australia been supplemented. In fact, in the last government's budget the supplement was in the order of about $17 million a year for the next three years. South Australia is given that supplementary funding in order to make up the shortfall that it would otherwise be entitled to if it were to be given what we believe to be a reasonable share of the national road fundingâ€”a reasonable share being somewhere between the population quota of seven per cent and the total proportion, 11 per cent, of the country's roads. It is interesting to note that under the Roads to Recovery program the amount that South Australia gets is over eight per cent. In respect of that allocation, the quota seems quite reasonable and certainly much fairer than what it is under the other formula.


Given that, if South Australia is to get an increased share of local roads funding, it would come at the expense of allocations to other states, I can understand the difficulty in the past, with ministers saying, 'If South Australia gets an increased allocation, someone has to lose out.' The way to correct the anomalyâ€”it is an anomaly that dates back about 20 years; I do not understand the historical context of itâ€”is to increase the quantum of money that goes into road funding. You could then increase South Australia's allocation without decreasing the amounts that go to each of the states. My question to members opposite is this: if this is a historical amount of funding that is being provided to infrastructure, is this now not the time to correct the imbalance and give South Australia, once and for all and permanently, its fair share of national road funding from the federal government? I believe the opportunity is before us right now with this legislation and I would urge members opposite to consider correcting what has been a long-term anomaly and to restore South Australia's fair share of local roads funding.


This legislation has other aspects to it that are also of concern. I note with interest that the reference to climate change in Infrastructure Australia's guidelines is totally removed in this legislation. I find it unusual and perplexing that a government would think that just because you remove a reference to climate change it means the issue will go away. The truth of the matter is that it will not go away just because you remove references to it in your guidelines or in your legislation. That is a retrograde step on the part of the government. The reference to climate change is in there for a very good reasonâ€”that is, to ensure that projects take into account the possible effects of climate change into the future, when they are prioritised in terms of whether they should or should not get funding.


It is also interesting to see that the tax concessions for private investors in infrastructure are also being excluded from this legislation. We know that within Australia there is a deficit of infrastructure funding and infrastructure spending throughout the country. We know that the only way that that deficit will ever be made up is if we go into joint partnerships with private investors from time to time. In order to do that, there has to be an incentive for those investors. To take away the tax concessions that previously existed in legislation is a retrograde step, because it means that you will no longer attract the level of private investment in major infrastructure projects that you might otherwise have done, and in turn that means that infrastructure will either be delayed or never be built. As members opposite have quite rightly pointed outâ€”and members on this side have pointed out the sameâ€”efficient infrastructure adds to national productivity. It is as simple as that. In turn, national productivity not only adds to the nation's income but also adds to business efficiency and viability. We need to do all we can to ensure that we have the infrastructure that we need to serve this country, and not do the opposite by taking away the tax concessions which were put in place for a very good reason.


I return to my initial point, about transferring authority back to the minister, from a different perspective. A number of national bodies, including the Business Council of Australia, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Urban Development Institute of Australia, all support Labor's amendment to restore authority to Infrastructure Australia. They do so because they understand that Infrastructure Australia will always act independentlyâ€”free of politicsâ€”to argue the case about which projects need to be funded first.


We are dealing with considerable expenditures in infrastructure. It was the last Labor government that made infrastructure spending a major priority in this country. Under Labor we went from being about 20th in infrastructure spending amongst OECD countries to being first. That was the difference Labor made, ensuring sufficient public funds were dedicated to infrastructure in this country. To its credit, the Abbott government has maintained a high level of infrastructure spending. However, it is important not only to maintain a high level of infrastructure spending but also to ensure that it is spent in accordance with the priorities that best serve this nation. If bodies like the Business Council of Australia can say to the government that allocating funds to projects needs to remain independent of politics then the suggestion that Infrastructure Australia needs to remain independent is not simply some sort of left-wing conspiracy.


The independence of Infrastructure Australia will ensure the projects that are truly deserving of priority get the priority they need and hopefully the minister will, in turn, support them through the final determination. I do not doubt that ultimately these decisions always will be made by government, but the transparency of having an independent body put up a list of recommendations will be welcomed by the public. If the minister, having seen the recommendations from Infrastructure Australia, determines not to support the priorities then it will be necessary to explain that determination. If there is a justifiable argument then so be it, but if there is no justifiable argument then the public will have a right to know why a project was funded ahead of another project that everyone else knew full well would have given the taxpayers a better return for their dollars. At the end of the day, these are Australian taxpayer dollarsâ€”in the order of $50 billion to $60 billion over the next three or four years. These are substantial funds. The public have a right to know that those funds will be spent not in accordance with the political priorities of a government, regardless of which government is in office, but in accordance with national priorities where those funds will provide the Australian people with the best return on their dollars. 


For those reasons, I believe that the amendments moved by the shadow minister should be considered by the government. I believe that they are appropriate. With those comments, we broadly support the expenditure in this bill but I hope that members opposite take the opposition's amendments into consideration.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,8,2
"Wilson, Rick, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (12:26):  I rise today to support the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, which details the government's injection of $35.5 billion to infrastructure priorities. There are a number of areas that this funding will benefitâ€”$300 million will go to the Black Spot program addressing road sites that are high risk areas for serious crashes, $300 million to the bridges renewal program to restore dilapidated local bridges, and various other major infrastructure projects across the country. But, today, I would like to endorse the commitment of $1.75 billion to the Roads to Recovery program to ensure its future for another five years, through to 30 June 2019.


On 27 November 2000, the Howard government introduced a four-year road funding package worth $1.6 billion. Of this, $1.2 billion would be spent on the Roads to Recovery program. At this time the program was available because of a strong budget position. The Howard government acknowledged road funding infrastructure would be the best investment of these surplus funds as it would be of long-term benefit to the nation. In the second reading speech it was indicated that government was serious about the renewal of local roads. It recognised they were an essential element to the economic and social infrastructure of Australia's communitiesâ€”rural, regional and metropolitan. The Howard government was aware that local councils, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, were faced with significant problems of maintaining local roads from within existing funding. They also noted that the economic and social importance of local roads was increasing with the expansion and emergence of rural industries.


Having lived my whole life in Katanning, some 280 kilometres from Perth, I can tell you that local roads are an essential feeder to other parts of the transport system, especially between rural, regional and urban areas. They are vital to the sustainability and recovery of rural and regional Australia. Access to education, health care, commercial shopping and other amenities is dependent on local roads. Although the program has gone through several phases, all the key features from its introduction in 2000 are still current in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Warren Truss, said:


We are moving to deliver the infrastructure Australia critically needs â€¦ which, over six years, will build the vital road and rail projects to improve efficiency, boost productivity and drive Australia's economy forward.


This cannot happen without funding to maintain local roads in rural and regional areas. With an electorate that covers over 900,000 square kilometres, road infrastructure is very important to the people living in O'Connor, mainly because there are very few alternatives to driving everywhere. As an example, to drive from Perth to Esperance, a tourist destination within the electorate, you must drive 715 kilometres on a single-lane highway. In travelling to Esperance, you will drive through six local council areas just in the O'Connor electorate. Those councilsâ€”Brookton, Corrigin, Kondinin, Kulin, Lake Grace and Ravensthorpeâ€”are all responsible for the maintenance of the roads in their area. 


On top of this, transport infrastructure is vital to Australian agriculture, with the industry relying on an efficient and well-connected network to move livestock and grain. The O'Connor electorate has agriculture such as cattle, sheep, wheat, canola and barley, which all require roads for transport. If we are to enhance Australia's economic growth and productivity, open up opportunities for jobs and access to markets, and improve the efficiency and safety of our transport and freight networks, then infrastructure investment is critical.


The Roads to Recovery program is an essential element in local government's ability to maintain and upgrade local roads. It is an outstanding example of a partnership between national and local governments and of providing direct funding to local communities. The cost of maintenance on local roads is immense and, although largely met by rates, requires extra funding. A number of roads are now reaching the end of their economic life and their replacement costs cannot be met by local governments alone. 


Since 2000, the much needed Roads to Recovery funding has helped local government begin to address the backlog of local road maintenance, improving safety and transport efficiency and stimulating economic development across the country. Under the program, direct funding to local councils is distributed according to a formula based on population and road length set by the local government grants commission in each state. The funding through the Roads to Recovery program is untied grants, which provide the freedom for local governments to make their own decisions. 


The O'Connor electorate has 43 local governments, which were awarded a combined total of $18,952,000 in the 2013-14 Roads to Recovery funding allocations. I will take this opportunity to tell you about just a few projects that have only been made possible through Roads to Recovery funding. In the 2013-14 funding allocation, the Shire of Esperance was awarded $1.26 million in untied funding, which has allowed the council to fund six projects ranging in cost from $48,000 to $650,000. One project was the Coolinup Road upgrade, a project of $650,000, which was required as the road had reached the end of its design life. To ensure a safe road for drivers, 4.6 kilometres of the road had a full-width reconstruction completed, and the road was widened to 7.4 metres. A further $300,000 was required to upgrade two kilometres of the Gibson East Road because the existing road surface had cracked and was starting to pothole, due to it reaching the end of its design life. The road had a full-width reconstruction and was widened to 7.4 metres. Without the Roads to Recovery program, the Shire of Esperance would not be able to fund either of these projects, nor the other four projects that I have not specified. With close to $1 million spent on these two projects alone, there is no way the Shire of Esperance could fund this out of their own resources. This would mean the people living and travelling in this area would be seriously disadvantaged. 


The City of Albany has used their 2013-14 funding allocation of $1.94 million on eight separate projects, including the Willyung Road upgrade. Due to expansion and development, the traffic along this 1.7 kilometre stretch of road increased, and subsequently the pavement was wearing out. The road was also of insufficient width. So, with this funding, the City of Albany was able to reconstruct the pavement and widen the road to seven metres. The total cost of the project is estimated at $600,000, with $200,000 coming from the Roads to Recovery program.


The City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder has used their Roads to Recovery allocation of $1.1 million to fund five reconstruction projects. The five projects include: the Bourke Street reconstruction; the Connolly Street reconstruction, the Cheetham Street reconstruction, the Moran Street reconstruction and the Hampden Street reconstruction. Although these five projects might not be considered glamorous, they are much-needed asset management replacement to serve the needs of the community and the city's infrastructure replacement backlog. 


At the Shire of Pingelly, the $994,000 they were allocated through the 2013-14 Roads to Recovery program has


been spent on two separate projects. Funding of $697,037 went towards bridge refurbishment and maintenance works. The remaining Roads to Recovery funding was allocated to a road sealing program.


The Shire of Dundas has used their Roads to Recovery allocation to put in place a resealing program in Norseman. This program is based on resealing all the existing town streets in Norseman and Eucla over a 10-year period, to maintain the current level of service to residents and visitors in these towns. Barry Gibbs, the works manager for the Shire of Dundas has said: 'If this funding was not available for the shire, the shire would be looking at sealing one or two streets a year. The level of maintenance and reconstruction would then compound and increase, which would lead to the shire having to use more rates money on roadworks. This means less money would be available for other community projects like youth services and grants to community groups that are an important part outback life.'


The Shire of Dundas bitumen sealing works for 2013-14, made available by the Roads to Recovery program, has seen 21 projects undertaken. That is a far cry from the one or two that the shire would be able to complete on rates income alone. These projects, along with many others in the O'Connor electorate, were all funded by the Australian government through the Roads to Recovery program. The funding has been a huge help to the local councils involved. It is also a great example of how local councils are working closely with the Australian government to deliver projects that make a real difference locally.


In the 14 years that the Roads to Recovery program has been running, there have been various reviews undertaken and academic papers written on the program. The Auditor-General has also undertaken two separate


performance reviews. In the academic paper, Bang for the Buck? An Evaluation of the Roads to Recovery Program (2013), the report concluded: 


Taking stock of the available evidence there is little doubt that the R2R Program provided a much needed injection of funds, which has helped to alleviate the severe financial distress facing Australia local government and therefore ameliorate the deterioration of local road infrastructure. 


Separately to this, a key success factor for the Roads to Recovery Program is the simple administrative system which allows the maximum funding to go to roadworks, as determined by local councils, who know local transport needs and priorities. Without the Roads to Recovery program, the people of O'Connor would miss out on $18 million worth of road infrastructure upgrades and would be severely disadvantaged. There is already a lack of public transport and rail infrastructure in the electorate. We can alleviate this by providing the funding to ensure safer and more efficient roads. 


The Roads to Recovery Program will not be able to continue without the amendments to the NBP act in this bill as the act specifies the Roads to Recovery funding period as ending on 30 June 2014. The government is committed to supporting Australia's regions and to delivering funding where it is best needed. Another five years of Roads to Recovery funding will allow local councils to continue to maintain their road infrastructure, facilitate economic growth and diversity, and enhance liveability across regional Australia. I commend this bill to the House.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:37):  Whenever I listen to this debate about infrastructure and the number of times the Prime Minister has talked about it in the House, I get a sense of deja vu. I am hearing things that leave me trying to work out where I have heard them before. It seems that our Prime Minister must have a fascination with everything that the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, does, because in so many instances they are literally carbon copies of each other in their approach. For example, back in 2011 I saw a document circulating in New South Wales called 'A contract with New South Wales' to be entered into by Barry O'Farrell which referred to the party that was in favour of individual contracts bringing a collective agreement with the people of New South Wales. Congratulations on thatâ€”



Mr Chester interjectingâ€”




Mr HUSIC:
  I'll get to it, don't you worry, Member for Gippsland. It was a contract with New South Wales obviously designed because members of the coalition know that the public suspects that they fail to bring the public along with them in believing that they will actually keep their promises. So in 2011 we had a contract with New South Wales. Then what happened in last year's federal election? We have a contract with Australia signed by the Prime Minister. So it goes from New South Wales to the national level. We have it here and it is signed by Tony Abbott, so it must mean that he is going to follow through on what he says. 


I keep hearing the Prime Minister talk about how he is going to be the infrastructure Prime Minister, so I go back in time again and I see a reference in 2010 to someone trying to equate themselves with leadership and the provision of infrastructure. Who was it? It was the then opposition leader in New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, who said in December 2010 that he wanted to be seen as the infrastructure premier and that he would 'forfeit his leadership' if he could not deliver on his key promises. I fast-forward in time after Barry O'Farrell said that and I get to another document, which was released on 5 September last year, member for Gippsland. It was released by your illustrious leader, Tony Abbott, who said, 'If elected, I want to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister.' So everything that Barry O'Farrell does, Tony Abbott copies. I note that he did not say he would resign if he does not fulfil his commitments at the federal level, but on everything else he copies him. Tony Abbott to Barry O'Farrell is sort of like Marmite to Vegemiteâ€”it tries hard but it just cannot make it. People just cannot sign up to the original being replicated in this case. 


But it does not stop there; it just keeps on going. For example, Barry O'Farrell comes up with the idea of WestConnex. Notionally, you would agree with the idea to extend the M4 and make sure that it goes on into the city, because people in Western Sydney know that this has plagued transport, it has been the missing link in trying to get people moving more. But the O'Farrell government not only does not extend it all the way to the airport or into the city, they also impose a toll on parts of the M4 that were already paid for by Western Sydney motorists. That is scandalous, because the people in Western Sydney who dug into their pockets and paid for that roadway should not be hit again by this government. But they do it, and at the federal level Tony Abbott supports it.




Mr Chester:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Chifley has been here for long enough to know that he should refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Yes.




Mr HUSIC:
  The Prime Minister backs this notion of WestConnex reimposing a toll on the people of Western Sydney and does not explain to people that that funding is contingent on the toll. Then what happens? There is a suggestion that we will do an extension from the M2 to the F3. And what do they propose calling it? This will not be called WestConnex; now it is going to be called NorthConnex. Yet another example of original thinking from the coalition! 


What was even better was that two Sundays ago we had the coalition at the federal level turn up with the coalition at the state level and try to suggest that this was something that they came up with. Wrong. What actually happened was that they picked up a previous idea and claimed it as their own, and we saw the member for Wide Bayâ€”




Mr Chester:
  The Deputy Prime Minister.




Mr HUSIC:
  or, should I say, the Prime Minister, announcing this NorthConnex link. The issue is that the former Labor government actually spent quite a deal of time working with the New South Wales government to ensure that the money was put there so we could get started on that. We worked constructively with Transurban, who runs much of Sydney's road network and who is also responsible for the M2 and M7, and we will be proud to see a project that will see significant congestion avoided by getting rid of 21 sets of traffic lights. We dedicated significant government investment towards that, with an agreement from each level of government. It was about $400 million originally and we had to go back to augment that, but the key thing was that this was included in the 2013 budget as a result of extensive negotiation. So, again, we have the federal coalition copying and claiming credit for ideas that were someone else's and trying to pass them off as their own. 


The pressure is truly on this government to decide whether they are going to simply adopt a cut-and-paste approach to policy formulation and if they will also sidestep the errors of history. Bear in mind that there were two things that plagued the Howard government which this government needs to be mindful of, and they were particularly around the issue of capacity constraints that were brought on by skill shortages and, importantly, by infrastructure blockages. People saw the problems that were occurring around the country in terms of roads, rail and ports, and they will see whether this government will continue in the same vein as the Howard government or actually address infrastructure issues as they arise. This bill seeks to address a number of issues, including continuing funding for Roads to Recovery; acquiring a power to determine a Roads to Recovery list; distinction between national, network and off-network projects; and transport research funding criteria. That is all well and good, and, as the member for Makin indicated, our position will be to support the bill, but with amendments made to it.


We had a number of Labor achievements that had sought to address the failings of the Howard government when it came to infrastructure blockages. That is why, for example, our investments while in government were akin to rebuilding or upgrading 7,500 kilometres of road or 4,000 kilometres of railway lineâ€”and these all have major economic benefit. We had a legacy that Labor could be proud of. In six years in office we delivered record investment in the land transport system, including doubling the roads budget to $46.5 billion, which allowed us to build or upgrade those 7,500 kilometres of road. We also boosted Commonwealth road grants to councils by 20 per cent, and we put in historic levels of investment into the rail systemâ€”and again I make reference to the 4,000 kilometres of track. As the member for Makin indicated in his contribution, infrastructure spending across the economy rose to record levels. Australia rose from 20th in the 34 OECD nations in terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP to first under Labor's watch in the 2012 calendar year. That is something we are right to be proud of.


When you look at this whole issue of infrastructure, and particularly from a Western Sydney perspective, there is a big reason we would be focused on that. I would commend to the House a terrific speech that the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank delivered in November last year to the IARIW-UNSW conference 'Productivity, Measurement Drivers and Trends'. He talked about the important role of investment in infrastructure in boosting productivity and our standard of living, because we do face challenges in terms of trying to boost productivity in the years ahead. He said that few would disagree with the idea that improving infrastructure is important if we are to compete internationally and that investments in infrastructure transport would yield a social rate of return greater than the cost of financing, which he is absolutely right about. He talks about how effective transportation deepens markets and brings new opportunities to businesses. He highlights three challenges, the first being governance of project selection, saying that there needs to be quite a degree of strong governance in place about the way projects are selected. He also talks about the financing of projects and, importantly, he talks about capacity constraints, which again rear their head in this debate around infrastructure and the way in which the coalition will manageâ€”or mismanage, as is the concernâ€”infrastructure rollout. He says we need to find a way to identify the best projects and to find a way to finance them into the future.


On that issue of financing, I might make the point that a lot of people rush to talk about the need to impose tolls as a way of financing road development, but I would be one of those people who says that Western Sydney in particular pays its fair share of tolls. There is no doubt we need to find a way to finance roads. But, for example, if someone in the electorate of Chifley was to drive from Chifley into the city they would pay a toll of $5.25 the minute they got on to Power Street, Doonside, to get to the M2. They would pay another toll, of $6.11, at the M2, a toll of $3.06 at the Lane Cove Tunnel and another toll, of $4.00, when they crossed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. For two trips per dayâ€”bearing in mind that you do not necessarily pay the bridge toll on the way backâ€”people living in Western Sydney are paying more than $30 in tolls. So while road financing itself is certainly a challenge, the people of Western Sydney are already paying a fair share of tolls and are looking to pay an additional toll when it comes to WestConnex for roads they have already paid off and then paying for anything else this government might be planning for infrastructure down the tack in terms of roadways. The one that comes to mind is getting the M9 in Western Sydney done.


The speech from Philip Lowe, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, is also important because he makes the connection between infrastructureâ€”particularly transport infrastructureâ€”and housing affordability. He says that when house prices are high it is largely because land prices are high, and that happens when there is a shortage of well-located land, which is very important. We cannot do much about the physical supply of land, he says, but investment in transportation infrastructureâ€”making it easy to move around the cityâ€”can increase the supply of well-located land, which is an important point. In Western Sydney we need to ensure that transport infrastructure helps to liberate the movement of people across our region, one of the biggest and fastest-growing regions in the country. And we need to be able to do it in a way that is mindful of the fact that Western Sydney residents are already paying a very high price for that roads infrastructure.


The other thing that will be interesting to see in terms of well-located land is the issue of where Sydney's next major CBD within will be. Parramatta often claims it is the second CBD of Sydney. But in fact I think Parramatta is set to lose that mantle in timeâ€”and it should, because if we want to have the break between the exodus of people from Western Sydney to the east and back again, we should be looking to set up another CBD not to the east of where the bulk of people live but in the south-west growth centres, where it is likely to emerge that people will live. A lot of the grid structures of the old CBDsâ€”be they in Parramatta, Blacktown or Penrithâ€”are from the 18th century and have well and truly outlived their purpose. What is needed is for government and business to work together in establishing a CBD in the south-west growth centre, where 300,000 people are likely to move. Again, you can look at old CBDs, like the Church Street Mall in Parramatta or High Street in Penrith, which David Borger from the Sydney Business Chamber cites as 'urban failures' because they do not have natural movement corridors. I do not necessarily agree with a lot of things David Borger says these days, but I do agree with him that we need to sidestep the errors of the past and think of a CBD that is in the south-west of Sydney and that can be designed properly with natural movement corridorsâ€”and have the infrastructure to support it. This is what Western Sydney needs. It needs to have some vision applied to it, with government and business working in concert, to find a way to break the nexus of west to east travel, to be able to split the movement of people, and to ensure there are jobs in our area, where they are needed most. As the Draft Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney to 2031 points out, we will need quite a significant number of jobs in the years ahead. So, I commend this bill. I do not commend any notion that they will just cut and paste from previous policy. I certainly hope that they will make genuine inroads into improving transport infrastructure in this country.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (12:52):  I am pleased to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. Infrastructure is being prioritised by the coalition, as it should be. For too many years we have had infrastructure backlogs that have not been processed. In fact previous state governments were given money and never seemed to spend it on road and other development projects. One of the saddest things about the waste of the last six years was how the money spent was not invested in things that were to do with production and would give the taxpayer a return for their money. We are paying for that, and we have paid for that to a large degree.


I note this bill will pave the way for over $35 billion over the next six years to deliver an intricate infrastructure programâ€”and road and rail infrastructure is what matters. The first job of road and rail is to promote trade and production, and, personally, I think the carriage of people after that is a bonus. The main issue must be allowing your country to develop, to create jobs, and to get stuff to port, because we are a trading nationâ€”two-thirds of our agriculture a heck of a lot of our mining production goes overseas. I believe that in road and rail infrastructure people are a bonus rather than being what we should think about first.


The states and the territories obviously have to work with youâ€”and we nearly have a totally cooperative state system, but not quite, as of yesterday. We still have one recalcitrant state down there in the south, but of course it is not your state, Deputy Speaker.


There are a number of big ticket items in this bill, but I want to focus on the things that are particularly important to Calare, in New South Wales. This includes inland rail, Roads to Recovery, the Black Spot Program, and the Bridges Renewal Program, which is actually very important in our part of the world. There are another couple of issues I will bring up that are enormously important. It is about having the guts to look to the future. It is about having the leadership to make things happen. One thing happening is the Bells Line of Road upgrade, which will open up the whole of western New South Wales and central-western New South Wales, if we get a freeway through the mountain from Sydney. The other is a new dam, which is desperately needed by two-thirds of my electorate, and that must happen.


But firstly, in regard to inland rail, we are seeing progress on this, after a hiatus. It is an ambitious and vital project that will connect Brisbane to Melbourne, and do so very quickly. The provision of $300 million will allow plans, engineering and the environmental assessment to be finalised and allow the various authorities to get on with it. It will also encourage the private investment that will be a huge part of it.


Over the next 50 years the north to south movement is going to be enormous, as will the east to west movement. That is why this needs to be tied with a freeway through the mountains and a better rail system from Sydney heading west, which links up with Perth and Adelaide, and all the rest, on the transcontinental line.


I have heard people make the mistake of saying that this will take a million semitrailer loads off the road over time. It will not do that. What it will prevent is another million going on them. Nothing is going to stop what is currently being carried on the roads. The issue is how we prevent the roads getting more overloaded, and that is what rail can do. It will not lower the number currently on the road. Under our plans the standard gauge line, which runs from Melbourne to Illabo, near Cootamundra, will finish its nearly 2,000 kilometre journey at the Port of Brisbane.


In my electorate the town of Parkes has a population of over 10,000 people and it will be a key part of the inland rail. It is already a key part of the transfer and transport system that affects not just eastern Australia but the whole of it. Inland rail will make Parkes the crossroad of eastern Australia, linking Adelaide to Brisbaneâ€”it already links Perth and Adelaide with Sydney. It will become an obvious link, particularly for Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Sydney, but even for Melbourne. It is an enormous opportunity, not just for Parkes but for the surrounding region, including the central-west of New South Wales. It gives the production from that region the opportunity to go straight to the three ports of Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, not to mention the other grain ports down around Wollongong. It opens Melbourne and Brisbane up. Whether it is mining or agriculture or forestry it will make the opportunities much better. There is nothing surer for a country that allows the transport systems to its ports, particularly a country like Australia, which is so export oriented in its primary industry.


There was a time when Brazil nearly came to a grand stop because of their transport system. It is a similar country to us, productivity wise, but it is just bigger, with a heck of a lot more people. When Brazil ignored its transport system it nearly brought their whole economy to a stop, and if we are not careful it will happen to us. People like Parkes mayor Ken Keith and his predecessor, and the previous general manager Allan McCormack and the current general manager in Parkes have all worked very hard to keep this alive, and I know we helped make it possible for $300 million to go towards that.


The bridges renewal program is very important in my part of the world. East of the Brumbeysâ€”not so much west of the Brumbeys out around Parkes, Forbes and further westâ€”around Cabonne, Blayney and the eastern side of the electorate there are any number of wooden bridges. They are very expensive to repair in this day and age. They talk about 30,000 across Australia. There are a heck of a lot of them in my part of the world and a heck of lot of them that do need renewing. Cabonne, for example, do have one heck of a lot of work to do over the next few years and have worked out how to fund most of theirs. It is a big issue. Timber bridges have to be in good condition to be used. There are a heck of a lot in the electorate of Calare that need to be upgraded or replaced.


I remember when the Roads to Recovery program was establishedâ€”I think it was around 1998 when John Anderson was the Deputy Prime Minister and roads minister. It is a fantastic program. The last Labor government were not game enough to rename it and it still has the name it started off with. That program is worth $8 million to the various councils in the electorate of Calare. The injection of $1.75 billion over the next five years will ensure that it will continue to upgrade those roads for which councils do not get direct funding. Allowing councils to decide entirely themselves how to spend the funding has been a huge part of the program's success and the fact that we fund it directly and do not allow state governments inâ€”not that I would accuse them of doing anything they should not do, but they are a little prone to getting their heads in the till when we give them money to pass on.


The Black Spot Program is another area where we are able to help councils. I must admit I am not entirely happy with the way it works in New South Wales. I think it is used for too many state roads rather than being used for council roads, which I think should be the main beneficiary. That is something that we need to look at. I am pleased to chair the panel in New South Wales. This program helps councils deal with roads where there has been a history of injury and death.


This bill is there to get on with infrastructure, road and rail, but infrastructure goes beyond road and rail. One of the main issues I have already mentioned is not just putting in an inland rail from Melbourne to Brisbane through the western part of my electorate, Parkes and other electorates but also providing access to Sydney and the country that Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson found 200 years ago on 31 May 1813, when they crossed the mountains and discovered Calareâ€”the best place to discover first. The area really does need a freeway. Governments are trying to ignore it and simply spend money on the Great Western Highway. There are 17 schools between Hartley and Penrith on the Great Western Highway. Would you seriously want to turn that into a freeway? No, you would not. Who would dream of having a freeway going past 17 schools. Basically that is what is happening at the moment. Yes, a lot of money is being spent on the Great Western Highway but they are not turning it into a freeway. Speed limits mean it is terribly slow. It is a terribly expensive project. While some overtaking lanes are being put on the old Bells Line of Road, a freeway is what we need and something that the state must do. They have to have the guts to get up and reserve the corridor to allow that express to happen. We all know where it should be. All they need to do is reserve the land and at least people will then know where it is going to go so it is ready to go. 


More immediate than most of those things is that the western two-thirds of my electorateâ€”in fact, beyond my electorate, including places like Grenfell, Cowra and further west down the Lachlanâ€”need water storage. State Water have identified the Needles dam as a magnificent sight, but it needs $3 million spent on it. It is not the first time I have mentioned this in this place and it certainly will not be the last until it happens. This project is absolutely necessary. It must happen and we must have the guts, the fortitude, the foresight and the leadership within the coalition to make it happen and make it happen in a couple of months time.


Calare is one of the engine rooms of Australia, certainly of New South Wales. The industries include energy, forestry, agriculture and very good coal. It exports all of those things. But you cannot go beyond a certain point without water. I am not talking about more irrigation. I am certainly talking about something that will give irrigation more security and I am certainly talking about the needs of industry, mining, development and urban development. It all has to happen and it needs to happen soon.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-03-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:07):  If there is one thing that is clear from this bill, it is that this government is very good at repealing acts, removing protections and tearing things down but, when it comes to building the public transport infrastructure that this country is going to need for the 21st century, it is missing in action. One would have expected that in one of the few significant pieces of infrastructure legislation that has come in here, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, it would be an opportunity to respond to the fact that our cities and the greater city areas in places like Melbourne, where I come from, are groaning under the weight of a growing population without a public transport plan to meet it.


If one were to come to the eastern edge of my electorate at peak hour in the morning, as the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, invited people to do, and look down the Eastern Freeway, what they would see is cars bumper to bumper and people spending hours in traffic jams wanting to come into the city or, perhaps, to the suburbs south of the city to go to work. What you would also see as you look down the Eastern Freeway from Clifton Hill outward is a great big swathe of land down the middleâ€”a reserve that, at the moment, is largely a green area set aside. It is a reserve going most of the length of the Eastern Freeway. That reserve was set aside some 30-odd years ago for a train line. If you go back and look in, I think, the 1979 or 1980 Melways street directory, what you see is, in fact, train stops marked out along that reserve down the middle of the Eastern Freeway. People were told at the time, 'Yes, we are going to build a freeway out there so that people who have no alternative but to drive can go to work in their cars but there will also be a train line out there.'


If you look at Perth, for example, you will see that with the freeways north up to Joondalup and south down to Mandurah they have done a very sensible thingâ€”which is, as the freeway was being built, they put a rail line down the middle. What you find is that it takes hundreds of thousands of cars off the road each year. And it is no surprise. I have been there myself. My parents spend some time down at Mandurah, and I have driven down to visit them. As you are driving down the freeway, all of a sudden a train whizzes past and overtakes you, and you think, 'Gee, I should have been on that because that would get me to my destination quicker.' When you have those rail lines going down the middle of the freeway, you find people make the choice because people want to do the right thing if the opportunity is presented to them. People know that petrol prices are just going to go up and up, and that building more roads to cure congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity. All it means is that in another few years time those roads will be full up as well and you are going to be stuck spending hours in traffic, in the morning or in the evening, that you could be spending at home with your family. That is why, when it comes to debating land transport infrastructure, the focus needs to be not what this bill is on but on improving our public transport.


In Melbourne, greater Melbourne and Victoria at large, the situation did not get much better after 11 years of state Labor government. Despite having 11 years to build that rail line out to Doncaster, where one train would take 800 cars off the road, they did not do that either. Instead, we saw under the previous, Labor government the hatching of the plan to build more roadsâ€”the East West Link. That plan is now being brought to fruition under the state Liberal government. One would have hoped that in this bill we might have seen some greater scrutiny on how Australian taxpayers' money is being spent. But, sadly, that is not happening, because we know that the current government is prepared to take $1.5 billion from the aid budget and put it into the East West Link. What we also know from the business caseâ€”not that the government want to tell us because they are fighting tooth and nail against releasing the business caseâ€”is that, for every dollar that the Australian taxpayer puts into the East West Link in Melbourne, you are going to get 80 cents back. It is a loss-making project. The only way that you can make it, on paper, look like it will make money is by fudging the figures and by putting pressure on people to include all kinds of other external benefits to bump it up so that, at least, in some sense, it makes money.


This is going to be Victoria's next desal plant, where everyday Victorians will be paying year after year for a piece of land transport infrastructure that should not be there. The winners will be the large private consortia that are going to get their risk underwritten by the public. The losers will be the Victorian public and the Australian public if they are forced to pay for this white elephant. It is going to increase pollution at a time when we should be cutting it, and it will wreck our inner-city parkland and homes. The East West Link will destroy what is good about Melbourne. It will destroy some of the reasons that people come to visit and live in those inner-city suburbs in Melbourne.


If it is built, we can forget about that rail line out to Doncaster, because what is clear, according to reports in the media in Melbourne, is that the only way this project can be close to being viable is by taking over that middle strip of land down the Eastern Freeway and turning it into extra lanes of traffic. If the East West Link goes ahead, you can forget about public transport out to the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. That is something that I do not think people in those marginal electorates out in the east have quite had explained to them yetâ€”that this means the end of the train line out so that you can get into the city. It is not just that the space will not be there; the money will not be there either. If we pour billions into a loss-making road project, that is money that is not there to build the rail line out to Doncaster or to build the metro that needs to be built in Melbourne.


Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have been lucky enough to travel around the world, you know you have been to a good city if you can get around without having to use a car. With the right planning, there is absolutely no reason why Melbourne or Sydney cannot be one of those cities or why Australia cannot be a world-class public transport country, but it is not in this bill. This bill does create a new capacity for a new eligible project type to allow funding of research and investigation of projects funded under the act, so you can submit innovative projects for consideration. Here is one for the government: why not put more money into public transport? Why is it that we are one of the few OECD countries that do not have a dedicated national line of funding and strategy for improving public transport in our big cities, where the majority of the population lives?


If in my state of Victoria there is a change of government at the election in November, and if the opposition climb down off the fence and agree that they will not proceed with the East West Link, then we have the possibility of saving Australian and Victorian taxpayers an enormous amount of money. I hear much said at times about the question of sovereign risk. It is said that we could not possibly rip up the contracts because that would be sovereign risk. It is not often that I would urge people to take a leaf out of the book of the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, but this is one such occasion. Over the last three years I sat in this place and watched the current Prime Minister, then opposition leader, in this parliament and everywhere else around the country saying, 'Don't sign up to any contracts or projects that depend on us putting a price on pollution, because I'm going to rip it up when we get into power.' We know that the approach of the current Prime Minister had the effect of pressing the pause button on a lot of investments in renewable energyâ€”investments that would otherwise have created jobs and cut pollution in this country. Perhaps state Labor should do the same thing. If they made it clear now that they would not go ahead and build the East West Link in Melbourne, I predict that it would not be built, that the Premier in Victoria would not proceed with his plan to sign contracts before the state election and that we would have a very different outcome after the election.


It is disappointing that, in dealing with land transport infrastructure legislation, we have nothing about public transport before us, but it is not surprising. This bill is a reflection of how out of step this government is with what people actually want from their governments. People want a bit of long-term planning. People want Australia to become a world-class public transport country and our cities to be places that you can get around without having to have a car. People do not want their houses bulldozed simply to fund a loss-making car project. People do not want Royal Park ripped up for on- and off-ramps. People do not want inner city Melbourne to become a magnet for traffic, which is what it will be if East West goes ahead.


I pay tribute to the community groups in Melbourne who, unlike the government with this piece of legislation, understand that we need a long-term plan and that successful, productive, livable cities in the 21st century will be those that are well served by public transport. The various groups in my electorate and more broadly that are campaigning against the East West Link and for more trains to get the people from the eastern suburbs into the city know that the economics do not stack up. As good as the western side of Melbourne isâ€”including the bit where I liveâ€”the drivers of those cars that are coming in on the Eastern Freeway do not want to go there. They do not want to go to Flemington or Footscray; they want to get into the city or the southern suburbs to go to work. The best way of cutting our pollution, reducing congestion on the roads and allowing people in Melbourne to spend more time at home with their families is to build public transport. This bill takes us in the opposite direction.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (13:21):  Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure. To meet the challenges and opportunities ahead, the coalition government has made a clear commitment to building the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is necessary to facilitate our ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda and to provide sustainable development across the country for many years to come.


At the last election, voters in my electorate of Bennelong joined a chorus of voices from around Australia demanding a government of action, not words, to address the infrastructure problems plaguing our roads. After six years of rhetoric from the previous government, Prime Minister Abbott has already begun to address the congestion in our cities and the neglected transport infrastructure networks around the country.


This bill sends a strong message to all Australians that this government is one of action and that we take our mandate seriously. The present bill is one part of our plan for building the infrastructure of the future. The bill will enable the continuation of the successful Roads to Recovery program to ensure that vital funding for local governments to support the maintenance of local roads infrastructure will be made available beyond 30 June this year. The Roads to Recovery program was established under the Howard government in 2005 and is due to expire at the end of the financial year. This bill removes from the act the specification of the funding period, allowing new funding to begin on 1 July 2014 and eliminating the need to amend the act in the future every time the funding period expires. This will help ensure that the program will continue well into the future. 


The bill further inserts a power for the minister to determine a Roads to Recovery list, which is essential for the program to be able to function. The Roads to Recovery list will be exempt from disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and this will provide certainty for the local government funding recipients of the program. Importantly, the bill introduces a new category of project that can receive funding under the act. Projects that involve research, investigation, studies or analysis of investment, or Black Spot projects, previously funded off-network projects and works funded under the Roads to Recovery program, will now be eligible for funding. This funding will also be available for analysis of projects submitted for consideration for funding as investments or Black Spot projects to help inform and advise the government. 


Funding for these vital research and analysis projects is in line with the coalition government's commitment to the continuation of the Black Spot Program, which provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. The Black Spot Program has funded vital road improvement projects in my electorate of Bennelong in Blaxland Road, Lane Cove Road, Epping Road, Constitution Road, Quarry Road, Rose Street and Shaftesbury Roadâ€”they have all benefited from this program, which helps keep Bennelong constituents more safe. The bill will ensure that many potential life-saving projects will be funded into the future, both in Bennelong and across the nation. The coalition government is working with the state and territory governments to deliver nationally significant infrastructure projects to grow Australia's productivity and to improve living standards. 


We are a government which recognises the need to work in partnership with the private sector to maximise private capital investment in infrastructure and to create meaningful employment to benefit all Australians. Collaboration  between the Australian government, states and territories and the private sector will enable us to successfully deliver the infrastructure that Australians expect. The continuation of funding under this bill will ensure that we can provide Australians with the roads of the 21st centuryâ€”roads that industry and our communities deserve. 


Through the Infrastructure Investment program the coalition government has committed $35.5 billion over six years to road and rail projects. This is a considerable investment in Australia's future and in the safety and efficiency of our extensive transport networks. Our investment includes $6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway, $5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway and $1.5 billion to the WestConnex project in Sydney. 


Bennelong constituents will no doubt be pleased that this government's $405 million commitment towards the F3-M2 link project in Sydney will dramatically improve local congestion by diverting traffic away from our electorate. This will save commuters considerable time and difficulty and improve the quality of life for all those currently affected by heavy traffic and delays. Similar projects include construction of the East West Link in Melbourne and the Swan Valley Bypass on the Perth-Darwin National Highway. It will be welcomed by commuters and provide much-needed upgrades to our national infrastructure networks and the connectedness of our vast land. This government recognises the great range of stakeholders in infrastructure development and has sought to expand the types of bodies eligible for funding under the act to further promote research into our roads and rail networks. 


A central pillar of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is the introduction of two new types of eligible funding recipients into the act. Partnerships have been added as eligible funding recipients which simplify funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. This will also benefit non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research related to land transport operations. The bill includes a new requirement that states and territories notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using the Australian government funding. This will ensure a timely response for land sales or disposal from the states and territories and the Australian government. Importantly, it will also ensure that the proceeds of the sale or disposal are then allocated to new infrastructure projects to promote further improvements and developments to our infrastructure network. The bill slightly alters one of the reasons for granting states and territories an exemption from the public tender requirements under the current act. Work that costs less than an amount prescribed by regulations can currently be exempted from funding. This is being altered so that the amount is determined instead by legislative instrument. This alteration will reduce regulatory delays and create greater clarity in this area. The bill makes no amendments to the national land transport network, which remains a vital component of the Infrastructure Investment program. This network contains the key road and rail links connecting Australia. The significant investments in transport and infrastructure projects proposed by the government will greatly improve the connectedness and accessibility of existing transport corridors and major hubs around the country. 


I am proud to work alongside Prime Minister Abbottâ€”the infrastructure Prime Ministerâ€”to put our plans into action. This bill is one part of our ultimate vision to provide Australians with first-class roads and rail networks. On behalf of the people Bennelong, I applaud the government for their dedication to improving our nation's infrastructure, for clearing the backlog of vital works and for honouring the commitment we made to the Australian people at the last election. 


I commend this bill to the House.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (13:21):  Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure. To meet the challenges and opportunities ahead, the coalition government has made a clear commitment to building the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is necessary to facilitate our ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda and to provide sustainable development across the country for many years to come.


At the last election, voters in my electorate of Bennelong joined a chorus of voices from around Australia demanding a government of action, not words, to address the infrastructure problems plaguing our roads. After six years of rhetoric from the previous government, Prime Minister Abbott has already begun to address the congestion in our cities and the neglected transport infrastructure networks around the country.


This bill sends a strong message to all Australians that this government is one of action and that we take our mandate seriously. The present bill is one part of our plan for building the infrastructure of the future.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:29):  I rise to inform the House of the passing of a much loved member of my local community Mr John Cohen OAM on 18 March 2014. John was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1919. After being thrown out of school at 14 by the Nazis, John came to Australia as a refugee in 1938. He joined the Labor Party in Perth in 1940 when he was nominated by the late Kim Beazley Snr. John later moved to Melbourne with his wife, Shirley, where he became well known as a tireless believer in, and worker for, the Labor cause.


I have many fond memories of John, most recently at Caritas Christi, his mind still engaged in politics. In 2011 local Labor branch members gathered to celebrate John's 70th year of ALP membership. I recall his passionate speech that day about his vast life experiences: in Europe as a young man, his journey to Australia before the war and the role that Labor had played in his life. I recall the great pride he showed in receiving a moving tribute from Bob Hawke, thanking him for his service to the party. He was a man whose beliefs were born out of sheer life experience. He is a deeply considered and passionate man. My thoughts are with his family: his wife, Shirley; his children, Rhonda, Roslyn and Keith; and his grandchildren.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkesâ€”The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:10):  I rise today to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to do so. This bill will enable the rollout of Roads to Recovery over six years and help to build vital road and rail projects. As someone who represents a third of New South Wales I fully understand the importance of having good road and rail projects. I would like to pay tribute to one of my predecessors, John Anderson, a former member for Gwydir, who was the minister at the time the Roads to Recovery program was mooted. I might also say that it came from a meeting that was held at Moree, in my electorate, organised by the Moree Plains Shire Council.


This bill will continue the rollout of the program until 30 June 2019, with $1.75 billion in funding. As someone who was previously a mayor of the Gwydir Shire Council I have a great understanding of the importance of the Roads to Recovery program. Roads to Recovery has been one of those programs that you will find no criticism of anywhere in this place, on either side of the House. It is a direct connection of funding from the federal government to local government. The programs are decided by the local government, and a large proportion of the money actually hits the asset where it is supposed to.


As someone who represents 17 local government areas I should say that if it was not for the Roads to Recovery program many of my councils would be in a lot of financial strife. Roads to Recovery funding in my electorate, over the length of the program, is something like $72 million. That is not only enabling many kilometres of new roads and road repairs to be laid out but it is also providing a valuable cash flow and resource for the councils in my area.


This bill will also allow the continuation of the Black Spot Program in places that have been identified as high risk. Even though the road toll over the last 20 or 30 years has been halved in Australia, it is still way too high. Unfortunately many of the people who die on our roads do so on rural roads, and many of them are still dying in identified black spot areas. This program will allow funding to go to those areas.


It is important to realise that pretty much everything we buy on the shelves of our supermarkets started its journey on a local road. Roads to Recovery is directly funding local roads. It does not apply to state roads and it does not apply to national highways. It is direct funding to councils for local roads.


In the Parkes electorate, there are many farms and businessesâ€”that rely on local roadsâ€”that generate billions of dollars of export income and provide produce that finds its way onto the shelves of supermarkets not only around Australia but around the world. While this program is very much appreciated, we must not think that we are doing enough for local roads. We need to be constantly looking at how we can continue to fund local roads. I would like to mention the Australian Rural Road Group that was formed by the Gwydir and Moree Plains councils. It has nearly 100 members right around Australiaâ€”councils that represent the high-producing agricultural shires in Australia and generally the councils that have low population densities but very high productivity. Quite often, the criterion that is used to measure the use of a road and the need for the funding or the upgrade of a road is traffic count. But that is not enough. We need to be looking at the productivity and the produce that come along the roads and the efficiency that that brings. 


The advent of the inland rail line from Melbourne to Brisbane took another step forward with the change of government. Minister Truss has allocated $300 million in the next term of government to get that project up and running. The implementation committee for that project was formed and chaired by my predecessor, John Anderson. That inland rail will provide a steel backbone for infrastructure right down the eastern side of Australia. It will be to Australia what the Mississippi is to the United States. We need to start planning our infrastructure around this inland rail line. We need to start to looking at where local road and rail interface and at how we can get the travel time down to the ports and the major markets, and do it in a more energy efficient way. This rail line will certainly do that. 


The main rail line that goes from Sydney to Perth runs through the bottom end of the Parkes electorate. To see double-stacked container trains nearly two kilometres long hurtling through the electorate certainly shows that this is the way of the future to shift freight. It is not much good if we have beef from feedlots or grain or cotton that is stranded on farm because of crummy infrastructure. As we speak, the forecast for rain this week across inland New South Wales and Queensland is very strong. That is a two-edged sword. While we will never not look forward to rainfall, it will mean that children will not be going to school and produce will not be going to market because of the state of the roads.


The issue here with rural roads is how did we got to this point? I would like to compliment the Rural Road Group, because they are working on a pilot program with half a dozen or so local government areas in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland that will measure the actual asset of the road. What has happened in the pastâ€”and I know this from experience as a mayor in a local government areaâ€”is that, quite often, the value of the write-down of those road assets has not been fully displayed. Because of the close relationship between local government and state government and the very parlous nature of the finances of local government, quite often the full level of the write-down of roads is not reported and it shows up on the balance sheet as a large loss, and the next thing you know is that that local government area is under the watchful eye of the state government for being in financial difficulty. So over the years, the actual size of the problem has been disguised somewhat. What is happening now in Moree Plains, Gwydir, Narrabri and some of the council areas in southern Queensland is that they are developing an asset management tool that can be transferred right across Australia. So at one point, as a government we can look at the state of every road in Australia and it will be in a recognised reporting system. We will be able to start to identify some priorities as to where the funds need to go and to start to have an objective look at allocating these assets. The real state of affairs has been hidden for some time. It is time that we looked at managing our assets in a more professional way and it is time that we started tying in the productivity of regional Australia with some of the spending on our road networks. 


It does give me a great deal of pleasure to support this bill knowing that we have a government and a minister totally focused on infrastructure, and that we are starting to see a planned rollout for transport infrastructure across Australia and indeed regional Australia. Not only does this tie into the lifestyle effects that I have talked aboutâ€”getting produce to market, kids to school, people to hospital and the likeâ€”but, as we need to be careful with our resources and as we become more aware of the need to preserve what resources we have, we need to be moving this freight around in the most cost-effective way. The road-rail interchange model that is being formulated at the moment is definitely a more cost-effective means to go about it. The number of trucks that that inland rail will take off the Newell Highway will be increased and the number of litres of diesel per tonne of freight moved will be drastically reduced because of this program.


Therefore, I am in support of the Land Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. It is a commitment of $35.5 billion in infrastructure investment. It will roll out over six years and, so, local government and infrastructure organisations will have the confidence to know that that funding is ongoing and, every time there is a change government, we will not have to go into this area of uncertainty. It does indicate that the Abbott-Truss government is committed to infrastructure. It does indicate that I am committed to infrastructure. I encourage anyone that is listening to me today to refer to my first speech in this place, in February 2008. Indeed, this is what I spoke aboutâ€”the need for funding for regional roads, the need for a railway line from Melbourne to Brisbane and the need for a plan to tie it all together. It is such a relief, and it gives me great pleasure, after being in this place for over six years now, to finally be part of a team that has the will, the plans and the gumption to make all this happen.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrestâ€”Government Whip) (15:24):  The purpose of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, to rename the act the National Land Transport Act 2014 and to enable the continuation of what we all know is a very important program, the Roads to Recovery program, beyond 30 June 2014. There are very practical measures in this bill. We in rural and regional Australia well understand the importance of having practical measures to deliver critical infrastructure in regional areas right throughout Australia.


The bill also amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to combine parts 3 and 6 into one part for investment, to streamline the actâ€”again, a very practical measureâ€”and to add a new eligible project type into part 4 to allow funding of research and investigations of projects funded under the act or submitted for consideration for funding under the act. As we know, such research will inform advice to government and enhance the management of projects. Also, it will add two new eligible funding recipientsâ€”partnerships for parts 4 and 5 and funding for land transport research entities and non-corporate Commonwealth entities for part 5â€”to expand the types of organisations that can be funded to undertake research, investigations, studies and analysis under the act. Again, these are practical measures. The bill also repeals the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Roads to Recovery Act 2000 and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958, as these are all spent legislation.


Amendments to the Nation Building Program are necessary to allow the government to proceed with what is an ambitious infrastructure agenda. I am very proud to be part of an infrastructure government under an infrastructure Prime Minister. The key function of the bill is to enable the continuation of what is unconditionally known as a very successful and critical programâ€”the Roads to Recovery program. This provides desperately needed funding to local governments for the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure. What connects people and communities, and all of the economic multipliers in regional areas, is mostly because of roads. It is very, very important funding for local governments. When I talk to my local governments, each one of them always tells me how important this funding is for them to be able to deliver what is needed in their particular areas.


The current program stalls on 30 June and it specifies funding to that date. The bill removes the definition and specification of the funding period and places it in the Roads to Recovery list. In practical terms, this removes the need to introduce a new bill to the parliament every time the Roads to Recovery funding period changes, and ensures that this critical program will continue. This is a very, very good measure contained in this bill. It will ensure that that real delivery on the ground in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia will continue.


As we know, and we have heard repeatedly in this place, local councils would struggle to be able to deliver their roads programs, if at all, without this funding. The bill also allows the minister to determine a Roads to Recovery list. This will be exempt from disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Again, this provides certainty, which is so important to local governments. It provides certainty to local government funding recipients of the program.


The bill combines part 3 of the original National Building Program act with part 6, or off-network projects, into one part for all investment projects. This is a unification and streamlining and, for practical purposes, will enhance the operation of the act. The existing parts 3 and 6 contain a significant number of identical provisions and combining them will remove the unnecessary duplication of provisions. The new part 3 for investment projects also includes a new requirement that states and territories notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian government funding. That will ensure that proper accountability is maintained and that there is a timely response to land sales or disposals from both the states and territories and the Australian government. Then the proceeds of the sale or disposal should be allocated to new infrastructure projects that enhance the Australian economy and continue to remove the existing bottlenecks, which we know in regional areas are really important and affect how products get to market. They are things that affect the economies in regional and rural areas.


The bill also alters the value of work that can currently be exempted from public tender requirements. Currently, the amount is prescribed by regulations; however, this will be altered to determination instead by legislative instrument. That will reduce the regulatory delays. It introduces a new type of project that can receive funding under part 4 for transport, development and innovation projects. Projects that involve research investigation studies or analysis of the important black spot projects, previously funded off-network projects and works funded under the Roads to Recovery program will be eligible for part 4 funding. It could also be used for projects submitted for consideration for funding as investment or black spot projects, again to help form advice to government.


This amendment enhances the management of projects and the infrastructure investment program. The bill also adds two new types of eligible funding recipient into the act. Partnerships have been added for funding recipients in parts 4 and 5. This change simplifies funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research related to land transport research operations will now be able to receive funding under part 5, which is funding for land transport research entities.


The government has committed, importantly, to continuation of the Black Spot Programme, which provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. There are many of these around Australia, and it is a program that is essential for state and local governments to be able to fulfil their local road safety commitments. Black spot projects are administered under part 7 and remain largely unchanged. The bill makes no amendments to the national land transport network. The network contains the key road and rail links connecting Australia and is a vital component of the government's infrastructure investment program.


Like many in this place, it would not surprise the House that, in discussions about transport infrastructure, the needs of my electorate of Forrest should also be considered. The bill before the House today repeals the Roads to Recovery Act 2000, which instigated the Roads to Recovery Program. It was moved into the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005 and then the nation-building program of 2009. AusLink was a defining national network that superseded the former national highway system and included important road and rail infrastructure links and their intermodal connections. It was first proposed in a green paper issued in 2002. AusLink connected many of the major economic and population centres of Australia; but, when it came to the south-west of Western Australia, this actually stopped at Bunbury in my electorate.


In the intervening years the south-west has grown significantly. It is now one of the fastest-growing regional areas in Australia. I well understand the budget challenges created by the former Labor government; however, I will continue to work towards having some of the major arterial roads in the south and east of Bunbury recognised by the federal government as roads of national significance. This is important because in the south-west we produce seven per cent of WA's total gross state product and in recent years there has been a 10 per cent growth rate in the south-west. As we know, Western Australia produces 46 per cent of Australia's export wealth. In time, as soon as the budget allows, I would hope that all levels of government would contribute to road infrastructure in the south-west given the continuous growth that we are seeing. Only then will the region be able to grow and develop to its full potential.


As I have said, the south-west is a jewel in the grown of the state's economic and cultural development. It is an environmental icon as well, listed as one of the world's international biodiversity hot spots. The region is also a tourism and holiday destination of choice. The fact that we have major infrastructure through the port is often overlooked. We also have significant exports; over 10 million tonnes is exported through the port of Bunbury on an annual basis. Mining and resource manufacturing are a major part of my electorate, and that is why transport links are so important. It is another reason the tax on diesel fuelâ€”the carbon tax that Labor were to impose in July this yearâ€”would have a critical impact right throughout Western Australia and throughout my electorate.


The wide range of activity in the south-west, coupled with the significant regional population growth of over 2.1 per cent a year compared with the state's average of 1.8 per cent and the nation's 1.4, continues to put significant pressure on the transport infrastructure of the region. Frequently I look at the waste and mismanagement in the previous government and think what some of those fundsâ€”and even what is currently being paid in interest on the debt that has been acquiredâ€”would do to deliver infrastructure in my region.


With this in mind, the Bunbury Outer Ring Road project is an essential and urgent piece of infrastructure. This is a project that has been expanded in stages. I was at the opening of stage 1 of the port access road in 2010. Stages 1 and 2 of Bunbury Outer Ring Road were completed last year. The remaining stage of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road is estimated to cost over $700 million, and that is why I can understand the challenges facing the budget and why, if it were not for some of the waste and mismanagement, these are the types of projects we would be able to fund. I look forward to a very responsible government looking seriously at these types of road transport projects in the future.


In the longer term I can see throughout the south-west that dual lanes from Perth to Margaret River will be essential. It is one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia and will continue to be so. It is part of my long-term transport vision for the south west, and of course this is also about the economic development of my part of the world. It is a major economic driver for Western Australia and for the Australian economy. As I say, frequently it is not well-understood that not only do we have mining resources but also we have agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. I have one of the most diverse electorates in Australia. Of course that brings with it huge demands for infrastructure, something that I know the minister at the table, Minister Truss, is very well aware off from looking at the infrastructure needs across this country. I am very pleased to support this particular bill and to be a part of an infrastructure minister's efforts, an infrastructure Prime Minister's efforts  and an infrastructure government.

There is a universal agreement on both sides of the parliament that infrastructure and building better infrastructure are important national priorities and that we as a parliament need to do what we can to provide adequate infrastructure to service the needs of our country and our growing economy in the years ahead. This bill will not only help put in place the arrangements for funding for major infrastructure projects, particularly over the next five years, but also it will set in place a legislative framework which will endure and support future governments' initiatives in land transport. The government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, as the previous speaker, Ms Marino, said and the changes in the bill will help us achieve this goal. The amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transparent infrastructure agenda. 


The bill continues the vitally important Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June 2014. Amendments to the act are necessary as it currently specifies the Roads to Recovery funding period as ending on 30 June 2014. The bill removes this specification from the act and places it in Roads to Recovery list, which allows the program to continue and removes the need to amend the act every time the funding period changes.


The bill renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. This means that the act will not need to be amended if the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program changes. It is the most sensible name for the act and keeps it above politics. The bill also streamlines and enhances the operation of the act to benefit the states and territories and the Commonwealth. 


The bill is consistent with the government's deregulation agenda, repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. There are no regulatory or financial impacts on business and on the amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 or the repeal of the spent legislation. 


I do not propose to respond specifically to all of the comments made by members in their contributions, but I do acknowledge their general support for infrastructure investment and for ensuring that we have an adequate program to meet our nation's needs. Some members spoke in support of existing projects, which are in the program, and many others raised, on behalf of their electorates, other major road projectsâ€”all of them, no doubt, worthy. They would like to see these projects included in the land transport program in the years ahead. I hope we can continue to build on the foundations of the past and to expand the quality of our road and rail network right across the nation. This legislation will certainly contribute to that. 


There is often debate between both sides of politics as to who has done the most in relation to road funding and road construction and I suspect that that will always be a part of the political debate. The member for Grayndler likes to speak with some degree of pride about what was achieved in his term in government. I would just remind him that the Howard government spent more on infrastructure than the previous ALP government and the next coalition government is going to spend more on infrastructure than the last Labor government. The Howard government was the first to establish a national transport plan and I think both sides of politics, while we may have different priorities, have sought to work on stronger infrastructure for our nation. I hope that that can be continued in future. 


The government has identified a long list of projects that will be our priorities over the next five years. I think all of those projects will make a real difference. I am sure that in additionâ€”unless this government serves for many decades, which we naturally hope to doâ€”there will be projects that will cross governments. I suspect that the list of projects, in many instances, will be fairly similar. On Friday, I had the privilege of opening the Hunter Expressway, for which the money was first provided in 1997 and its actual construction crossed three federal governments. That is not uncommon in these very large infrastructure projects. In reality we need to work constructively as a parliament to put together the kinds of infrastructure projects that will make a real difference in the future. 


The program we have announced and we are determined to deliver includes quite a number of new projects. They will be of particular significance in the cities and in regional Australia. Beyond that we have fully committed and budgeted for the projects that the previous government had planned to fund with the proceeds of the mining tax, which commitments it was never going to be capable of meeting. This demonstrates why this government is committed to building and delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century and beyond. 


I commend the bill to the House.

These amendments go to what I believe is the inadequate drafting of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 that is before the parliament this afternoon. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program is an initiative that we established under the existing nation building program act in 2009. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as you would be familiar because your electorate in Maranoa was a big beneficiary, it was aimed at improving safety and productivity outcomes of heavy vehicle operations across Australia. It was very clear after representation from organisations, including the Australian Trucking Association and the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association, and individual trucking companies and operators that there was a gap to be filled in terms of the program so the former government established the first Commonwealth dedicated program of its kind. Given the nature of this new legislation that is providing a framework for infrastructure and transport funding moving forward, I think it would be appropriate to include it in the act at this time.


The former government allocated some $70 million in the period 2008-09 to 2011-12. In the 2012 and 2013 budgets the former Labor government provided a further $250 million to extend this program. Total spending on the program became $320 million. It is a very significant program particularly aimed at road safety. When it comes to road safety we know that an extraordinary percentage of fatal accidents involve heavy vehicles. That is a problem for people who dedicate their very hardworking lives to driving on our highways to deliver products to market. It is also a problem for every driver because we all share the road with those heavy vehicles. Already there are 294 projects in total, including some 236 projects that have been completed, along with over 140 new or upgraded rest areas and 46 new or upgraded parking and decoupling bays.



Round 3 project criteria included funding the states and territories under six categories: rest area projects, which were about improving the provision of heavy vehicle rest areas on key interstate routes; parking and decoupling bay projects, which went to providing heavy vehicle parking and decoupling areas and facilities in outer urban and regional communities; and technology trial projects, which included the trial technologies to improve heavy vehicle safety and/or productivity. We know that this has reaped dividends in the past. Then there is the area of 'improving undercarriage'. There are considerable fatalities where literally heavy vehicles go over the top of passenger motor vehicles. This new technology ensures that that does not occur. New technology can also be designed to ensure that notification is given to a heavy vehicle driver who goes out of their lane. New technology can also provide for automated braking if a heavy vehicle gets too close to the vehicle in front of it. That automatic braking system has been advocated by people, including Lindsay Fox and others in the transport industry. This is an area that has seen extraordinary progress in saving lives and is one of the reasons why I think we as a parliament can be proud of the difference we have made in recent years to reduce the fatality rate on our roads. (Extension of time granted)


The fourth area is road enhancement projects. This can enhance the capacity and/or safety of roads, including bridges, to allow access by high-productivity vehicles to more of the road network. This again is a common-sense initiative. You should not have bottlenecks because bridges cannot take the weight of a heavy vehicle and therefore the driver has to, literally, spend many additional hours on the road with the consequential cost to the driver and the consequential cost to those who share the road with that driver, as well as the increased emissions and increased costs at the end of the day to the consumer who has to pay those flow-through costs. So this was a very sensible initiative.


The fifth is demonstration projects to facilitate innovation to improve heavy-vehicle safety and productivity projects. Again, working with the industry itselfâ€”to get that feedback and to make sure that the government is responsive to the needs of industry and of those people who work on the frontline in this industry.


The last was particularly important, and came from very specific representations from ALRTA, the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters' Association. It is livestock transport industry projects which improve heavy-vehicle safety and productivity for specific livestock transport operations. The former member for New England was a big champion of this particular area. In terms of the assistance given, when you look at the website you see projects from right around the countryâ€”particularly in Queensland, which is not surprising given the nature of the state thereâ€”to have improvements which make an enormous difference to safety and to the working lives of those people who work in that industry. For heavy-vehicle safety, I believe this is particularly important.


Of course, it was consistent with our initiative in introducing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. That arose out of the landmark report of the House of Representatives committee supported by, and including, the former member for Hinkler, Paul Neville. He was a big champion of this reform, which essentially introduced Safe Rates and acknowledged that the power in the marketplace between an individual driver and a big company is not even, and that that pressure could lead to practices which cost lives. We know that is the case. No-one could not be moved if they spoke to one of the wives or family of people who have lost their lives because of the pressure that was placed on these people on our roads.


That is why the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was enacted by the former government. I believe that it was an absolutely critical reform. We were given a reminder of it recently by the Four Corners program, which outlined very clearly, in practical terms, why this issue should not be one of ideology and of partisan political debate. This should be something that is above party politics and should be an issue which is supported by all in this chamberâ€”particularly by representatives from regional Australia. It is in regional Australia that most of the incidences involving heavy vehicles which cause fatalities occur.


These are sensible reforms, putting in place a framework which stops the undue exercise of pressure on drivers to drive what are sometimes extraordinary hours have been indicated. In Australia, people driving for more than 24 hours straight should not occur. There needs to be a framework around that. (Extension of time granted)This is critical and we established the Safe Rates Remuneration Tribunal. It commenced operation in July. 2012. The object of the act is to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry. The tribunal's role in this area primarily relates to addressing the relationship between remuneration and safety in the industry by ensuring, amongst other things, that road transport drivers do not have remuneration related incentives to work in an unsafe manner and removing remuneration -related incentives, pressures and practices that contribute to unsafe work practices.


I am disappointed that the coalition government has flagged its intention to eliminate this tribunal even before its first order comes into effect on May 1 of this year. It has commissioned an inquiry into the tribunal before it has had a chance to prove its worth as an additional tool to deliver road safety. It is particularly insulting to the families of hard-working truck drivers to describe this tribunal as 'red tape'. This is a tribunal that is aimed very fairly and squarely at saving lives.


The first four of the items listed in the amendment which I have moved add the Heavy vehicle Safety productivity program to definitions in the act in a manner consistent with the existing programs: Item (1) inserts the heavy vehicle safety productivity program into the act's definition of an eligible funding recipient. Item (2) inserts the program into the act's definition of approved purposes. Item (3) inserts a definition reference to the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program. Item (4) inserts a reference to the project approval instrument for the program. Item (6) inserts a new part 7 to the act that outlines the essential elements of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program in a manner that is consistent with other programs under the act. The provisions relating to approval of projects, provision of funding and conditions that apply to funding are the same as for other projects such as black spots.


I might leave my comments there and give the minister an opportunity to respond to these amendments. I must indicate that I contacted the minister last Friday morning and indicated very clearly that I was prepared to have discussions about the amendments we are moving to this bill today. I believe it is important that these amendments be considered on their merits. They clearly have merit. The same arguments that the minister has put with regard to areas such as the Roads to Recovery Program was of course included in the budget in 2013. We extended the program out through the forward estimates, but it does make a common-sense reform to include it in the act, which is the legislation that we have before us today. Just as that makes sense, it also makes sense to include the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, which is why we are moving this amendment today. 


I have two further points to make. The key clauses to note in the amendments are clause 86C, which prescribes eligible heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects as being projects that reduce accidents by reducing driver fatigue or projects that increase productivity by enhancing capacity on existing roadsâ€”those are the current project criteria for the minister to note; and clause 86R, which says that records relating to measuring the outcomes of the investment are required to be kept for five yearsâ€”which is, again, consistent with the way that, in general, the act applies. For the benefit of the House, amendment (7) is simply a consequential amendment, if you like, relating to renumbering. I commend the amendments to the House.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bayâ€”Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (16:01):  The government will not be supporting the amendments moved by the honourable member for Grayndler. Let me begin by assuring the House that the government has no intention whatsoever of getting rid of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program. We recognise that it is a program of value. The heavy vehicle industry pays a road user charge and they expect that money would be spent on projects of benefit to the road transport industry. We will continue to do that.


There is no need to include these amendments or the references that the shadow minister is talking about in the legislation. He did not do it when he was the minister. These clauses were not in the act. It is not as though we are removing them; he is asking that they be added. If it were necessary to have them in the act, he would have been in the position to do it when the Labor Party was in government,. The reality is that this program is covered by the existing provisions in the act. It is covered by the legislation that was in place under the previous government and it has not changed under this government.


We certainly are committed to delivering this particular program and we will deliver it with enthusiasm and genuine commitment. However, these amendments increase duplication and increase the administrative burden on funding recipients for no real value. The proposed part 7A for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Project duplicates existing provisions in the act. The heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects are currently approved under either part 3 or part 6 of the act, depending on whether they are on or off the National Land Transport Network. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is combining the existing part 3 and part 6 into a new part 3 to remove the duplication from the act. The proposed part 7A would undo this if the opposition's amendments were to be accepted. The proposed part 7A also increases the record-keeping burden on funding recipients by requiring them to maintain records for heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects for five years under the proposed clause 84R. Funding recipients are not required to keep these records under the existing part 3 and part 6 or the new part 3. So this kind of record keeping was not required when Labor was in government.


We are a government that believes in less regulation and less red tape. These amendments add substantial burden to those who are receiving these grants. For that reason, it does not really seem to me to make much sense. Labor had the capacity to put this kind of prescription in the legislation when they were in office, they did not choose to do so. To do it now adds administrative burden to those who receive the grants and duplicates existing sections in the act. For those reasons, we do not support the amendments.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (16:05):  I very strongly support the amendments to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 that are being proposed here. I take the point that the minister has made. We would argue that this program has been of such success that it is important to really give it an elevated status. It has already been said that the road user charges that are paid by the trucking industry are very considerable. We think that giving this particular aspect of the programâ€”which was part of the nation-building funding, more generallyâ€”an elevated status and enshrining it within the legislation would be an act of very considerable support to the industry. Many of these aspectsâ€”many of the projects that have been covered and many of the sub-programs that are part of that programâ€”are very much geared towards boosting the productivity of the industry and improving the safety, which in turn increases the productivity of the industry. I add my voice to the plea for the minister to retain the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. I take considerable pride in the fact that Western Australia was the first jurisdiction to introduce this legislation, because we were conscious not only of the potential impact on the lives and health of many of the truck drivers, who were reliant on heavy doses of pharmaceutical assistance to enable them to deal with the hours they were being required to drive, but also of the impacts that it would have had for the rest of the community, including impacts on their safety. It is simply unacceptable for us to continue refusing to do anything about the problem given that we know the nature of this problem so well. 


I am disappointed that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is not listening because I wanted to ask him if he had read the reports going right back to the Howard era, including the Burning the midnight oil report promoted by Senator Ron Boswell. The reports highlight that we need to get the whole supply chain engaged in this issue. The whole supply chain must take responsibility and an important part of that is safe sustainable rates. The Western Australian conservative government did not seek to overturn the legislation when they came into government, so I would seek a response from the minister as to why he will not give this legislation a chance to prove its efficacy.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (16:08):  I am very pleased to support the amendments proposed by the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 and I endorse the comments made by my colleague, the member for Perth, who has just spoken. I speak on this issue from two bases. Firstly, there is a strong awareness of the issues in my own electorate, given that the road connections to the port of Kemblaâ€”shared between my electorate and the electorate of the member for Throsbyâ€”are so heavily utilised by trucks servicing the port. Secondly, I am well aware that, if you live in a rural or regional community, the roads are critically importantâ€”they are a part of the lifeblood of Australia. I am sure the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is also aware that in regional and rural communities roads are essential for community members to be able to participate in life. Families use roads to take kids to school, people drive to visit others, and drivers, whether they are small carriers or driving for large trucking companies, earn their living by travelling on roads. As I say, roads are a critically important part of the lifeblood of rural and regional Australia and keeping people safe on these roads has to be one of the most significant things that we undertake when legislating in this space. 


The proposed amendment, to have the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program specifically identified under a separate funding stream in the act, is both reasonable and sensible. In March 2013, under the previous government's Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, joint funding of just over $8 million was providedâ€”approximately $4 million from Commonwealth and $4 million from the New South Wales state governmentâ€”to upgrade the existing truck stop on Mount Ousley Road. Mount Ousley Road is the key feeder road into and out of Port Kembla and it has, as you could well imagine, a lot of trucks travelling on it. I am very pleased that my state colleagues, in government, expanded the use of the port by the addition of the movement of cars, but that has, of course, resulted in a lot more usage of the road. The announcement of the $8 million investment in the truck stop upgrade along with the announcement of a $1.4 million trial of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems Initiative along the Hume Highway to Port Kembla, where again $700,000 was contributed by the state government, were very important for the wellbeing and safety of road users. These are some very good initiatives in the promotion of the wellbeing and safety of road users. 


I support this particular amendment from a background of having worked with the shadow minister when he was Minister for Transport and Infrastructure. I also acted as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Infrastructure under, as the shadow minister indicated in his earlier speech, Mr Paul Neville, the then chair and member for Hinkler. It was my very first experience of committee work and I have to say that he taught me very well about the good work a committee could do. The committee presented a report titled Thegreat freight task: is Australia's transport network up to the challenge?which indicated that a significant increase in the movement of freight around our nation would require serious infrastructure investment into the future. The report noted that we also needed to put the related regulations and protections in place. The committee travelled around the country to look at ports, roads and rail networks to determine what tasks needed to be undertaken. 


I was very pleased eventually, on our coming to government, to become the chair of the committee. Following a reference from the shadow minister, we had an inquiry into the need for a Safe Rates Remuneration Tribunal. We received, as the shadow minister indicated, very moving evidence not only from truck drivers and from the union representing them, the TWU, but also from families that had suffered grief and loss as a result of tragic road accidents involving heavy vehicles. The committee recommended to the minister that establishing the Safe Rates Remuneration Tribunal would be the most appropriate action to take, given of course that there was cross-portfolio coverage. The view of the infrastructure and transport committee was that it was the appropriate body to put in place and, as the shadow minister said, it should now be given the opportunity to prove its value and prove what it can contribute to all of us in the community. Finally, as the Minister for Road safety, I had the opportunity to see, firsthand, how important these sorts of initiatives are. I think the amendment is very reasonable. It is a sensible amendment and it embeds something that I think we should all be proud to support.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:14):  I rise to speak on the proposed amendments put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Grayndler, to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. I know he has been a passionate advocate of the development of transport and infrastructure. I am lucky to have served under two 'infrastructure' Prime Minister's, who earned their title by actually investing in infrastructure, not just claiming their support for it as part of a political process. In no small amount that was due to the efforts of the member for Grayndler.


Obviously, having an inner city seat, my electorate is very different to yours, Deputy Speaker Scott. An inner city seat is often where transport congestion is at its worst. That is why it is so important that the best possible analysis is done of the productivity benefits of the economic infrastructure that the government signs off on. I have seen that in my electorate at the Kessels and Mains roads intersection, a road that I can now drive through, which used to have traffic snarls for two, three or four changes of lights. Now, the east-west traffic can go straight through, under a grade separation. I am passionate about making sure that infrastructure in my electorate is completed and upgraded, but I know that it must go through Infrastructure Australia, the organisation that will make the best decisions about it.


The amendments put forward by the member for Grayndler make sure that, rather than having the possibility that the minister may be influenced by political decisions, the responsibility is in the hands of those who will make the evaluation based on the best cost-benefit for the nation. That is why these amendments should be supported by those opposite. 


I also wish to speak about the safe rates legislation. My electorate is a hub for business and transport. It has a big trucking industry, with the busiest truck-stop in Australia in terms of fuel sold. My electorate has the interstate rail line, it has coal trains coming from the west and it has the start of the train line which takes goods all the way up to Cairns. The freeway is one of my electorate's boundaries, and the Kessels and Mains intersection is the second-busiest intersection in Queensland. That is why I am proud to have had that intersection sorted out by the member for Grayndler through his commitment to infrastructure investment. As I said, he does not just claim the title; he actually puts dollars there. 


Back in 2003, under the Howard government, the percentage of GDP invested in infrastructure bottomed out at around one per cent. It is great to see that, under the fair dinkum infrastructure prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, we were able to increase that and achieve some great outcomesâ€”outcomes that are good for productivity. I think Prime Minister Howard was on the record as saying that he did not believe in investing in public transport in urban areas, not realising the great productivity stranglehold that that creates. I was at an event in my electorate with the then minister for transport, the member for Grayndler, where he was able to sign off on some signal changes that had been advocated 108 years before, at the time of Federation. It took Labor to actually get it together, to bang the heads together, and say, 'We need to do this in the nation's interest,' rather than just letting those individual transport ministers look after their fiefdoms. 


When politics comes into play, you do not get the best possible outcomes. I have seen that in my electorate. The transport minister in Queensland, the Hon. Scott Emerson, is the only state MP with an electorate that spans both sides of the Brisbane River. I wrote to him saying: 'I note that there are two rail crossing improvements being funded by the Queensland government, but both of them are on the north side of the river,' one at Robinson Road at Geebung and one at Telegraph Road at Bracken Ridge.' I said, 'How about fixing up the Coopers Plains rail crossing?' something that the former member for Moreton promised to improve back in March 1996. Minister Emerson wrote back and said: 'Go and talk to the federal transport minister and let him sort it out. It is not our problem.' It seems like the LNP in Brisbane will only look after infrastructure on the north side of the river, so I will be talking to the transport minister about that later.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:19):  I too rise in support of the amendments before the House. I am one of those MPs with a rural electorate. I know too well, not only from media reports but also from conversations that I have had in my community, how important road safety is. With thousands of country roads, streets, highways, intersections, rail crossingsâ€”and the list continuesâ€”I am sad to say that road safety continues to be one of those hot-button issues in my electorate.


I am relieved that this bill will continue the Roads to Recovery and Black Spots funding, programs that in recent years have seen over $10.5 million spent in my electorate to fund much-needed upgrades. In a meeting with the Macedon Ranges CEO, he said: 'The funding we have received from Roads to Recovery has fixed 10 years worth of roads that we would be able to fix on our normal rate base. Thank you.' 


Black Spots is directly targeted at identified roads where there have been more accidents than normal. Those are pretty dark words to be linked to a federal government program. Small councils have small rates bases, yet large regional areas and a number of roads. They struggle to maintain these roads, which is why it is so important that federal governments partner with local governments to tackle these issues. What is disappointing is that the government has not agreed to enshrine in the legislation the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. It is also disappointing that the government has not agreed to consult with Infrastructure Australia before approving projects, which would provide greater transparency around decision-making when it comes to large infrastructure projects. Under the former Labor government, funding did flow in my electorate in relation to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. In fact, last year alone just under $400,000 was delivered to central Victoria to improve a number of trouble spots. This funding not only improved the safety of those working in livestock saleyards, and upgraded other facilities; it also increased and improved productivity.


Any program that improves the safety of workers and roads can only be a good thing. That is why I believe it is important that this program also be enshrined in the bill and the legislation before us. These amendments will help protect rural truck drivers and their families. 


Heavy vehicle legislation is also being addressed through the new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was again established by the former Labor government and commenced operations in July 2012. The object of this act is to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industryâ€”again, going back to my initial point that road safety and improving the safety of workers on roads can only be a good thing. To describe the tribunal as red tape proves the government prefers ideology over trying to find ways to save lives on our roads. 


I think the second amendment is a vital one in ensuring Infrastructure Australia is consulted before the approval of any major projects to ensure that there is greater transparency around decision making. Many stakeholders are calling for this in my own area. In central Victoria, a debate rages about the East West tunnel and whether the $8 billion being spent on that tunnel is at the expense of safety in our country and regional areas. Instead of allocating these funds to our regional highways, arterial roads and local roads that are falling apart and riddled with dangerous cracks and potholes, this money has been allocated to what has been described as a dud tunnel. Not only will this tunnel not solve the congestion problem of Melbourne's east-west, it is also an expensive dud. The tunnel will lead traffic straight into a traffic jam. Very few people travel from east to west in the inner city. They travel from the east to the city or they travel from the west to the city; rarely do they go across the city, which is why it is an expensive dud. The spending of the $8 billion on the tunnel will not benefit motorists in my electorate. That money could be spent on fixing vital infrastructure and bottlenecks in regional Victoria.


It is a waste of money that nobody wants, and it is one that the federal government should not be committing toâ€”but they are. The Prime Minister said in The Age last September that he does not need to see the East West Link business case. The journalist went on to report that the government will hand over $1.5 billion to fund this tunnel without seeing the full business case. If there was one example that demonstrated that there is a need for greater transparency, it is this one. (Time expired)

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (16:24):  I rise in support of the amendments moved by the member for Grayndler and, in particular, to speak to some extent with respect to those designed to strengthen governance around project selection by elevating the role of Infrastructure Australia in advising on project benefits. The amendments make the logical link between Infrastructure Australia's role to provide advice on infrastructure and national priorities and the minister's role to decide how to allocate scarce Commonwealth funds. For the projects that are funded, the minister will be required to publish details of the project and include Infrastructure Australia's evaluation and cost-benefit outcome. The requirement to publish delivers transparency to the sector and the community at large around the merits of allocating taxpayer funds to projects.


Overall, the strengthened governance is precisely what all major stakeholders in the infrastructure sector have called for in the current Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure and in the recent Infrastructure Australia Senate inquiry, including the BCA, Infrastructure Partnerships and the Infrastructure Coordinator himself. But it is not only from those expert sources that we see a call for increased transparency and better governance. I have in my possession a copy of the coalition's policy from the last election to deliver the infrastructure for the 21st century. It has a photo on the front of a series of smiling faces, in which the minister is included. 



Mr Keenan interjectingâ€”




Mr GRIFFIN:
  You did not make it, Member for Stirling. Maybe next time. It makes a number of key points which relate to this very area and the whole point of the amendments the member for Grayndler has moved. I quote from it:


But we will do much more than just deliver infrastructure. We will ensure better infrastructure planning, more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects, and develop a much firmer and clearer infrastructure plan for Australiaâ€™s future.


I go on, as, no doubt, did the coalition:


The Coalition will strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia, to create a more transparent, accountable and effective adviser on infrastructure projects and policies.


And again, in a dot point:


Require all Commonwealth infrastructure expenditure exceeding $100 million to be subject to analysis by Infrastructure Australia to test cost-effectiveness and financial viability. 


And again:


Regularly publish cost-benefit analyses for all projects being considered for Commonwealth support or investment.


As you can see, the purpose and intent of this amendment is about codifying what the coalition was saying that they were supposed to be all about in their policy. So what we are trying to do here is assist the government in ensuring that they meet their election commitments; to create a situation where what they said they would do will actually be enshrined in legislation to ensure that is in fact what happens. 


Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, weâ€”probably me more than youâ€”are concerned that this government needs to be understood as to what it really intends to do and needs to be held to account. When it uses terms like transparency and accountability, we want to ensure that that is there for all to see and is not something that can be changed at the whims of a new minister down the track or altered just because they feel like it after the next Commission of Audit, or the next budget, or the next review or the next change of Prime Minister. What we want is a situation where these sorts of conditions are not only clearly understood, but also enshrined in legislation to ensure that those who follow will indeed act according to these high ideals. 


I would urge the government to reconsider their position. I would urge the minister to perhaps revisit the document that he had his picture on the front of, look to the points in that document that were stated quite clearly, and see and understand that the amendments that are being proposed here today will ensure that he keeps the very promise that he made in this documentâ€”not only now but in the future, as part of what will be a sensible regime for the future management of infrastructure projects within this country.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:28):  I join with the member for Bruce in urging the minister to reconsider support for these practical amendments. It is important to look at what these amendments will do. It is pretty simple. They will enshrine the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program to make sure that the program exists. It does not exist because, as the opposition, we cannot allocate funding and seek an appropriation. All we can do is put in place a framework in which funding is possible. 


Have a look at round 3 of the program. I want to outline just some of the projects and put on record to the House why this is important. Firstly, in New South Wales there is a Smart Rest Area Cooperative Intelligent Transport System trial on the Newell Highwayâ€”$1.06 million from the Commonwealth, matched by the state. This project is aimed at exploring the use of cooperative intelligent transport systems for drivers of heavy vehicles so that they can locate where the rest stops are as they are driving, looking at the potential integration of this technology. This is an important change and an example of an innovative use of this program, jointly with the New South Wales government. Similarly, there is the New South Wales Mount Ousley Road Rest Area project. People in Sydney or Wollongong who drive on those routes would know the circumstances around that particular area of Mount Ousley Road. This is a $4.045 million project from the Commonwealth, matched by the stateâ€”more than $8 million for a heavy vehicle rest stop on Mount Ousley Road, Mount Keira, northbound. It is aimed at increasing capacity from four to between 10 and 15 B-double bays. It will also significantly improve the amenity on the siteâ€”a big differenceâ€”ensuring that co-investment is there.


Again on the Newell Highway, there is the $1.65 million Gillenbah rest area upgradeâ€”again, a vital project. Just one project from the livestock area of the program that was added is Dubbo Regional Livestock Marketsâ€”a project that will upgrade the access roads, loading ramps and security safety lighting and improve line marking and signage. There will be $1.14 million from the Commonwealth, matched by $1.68 million from Dubbo Councilâ€”a good example of cooperation between the Commonwealth and Dubbo Council for projects that I am sure were on Dubbo Council's books for a long time but that they could not afford to do by themselves. Together this program has ensured that it will occur, creating jobs in that local regional community and improving both safety and outcomes.


In Victoria, there is the Hume Highway Truck Rest Area Vacancy Information System, aimed at developing and installing a rest area vacancy information system on the southbound carriageway of the Hume between Wodonga and Benalla. For this, more than $2 million came from the Commonwealth and more than $2 million from the state of Victoriaâ€”again, an innovative use of this program and one that will make a substantial difference.


A Queensland project is the Warrego Highway, at Cemetery Road east of Chinchillaâ€”supplementing existing project works, including paving and sealing of ingress and egress and providing greater amenity on that site. For this, $310,000 came from each area. And then there is sealing the hard surface of all access circuit roads and the truck-park area at the Blackall saleyards, with $1.2 million from the Commonwealth and $300,000 from the state. (Extension of time granted) In Western Australiaâ€”and this is a topic of some conversation at the moment in this chamberâ€”there is the expansion of the Wubin road train assembly area on the Great Northern Highway just 25 kilometres north of Perth, with $1.5 million from both the Commonwealth and the Western Australian government. Further afield, in between Port Hedland and Newman on the Great Northern Highway, with $950,000 from both the Commonwealth and the state government, is a project to construct two layover bays to permit oversized mass vehicles to leave the highway during daylight hours for rest. It is very important that these projects are able to be funded.


In South Australia, almost $2 million is being provided by both the Commonwealth and the South Australian government, leading to the planning, design and construction of seven new or upgraded rest areas on the Sturt, Stuart and Eyre highways. In Tasmania, examples of the use of the program for bridge upgrades are the Esk Main Road Bridge, with $1.25 million from each level of government, and the Railton Main Road Bridge, with $1.14 million from each level of government. And here in the ACT a program of almost $1 million, shared equally between the ACT government and the national government, proposes to strengthen the Barry Drive Bridge to allow larger vehicles to use it.


All up, if you look at just round 3, that is $45 million from the Commonwealth, matched by $36 million from the private sector and local government but also primarily from state governments that have made applications to this program. These are examples of why the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program should be continued. If the government is committed to its continuation, there is no reason that it should not be included in this act, as other programs are included under the act. The nation building program was of course where it was funded from, and the nation building act was legislation that was passed by this parliament prior to this particular program being included. I would ask the minister to tell us why he believes Roads to Recovery should be included in the act in a way that does not ensure the program, as of a particular period, in this case 30 June 2014, does not require further rollover, but will be permanently included in the act. I would ask why this program is any different. It would certainly be up to the government of the day to determine at what level the funding would be included for the program. It would also be up to the government of the day to determine specific aspects of the program, such as the former government did when we received the representations from the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association.


I am at a loss. If the government does not have an intention to remove future funding rounds of this program, either in this budget or some budget in the future, why does it not support this amendment being included in the act? I would ask that question to the minister opposite. (Extension of time granted) I asked the minister opposite a question, and this is the appropriate place to ask it.




Mr Truss:
  If you close the debate I will get up and respond.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The minister opposite says that if we close the debate he will get up and respond. That is not the way that Consideration In Detail works. Once no-one has the call, the debate concludes and the minister does not have to respond. I am certain you would be aware of that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Prime Minister should be aware of that, because otherwise he is not conducting this debate in the constructive way in which the opposition has approached it.


We have moved amendments in good faith. We have put forward the argument for why they should be included. I have asked the minister to outline what the differences are between this program and the Roads to Recovery program, and if he wants to leave my view on the record unchallenged. My view is that the only reason these amendments would not gain the support of the government is because they intend to get rid of these particular aspects of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, on the basis that they could be included in the commission of cuts, which they have refused to let the Australian people see.


It is up to the responsible minister to at least respond to the argument. If he disagrees, then he should put on the record why he disagrees with these very reasonable amendments. The only argument I have heard from the minister, which was in his first contribution, concerned the keeping of records. Well, they are the existing provisions. If the Commonwealth is going to argue for existing programs not to require a process of reconciliation and reporting back of records when money is handed over to state governments, then so be it. I do not call that red tape. I call that looking after taxpayers funds in an appropriate way, as recommended by numerous National Audit Office reports. There is no change recommended to the record keeping, from existing practice, of the amendments. In the drafting of the amendments the opposition had due regard to the existing program, and that is the basis for how we have moved these amendments before the House today.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bayâ€”Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (16:42):  I have not intervened during the debate. I have allowed members to speak way off the subject on matters not related to the amendments, even though that was contrary to the standing orders. I have allowed people to make their contributions. We have heard discussions about Safe Rates, which are not mentioned anywhere in this legislation, nor in the amendments. The debate on the committee stages is supposed to be about what is in the amendments. I have allowed that to go on.


I have allowed the member for Bruce to speak on the wrong amendments, I hope he is not going to pop up again and say the same thing when we get to the next set of amendments. In regard to the assurance the opposition shadow minister has sought that we will retain the Heavy Vehicle Safely and Productivity Program, I gave that assurance in my first response to the shadow minister. It was an absolute statement that it was my intention we would retain this program. We value it. I do not criticise the contributions of the many members opposite who outlined the merits of particular projects. I am sure they all had merit. Whether they were the ones I would have chosen in the same situation, I am not commenting on. What I am commenting on is the fact that this has been a good program. It is one that is supported by the heavy vehicle industry, and it is supported by the government.


It existed under the previous government without this legislation. Under the previous government there was no requirement to report and keep records for five years, so why is it suddenly necessary under the current government? The reality we need to recognise is that there is a bipartisan commitment to this program. It is our intention to keep it. It has not had specific legislation around it in the past, and neither does the Bridges Renewal Program that this government is proposing to introduce. Quite a number of the other areas which are funded under the land transport program do not have specific chapters about them and nor do they have specific legislation to underpin them, yet they continue to be funded. We intend to continue this funding and I think it is time we voted on the amendments.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (16:44):  We acknowledge that this was not included in the legislation previously, but, as the member for Grayndler explained, that was because this program was introduced after that legislation had already been in existence. Whilst it is absolutely true that we can continue to fund this program without it being enshrined specifically in the legislation, the point that we are seeking to make is that this program has now become one of such significance and such importance to the heavy vehicle industry that we believe it is timely that it be brought into the act in a more formal way.


This has become a much more significant program, a program on which $70 million was spent in the first two rounds and to which, in the subsequent rounds, $250 million was added to extend the program. In the overall scheme of things, we can see that this program has become an increasingly significant program that has very significant support from the heavy vehicle industry and, indeed, local and state governments because it has gone to the heart of improving productivity and safety.


Our case here is that this is now a significant and important program. If it is intended to be retained in its current form, the program is of a scale that warrants it being specifically included in the legislation. The auditing provisions that surround such a scheme and expenditure should be similar to those of existing programs.




Mr Truss:
  We are quite happy for that to happen, and it will happen. The auditing provisions are not being changed.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  But none of the auditing provisions that are included in the amendments are any different from the auditing provisions in theâ€”




Mr Truss:
  They are. What is there now is about keeping crash records for the Black Spot Program; it has nothing to do with this program.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  That is certainly not the advice that we are getting. No doubt the member for Grayndler will be able to clarify that point. I think the rationale is that this is now a very significant program. This is no longer simply an incidental program; it has been developed to a point where it now represents very significant expenditure. Given its importance and what it has been able to deliver, we would like to see this particular program entrenched. We believe that there is a very strong argument for entrenching it in the legislation to ensure that it receives continuous funding at whatever level. The government may, from time to time, determine to fund it, but we do not believe it is a program that should be accorded a lesser status. As we are amending the legislation now, this seems to be an ideal time to update the legislation to include this program, which has now been in operation for a number of years.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (16:49):  I want to support the comments of my colleague, the member for Perth, and take up the issues raised by the minister. We, in good faith, provided the amendments to the government in advance of moving them so that they could have the opportunity to receive advice from the department, and we know they need that advice. We have attempted to do something very simpleâ€”that is, create provisions in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 which are very similar to the provisions which exist and are being included in the Roads to Recovery program.


The question that the minister has not addressed adequately is: why is it good enough for the Roads to Recovery program but not the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program? I agree that it is an excellent program with bipartisan support that enabled it to be extended in the 2013 budget across the forward estimates to make sure that local government would have certainty in the future. The benefit of the Roads to Recovery program is that it is untied so that local governmentâ€”the elected local officials in a communityâ€”can determine the priorities according to local feedback. They are in the best position to do so, as opposed to the bureaucracy in Canberra.


With the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, we did not have people sitting in the offices in Civic saying, 'I think a heavy vehicle rest area on the Newell Highway is best positioned at place X.' What we did was consult with the sector and the industry itself and ask for that process to occur. We went to state government and local government. We did so in a way which, I believe, produced an extraordinarily successful range of projectsâ€”rest areas, parking decoupling bay projects, technology trial projects, road enhancement projects, demonstration projects and livestock transport industry projects. We did this in a way which, because we requested some matching funding from the state government, the local government or the private sector, ensured that there was real economic stimulus in those local communities. If you look at where the projects took place and what electorates it took place in, over 90 per cent of the funding presided over by me as minister for infrastructure under this program went to coalition-held seats across the program.



Mr Truss interjectingâ€”




Mr ALBANESE:
  Those opposite are still having their obsession with the former member for New Englandâ€”he was someone who would stand up for his seat and someone who has my ongoing respect. Here we are today moving a program of which 90 per cent went into coalition seats because funding was determined on its merit. When we have road safety issues, it is merit that matters, which is why for the Pacific Highway, the member for Cowper who was here before, we have either completed or fundedâ€”the former governmentâ€”the entire duplication of the Pacific Highway throughout his electorate. That is the whole lot, including of course the Kempsey Bypass, which is the longest road bridge in Australia.


That is the commitment that I brought to the program of making sure that we made a difference to the national interest, not just to political interest. The next amendment is a real test for the government over whether they will continue that role, but I commend these amendments to the House.

(2) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of a project mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) must:


Â Â Â (a) contain a cost benefit analysis of the project; and


Â Â Â (b) specify the priority that Infrastructure Australia would give the project in relation to priorities specified in its current Infrastructure Plan; and


Â Â Â (c) set out any other matter that Infrastructure Australia considers relevant to the project.




4C


Cost benefit analyses to be made public



Â Â Â Â Â Â If Commonwealth funding is provided for a Black Spot Project, Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Project, Investment Project or Transport Development and Innovation Project, the Minister must ensure that the following information about the project is made available on the Department's website:


Â Â Â (a) a description of the project;


Â Â Â (b) when the project is to start and is likely to be completed;


Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Infrastructure Australia's views on the project, including any evaluation provided to the Minister under section 4B.


This amendment requires the minister to require an evaluation by Infrastructure Australia prior to approving funds for land transport projects valued at over $100 million. Such an evaluation needs to include a cost benefit analysis, Infrastructure Australia's view on project priority and any other views that Infrastructure Australia considers relevant. If the project is funded by the government, the evaluation must be published on the department's website. For other projects under $100 million, the minister must have regard to Infrastructure Australia's advice and views on priorities. This is an amendment that absolutely should be supported by this parliament. 


We on this side of the chamber are very proud that we created Infrastructure Australia in 2008. We did so to break the nexus between the political cycle, which by definition is very short term, and the infrastructure investment cycle, which requires a longer term perspective. It is also consistent with the amendments that we will move to the Infrastructure Australia Bill, which was gagged in this House but is before the Senate. Submissions to that inquiryâ€”from organisations like Business Council of Australia, the Urban Development Institute of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, and many other submissions, including, it must be said, the evidence given by the Infrastructure Coordinatorâ€”indicated how important it was that the government's attempt to gag Infrastructure Australia from providing a transparent process when it comes to infrastructure investment occursâ€”



Mr Briggs interjectingâ€”




Mr ALBANESE:
  The errand boy opposite said,  'Wrong bell'. What he needs to understandâ€”and if he were listening, he would understandâ€”is that the amendments we have moved here, which I believe will certainly be supported in the Senate, if not in this chamber, are consistent with the amendments that will be moved to the Infrastructure Australia Bill. 


What is more, they are consistent with coalition policy. The coalition went to the election saying that all projects of $100 million or more should be assessed by Infrastructure Australia before they are funded. So we are putting it into the legislation. If only for that reason, the opposition is moving this amendment with the expectation that the government will support it, because it is absolutely consistent with their policy. 


This amendment provides for the further entrenchment of Infrastructure Australia. It bolts together Infrastructure Australia's role as an independent adviser to government and major government infrastructure programs. If you are going to put before the House this Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill, which purports to take infrastructure development forward, without putting in the legislation a role for Infrastructure Australia, then it clearly is inadequate; it clearly is inconsistent with the rhetoric of those we see opposite. This amendment should be supported by this entire House. 


The minister, if this amendment is carried, will remain able to make funding decisions as he or she sees fit. We regard that as the role of government. But there will be transparency around cost-benefit of funded projects and how funded projects stack up against national priorities. In government of course Labor provided funding for all 15 of the projects which Infrastructure Australia determined were ready to proceed on their priority list. This strengthened governance and transparency is precisely what all major stakeholders in the infrastructure sector have called for in not just the legislative inquiry but also in the Productivity Commission inquiry into public infrastructure.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bayâ€”Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (17:11):  The coalition will not be supporting this amendment. The proposed section 4B requires the minister to have regard to infrastructure priority lists, infrastructure plans and any project-specific advice from Infrastructure Australia before approving 'a black spot project, heavy vehicle safety and productivity project, investment project or transport development and innovation project'. If capital expenditure on a project is $100 million or more, Infrastructure Australia is required to give the minister an evaluation of the project, including a cost-benefit analysis.


So the proposed section 4B would duplicate the $100 million requirement provided for under the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. So my advice to the opposition is: if you want that $100 million requirement, as we do, then simply vote for our Infrastructure Australia amendments. Just vote for the bill. That will deliver the $100 million obligation. In fact, you actually have to vote for our infrastructure bill to make this amendment work, because it requires the minister to have regard for an infrastructure plan in making assessments about these particular projects. There are no infrastructure plans now. They are created under our amendments to the IA Act.  So, in reality the shadow minister must vote for our amendments to the Infrastructure Australia Act to even be able to deliver on the amendments he is talking about now.


We have made it clear that we are determined to make Infrastructure Australia more open and transparent than it is today. Instead of having an Infrastructure Coordinator who answers to the minister and takes direction from the minister, we want to have a new CEO who will be answerable to the board. Currently the board is simply an advisory committee. 


We think it makes a lot of sense; if you believe in having an independent IA, the CEO should be answerable to the board not to the minister. The board should take the action that it needs to take to ensure that things are done in an independent, open and transparent way. We will deliver an Infrastructure Australia that will be genuinely independent in a way that it is not now. I would encourage members opposite not to just defend past history or past legacy but to look to what we need for the future, in other words, an Infrastructure Australia that is able to act independently and give independent advice to the government.


I would also make another important point in relation to these amendments. Black Spot, Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity and Transport Development and Innovation projects are all small value and small-scale projects and they are unlikely to be considered by Infrastructure Australia in developing infrastructure priority lists and infrastructure plans. Infrastructure Australia was created to consider nationally significant projects, not Black Spot projects, which have a maximum funding amount of $2 million. Even though we are resourcing Infrastructure Australia better than has been the caseâ€”




Mr Albanese:
  No, you're not.




Mr TRUSS:
  Well, we are maintaining the fundingâ€”and, in that regard, it will have more resources to do its job. But there is no way in the world it is going to be able to consider every project of $2 million and give a detailed cost-benefit analysis as would be required under this amendment. The reality is that the matters of substance in the proposed amendment are best addressed by passing the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill. The Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill will deliver on an independent analysis of important projects. It will deal with the $100 million threshold requirement that is proposed in this amendment. I think that the best way to ensure that these matters can be dealt with quickly and constructively is for the opposition in the Senate to agree to pass the bill, and then we will have the kind of scrutiny that is required.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:16):  We have just seen an example of why infrastructure policy development under this government is so erratic. The Deputy Prime Minister said in one sentence: 'We are resourcing Infrastructure Australia more; we are maintaining funding; that will mean it has more money.' That is the sort of logic that we see from those opposite. They come up with rhetoric about Infrastructure Australia while they are trashing its independence. It is not just that I say that; the Business Council of Australia say that in their submission, where they recommend changes to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill.


The minister does not understand. He is walking out of this important debate and refusing to participate, giving the job to his errand boy, the member for Mayo. It is up to the senior minister to actually participate in this debate. He said that there was no infrastructure plan and somehow that was an initiative of the new government. The fact is this: if he had been paying any attention at allâ€”if he had woken up for just a few minutes in his time in oppositionâ€”he would know that Infrastructure Australia produced annual reports that had plans going forward into the future and have a website with a pipeline of projects. Now, while he is in his office, the minister should ring Lyn O'Connell, the deputy secretary of the infrastructure department, and ask about the website with the pipeline of all projects of $50 million or more that are in the planning stage, that are under construction or that are completed into the future.


That is the sort of pipeline that was asked for by the business community. That is the sort of pipeline that has seen competition come into the infrastructure sector and has lowered costs. That is the sort of pipeline that has seen companies like Ghella, from Italy, come in and participate in the Legacy Way projectâ€”which came in under budget by hundreds of millions of dollars. It is the sort of pipeline that saw Bouygues, a French construction company, along with Lend Lease, successfully get the tender for the M1 to M2 project. That is the project that they had a press conference about last week and pretended it was new even though it was funded in the 2013 budget and the intergovernmental agreement was signed on 21 June 2013.


The fact is that these infrastructure plans are produced by Infrastructure Australia right now. The provisions in this amendment which would allow for cost-benefit analysis for all projects above $100 million would also allow for due consideration to be given if Infrastructure Australia have advice on lesser projectsâ€”and from time to time they do. For example, Infrastructure Australia gave advice about a very small project in Chullora. It was about a particular bottleneck for the freight industry, which had a BCR through the roof, and which, for a matter of millions of dollarsâ€”not hundreds of millions of dollarsâ€”would produce an outstanding return to national productivity. Infrastructure Australia gave that advice and we as a government took that advice.


That is why these provisions are there. These provisions are sensible provisions with regard to Infrastructure Australia. They should be supported by those opposite. Those opposite said that they would ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer funded projects. 'We will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis,' they said. That is what they needed to do on the East West Link in Victoria. That is what they need to do on projects that they intend to fund. They need to do what they said they would do, so that they get the best productivity outcome.


Today in The Daily Telegraph we hear about a cabinet subcommittee, as if that is somehow a substitute for proper policymaking and proper advice from Infrastructure Australia. Everywhere you look, the government are undermining the independence of Infrastructure Australia. That is why we have moved this amendment that is before the House.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayoâ€”Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (17:21):  A couple of points need to be addressed to reinforce what the Deputy Prime Minister so eloquently put in his contribution moments ago. We are far from attacking the independence of Infrastructure Australiaâ€”in fact, we are enshrining it in law, and if the member opposite would instruct his colleagues in the Senate to pass it we would get it going straight away.


As to projects such as the East West Link, we absolutely will go through, with the Victorian government, a cost-benefit analysisâ€”absolutely.




Mr Albanese:
  When?




Mr BRIGGS:
  Wellâ€”if you would hear me out, Member for Grayndlerâ€”at the moment, the Victorian government, like the New South Wales government and the Queensland government, refuses to cooperate with Infrastructure Australia. The trust has been completely broached byâ€”



Mr Albanese interjectingâ€”




Mr BRIGGS:
  This is the thing we hear from the member for Grayndler. I do not know how many minutes, now, of the House's time we have spent listening to the complete lack of understanding from the member for Grayndler that, on 7 September last year, the Australian people voted for a different direction. In saying that, they said: 'We support the proposalâ€”




Mr Albanese:
  We are entitled to hold you to account.




Mr BRIGGS:
  You are entitled to hold us to account, but you are not entitled to rewrite history. If the infrastructure system is in such terrific nick right now, why is it that the PC's report says that we are wasting at least a billion dollars a year that we need or ought not to? A billion dollars a year! A billion dollars a year of taxpayers' money is being wasted because of the system we inherited from the member for Grayndler.


So the system we inherited is not in perfect condition and we are setting about fixing it. This bill, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, has nothing to do with the gripes the member for Grayndler is trying to raise; they are all in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013, which he should pass in the Senate to help us start to fix the problems he left us that we now have to try and fix. But he is buddying up with his mate there, the Greens' member for Melbourne, to try and stop any progress on making sure that we get the best value for taxpayers' money, that we get transparency in the system, and that we stop wasting taxpayers' money.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-03-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:24):  I am pleased to hear the assistant minister saying that he wants to increase transparency, because, despite everything the assistant minister just said, it is my recollection thatâ€”and I stand to be corrected on thisâ€”the Prime Minister actually said he had seen the business case for the East West Link. If that is the case, the government sure ought to be in a position to table it now, and not come into this chamber and give some answer that apparently Infrastructure Australia is not being cooperative; that is simply not the case.


I spent a long time in this chamber in the last parliament listening to the member for Wentworth, then the shadow minister for communications, now the Minister for Communications, and he prosecuted a case very vigorously against the NBN and against spending on the NBN. I and the Greens are supporters of the NBN, and it was clear that the then opposition, now the government, was going to do everything they possibly could to wreck the NBN, and they ran a number of arguments, about where fibre should go to et cetera.


One of the arguments, though, that did strike a chord with meâ€”and, perhaps, had they not been so clearly out to wreck the whole thing, might have got some supportâ€”was that they came in here, time after time, and said, 'We should not proceed with the NBN and with spending significant amounts of money on it because we have not done a cost-benefit analysis.' In fact, from memory, it was not just that they said that rhetoricallyâ€”and, again, I would stand to be corrected, but I think that the opposition, now the government, came in here and moved amendments to legislation saying that certain bills should not pass until a cost-benefit analysis has been done on the NBN. The arguments were, simply put, that if you are going to spend money on significant pieces of infrastructure, there ought to be a cost-benefit analysis and it ought to be publicly released.


Prior to the election, I held out some faint hope, which has clearly been misplaced, that that commitment to cost-benefit analysis, when you are spending on infrastructure, might carry through once the government was elected. But what we saw during the campaign period was that, despite the fact that there is no business case that stacks up for the East West Link, the now Prime Minister was quite prepared to come out and say, 'I will rip $1Â½ billion out of the aid budget to put it into the East West Link.' What we then find is that, despite repeated requests to table the business case, the government fights that tooth and nail. Then, when we take the matter to Senate estimates, we find that the only business case or summary of a business case that has been provided to Infrastructure Australia for the East West Link says that, if you apply the same methodology that most other people do, for every dollar the Australian taxpayer tips into the East West Link, you are only going to get 80c back. It is a loss maker, according to the evidence given by the head of Infrastructure Australia, unless you fudge the figures and include all sorts of other additional benefitsâ€”benefits that are nebulous, because the government will not tell us what they are but just says, 'Trust us.' When it comes to the NBN, apparently you need a cost-benefit analysis. But, when it comes to tipping a couple of billion dollars into a road project that every analysis that has been made publicly available tells you does not stack up, apparently it is a set of different rules.


If the assistant minister genuinely believes what he just told the Houseâ€”that this government is committed to increasing transparency when it comes to spending billions on infrastructureâ€”then he should table the business case for the East West Link. Infrastructure Australia clearly wants to say more about it and is being held back. So table it. Let us have some faith that you actually believe what you say about the commitment to increase transparency, because I would have to say that that has not been a hallmark of this government in other respects. 


In the absence of the minister being prepared to do that, that is why it is important that this amendment is passed, because it is clear that the government will rip billions from aid projects to spend on infrastructure projects, without a cost-benefit analysis. So I ask the minister at the table in this debate: is he prepared to table the cost-benefit analysis for the East West Link?

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:29):  The comments that the minister has made are simply incorrect. It could well be that he is not aware of the functioning of Infrastructure Australia and the role that it plays. But the fact is that Infrastructure Australia has been able to examine projects of significant value across the nation and has produced regular reports and regular accountability to the Australian public through that transparent process. What the minister has not stated is that the legislation which is before the Senate that is linked to the amendments that we are moving and considering now to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 in fact diminish the independence of Infrastructure Australia, and they do so in a number of ways. Firstly, they remove the ability of Infrastructure Australia to publish information. That becomes a decision made by the minister. Secondly, and most remarkably, they allow for certain classes of infrastructure to not be examined if that is directed by the minister. 


Quite clearly, this is a government that have said it will not fund public transport projects. They have said that they will, as they put it, 'stick to their knitting' and just fund road projects. The problem with that is that it undermines the whole basis of Infrastructure Australia, that you need to look at integrated transport strategies and the way that the cities fit together and the way that transport infrastructure fits with community based infrastructure and with employment. That is why the opposition was so disturbed that on the first day that those opposite were sworn in as ministers they abolished the Major Cities Unit. We are one of the most urbanised countries on the planet and the priority of those opposite was to sack the Major Cities Unit upon their coming to office and then to declare that they would not fund any urban public transport projects. In order to defend that, they say, 'Oh well, we won't fund any urban public transport projects but that will mean state governments will be able to because we will be funding road projects.' 


The difficulty is that all of the announcements that they have made are re-announcements. According to those opposite, it is like that declaration post French Revolution of 1792 which was declared to the year one. They think year one was September last year, that everything that went beforehand does not count. We have seen numerous examples of that by those opposite. Just today we saw the latest example of that whereby those opposite, including the minister at the table, put out this press release, 'Funds flow to reduce Kwinana Freeway congestion'â€”a good announcement, but the only problem is that it was announced on 5 August 2013 between me and the WA minister, 'Extra funding for Kwinana Freeway and Great Eastern Highway'. You can tell that the department had something to do with both of the releases because, remarkably, they are very similar in terms of the rhetoric. Todayâ€”




Mr Nikolic:
  Except one is funded.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The nong opposite has no idea. If that is the case, nothing has changed, and breaking news for those opposite: the government have not yet had a budget. So they announced today projects thatâ€”




Mr Nikolic:
  All those big, extravagant promises were never funded.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask you to call this bloke to order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order! The member for Grayndler has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  This announcement by Jamie Briggs as the assistant minister was an absolute crackerâ€”joint funding of $31 million to fund the $62 million widening. (Extension of time granted) It was funded through savings in existing projects between the Australian government and the Western Australian government. It was agreed by me and the then WA Treasurer, Troy Buswell. In terms of the funding, $31 million from both levels of governmentâ€”a $62 million project, very significant indeed. 


They announced it today but it is underway. We see it continually from those oppositeâ€”that they announce projects and pretend that they are somehow new. We have seen in question time over last week and a bit those opposite talking about the Gateway WA project. If you had just arrived, like the member for Bass, who has just arrived here, you might not quite know where Gateway WA is as a project. And there is no criticism there; there is no reason he would be an expert. There are lots of oncers who come and go in this place and they make a contribution while they are here. In terms of the Gateway WA project, you would think that this had been launched last week. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday visited the construction site that is in its second year. But, at the same time as the minister has pretended that this is new, on 13 November 2013 he announced, 'New Ramp at Abernethy Road Now Open'. In a joint release with various backbench members from the coalition, Minister Truss said:


The first section of the $1 billion Gateway WA projectâ€”the Abernethy Road and Tonkin Highway interchangeâ€”is now complete with the new $15.4 million on-ramp now open for traffic


He went on about how vital it was, that 6,000 vehicles a day would use it. He said:


The ramp reduces travel time by about seven minutes, and saves 3.7 kilometres over existing routes. It is great news for the 22,000 vehicles travelling this section of Abernethy Road.


Indeed, it is. But I have news for those opposite and it is news that people in Perth in Western Australia know, that the new government that was sworn in sometime in September did not get this project funded, built and opened by the beginning of November because construction began more than a year ago on these projects. Indeed, at the end of the release from the minister, he said:


The Australian government has committed $686.4 millionâ€”


to the Gateway WA project. And indeed we did! But those opposite pretend that somehow that funding was not real. We heard it again today in question time, when the minister attempted to say that this funding was not there. But he visited the construction project yesterday, and I have news for those opposite who might be new to understanding how a project works. You have to have all of the funding allocated, be it from federal, state or local government or the private sector, in order to sign the contract, in this case with the Gateway WA alliance, to proceedâ€”for the project to start. That is how it works.




Mr Nikolic:
  What about the mining tax funding?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order!




Mr ALBANESE:
  You have from those opposite complete ignorance. I was at an event yesterday where a senior infrastructure playerâ€”not a supporter of mine politically, it must be saidâ€”said, 'Has anyone explained to the new government how an infrastructure project gets funding; how it works?' It is so embarrassing for them to say that projects which are underway somehow do not have funding, because that is the basis of a contract. If it is not there, then the fact is the project cannot proceed. Everyone in the private sector knows that.




Mr Nikolic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek an intervention.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Throw him out. He should be thrown out.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The intervention is not agreed to.




Mr ALBANESE:

(Extension of time granted) The fact is that, every time those opposite make the sorts of statements that they have made about Gateway WA and about a host of other projects, they show how embarrassing their lack of knowledge of infrastructure projects is. And they have done it right around the country. The minister opposite went and visited part of the upgradeâ€”Gateway Upgrade Northâ€”and, yet, those opposite would pretend that that funding was not there and that, somehow, it had not happened.


They are happy to go to the openings. Last Friday, of course, many of the federal members who will benefit from the Hunter Expressway did not get an invitation. Those opposite could not squeeze Labor members in. There were more Tories in the Hunter Valley last Friday than you have seen in the Hunter region in history. It was quite remarkable. They were all there for the opening of a project that was promised, funded and built by the federal Labor government as part of the economic stimulus planâ€”and they had voted against that. They voted against the economic stimulus plan that contained $1.45 billion of the $1.7 billion for the project.


The reason why we believe that you need proper cost-benefit analysis for the land transport program comes back to a proper analysis of benefit. That might be road or it might be rail. Take Melbourne, for example: the M80 projectâ€”a very good projectâ€”received $788 million from the federal government and is making a big difference to productivity. Also making a significant difference is the largest ever Commonwealth investment in a single public transport project in Australia's historyâ€”the $3.225 billion regional rail link. One of the reasons why you have a high BCR for the project is the uplift factor along the route of the train line. If you go to the new stations that have been built, what you see is significant residential development and commercial development specifically around the new stations. You also see significant benefit because of what it does by separating freight and passenger rail going into Melbourne. It is of significant benefit for Melbourne but also for Geelong, for Ballarat and for Bendigo. The current Prime Minister did not seem to know that that even existed when made his 3AW declaration that the Commonwealth government which he would lead would not fund any urban public transport project because that was not what Commonwealth governments do.


The fact is that Commonwealth governments were doing that and they were doing it to significant value, whether it be the Perth City Link project opened and funded, of course, in partnership with the state government, making a huge difference to urban amenity around Perth; the Noarlunga to Seaford rail extension in Adelaide; the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project on the Gold Coast; or, of course, the Moreton Bay rail link, which is now under construction. That rail link was first promised in 1895, but it took a federal Labor government to make sure that that proceeded to construction. All of these projects are examples of assessments being made and then funding being delivered. It is important that, in the area of infrastructure, Infrastructure Australia gets a say. What we are proposing with this amendment is nothing more and nothing less than the existing coalition policy. It is what they said they would doâ€”that there would be cost-benefit analysis for projects of value above $100 million. I commend the amendment to the House.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayoâ€”Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (17:44):  Half of this may be cleared up if we say out loud to the member for Grayndler that he did not do all bad things when he was in government. Some things that he did were good things. Now that we have cleared that up, we can say that with certain projects the member for Grayndler, as a federal minister, allocated taxpayers' money which has achieved good outcomes. I am very happy to put that on the record. If that makes the member for Grayndler a little bit happier, I am glad that may help clear up this debate, finally getting us to an actual vote and moving the legislation through. The debate we are having at the moment has nothing to do with the proposed amendment. It is about getting on the record what the member for Grayndler thinks was his record. We will happily say some of the things the member for Grayndler did were good things and some of the things he announced with taxpayers' money prior to the election on 7 September continue today. Of course they do. But it was not the member for Grayndler's money. It was not the Labor Party's money. It was taxpayers' money, and the new government, which was rightfully voted in on 7 September, has an obligation to tell taxpayers what is happening with its money. That is why we have put in place more transparency.



Mr Albanese interjectingâ€”




Mr BRIGGS:
  We are not announcing that these things are new. The member for Grayndler is struggling to get past what happened. I accept that. But we will say that some things he did were good. We refer to the Productivity Commission and say some of the system we inherited was bad. So there we go: a little from column A, a little from column B.


To one of the points the member for Melbourne raisedâ€”and I will not say I agree with him on thisâ€”about the NBN: if you look at the draft Productivity Commission report, he is right to point to the NBN, because it is the pin-up boy example of how not to do infrastructure. You cannot blame the member for Grayndler for that, because he inherited it at the end of his reign as a minister but was not responsible for its process in the first place.




Mr Albanese:
  A golden era!




Mr BRIGGS:
  The golden era as comms minister! Compared to the predecessor, probably.


It is the draft Productivity Commission report's view that the NBN is the example of how not to do infrastructure in Australia, so the member for Melbourne is right to point to that project.


Proposed opposition amendment 4(b) refers to infrastructure plans developed under the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008. IA are not required to develop plans under the act. The coalition's amendment to the IA Act will require IA to produce those plans. The government's amendment to the IA Act will require IA to develop specific plans of nationally significant infrastructure projects over a 15-year periodâ€”working with the states in a collaborative manner is, as I said, not happening at the momentâ€”rather than having IA agree simply to election commitments. Under the current legislation IA do not have to publish anything. So our point that you have to pass the Infrastructure Australia Act is absolutely valid.


This amendment we do not agree with. We have had a reasonable debate on it, and I think it is time for us to move to a vote.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:47):  We had some interesting statements made today by the minister in the chamber. These were statements he made in an interview this morning. He said that government is going to make decisions based on evidence in the infrastructure area, but quite clearly what we are going to do is limit the amount of evidence that is available on which to make a decision. Firstlyâ€”and the minister has contested thisâ€”we argue that the amendments that have been made to Infrastructure Australia do in fact reduce the autonomy and transparency of the work that is done by Infrastructure Australia. It will give much more control to the government over the release of the reports that are done by Infrastructure Australia, so the evidence that is there is not going to be available for us to judge what the government is doing. Secondly, of course, it enables the minister to direct or exclude certain classes of infrastructure from being examined.


We are going to make decisions on the basis of the evidence, but we are actually going to control what the evidence is. We will then say, 'Now we've got the evidence supporting our decisions, but that's precisely because we have prevented Infrastructure Australia looking at the entire picture.' As we know, they will be precluded from making assessments on very important urban rail projects. So we will have this situation where Infrastructure Australia are going to be examining road funding and doing cost-benefit analyses on those road projects but will be legislatively proscribed from taking into account what might in fact be a far more efficient and effective way of dealing with those urban mobility problems. It is all very well to say we are going to make our decisions based on the evidence; when you are doctoring, limiting and controlling that evidence, that then becomes a pretty hollow statement.


I am very interested in the cabinet subcommittee that has been set up today. I wonder to what extent this is an attempt to bring this back into the fold of the Liberal Party? Having the National Party in charge of the infrastructure portfolio may indeed cause problems. I would be interested to know from the assisting minister: if the Prime Minister is unable to chair the meetings, whose job would it be? Would it be your job? Would you be delegated to chair those meetings?




Mr Briggs:
  It certainly won't be you.




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  It certainly will not be me, because I am not part of the government.




Mr Briggs:
  And you won't be.




Ms MacTiernan:
  Oh, I won't be. So you are going to predict what the Australian people are going to do in the fullness of time. You argued very eloquently a few minutes ago. You put it very passionately that we should accept the fact that the people in all their wisdom have made the decision to have you in government, but apparently you are born to rule!

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:52):  I rise, based on Minister Briggs' previous interventions, to ask a question during this debate. No doubt the minister is now the one responsible for getting this legislation through and wants to get it through both houses. I think everyone understands what the numbers are in the Senate. I ask the minister this question to assist us and my party on formulating our position on this. The minister just said that there is an 'obligation to tell taxpayers what is happening with their money'. I think I have that quote right. My questionâ€”to assist us in formulating how we might vote on this amendment or other amendments or deal with it when it comes to the Senateâ€”is: will the minister commit to tabling the cost-benefit analysis for the East West Link project before the contracts are signed?

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayoâ€”Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (17:53):  I refer back to the contribution I made earlier in respect of the East West Link project. A couple of things that I do want to correct now, having been given the opportunity, are: firstly, with respect to the claim that Labor MPs were not invited to the Hunter Expressway opening, I am very well advised that the member for Hunter was there and was invited, and so was Mr Clayton Barr from the New South Wales opposition. They were invited by the relevant members, which is, I think, exactly the same procedure that the former minister would have followed. Secondly, to correct the contributions made by the member for Perthâ€”just so she understandsâ€”Infrastructure Australia do not actually do the cost-benefit analysis; we rely on the states to do it. That is how it worked under the former minister and that is how I intend to operate. We are not going to have an agency which is second-guessing; of course it is the states which build, own and operate the roads. With respect to the claims which continue to be made not so clearly by the minister but by the member for Perth, who clearly said that we are precluding consideration of Infrastructure Australia on public transport projects, that is just simply not true. There are two different things here. We fully expect, as we have said numerous times, that Infrastructure Australia will include consideration of public transport projects because the states will say that they are important and are a part of their plansâ€”the states do the planning. If public transport projects are an important part of the states' planning, which you would expect in major cities, they would be part of the 15-year infrastructure plan. But we have said we believe the best place for the federal government's contribution, in respect of infrastructure, is lifting productive capacity in our economy. In that sense we are focused on contributing to roads and to freight rail. That was a clear commitment at the election.


The member for Grayndler is right to disagree; he is entitled to disagree and he will put his perspective at the next election, just as he put it at the last election. We are very clear on one thingâ€”we will do as we say and act in accordance with the commitments we made to the Australian people prior to the election. The opposition is entitled to make the claim that they would fund public transport projects, but they should not continue to create a furphy, which is that we will preclude Infrastructure Australia from considering public transport projects; we will not. It is of course part of a 15-year plan that we expect. We want transparency; we want Infrastructure Australia to build that plan so that we have the infrastructure of the 21st century delivering a stronger economy. These of course are interesting matters but they are matters which relate to another bill. We should get back to the amendment moved by the member for Grayndler so we can move on with the business of the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:56):  I want to take issue with a number of the comments from Assistant Minister Briggs who has identified correctly that there is a link between the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 and Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. What there is notâ€”where he was incorrect, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt and just say he did not knowâ€”is the provision in this bill, which is before the Senate, to allow for a mandated examination by Infrastructure Australia of projects of value above $100 million. It is not in the legislation. I will tell you what is in the legislationâ€”and is being opposed by the Business Council of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and others; it is the ability to direct Infrastructure Australia to exclude certain classes of infrastructure. That is in the bill which is before the other place. 


In terms of productive capacity and the minister's response, he stated that he was concerned with an increase in productivity and the government is right to do so. The disagreement between the government and opposition is essentially that you cannot do that if you exclude some classes of infrastructure if you say that you will not fund some classes. I will give just a couple of examples: one is the direct relation between public transport and the road network. By investing in public transport, in the Geelong-Ballarat-Bendigo region in terms of the regional rail link project, it takes pressure off the road network between those regional cities and the city of Melbourne. I am certainly not opposed to road funding. We doubled the roads budget when we were in government and funded projects like the Geelong ring-road and other projects there including the Princes Highway in the Geelong region, as well as the Sydney Road improvements in Bendigo and improvements in Ballarat. But there is a relation between the two and there is also a relation between passenger and freight transport. For example, the project Southern Sydney Freight Lineâ€”opened by me as the minister some time ago, although, I am sure, in spite of that, at some stage the current government will claim credit for itâ€”and the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor program, which will create a particular grade separation at Strathfield, the centre of the Sydney rail network, will improve the passenger round network by separating it.


Before we funded the upgrade the Southern Sydney Freight Line had a period of curfew at Port Botany. Because the passenger line, quite rightly, got priority, freight could not be moved during peak hours in the morning and the afternoon. Closer to the minister's home is the Goodwood to Torrens rail project. If politics rather than productivity were the driving force behind decisions on infrastructure, I do not believe the Goodwood to Torrens rail project in Adelaide would have got funding, nor would the Majura Parkway in the ACT and the outskirts of New South Wales. Those projects were funded because of the high BCR that they had. The Hunter Expressway is very similar because of the amount of freight on it. So if you have a view of the world that says we fund passenger roads and freight rail and do not look at the integrated system, you will get distorted outcomes. I ask the minister to point to where in the billâ€”and perhaps he is correctâ€”it says $100 million projects will all be evaluated before the government funds them. It is little wonder that the member for Melbourne is asking about the tabling of the cost-benefit analysis for the east-west road project. (Time expired)

 (Mayoâ€”Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (18:01):  Without debating another bill that is now before the Senate and has just had a Senate committee report on it, which I must sayâ€”



Mr Albanese interjectingâ€”




Mr BRIGGS:
  You shut it down last time. I must say in relation to the Senate inquiry into the IA bill the Infrastructure Coordinator appointed by the former minister said he recommends the committee support giving the IA the new function to produce infrastructure plans. That was the recommendation from Mr Deegan, which earlier you were arguingâ€”

  No, they do not exist already. I explained when you were out of the parliament that they were not.




Mr Albanese:
  We tabled it in the parliament!




Mr BRIGGS:
  I suspect we are not going to come to an agreement. Under proposed section 5A(2) of the IA bill IA must not evaluate a proposal that is to give effect to the $100 million promise. This is also in the second reading speech and is made clear in the department's submissionâ€”




Mr Albanese:
  Where is it?




Mr BRIGGS:
  It is in the second reading speech, so it makes it clear that is the commitment.




Mr Albanese:
  It is not here.

  That is in the second reading speech. And the $100 million will be a determination made by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Truss, under proposed section 5A(3). That answers the question.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:03):  With due respect to the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, he full well knows that it is not included in the legislationâ€”that it is determined upon the whim of the government of the day. We know that the last time the coalition came to office they cut $2 billion from the road funding budget in their first budget and they never recovered in terms of road funding. 



Mr Briggs interjectingâ€”




Mr ALBANESE:
  The errand boy opposite indicates that he was very young at the time, and I accept that he is not personally responsible.



An opposition member interjectingâ€”




Mr ALBANESE:
  But I will point out that the bloke who issues him orders and instructions each day was here. He has been here almost since Federation. He was the transport minister who described the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway as the worst section of road in Australia. It was in his seat and he was the transport minister but it took a Labor government to promise, fund, build and open the new section from Cooroy to Curra. That is typical of what we did.


Those opposite simply seek to politicise decision making. We saw this morning on the front page of the newspaper that they are establishing a subcommittee of cabinet. Why that is an announcement is another thing. We had subcommittees of cabinet as well, but we did not do press releases, as cabinet is supposed to be sensitive and not for publicity. But when you have nothing to say about infrastructure except for re-announcements, you say you are establishing a committee.


The rhetoric of that article indicated that this was about the politicians, not the bureaucracy, making decisions, which is how this fits with the amendment that is before the chamber. That is what the article said: they are taking charge; they are going to make decisions. You can imagine the sorts of decisions that will be made by those opposite. Tonsley Park is a public transport project in the assistant minister's own city, yet when he talked about it on radio he thought it was a freight project. It is about three kilometres out of his seat. Such an anathema is the very concept of public transport to those opposite.


It comes down to the book Battlelines. Tony Abbott clearly indicates his view that public transport somehow diminishes the rights of the individual and the power that an individual feels in a car. If cities are going to function productively, you need to have effective public transport. That is why the amendment before the chamber seeks to have Infrastructure Australia play its proper role. It is not picked up in this billâ€”Infrastructure Australia has no role. The other bill before the Senate, which they say covers it off, clearly does not cover it off. Proposed section 5A(2) gives complete power to the minister. It says:


However, Infrastructure Australia must not evaluate a proposal under subsection (1)â€”


that is, nationally significant infrastructureâ€”


if the proposal is in a class of proposals determined by the Minister.


Complete power to the minister for what Infrastructure Australia does. So you are going to establish a board rather than the Infrastructure Australia councilâ€”same thing, different wordâ€”and you are going to instruct them. I never, ever instructed Sir Rod Eddington, as Chair of Infrastructure Australia, about what he could, or could not, look at. Infrastructure Australia came up with a range of recommendations, some of which I agreed with and some of which I did not. But if you are going to have an independent adviser then you should actually respect it. This legislation, just like the IA bill does not do that.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (18:07):  There are a couple of extraordinary things about the debate about the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 before the House this evening. The first is that they are actually having a debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall the last piece of infrastructure legislation that was before the Houseâ€”and these people on the other side of the House. It with their own bill, but they did not have the confidence to have the legislation considered in detail. So confident were they about the subject matter of their legislation that they gagged the debate. They were not willing to have their own legislation considered in detail and there was a very good reason for that. There was much to be ashamed of in that billâ€”the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. So the first thing that is extraordinary about the debate before the House today is that we are actually considering this bill in detail. A welcome thing that is too.


The second extraordinary thing is the subject matter. I listened with interest to the assistant minister's speech when he was responding to some of the questions before him today. I listened with particular interest when he said that they will honour the commitments they made in the election campaignâ€”they will honour the commitments that they made and the policies they took to the last election. I pricked up my ears when I heard the assistant minister say this. I went to my office, and I grabbed a copy of the coalition's policyâ€”the coalition's policy to deliver infrastructure for the 21st century. This is not a 2011 document or 2010 documentâ€”they could be forgiven for forgetting their policy if it was dated back a few yearsâ€”this was September 2013. And I had not forgotten. I thought I had forgottenâ€”I thought the assistant minister might actually have got it wrong. But there it was. I picked it up, and in black and white I read these words:


The coalition will strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia to create a more transparent, accountable and effective adviser on infrastructure projects and policies. Under a coalition government, Infrastructure Australia willâ€”


amongst other thingsâ€”


require all Commonwealth infrastructure expenditure exceeding $100 million to be subject to analysis by Infrastructure Australia to test cost effectiveness and financial viability


It goes on to say Infrastructure Australia will:


â€¦regularly publish cost-benefit analyses for all projects being considered for Commonwealth support or investmentâ€¦


Well there you have it; that was the policy that they took to the 2013 election.


So I have to ask the assistant minister, who stood up not 10 minutes ago and said that the coalition will honour every policy they took to the last election, why is it that at the first opportunity they have to honour that policy by voting in favour of an amendment to their legislation they resist it? They say they will not support it. Is it because they have already given the go-ahead to the East West Link project and the WestConnex project? Two projects, no cost-benefit analysis. Despite the fact, a few months ago, in this very place the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Finance stood at that very dispatch box and said, 'yes' that those projects will have cost-benefit analysis. But no cost-benefit analysis, and no support for the legislation before the House. You have to ask yourself: is this another instance of the government saying one thing before the election and doing exactly the opposite once they get elected?


The second question that I have goes to the issue of the new subcommittee of the cabinet that we were advised of by press release this morning. The question I have is this: is this new subcommittee of cabinet truly designed to fast-track infrastructure projects, or is this new subcommittee of cabinet designed to sidetrack Infrastructure Australia and to sidetrack cost-benefit analysis? That is the question for the assistant minister; that is the question for this parliament. If the government truly wants to honour its commitments, the commitments that it took to the last election in this document here, then they will do away with this bogus subcommittee of cabinet. They will ensure that Infrastructure Australia is able to do the job that it was set up to doâ€”the job that these people opposite promised the people of Australia that Infrastructure Australia would be allowed to do. It would be allowed to provide free and frank advice to government, and the cost-benefit analysis the people of Australia deserve. (Time expired)

 (Melbourne) (18:13):  The assistant minister does not seem to be that keen to secure the support of the Greens for this Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 so I rise to give them one last opportunity for the third time on this question.


I have heard this assistant minister come into the chamber many, many times, whether it has been in opposition or now in government, and say, 'The only people that you can trust to spend your money are the Liberal Party because we put everything through a rigorous cost-benefit analysis'. There will be no waste under us.' As he just alluded to in a previous contribution in this debate he said, 'It's the same argument that we ran with the NBN.' And what the minister will remember, is that the opposition then said, 'Don't proceed with the NBN until there has been a cost-benefit analysis done and until the results are published.' Given all of that, and given that we are seriously considering this billâ€”and I presume that the minister wants to get it through the Senateâ€”I will try one last time. Will the minister or the government commit to making public cost-benefit analysis on the East West Link before $1Â½ billion is spent on before the contracts are signed?

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:14):  I rise to express concern at the report today that not only would the government not have Infrastructure Australia determine priorities, but Tony Abbott is going to determine priorities by takingâ€”to quote the front page of today's newspaperâ€”'personal control' of infrastructure development. It is quite extraordinary that that would occur. One of the issues raised by the article today is the rolling out of infrastructure associated with the potential second airport in Sydney.


For a second airport in Sydney to work, of which I am very clearly on the record as a supporter, it needs road and rail infrastructure. If you are not going to have that funding there, then you will not have the support that is required from people in Western Sydney who regard infrastructure development, quite rightly, as an absolute priority for them. Those on this side of the House would be very supportive of increased infrastructure for Western Sydney, but if you have circumstances whereby the government is ruling out funding for rail infrastructure, which is a necessary component as shown by the planning work that was done by the former government for a second Sydney airport, then you need that infrastructure looked at as a whole. Indeed, that issue is a good example of why you need integrated infrastructure planning. The joint study that was done by the New South Wales and Australian governments had very much an emphasis on land transport infrastructure to support aviation infrastructure. It is the case right around the country. It is the case with ports. It is why Infrastructure Australia should not be hamstrung and it is why there should be an assessment of the cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia for all projects of $100 million or more.


The final decision should be made by the government. I accept that is the case. I do not take one position when I was in government and another in opposition. I take a consistent view, but my consistent view is that infrastructure development is best when you have independent and transparent advice. This amendment would allow for Infrastructure Australia to play a role in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, addressing that inadequacy in the legislation. Infrastructure Australia, under the chairmanship of Sir Rod Eddington, has done an outstanding job. The fact that those opposite are pretending that they are strengthening Infrastructure Australia when they are really trying to undermine its independence and integrity shows how far the debate has moved and indeed how successful it has been. When we moved the legislation early in 2008, it was opposed by those opposite, just like they opposed the economic stimulus plan and the nation-building investments that we made.


I commend the amendment to the House. If it is not carried here it will be moved by Labor senators in the other place, because we believe this is absolutely critical. It is consistent with the rhetoric of those opposite. We attempted to get agreement for this amendment, which is why we provided the amendments to the government in advance of this debate and indicated that we were open to discussion. The government rammed through the Infrastructure Australia legislation last year and is putting through this legislationâ€”which makes a significant changeâ€”without any proper process and review being attached to it. This legislation is not the comprehensive legislation it could be if the government were prepared to take a bit of a common-sense approach and support the opposition's amendment.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayoâ€”Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (18:19):  In summing up the debate and answering the last couple of points, we hope that the Labor opposition will come to some sense on the amendments that we are moving in the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill, and that it will accept that we are making Infrastructure Australia more independent and giving it a strong and transparent voice. That was the point that the member for Grayndler just made. I would have thought that a cabinet subcommittee is something he would have welcomed. He does have a passion for Infrastructure Australiaâ€”I acknowledge that. Putting the emphasis of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer on this is something, you would think, the member for Grayndler would welcome deep down inside, because it is about getting the infrastructure delivered. I am sure that at times he had the same frustrations that we have whereby sometimes the states are not as good at delivering as they should be. Having a cabinet subcommittee to push through an agenda which is part of a transparent and independently recommended spend of taxpayers' money to build a stronger economy should be something that is welcomed. That is what the cabinet subcommittee is all about. It is about achieving the outcomes that we seek through our infrastructure investments now and through what we will do in the future. Of course, the East West project is a great project. It is a project which stacks up economically and we willâ€”

Mr Albanese:

  The member for Grayndler is right. Ultimately, as he said across the chamber, how people in Victoria vote in the election later this year will be a matter for them. I am sure both the parties at that stage will put those proposals just as they did in September last year. I say to the member for Grayndler: that is a good way to end this debate.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkesâ€”The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:10):  I rise today to speak on the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to do so. This bill will enable the rollout of Roads to Recovery over six years and help to build vital road and rail projects. As someone who represents a third of New South Wales I fully understand the importance of having good road and rail projects. I would like to pay tribute to one of my predecessors, John Anderson, a former member for Gwydir, who was the minister at the time the Roads to Recovery program was mooted. I might also say that it came from a meeting that was held at Moree, in my electorate, organised by the Moree Plains Shire Council.


This bill will continue the rollout of the program until 30 June 2019, with $1.75 billion in funding. As someone who was previously a mayor of the Gwydir Shire Council I have a great understanding of the importance of the Roads to Recovery program. Roads to Recovery has been one of those programs that you will find no criticism of anywhere in this place, on either side of the House. It is a direct connection of funding from the federal government to local government. The programs are decided by the local government, and a large proportion of the money actually hits the asset where it is supposed to.


As someone who represents 17 local government areas I should say that if it was not for the Roads to Recovery program many of my councils would be in a lot of financial strife. Roads to Recovery funding in my electorate, over the length of the program, is something like $72 million. That is not only enabling many kilometres of new roads and road repairs to be laid out but it is also providing a valuable cash flow and resource for the councils in my area.


This bill will also allow the continuation of the Black Spot Program in places that have been identified as high risk. Even though the road toll over the last 20 or 30 years has been halved in Australia, it is still way too high. Unfortunately many of the people who die on our roads do so on rural roads, and many of them are still dying in identified black spot areas. This program will allow funding to go to those areas.


It is important to realise that pretty much everything we buy on the shelves of our supermarkets started its journey on a local road. Roads to Recovery is directly funding local roads. It does not apply to state roads and it does not apply to national highways. It is direct funding to councils for local roads.


In the Parkes electorate, there are many farms and businessesâ€”that rely on local roadsâ€”that generate billions of dollars of export income and provide produce that finds its way onto the shelves of supermarkets not only around Australia but around the world. While this program is very much appreciated, we must not think that we are doing enough for local roads. We need to be constantly looking at how we can continue to fund local roads. I would like to mention the Australian Rural Road Group that was formed by the Gwydir and Moree Plains councils. It has nearly 100 members right around Australiaâ€”councils that represent the high-producing agricultural shires in Australia and generally the councils that have low population densities but very high productivity. Quite often, the criterion that is used to measure the use of a road and the need for the funding or the upgrade of a road is traffic count. But that is not enough. We need to be looking at the productivity and the produce that come along the roads and the efficiency that that brings. 


The advent of the inland rail line from Melbourne to Brisbane took another step forward with the change of government. Minister Truss has allocated $300 million in the next term of government to get that project up and running. The implementation committee for that project was formed and chaired by my predecessor, John Anderson. That inland rail will provide a steel backbone for infrastructure right down the eastern side of Australia. It will be to Australia what the Mississippi is to the United States. We need to start planning our infrastructure around this inland rail line. We need to start to looking at where local road and rail interface and at how we can get the travel time down to the ports and the major markets, and do it in a more energy efficient way. This rail line will certainly do that. 


The main rail line that goes from Sydney to Perth runs through the bottom end of the Parkes electorate. To see double-stacked container trains nearly two kilometres long hurtling through the electorate certainly shows that this is the way of the future to shift freight. It is not much good if we have beef from feedlots or grain or cotton that is stranded on farm because of crummy infrastructure. As we speak, the forecast for rain this week across inland New South Wales and Queensland is very strong. That is a two-edged sword. While we will never not look forward to rainfall, it will mean that children will not be going to school and produce will not be going to market because of the state of the roads.


The issue here with rural roads is how did we got to this point? I would like to compliment the Rural Road Group, because they are working on a pilot program with half a dozen or so local government areas in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland that will measure the actual asset of the road. What has happened in the pastâ€”and I know this from experience as a mayor in a local government areaâ€”is that, quite often, the value of the write-down of those road assets has not been fully displayed. Because of the close relationship between local government and state government and the very parlous nature of the finances of local government, quite often the full level of the write-down of roads is not reported and it shows up on the balance sheet as a large loss, and the next thing you know is that that local government area is under the watchful eye of the state government for being in financial difficulty. So over the years, the actual size of the problem has been disguised somewhat. What is happening now in Moree Plains, Gwydir, Narrabri and some of the council areas in southern Queensland is that they are developing an asset management tool that can be transferred right across Australia. So at one point, as a government we can look at the state of every road in Australia and it will be in a recognised reporting system. We will be able to start to identify some priorities as to where the funds need to go and to start to have an objective look at allocating these assets. The real state of affairs has been hidden for some time. It is time that we looked at managing our assets in a more professional way and it is time that we started tying in the productivity of regional Australia with some of the spending on our road networks. 


It does give me a great deal of pleasure to support this bill knowing that we have a government and a minister totally focused on infrastructure, and that we are starting to see a planned rollout for transport infrastructure across Australia and indeed regional Australia. Not only does this tie into the lifestyle effects that I have talked aboutâ€”getting produce to market, kids to school, people to hospital and the likeâ€”but, as we need to be careful with our resources and as we become more aware of the need to preserve what resources we have, we need to be moving this freight around in the most cost-effective way. The road-rail interchange model that is being formulated at the moment is definitely a more cost-effective means to go about it. The number of trucks that that inland rail will take off the Newell Highway will be increased and the number of litres of diesel per tonne of freight moved will be drastically reduced because of this program.


Therefore, I am in support of the Land Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. It is a commitment of $35.5 billion in infrastructure investment. It will roll out over six years and, so, local government and infrastructure organisations will have the confidence to know that that funding is ongoing and, every time there is a change government, we will not have to go into this area of uncertainty. It does indicate that the Abbott-Truss government is committed to infrastructure. It does indicate that I am committed to infrastructure. I encourage anyone that is listening to me today to refer to my first speech in this place, in February 2008. Indeed, this is what I spoke aboutâ€”the need for funding for regional roads, the need for a railway line from Melbourne to Brisbane and the need for a plan to tie it all together. It is such a relief, and it gives me great pleasure, after being in this place for over six years now, to finally be part of a team that has the will, the plans and the gumption to make all this happen.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrestâ€”Government Whip) (15:24):  The purpose of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, to rename the act the National Land Transport Act 2014 and to enable the continuation of what we all know is a very important program, the Roads to Recovery program, beyond 30 June 2014. There are very practical measures in this bill. We in rural and regional Australia well understand the importance of having practical measures to deliver critical infrastructure in regional areas right throughout Australia.


The bill also amends the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to combine parts 3 and 6 into one part for investment, to streamline the actâ€”again, a very practical measureâ€”and to add a new eligible project type into part 4 to allow funding of research and investigations of projects funded under the act or submitted for consideration for funding under the act. As we know, such research will inform advice to government and enhance the management of projects. Also, it will add two new eligible funding recipientsâ€”partnerships for parts 4 and 5 and funding for land transport research entities and non-corporate Commonwealth entities for part 5â€”to expand the types of organisations that can be funded to undertake research, investigations, studies and analysis under the act. Again, these are practical measures. The bill also repeals the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Roads to Recovery Act 2000 and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958, as these are all spent legislation.


Amendments to the Nation Building Program are necessary to allow the government to proceed with what is an ambitious infrastructure agenda. I am very proud to be part of an infrastructure government under an infrastructure Prime Minister. The key function of the bill is to enable the continuation of what is unconditionally known as a very successful and critical programâ€”the Roads to Recovery program. This provides desperately needed funding to local governments for the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure. What connects people and communities, and all of the economic multipliers in regional areas, is mostly because of roads. It is very, very important funding for local governments. When I talk to my local governments, each one of them always tells me how important this funding is for them to be able to deliver what is needed in their particular areas.


The current program stalls on 30 June and it specifies funding to that date. The bill removes the definition and specification of the funding period and places it in the Roads to Recovery list. In practical terms, this removes the need to introduce a new bill to the parliament every time the Roads to Recovery funding period changes, and ensures that this critical program will continue. This is a very, very good measure contained in this bill. It will ensure that that real delivery on the ground in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia will continue.


As we know, and we have heard repeatedly in this place, local councils would struggle to be able to deliver their roads programs, if at all, without this funding. The bill also allows the minister to determine a Roads to Recovery list. This will be exempt from disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Again, this provides certainty, which is so important to local governments. It provides certainty to local government funding recipients of the program.


The bill combines part 3 of the original National Building Program act with part 6, or off-network projects, into one part for all investment projects. This is a unification and streamlining and, for practical purposes, will enhance the operation of the act. The existing parts 3 and 6 contain a significant number of identical provisions and combining them will remove the unnecessary duplication of provisions. The new part 3 for investment projects also includes a new requirement that states and territories notify the minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian government funding. That will ensure that proper accountability is maintained and that there is a timely response to land sales or disposals from both the states and territories and the Australian government. Then the proceeds of the sale or disposal should be allocated to new infrastructure projects that enhance the Australian economy and continue to remove the existing bottlenecks, which we know in regional areas are really important and affect how products get to market. They are things that affect the economies in regional and rural areas.


The bill also alters the value of work that can currently be exempted from public tender requirements. Currently, the amount is prescribed by regulations; however, this will be altered to determination instead by legislative instrument. That will reduce the regulatory delays. It introduces a new type of project that can receive funding under part 4 for transport, development and innovation projects. Projects that involve research investigation studies or analysis of the important black spot projects, previously funded off-network projects and works funded under the Roads to Recovery program will be eligible for part 4 funding. It could also be used for projects submitted for consideration for funding as investment or black spot projects, again to help form advice to government.


This amendment enhances the management of projects and the infrastructure investment program. The bill also adds two new types of eligible funding recipient into the act. Partnerships have been added for funding recipients in parts 4 and 5. This change simplifies funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research related to land transport research operations will now be able to receive funding under part 5, which is funding for land transport research entities.


The government has committed, importantly, to continuation of the Black Spot Programme, which provides funding to address road sites that are high-risk areas for serious crashes. There are many of these around Australia, and it is a program that is essential for state and local governments to be able to fulfil their local road safety commitments. Black spot projects are administered under part 7 and remain largely unchanged. The bill makes no amendments to the national land transport network. The network contains the key road and rail links connecting Australia and is a vital component of the government's infrastructure investment program.


Like many in this place, it would not surprise the House that, in discussions about transport infrastructure, the needs of my electorate of Forrest should also be considered. The bill before the House today repeals the Roads to Recovery Act 2000, which instigated the Roads to Recovery Program. It was moved into the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005 and then the nation-building program of 2009. AusLink was a defining national network that superseded the former national highway system and included important road and rail infrastructure links and their intermodal connections. It was first proposed in a green paper issued in 2002. AusLink connected many of the major economic and population centres of Australia; but, when it came to the south-west of Western Australia, this actually stopped at Bunbury in my electorate.


In the intervening years the south-west has grown significantly. It is now one of the fastest-growing regional areas in Australia. I well understand the budget challenges created by the former Labor government; however, I will continue to work towards having some of the major arterial roads in the south and east of Bunbury recognised by the federal government as roads of national significance. This is important because in the south-west we produce seven per cent of WA's total gross state product and in recent years there has been a 10 per cent growth rate in the south-west. As we know, Western Australia produces 46 per cent of Australia's export wealth. In time, as soon as the budget allows, I would hope that all levels of government would contribute to road infrastructure in the south-west given the continuous growth that we are seeing. Only then will the region be able to grow and develop to its full potential.


As I have said, the south-west is a jewel in the grown of the state's economic and cultural development. It is an environmental icon as well, listed as one of the world's international biodiversity hot spots. The region is also a tourism and holiday destination of choice. The fact that we have major infrastructure through the port is often overlooked. We also have significant exports; over 10 million tonnes is exported through the port of Bunbury on an annual basis. Mining and resource manufacturing are a major part of my electorate, and that is why transport links are so important. It is another reason the tax on diesel fuelâ€”the carbon tax that Labor were to impose in July this yearâ€”would have a critical impact right throughout Western Australia and throughout my electorate.


The wide range of activity in the south-west, coupled with the significant regional population growth of over 2.1 per cent a year compared with the state's average of 1.8 per cent and the nation's 1.4, continues to put significant pressure on the transport infrastructure of the region. Frequently I look at the waste and mismanagement in the previous government and think what some of those fundsâ€”and even what is currently being paid in interest on the debt that has been acquiredâ€”would do to deliver infrastructure in my region.


With this in mind, the Bunbury Outer Ring Road project is an essential and urgent piece of infrastructure. This is a project that has been expanded in stages. I was at the opening of stage 1 of the port access road in 2010. Stages 1 and 2 of Bunbury Outer Ring Road were completed last year. The remaining stage of the Bunbury Outer Ring Road is estimated to cost over $700 million, and that is why I can understand the challenges facing the budget and why, if it were not for some of the waste and mismanagement, these are the types of projects we would be able to fund. I look forward to a very responsible government looking seriously at these types of road transport projects in the future.


In the longer term I can see throughout the south-west that dual lanes from Perth to Margaret River will be essential. It is one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia and will continue to be so. It is part of my long-term transport vision for the south west, and of course this is also about the economic development of my part of the world. It is a major economic driver for Western Australia and for the Australian economy. As I say, frequently it is not well-understood that not only do we have mining resources but also we have agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. I have one of the most diverse electorates in Australia. Of course that brings with it huge demands for infrastructure, something that I know the minister at the table, Minister Truss, is very well aware off from looking at the infrastructure needs across this country. I am very pleased to support this particular bill and to be a part of an infrastructure minister's efforts, an infrastructure Prime Minister's efforts  and an infrastructure government.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2014-03-24,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bayâ€”Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (15:38):  May I thank all members who have contributed to the debate. There is a universal agreement on both sides of the parliament that infrastructure and building better infrastructure are important national priorities and that we as a parliament need to do what we can to provide adequate infrastructure to service the needs of our country and our growing economy in the years ahead. This bill will not only help put in place the arrangements for funding for major infrastructure projects, particularly over the next five years, but also it will set in place a legislative framework which will endure and support future governments' initiatives in land transport. The government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, as the previous speaker, Ms Marino, said and the changes in the bill will help us achieve this goal. The amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transparent infrastructure agenda. 


The bill continues the vitally important Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June 2014. Amendments to the act are necessary as it currently specifies the Roads to Recovery funding period as ending on 30 June 2014. The bill removes this specification from the act and places it in Roads to Recovery list, which allows the program to continue and removes the need to amend the act every time the funding period changes.


The bill renames the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program. This means that the act will not need to be amended if the name of the land transport infrastructure funding program changes. It is the most sensible name for the act and keeps it above politics. The bill also streamlines and enhances the operation of the act to benefit the states and territories and the Commonwealth. 


The bill is consistent with the government's deregulation agenda, repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. There are no regulatory or financial impacts on business and on the amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 or the repeal of the spent legislation. 


I do not propose to respond specifically to all of the comments made by members in their contributions, but I do acknowledge their general support for infrastructure investment and for ensuring that we have an adequate program to meet our nation's needs. Some members spoke in support of existing projects, which are in the program, and many others raised, on behalf of their electorates, other major road projectsâ€”all of them, no doubt, worthy. They would like to see these projects included in the land transport program in the years ahead. I hope we can continue to build on the foundations of the past and to expand the quality of our road and rail network right across the nation. This legislation will certainly contribute to that. 


There is often debate between both sides of politics as to who has done the most in relation to road funding and road construction and I suspect that that will always be a part of the political debate. The member for Grayndler likes to speak with some degree of pride about what was achieved in his term in government. I would just remind him that the Howard government spent more on infrastructure than the previous ALP government and the next coalition government is going to spend more on infrastructure than the last Labor government. The Howard government was the first to establish a national transport plan and I think both sides of politics, while we may have different priorities, have sought to work on stronger infrastructure for our nation. I hope that that can be continued in future. 


The government has identified a long list of projects that will be our priorities over the next five years. I think all of those projects will make a real difference. I am sure that in additionâ€”unless this government serves for many decades, which we naturally hope to doâ€”there will be projects that will cross governments. I suspect that the list of projects, in many instances, will be fairly similar. On Friday, I had the privilege of opening the Hunter Expressway, for which the money was first provided in 1997 and its actual construction crossed three federal governments. That is not uncommon in these very large infrastructure projects. In reality we need to work constructively as a parliament to put together the kinds of infrastructure projects that will make a real difference in the future. 


The program we have announced and we are determined to deliver includes quite a number of new projects. They will be of particular significance in the cities and in regional Australia. Beyond that we have fully committed and budgeted for the projects that the previous government had planned to fund with the proceeds of the mining tax, which commitments it was never going to be capable of meeting. This demonstrates why this government is committed to building and delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century and beyond. 


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (19:47):  I rise to make a contribution in support of the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I am pleased to have been in the House for the contribution of the member for Longman. I noted with interest that he went through a number of local programs that will be advanced by the Green Army established through this legislation. Certainly, members on this side are supportive of those sorts of initiatives and also of the pathways to meaningful employment that may be generated through programs such as this, but this legislation raises a couple of other significant questions that I wish to draw attention to, firstly, at a broad level, about the relationship between the bill before us and the government's environmental agenda and, secondly, about an issue relating to the status of persons engaged in the Green Army process.


In making my contribution, I think it is important that we do reflect in the first instance on the environmental performance of the government to date. The question I think we need to pose is: do we really have a minister who is for the environment? His performance to date, lamentably, suggests environmental concerns do not have an advocate in this government or, at any rate, an effective one. Members opposite, it should be noted, often speak in this place on questions of the legacy that we might leave to future generations. These contributions relate exclusively to their posturing over debtâ€”a matter for another time. We do not hear any concern for the sort of world our grandchildren will inherit for this most fundamental expression of intergenerational equity.


This is not just about inconsistency. It is a profoundly troubling failure, because across the developed world, only Australia is going backwards in terms of its approach to tackling climate change. I think of the Globe Climate Legislation Study which found Australia to be uniqueâ€”in a class of its ownâ€”as the only nation taking negative legislative action on climate change. As the shadow minister said, in response to this very report:


Australia is continually being embarrassed on a global stage by Tony Abbott's ideological attack on Australia's future.


This is an attack on future generations and it is blindingly ideological, with the environmental failures not confined to climate change. We see the Great Barrier Reef under threat, and it seems the only recourse to protect it is the courts. There are very significant challenges, to say the least, to Tasmania's wilderness through the proposed delisting of much of the wilderness World Heritage Area on the one hand and the state government's promise to tear up the forest agreement on the other. This list could go on, but the point is this: we are going backwards. I read with interest an article by Nick Feik in the Saturday Paper last weekend. This bears eloquent testimony to the environmental credentials of this government as it subordinates environmental protection to short-term commercial consideration. The article acknowledges that this may be one area of policy making where the government is, at least in broad terms, implementing an agenda set out prior to the election. I quote:


But the brute efficiency of its program to damage environmental interests has been breathtaking.


It certainly has been. Accompanied by the trademark cuts to bodies providing independent advice or checks to government action, from the Climate Commission to environment defenders offices in states and territories. So it grates more than just a little when the minister asserts the Green Army is a 'central component of the government's cleaner environment plan.' And also that it complements, apparently, direct action, but more on that point later.


I note that there was no formal coalition environment policy going into the last election on this point. This begs the question: where is the rest of this government's cleaner environment plan? What evidence is there of any commitment on the part of this government to stand up for our beautiful natural environment that is at the core of Australia's patrimony? This context is important when discussing this bill.


While I have some concerns about the legislation before us, my wider concern is the opposition this government and this minister seem to have to environmentalism and the priority it has allocated to the preservation and protection of our environment. The fact is, there is no coherent environment policy under this minister or this government, and legislation such as this, however beneficial it might be, can be no substitute for such an agenda.


Having said that, I turn to the provisions of the legislation before us, which, of course, rest on Labor foundations. Previous programs, some of which were touched upon by the previous speaker, but starting with the Keating government's Landcare and Environment Action Program in 1992 set out two critical objectives: providing work opportunities for young people and supporting community action to promote important environmental outcomes. Both objectives are vital.


The purpose of this bill is to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to make certain specifications, particularly: with some limited exceptions, recipients of the Green Army allowance are not also able to receive a social security benefit or pension; income testing arrangements apply to the social security pension of a Green Army participant's partner; and participants who are not Green Army team supervisors are not to be treated as workers or employees for the purposes of certain Commonwealth laws. It is the last aspect of this bill that I find most troubling and I will focus the balance of my contribution on that.


When reading through the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the minister's second reading speech it is clear, despite claims to the contrary, that this program is an employment program. Labor's position on employment is clearâ€”a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. As well as their pay, a person's employment conditions are a big part of being employed. Conditions include fundamental things like occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation rights. The government wants the program's participants to perform work and, to its credit, it is proposing to pay a comparable training wage. But someone's pay must also take into account their conditions and basic protections. The minister invokes the precedent of Work for the Dole and the Howard-era Green Corps programs but does not explain why these are precedents that should be followedâ€”funny, that. 


According to the Green Army Program Draft Statement of Requirements Consultation Process document, the Green Army Program service providers are required to obtain and maintain insurance. There is a vague reference to the government purchasing personal accident insurance and products and public liability insurance to cover participants in the program. However, nothing in the proposed legislation before us addresses the critical issue of the extent to which Green Army service providers will be required to provide suitable insurance. Even where insurance is in place, it differs from workers compensation cover in that an injured participant is likely to have to demonstrate negligence by the provider. These disputes can take many years and great expense to resolve, and young volunteers are highly unlikely to have the resources to singlehandedly pursue such claims however meritorious they may be. As such, compared to workers generally, a lower standard of protection is being offered to Green Army participants, particularly given the physical and outdoor nature of the tasks they are doing. 


Of course, the workplace relations environment has changed in recent years. Most states and territories had referred their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth by 2010. This means that the Fair Work Act, and the National Employment Standards contained within it, has been the framework for a national workplace relations system, which includes all private sector employment other than employment by non-constitutional corporations in Western Australia. This is important because under previous schemes participants would have been covered by state and territory employment laws, but this will no longer be the case. What is the rationale behind this, I ask? There is nothing by way of explanation in any of the publicly available information. This just seems like more slipshod government by way of slogans. The government's website offers no further clues. It has one brief page on the Green Army, a link to a draft statement of requirements, and at the bottom of this page is a generic email and a 1800 number for people to call. That is it. Surely, if the government wants the support not just of this parliament and the people of Australia but of those it wants to participate in this program, it should provide this detail to enable potential participants to effectively determine the basis of their participationâ€”it cannot be too much to ask. If the government can acknowledge that the program's participants are performing work worthy of the training wage, then surely it should ensure that they have the same OHS, workers compensation and rehabilitation standards.


Labor supports helping people find work and giving them the skills and experience to do so. I am sure those opposite do so too, but this bill leaves out so much information it is as if no real thought has gone into the mechanics of the program's operationâ€”a matter members opposite are generally keen to find fault on when little thought has allegedly gone in from this side of the House. For example, there are no minimum hours specified. This is ominous. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics reveals that over half a million workers were forced to sign zero-hour contracts, though the figure is likely to be higher as many employees are employed this way without them realising. Such contracts entail an employee being on-call, without a minimum amount of weekly work specified in the contract. Some big UK employers have 90 per cent of their workforce on such contracts. I hope this is not the beginning of such a trend in Australia, although it does appear that the promotion of insecure work will be the inevitable consequence, if not the central objective, of this government's policy settings.


I also note the concerns of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights with respect to the right to social security and the right to work, neither of which has been addressed by the bill's statement of compatibility I am sorry to say. Regarding the right to social security, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that social security should be available, adequate and accessible. The joint committee contended that, in excluding Green Army participants from receiving other benefits or pensions, the bill may limit the right to social security. This is of some concern. The committee, quoting from Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, goes on to observe that the right to social security may be subject to such limitations 'as are determined by law only in so far as this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.' The committee states:


It is necessary for the government to demonstrate that the measure pursues a legitimate objective and has a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the objective sought to be realised.


The committee goes on to note that it is unclear whether or not participants may actually be worse off by virtue of their receiving the Green Army allowance rather than income support and whether the allowance 'will be sufficient to meet minimum essential levels of social security'. In respect of the right to work the committee states that the exclusion of Green Army Program participants from such laws may constitute a limitation on the right to just and favourable conditions of employment, as specified in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. While the committee notes that participation in the program is voluntary, it suggests that, because the participation may be on a full-time basis and constitute a participant's sole means of earning a living, it should be treated as work and participants should be treated as workers or employees under the abovementioned Commonwealth laws. I note that the committee is seeking further information from the minister on the above matters and, on this side of the chamber, we join the committee in waiting with keen interest for the minister's response. These are matters I am deeply concerned by.


I also have some questions about what would happen to a participant of this program if they wished to raise a complaint about their supervisor or provider. Can they join a union? Can they go to the Fair Work Ombudsman? What are the channels for addressing these complaints should they arise? These are significant matters that have not been touched upon. Again, the minister has provided information which is, at best, unhelpful. The minister seems to taking a 'she'll be right' approach to this policy as well as to the profound challenge that climate change poses. Indeed, the minister in his second reading speech mentions climate change only once, as a mere afterthought. It is unclear what exactly has happened to direct action, which this legislation apparently complementsâ€”although it is unclear precisely how. Is the government still of the view that paying polluters is the most efficient allocation of finite resources? As the scientific and economic consensus indicatesâ€”and as the minister used to acknowledge, and in fact advocate forâ€”the most efficient way to allocate resources, and hence the most effective way to deal with the impact of climate change, is with a price on carbon through market mechanisms. When it comes to dealing with climate change, this government has its head in the sand. Perhaps getting the government to take its head out of the sand could be one of the Green Army's first keynote projects.


These sorts of programs, as touched upon by the member for Longman earlier, may well be very worthwhile programs in themselves; however, they need to supplement an actual coherent environmental policy, not just the 'direct distraction' on climate change and the environment more generally. 


Members on this side support the objectives of this bill because we support taking local and global action on climate change. Of course, in the Labor Party, we support doing all we can to get people into work, into well-paid and secure jobs. On that very last point, it is these concerns regarding worker protections that need to be addressed by the minister before this bill is enacted. I call on him do so. I also call on him to start work on being a minister who is committed to being for the environment.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (20:01):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. There should be no surprise that this legislation is before the House today, because we have been promising the Green Army for years now. Now that we are the government, we are making good on our policy commitment. 


What is this initiative all about? What benefits will it bring? Given the rising youth unemployment that has been a legacy of recent years, there is no doubt that there is a place for a program that is designed to provide employment opportunities for young Australians aged 17 to 24. This program can help young people gain training and experience in the environmental field. They can also gain a better understanding of heritage and conservation matters. This is the sort of work that enables young people to look at careers in conservation management, while also working on projects that generate real benefits forâ€”and real visual change inâ€”the Australian environment.


Just this morning I was reading in the newspaper about a young man who could not get a job because of a lack of transport and a lack of experience. In my electorate of Cowan, there are many opportunities for Green Army projects to be taken up by service providers and project sponsors. When I look around the 180 square kilometres of Cowan, it is easy to see the potentialâ€”places like Warwick bushland, Koondoola bushland, or the lakes of Cowan, such as Lake Goollelal in Kingsley, Lake Joondalup or even Emu Lake in Ballajura. There are extensive bushland tracts throughout the electorate and, because there are many, they are not hard to get to as the public transport is pretty good. It is therefore easy to see the opportunities that the Green Army will provideâ€”not only opportunities for young people but also opportunities to achieve great environmental results. I therefore encourage the cities of Joondalup, Wanneroo and Swan to look at the opportunities to look after their young people and achieve benefits for the environment.


The concept of this program is that the Green Army will be made up of teams of 10 people: one supervisor and up to nine participants. These teams will be deployed to help communities deliver local conservation outcomes. The great thing about the program is that each project will be guided by local community needs. It really is local action, and through that local action the projects will contribute to Australia's environmental priorities and obligations.


The program will support 250 projects in 2014-15, then 500 projects in the following year and 750 projects in 2016-17. This is a long-term, ongoing program. Beyond the $300 million to cover these first three years, there will be more funding in the future.


From here, the request for tender will soon be available. Following the tender process, contractors can be engaged. They will then engage teams and manage activities to ensure projects are completed and will report regularly on progress.


Next there will be the need for project sponsors. This is where we will see local input into the proposal and development of local projects. Again, by way of example I can see the City of Wanneroo coming up with projects around such places as Lake Gnangara. The Friends of Yellagonga Regional Park could also propose work around Lake Goollelal, and the same with the Friends of Warwick Bushland. I also think about the opportunities for the Koondoola bushland, an area severely burnt out in a bushfire a couple of years ago.


When I think of the friends groups around the Cowan electorate, I particularly think of dedicated volunteers achieving very good results with minimal assistance from all levels of government. Every month or so they have their work days, which target particular problems or areas that are in need of remediation. These work days include a focus on places such as Frog Hollow, Duck Landing, or even Hocking Road. From this sort of position, I know that the Friends of Yellagonga are literally the experts and their excellent local knowledge will be needed. Therefore, I encourage their input. Perhaps they may even seek a supervisor position or two. They would be employed by the service providers. 


Regardless of whether they decide to take up the opportunity or not, I would like to thank the Friends of Yellagonga for their environmental work to date. In particular, I would like to thank their committee: the chair, Kevin McLeod; vice chair, Marian Napier-Winch; treasurer, John Stenton; secretary, Heather Chester; the volunteers coordinator, Graham Sinclair; and general committee members John Chester, Sue Walker, David Taggart, Will Carstairs and Rebekkah Lamont.


I encourage the friends groups and the local governments to start working on proposals that they would like to see undertaken in their areas. Proposals will be assessed and recommended to the Minister for the Environment for approval.


I have certainly seen what benefits will flow to the environment in Cowan and what advantages can be gained for local sponsors; however, this is mostly about the opportunities for young people. Those young people aged between 17 and 24 years will be the participants. They could be school leavers, gap year students, graduates, the unemployed or even people with disabilities.


What this specifically means for participants is that they will generally be engaged for 30 hours per week on a project. That involves undertaking formal training in work-readiness, conservation and land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management, and trades. Where possible, certificate I or II qualifications will be sought, although depending on the circumstances credit for units at more advanced levels may also be obtained. All participants will be paid an allowance. Anyone interested on any level can send an email to greenarmy@environment.gov.au. 


I support this program very simply because it is a way to assist young people to get skills and qualifications while at the same time helping achieve environmental outcomes in Cowan. This is the sort of opportunity that all young people in Cowan, whether they live in Ballajura, Tapping, Warwick, Gnangara or anywhere, would be close to and could benefit from. Across Australia, the benefits for young people and the environment will be clear. The Green Army will be our biggest ever environmental workforce, with 15,000 by 2018, and some 1,500 projects. On such a scale, the benefits of habitat preservation, weeding, planting and cleaning up lakes and rivers will be immense. Of course, this is not in isolation to other Abbott government efforts. We will still see the National Landcare Program, direct action, the 20 million trees program and the Indigenous ranger program, all providing benefits across Australia and not undermining jobs, as the anti-Western Australian carbon tax does.


Of course, any discussion of the Green Army has to cover more than just skills and environmental benefits. The team supervisor will be an employee of the service provider and they will be paid a wage that is consistent with the relevant award, which is the Gardening and Landscaping Services Award. For the participants, they will be paid a Green Army allowance and will not at the same time receive a social security benefit or a pension. Through amendments to various Commonwealth laws, the participants will not be considered workers or employees of the Commonwealth.


I fully support and endorse the Green Army concept because it is based on the Green Corps program of the Howard government. Environmentally it was a successful program, seeing the propagation and planting of more than 14 million trees and the clearing of more than 50,000 weeds. The program also saw in excess of 8,000 kilometres of fencing and more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks or boardwalks constructed or maintained. I support the Green Army Program because it achieves for young people and for the environment. I like it because it links into the local needs and priorities of our environment and is there for young people in the area, helping to get them skills, qualifications, experience and achievements. I look forward to the bill being passed and I again encourage sponsors in Cowan to think about specific projects that will really help the environment in Cowan.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:09):  I am pleased to stand tonight to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I have been looking forward to an opportunity to do so for some time. There are many of my colleagues on this side that have addressed issues in the bill relating to the training, or the lack of training, for the participants and the lack of protections in the case of injury, but I am not going to spend much time talking on that tonight. I actually want to talk about the environment.


I remember that, when this program was launched by Tony Abbott in the election campaign, it was launched clearly as part of his Direct Action strategy. They were going to move away from a market based mechanism and go to direct action, and they were going to create a Green Army across the country. It was a part of Direct Action and part of their environmental program. So I want to talk today about a $300 million program that purports to be about the environment and look at whether or not there are alternatives that might be more effective, both in terms of local environmental protection and in terms of spend. The government talks a lot about value for money, so let us have a look at this program.


It purported originally to be about the environment. If you look at the bill and hear the speakers on the other side, it seems to have morphed into something else. It is somewhere between a training program and a volunteer program, except there is no training budget, so it seems to have morphed but it was about the environment. We have a Minister for the Environment at the moment on the government's side that rarely mentions the environment. We on this side of the House wait for him in question time to get up and talk about the environment, everâ€”he never does. Today he actually used the word 'forest' and I got excited because I thought the environment minister was going to talk about the environment, but he was referring to the member for Forrest. Imagine my disappointment when he went back to talking about on-road and off-road diesel, which does seem to be his main topic of conversation at the moment.


This Green Army Program is his program, and this is the first sign of any action on the environment that we have seen from the environment minister in nearly seven months, so it is worth looking at it in great detail. There is $300 million over the next four years, between 2014-15 and 2017-18. That is $300 million for 15,000 people over those four years, for 1,500 projects. I always do a quick calculation when I see numbers like this. There are 150 electorates, so we are talking about 10 projects on average per electorate. I expect Western Australia might have a few more, because 10 projects spread out over almost the entire state of Western Australia would not be particularly effective, but let's accept the average of 10 projects per electorate over the next four years. For those who can divide 10 by four, it is about two to three per year per electorate.




Ms Henderson:
  It is 1,500 projects over four years.




Ms OWENS:
  Yes, and divided by 150 it is 10. You do the maths: 1,500 divided by 150 is 10. Go back to school. Ten projects over four yearsâ€”




Ms Henderson:
  1,500 projects over four years.




Ms OWENS:
  It is 10. Get your pencil out and do the maths. It is 10 per electorate over four yearsâ€”that is two to three per year, starting with one and growing. When you look at that as a group of 10 projects using volunteers who are unskilled, who are not necessarily fit and who are doing a job they have never done before, that is actually a very small amount of effort in the environmental work in an electorate. But consider what a council would doâ€”what my Parramatta council would doâ€”with 10 projects worth $200,000 each. That is what they are worth each, if you divide the $300 million by the number of projects. I know that when this program is implementedâ€”if it isâ€”then a lot of that money will go into the administration of the program. However, if you look at it as 10 contracts worth $200,000 each, I know my councils could achieve a great deal of local environmental work with that amount of money and do it with professionals in a way which had an ongoing life. When you look at the program rolled out in total, that would be 10 projects at $200,000 each per year in each electorate, working on the figures we have been given. And, again, imagine what a local council could do with that, including taking on apprentices or having the organisations that deliver those projects taking on apprenticesâ€”real pathways to employment and real environmental work being done by experts.


Environmental work has to be done by experts. It is actually very difficult, and it takes years to get the canopy, the under-storey and the groundcover right when you are refurbishing bushland. And it takes more years again to get the mix of insects and bird life back to an appropriate level to sustain life in the bushes. It is highly skilled, and it is ongoing. It is like trying to stay healthyâ€”you do not do it just for this month or just for this year and then give it up; you do it for all of your life. And you do environmental work for the life of the forest. In my electorate of Parramatta, and I suspect it is the same for all of your electorates, there is a growing group of highly skilled small businesses that specialise in environmental refurbishment. It is what they do. I have one in my electorate that specialises in native grasses. That is how detailed it isâ€”just native grasses. It is quite remarkable. But I have several of them that are engaged by council to refurbish bushland, to provide advice. They are engaged by businesses to deal with the land around their factories and premisesâ€”highly skilled small businesses that have trained for years and that work incredibly well, and it is a growing specialty. And as more and more Australians realise that what we want around us is our native bushland, it is going to be an area of small business that continues to grow.


One of my concerns with this influx of cheap, untrained labour into what is a growing, highly skilled area is that we will see councils effectively cost-shifting from the professional services that are currently going to small businesses to the low-paid Green Army of unskilled labour. We will see a crowding out of an incredibly important part of our small business economy and a part of our economy that we need to grow if we want this country to be environmentally as strong as it could be. For me, that is a great concern, and I do not see anything in the legislation or anything coming from the government side that gives me confidence that there will not be protections against councils cost-shifting from their current budgets to professional small businesses to a Commonwealth-funded cheap labour force. And unless you can provide me with those sorts of protections, I will be up here screaming on behalf of my small business community that is about to get done in by cheap labour that is unskilled. I will be up here every day until the government can provide me with some guarantees that it will not happen. And I tell you, with what you are talking about at the moment, it will happen. And there will be several quite good local businesses in my areaâ€”as there will be all across the countryâ€”that will find it very difficult to get work because of this influx of unskilled and low-wage labour.


I want to talk about the previous Green Corps program, which I have heard talked about here quite a bitâ€”the Howard government oneâ€”and what it did. I have heard about the 14 million trees, I have heard about the fencing, I have heard about the weed removalâ€”all really important stuff. But anybody who knows anything about environmental refurbishment knows that if you pull the weeds out today and you do not have an ongoing program, they will be back next year. Really simpleâ€”they will be back next year. Pull them out today, pull them out this yearâ€”they will be back next year. If you want to implement a good local environmental policy, it has to have life beyond one year. It has to have life beyond one project. It has to have somebody or some organisation that has responsibility for that area of land with ongoing contributions towards its maintenance. And there is nothing in this program that does thatâ€”this is one-off stuff. One yearâ€”plant some trees, no-one takes care of them, drought comes along, down they go. This is naive at best. Talk to an expert about environmental management, or about refurbishment of the land, and they will tell you that it is something you do forever. It is not something you do for only one year. Rip out the blackberry todayâ€”in two years it will be back as bad as ever. I guess then you can send another group in, because you will be doing this for a while, so perhaps you can just keep repeating the same actions over and over again.


I want to quote a statement by Glenn Albrecht, professor of sustainability at Murdoch University, commenting on the Green Corps program under the Howard government. He talked about the 14 million trees, he talked about the fencing and he talked about the 50,000 hectares of weeds. And he said this:


If it's really just weeding and tree planting, similar to the sorts of things that were done under the Howard government's programs, a lot of that work, particularly in periods of savage drought, was simply undone because there was no long-term follow-up.


That is a statement from the expert. What we have here is a program that at first glance appears to be an incredibly inefficient use of taxpayers' money in terms of local environmental work, a program that is one-off, that does not provide the ongoing environmental work that is required to sustain the improvement over time, that brings low-pay wages and unskilled labour into an area of growing skill without any guidelines or protections to ensure that local councils do not simply shift their costs from the professional side of the business to the amateur side. And I tell you, that is what we are going to see happening.


So I will be watching this program very carefully over the next few months as it works its way through this House and the Senate. There is so little detail in it at the moment that deals with the real issues and how this program will work that it is very difficult to find genuine support for it. I will be watching it very closely, and I would hope that the members of the government would also consider whether or not this is the most effective use of $300 million of taxpayers' money.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (19:47):  I rise to make a contribution in support of the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I am pleased to have been in the House for the contribution of the member for Longman. I noted with interest that he went through a number of local programs that will be advanced by the Green Army established through this legislation. Certainly, members on this side are supportive of those sorts of initiatives and also of the pathways to meaningful employment that may be generated through programs such as this, but this legislation raises a couple of other significant questions that I wish to draw attention to, firstly, at a broad level, about the relationship between the bill before us and the government's environmental agenda and, secondly, about an issue relating to the status of persons engaged in the Green Army process.


In making my contribution, I think it is important that we do reflect in the first instance on the environmental performance of the government to date. The question I think we need to pose is: do we really have a minister who is for the environment? His performance to date, lamentably, suggests environmental concerns do not have an advocate in this government or, at any rate, an effective one. Members opposite, it should be noted, often speak in this place on questions of the legacy that we might leave to future generations. These contributions relate exclusively to their posturing over debtâ€”a matter for another time. We do not hear any concern for the sort of world our grandchildren will inherit for this most fundamental expression of intergenerational equity.


This is not just about inconsistency. It is a profoundly troubling failure, because across the developed world, only Australia is going backwards in terms of its approach to tackling climate change. I think of the Globe Climate Legislation Study which found Australia to be uniqueâ€”in a class of its ownâ€”as the only nation taking negative legislative action on climate change. As the shadow minister said, in response to this very report:


Australia is continually being embarrassed on a global stage by Tony Abbott's ideological attack on Australia's future.


This is an attack on future generations and it is blindingly ideological, with the environmental failures not confined to climate change. We see the Great Barrier Reef under threat, and it seems the only recourse to protect it is the courts. There are very significant challenges, to say the least, to Tasmania's wilderness through the proposed delisting of much of the wilderness World Heritage Area on the one hand and the state government's promise to tear up the forest agreement on the other. This list could go on, but the point is this: we are going backwards. I read with interest an article by Nick Feik in the Saturday Paper last weekend. This bears eloquent testimony to the environmental credentials of this government as it subordinates environmental protection to short-term commercial consideration. The article acknowledges that this may be one area of policy making where the government is, at least in broad terms, implementing an agenda set out prior to the election. I quote:


But the brute efficiency of its program to damage environmental interests has been breathtaking.


It certainly has been. Accompanied by the trademark cuts to bodies providing independent advice or checks to government action, from the Climate Commission to environment defenders offices in states and territories. So it grates more than just a little when the minister asserts the Green Army is a 'central component of the government's cleaner environment plan.' And also that it complements, apparently, direct action, but more on that point later.


I note that there was no formal coalition environment policy going into the last election on this point. This begs the question: where is the rest of this government's cleaner environment plan? What evidence is there of any commitment on the part of this government to stand up for our beautiful natural environment that is at the core of Australia's patrimony? This context is important when discussing this bill.


While I have some concerns about the legislation before us, my wider concern is the opposition this government and this minister seem to have to environmentalism and the priority it has allocated to the preservation and protection of our environment. The fact is, there is no coherent environment policy under this minister or this government, and legislation such as this, however beneficial it might be, can be no substitute for such an agenda.


Having said that, I turn to the provisions of the legislation before us, which, of course, rest on Labor foundations. Previous programs, some of which were touched upon by the previous speaker, but starting with the Keating government's Landcare and Environment Action Program in 1992 set out two critical objectives: providing work opportunities for young people and supporting community action to promote important environmental outcomes. Both objectives are vital.


The purpose of this bill is to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to make certain specifications, particularly: with some limited exceptions, recipients of the Green Army allowance are not also able to receive a social security benefit or pension; income testing arrangements apply to the social security pension of a Green Army participant's partner; and participants who are not Green Army team supervisors are not to be treated as workers or employees for the purposes of certain Commonwealth laws. It is the last aspect of this bill that I find most troubling and I will focus the balance of my contribution on that.


When reading through the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the minister's second reading speech it is clear, despite claims to the contrary, that this program is an employment program. Labor's position on employment is clearâ€”a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. As well as their pay, a person's employment conditions are a big part of being employed. Conditions include fundamental things like occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation rights. The government wants the program's participants to perform work and, to its credit, it is proposing to pay a comparable training wage. But someone's pay must also take into account their conditions and basic protections. The minister invokes the precedent of Work for the Dole and the Howard-era Green Corps programs but does not explain why these are precedents that should be followedâ€”funny, that. 


According to the Green Army Program Draft Statement of Requirements Consultation Process document, the Green Army Program service providers are required to obtain and maintain insurance. There is a vague reference to the government purchasing personal accident insurance and products and public liability insurance to cover participants in the program. However, nothing in the proposed legislation before us addresses the critical issue of the extent to which Green Army service providers will be required to provide suitable insurance. Even where insurance is in place, it differs from workers compensation cover in that an injured participant is likely to have to demonstrate negligence by the provider. These disputes can take many years and great expense to resolve, and young volunteers are highly unlikely to have the resources to singlehandedly pursue such claims however meritorious they may be. As such, compared to workers generally, a lower standard of protection is being offered to Green Army participants, particularly given the physical and outdoor nature of the tasks they are doing. 


Of course, the workplace relations environment has changed in recent years. Most states and territories had referred their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth by 2010. This means that the Fair Work Act, and the National Employment Standards contained within it, has been the framework for a national workplace relations system, which includes all private sector employment other than employment by non-constitutional corporations in Western Australia. This is important because under previous schemes participants would have been covered by state and territory employment laws, but this will no longer be the case. What is the rationale behind this, I ask? There is nothing by way of explanation in any of the publicly available information. This just seems like more slipshod government by way of slogans. The government's website offers no further clues. It has one brief page on the Green Army, a link to a draft statement of requirements, and at the bottom of this page is a generic email and a 1800 number for people to call. That is it. Surely, if the government wants the support not just of this parliament and the people of Australia but of those it wants to participate in this program, it should provide this detail to enable potential participants to effectively determine the basis of their participationâ€”it cannot be too much to ask. If the government can acknowledge that the program's participants are performing work worthy of the training wage, then surely it should ensure that they have the same OHS, workers compensation and rehabilitation standards.


Labor supports helping people find work and giving them the skills and experience to do so. I am sure those opposite do so too, but this bill leaves out so much information it is as if no real thought has gone into the mechanics of the program's operationâ€”a matter members opposite are generally keen to find fault on when little thought has allegedly gone in from this side of the House. For example, there are no minimum hours specified. This is ominous. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics reveals that over half a million workers were forced to sign zero-hour contracts, though the figure is likely to be higher as many employees are employed this way without them realising. Such contracts entail an employee being on-call, without a minimum amount of weekly work specified in the contract. Some big UK employers have 90 per cent of their workforce on such contracts. I hope this is not the beginning of such a trend in Australia, although it does appear that the promotion of insecure work will be the inevitable consequence, if not the central objective, of this government's policy settings.


I also note the concerns of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights with respect to the right to social security and the right to work, neither of which has been addressed by the bill's statement of compatibility I am sorry to say. Regarding the right to social security, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that social security should be available, adequate and accessible. The joint committee contended that, in excluding Green Army participants from receiving other benefits or pensions, the bill may limit the right to social security. This is of some concern. The committee, quoting from Article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, goes on to observe that the right to social security may be subject to such limitations 'as are determined by law only in so far as this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.' The committee states:


It is necessary for the government to demonstrate that the measure pursues a legitimate objective and has a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the objective sought to be realised.


The committee goes on to note that it is unclear whether or not participants may actually be worse off by virtue of their receiving the Green Army allowance rather than income support and whether the allowance 'will be sufficient to meet minimum essential levels of social security'. In respect of the right to work the committee states that the exclusion of Green Army Program participants from such laws may constitute a limitation on the right to just and favourable conditions of employment, as specified in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. While the committee notes that participation in the program is voluntary, it suggests that, because the participation may be on a full-time basis and constitute a participant's sole means of earning a living, it should be treated as work and participants should be treated as workers or employees under the abovementioned Commonwealth laws. I note that the committee is seeking further information from the minister on the above matters and, on this side of the chamber, we join the committee in waiting with keen interest for the minister's response. These are matters I am deeply concerned by.


I also have some questions about what would happen to a participant of this program if they wished to raise a complaint about their supervisor or provider. Can they join a union? Can they go to the Fair Work Ombudsman? What are the channels for addressing these complaints should they arise? These are significant matters that have not been touched upon. Again, the minister has provided information which is, at best, unhelpful. The minister seems to taking a 'she'll be right' approach to this policy as well as to the profound challenge that climate change poses. Indeed, the minister in his second reading speech mentions climate change only once, as a mere afterthought. It is unclear what exactly has happened to direct action, which this legislation apparently complementsâ€”although it is unclear precisely how. Is the government still of the view that paying polluters is the most efficient allocation of finite resources? As the scientific and economic consensus indicatesâ€”and as the minister used to acknowledge, and in fact advocate forâ€”the most efficient way to allocate resources, and hence the most effective way to deal with the impact of climate change, is with a price on carbon through market mechanisms. When it comes to dealing with climate change, this government has its head in the sand. Perhaps getting the government to take its head out of the sand could be one of the Green Army's first keynote projects.


These sorts of programs, as touched upon by the member for Longman earlier, may well be very worthwhile programs in themselves; however, they need to supplement an actual coherent environmental policy, not just the 'direct distraction' on climate change and the environment more generally. 


Members on this side support the objectives of this bill because we support taking local and global action on climate change. Of course, in the Labor Party, we support doing all we can to get people into work, into well-paid and secure jobs. On that very last point, it is these concerns regarding worker protections that need to be addressed by the minister before this bill is enacted. I call on him do so. I also call on him to start work on being a minister who is committed to being for the environment.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (20:01):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. There should be no surprise that this legislation is before the House today, because we have been promising the Green Army for years now. Now that we are the government, we are making good on our policy commitment. 


What is this initiative all about? What benefits will it bring? Given the rising youth unemployment that has been a legacy of recent years, there is no doubt that there is a place for a program that is designed to provide employment opportunities for young Australians aged 17 to 24. This program can help young people gain training and experience in the environmental field. They can also gain a better understanding of heritage and conservation matters. This is the sort of work that enables young people to look at careers in conservation management, while also working on projects that generate real benefits forâ€”and real visual change inâ€”the Australian environment.


Just this morning I was reading in the newspaper about a young man who could not get a job because of a lack of transport and a lack of experience. In my electorate of Cowan, there are many opportunities for Green Army projects to be taken up by service providers and project sponsors. When I look around the 180 square kilometres of Cowan, it is easy to see the potentialâ€”places like Warwick bushland, Koondoola bushland, or the lakes of Cowan, such as Lake Goollelal in Kingsley, Lake Joondalup or even Emu Lake in Ballajura. There are extensive bushland tracts throughout the electorate and, because there are many, they are not hard to get to as the public transport is pretty good. It is therefore easy to see the opportunities that the Green Army will provideâ€”not only opportunities for young people but also opportunities to achieve great environmental results. I therefore encourage the cities of Joondalup, Wanneroo and Swan to look at the opportunities to look after their young people and achieve benefits for the environment.


The concept of this program is that the Green Army will be made up of teams of 10 people: one supervisor and up to nine participants. These teams will be deployed to help communities deliver local conservation outcomes. The great thing about the program is that each project will be guided by local community needs. It really is local action, and through that local action the projects will contribute to Australia's environmental priorities and obligations.


The program will support 250 projects in 2014-15, then 500 projects in the following year and 750 projects in 2016-17. This is a long-term, ongoing program. Beyond the $300 million to cover these first three years, there will be more funding in the future.


From here, the request for tender will soon be available. Following the tender process, contractors can be engaged. They will then engage teams and manage activities to ensure projects are completed and will report regularly on progress.


Next there will be the need for project sponsors. This is where we will see local input into the proposal and development of local projects. Again, by way of example I can see the City of Wanneroo coming up with projects around such places as Lake Gnangara. The Friends of Yellagonga Regional Park could also propose work around Lake Goollelal, and the same with the Friends of Warwick Bushland. I also think about the opportunities for the Koondoola bushland, an area severely burnt out in a bushfire a couple of years ago.


When I think of the friends groups around the Cowan electorate, I particularly think of dedicated volunteers achieving very good results with minimal assistance from all levels of government. Every month or so they have their work days, which target particular problems or areas that are in need of remediation. These work days include a focus on places such as Frog Hollow, Duck Landing, or even Hocking Road. From this sort of position, I know that the Friends of Yellagonga are literally the experts and their excellent local knowledge will be needed. Therefore, I encourage their input. Perhaps they may even seek a supervisor position or two. They would be employed by the service providers. 


Regardless of whether they decide to take up the opportunity or not, I would like to thank the Friends of Yellagonga for their environmental work to date. In particular, I would like to thank their committee: the chair, Kevin McLeod; vice chair, Marian Napier-Winch; treasurer, John Stenton; secretary, Heather Chester; the volunteers coordinator, Graham Sinclair; and general committee members John Chester, Sue Walker, David Taggart, Will Carstairs and Rebekkah Lamont.


I encourage the friends groups and the local governments to start working on proposals that they would like to see undertaken in their areas. Proposals will be assessed and recommended to the Minister for the Environment for approval.


I have certainly seen what benefits will flow to the environment in Cowan and what advantages can be gained for local sponsors; however, this is mostly about the opportunities for young people. Those young people aged between 17 and 24 years will be the participants. They could be school leavers, gap year students, graduates, the unemployed or even people with disabilities.


What this specifically means for participants is that they will generally be engaged for 30 hours per week on a project. That involves undertaking formal training in work-readiness, conservation and land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management, and trades. Where possible, certificate I or II qualifications will be sought, although depending on the circumstances credit for units at more advanced levels may also be obtained. All participants will be paid an allowance. Anyone interested on any level can send an email to greenarmy@environment.gov.au. 


I support this program very simply because it is a way to assist young people to get skills and qualifications while at the same time helping achieve environmental outcomes in Cowan. This is the sort of opportunity that all young people in Cowan, whether they live in Ballajura, Tapping, Warwick, Gnangara or anywhere, would be close to and could benefit from. Across Australia, the benefits for young people and the environment will be clear. The Green Army will be our biggest ever environmental workforce, with 15,000 by 2018, and some 1,500 projects. On such a scale, the benefits of habitat preservation, weeding, planting and cleaning up lakes and rivers will be immense. Of course, this is not in isolation to other Abbott government efforts. We will still see the National Landcare Program, direct action, the 20 million trees program and the Indigenous ranger program, all providing benefits across Australia and not undermining jobs, as the anti-Western Australian carbon tax does.


Of course, any discussion of the Green Army has to cover more than just skills and environmental benefits. The team supervisor will be an employee of the service provider and they will be paid a wage that is consistent with the relevant award, which is the Gardening and Landscaping Services Award. For the participants, they will be paid a Green Army allowance and will not at the same time receive a social security benefit or a pension. Through amendments to various Commonwealth laws, the participants will not be considered workers or employees of the Commonwealth.


I fully support and endorse the Green Army concept because it is based on the Green Corps program of the Howard government. Environmentally it was a successful program, seeing the propagation and planting of more than 14 million trees and the clearing of more than 50,000 weeds. The program also saw in excess of 8,000 kilometres of fencing and more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks or boardwalks constructed or maintained. I support the Green Army Program because it achieves for young people and for the environment. I like it because it links into the local needs and priorities of our environment and is there for young people in the area, helping to get them skills, qualifications, experience and achievements. I look forward to the bill being passed and I again encourage sponsors in Cowan to think about specific projects that will really help the environment in Cowan.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:09):  I am pleased to stand tonight to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I have been looking forward to an opportunity to do so for some time. There are many of my colleagues on this side that have addressed issues in the bill relating to the training, or the lack of training, for the participants and the lack of protections in the case of injury, but I am not going to spend much time talking on that tonight. I actually want to talk about the environment.


I remember that, when this program was launched by Tony Abbott in the election campaign, it was launched clearly as part of his Direct Action strategy. They were going to move away from a market based mechanism and go to direct action, and they were going to create a Green Army across the country. It was a part of Direct Action and part of their environmental program. So I want to talk today about a $300 million program that purports to be about the environment and look at whether or not there are alternatives that might be more effective, both in terms of local environmental protection and in terms of spend. The government talks a lot about value for money, so let us have a look at this program.


It purported originally to be about the environment. If you look at the bill and hear the speakers on the other side, it seems to have morphed into something else. It is somewhere between a training program and a volunteer program, except there is no training budget, so it seems to have morphed but it was about the environment. We have a Minister for the Environment at the moment on the government's side that rarely mentions the environment. We on this side of the House wait for him in question time to get up and talk about the environment, everâ€”he never does. Today he actually used the word 'forest' and I got excited because I thought the environment minister was going to talk about the environment, but he was referring to the member for Forrest. Imagine my disappointment when he went back to talking about on-road and off-road diesel, which does seem to be his main topic of conversation at the moment.


This Green Army Program is his program, and this is the first sign of any action on the environment that we have seen from the environment minister in nearly seven months, so it is worth looking at it in great detail. There is $300 million over the next four years, between 2014-15 and 2017-18. That is $300 million for 15,000 people over those four years, for 1,500 projects. I always do a quick calculation when I see numbers like this. There are 150 electorates, so we are talking about 10 projects on average per electorate. I expect Western Australia might have a few more, because 10 projects spread out over almost the entire state of Western Australia would not be particularly effective, but let's accept the average of 10 projects per electorate over the next four years. For those who can divide 10 by four, it is about two to three per year per electorate.




Ms Henderson:
  It is 1,500 projects over four years.




Ms OWENS:
  Yes, and divided by 150 it is 10. You do the maths: 1,500 divided by 150 is 10. Go back to school. Ten projects over four yearsâ€”




Ms Henderson:
  1,500 projects over four years.




Ms OWENS:
  It is 10. Get your pencil out and do the maths. It is 10 per electorate over four yearsâ€”that is two to three per year, starting with one and growing. When you look at that as a group of 10 projects using volunteers who are unskilled, who are not necessarily fit and who are doing a job they have never done before, that is actually a very small amount of effort in the environmental work in an electorate. But consider what a council would doâ€”what my Parramatta council would doâ€”with 10 projects worth $200,000 each. That is what they are worth each, if you divide the $300 million by the number of projects. I know that when this program is implementedâ€”if it isâ€”then a lot of that money will go into the administration of the program. However, if you look at it as 10 contracts worth $200,000 each, I know my councils could achieve a great deal of local environmental work with that amount of money and do it with professionals in a way which had an ongoing life. When you look at the program rolled out in total, that would be 10 projects at $200,000 each per year in each electorate, working on the figures we have been given. And, again, imagine what a local council could do with that, including taking on apprentices or having the organisations that deliver those projects taking on apprenticesâ€”real pathways to employment and real environmental work being done by experts.


Environmental work has to be done by experts. It is actually very difficult, and it takes years to get the canopy, the under-storey and the groundcover right when you are refurbishing bushland. And it takes more years again to get the mix of insects and bird life back to an appropriate level to sustain life in the bushes. It is highly skilled, and it is ongoing. It is like trying to stay healthyâ€”you do not do it just for this month or just for this year and then give it up; you do it for all of your life. And you do environmental work for the life of the forest. In my electorate of Parramatta, and I suspect it is the same for all of your electorates, there is a growing group of highly skilled small businesses that specialise in environmental refurbishment. It is what they do. I have one in my electorate that specialises in native grasses. That is how detailed it isâ€”just native grasses. It is quite remarkable. But I have several of them that are engaged by council to refurbish bushland, to provide advice. They are engaged by businesses to deal with the land around their factories and premisesâ€”highly skilled small businesses that have trained for years and that work incredibly well, and it is a growing specialty. And as more and more Australians realise that what we want around us is our native bushland, it is going to be an area of small business that continues to grow.


One of my concerns with this influx of cheap, untrained labour into what is a growing, highly skilled area is that we will see councils effectively cost-shifting from the professional services that are currently going to small businesses to the low-paid Green Army of unskilled labour. We will see a crowding out of an incredibly important part of our small business economy and a part of our economy that we need to grow if we want this country to be environmentally as strong as it could be. For me, that is a great concern, and I do not see anything in the legislation or anything coming from the government side that gives me confidence that there will not be protections against councils cost-shifting from their current budgets to professional small businesses to a Commonwealth-funded cheap labour force. And unless you can provide me with those sorts of protections, I will be up here screaming on behalf of my small business community that is about to get done in by cheap labour that is unskilled. I will be up here every day until the government can provide me with some guarantees that it will not happen. And I tell you, with what you are talking about at the moment, it will happen. And there will be several quite good local businesses in my areaâ€”as there will be all across the countryâ€”that will find it very difficult to get work because of this influx of unskilled and low-wage labour.


I want to talk about the previous Green Corps program, which I have heard talked about here quite a bitâ€”the Howard government oneâ€”and what it did. I have heard about the 14 million trees, I have heard about the fencing, I have heard about the weed removalâ€”all really important stuff. But anybody who knows anything about environmental refurbishment knows that if you pull the weeds out today and you do not have an ongoing program, they will be back next year. Really simpleâ€”they will be back next year. Pull them out today, pull them out this yearâ€”they will be back next year. If you want to implement a good local environmental policy, it has to have life beyond one year. It has to have life beyond one project. It has to have somebody or some organisation that has responsibility for that area of land with ongoing contributions towards its maintenance. And there is nothing in this program that does thatâ€”this is one-off stuff. One yearâ€”plant some trees, no-one takes care of them, drought comes along, down they go. This is naive at best. Talk to an expert about environmental management, or about refurbishment of the land, and they will tell you that it is something you do forever. It is not something you do for only one year. Rip out the blackberry todayâ€”in two years it will be back as bad as ever. I guess then you can send another group in, because you will be doing this for a while, so perhaps you can just keep repeating the same actions over and over again.


I want to quote a statement by Glenn Albrecht, professor of sustainability at Murdoch University, commenting on the Green Corps program under the Howard government. He talked about the 14 million trees, he talked about the fencing and he talked about the 50,000 hectares of weeds. And he said this:


If it's really just weeding and tree planting, similar to the sorts of things that were done under the Howard government's programs, a lot of that work, particularly in periods of savage drought, was simply undone because there was no long-term follow-up.


That is a statement from the expert. What we have here is a program that at first glance appears to be an incredibly inefficient use of taxpayers' money in terms of local environmental work, a program that is one-off, that does not provide the ongoing environmental work that is required to sustain the improvement over time, that brings low-pay wages and unskilled labour into an area of growing skill without any guidelines or protections to ensure that local councils do not simply shift their costs from the professional side of the business to the amateur side. And I tell you, that is what we are going to see happening.


So I will be watching this program very carefully over the next few months as it works its way through this House and the Senate. There is so little detail in it at the moment that deals with the real issues and how this program will work that it is very difficult to find genuine support for it. I will be watching it very closely, and I would hope that the members of the government would also consider whether or not this is the most effective use of $300 million of taxpayers' money.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringahâ€”Prime Minister) (20:21):  I wish to update the House with the latest developments in the search for ill-fated flight MH370. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has advised that objects have been located by a Royal Australian Air Force P-3 Orion. I can advise the House that HMAS Success is on the scene and is attempting to locate and recover these objects. The objects were spotted in the search area, about 2,500 kilometres south-west of Perth, at about 2:45pm our time. The crew on board the Orion reported seeing two objects, the first a grey or green circular object and the second an orange rectangular object. These are separate to the objects reported earlier today by a Chinese search aircraft.


I can advise the House that a US Navy Poseidon, a second Royal Australian Air Force Orion, and a Japanese Orion, are also en route to, or in, the search area. Planes and ships continue to search the area for any sign of the missing aircraft. I again caution that we do not know whether any of these objects are from MH370. They could be flotsam. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that we can recover these objects soon, and that they will take us a step closer to resolving this tragic mystery. This is an extraordinary mystery, an absolutely baffling mystery. Let me reiterate to the House that we owe it to the families of those on board, we owe it to the loved ones of those on board and we owe it to all the people who are concerned about the fate of this aircraft to do whatever we reasonably can to find anything that is out there, test it, and see what we can learn about what has so far been one of the great mysteries of our time.

We also wish to put on record our gratitude for the efforts of Australian service people who are assisting in trying to answer this most difficult and tragic of questions. All around the world bad things happen to good people, but there is something about a plane disappearing that links all the citizens of the globe. Anyone who entrusts their life to an aeroplane and the skills of the engineers and the pilots appreciates that this mystery brings this truth home in a way other disasters around the world do not always bring home to the lounge rooms and living rooms of Australia.


The people who have disappeared on this flight could be any of us. For all those who fly, and all those who have loved ones who fly, we sincerely hope we can find answers to this most troubling, disturbing and tragic of incidents.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (20:25):  This bill for an act to amend the law relating to social security for related purposes opens the door of opportunity for the Green Army projects to be rolled out. The Green Army is a hands-on, practical, grassroots environmental action program that supports local environment and heritage conservation projects across Australia. Young Australians aged 17 to 24 will have a chance to gain training and experience in environmental and heritage conservation fields, and explore careers in conservation management. Our youth will build on their levels of self-confidence, while participating in projects that generate real benefits for the Australian environment.


Green Army teams of 10, up to nine participants and one team supervisor, will be working across the country to help local communities deliver local outcomes. The Green Army Programme is ongoing, and initially up to $300 million is available over three years from 1 July 2014. The program will support 250 projects this year, 500 in 2015-16, and 750 in 2016-17. We have heard that those opposite see this proposal as a way of displacing existing workers. There is apparently considerable confusion on the other side about the program rollout. These Green Army projects are not a part of the existing project line-up of works for councils, but are additional wish list projects that currently have no money for labour.


The previous Green Corps projects were extremely well coordinated, with an excellent array of courses that equipped young people with skills and a work ethic that enabled them to enter the workforce, and many of them did. This is not designed to be a direct work pathway, but more importantly it is a preparation to be work ready, to be work motivated, and to have a successful outcome behind them so they have something to build on for their future. In no way is the Green Army a substitute workforce, and to interpret this legislation in that way is just wrong. Those opposite even refer to these young people as volunteers. One of the previous speakers used this exact term. These young people are not workers, they are volunteers, and as a consequence there are different regimes that support this scheme.


The previous schemes were effective and successful, trying not to be distracted by red tape implications. This legislation is about people and human capacity. This truly is a value for money initiative, with overlapping benefits. A sound approach to our future is to have different portfolios overlap for increased benefit. So how do we evaluate the interaction between youth initiatives that build self esteem, the environmental benefit, and the economic benefit of the future? To coldly dismiss the human capacity of our unemployed youth is callous at best, and discriminatory at worst. Environmental repair does not have to be done solely by experts. In fact some catchment management authorities actively advise that bush regeneration can be achieved in overgrazed paddocks by simply closing the gates.


Green Army participants will most likely be engaged full-time for around about 30 hours per week on a project, and they will undertake formal training in areas such as work readiness, conservation and land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management, and trades. Where possible the young people who are part of this scheme will be assisted to obtain Certificate I or Certificate II qualifications. Extra units may also be undertaken towards more advanced levels. All participants will be paid an allowance.


The concept of a group of young people working on an environmental project for community benefit is not new to Gilmore. In the past there were a number of very successful Green Corps projects. Many of the mangroves and casuarinas on the banks of the Shoalhaven River are testimony to the great work that was done. Over the last years, Charlie Weir has become the celebrated mangrove man, working as an amazing volunteer to continue this work, growing and planting seedlings to prevent riverbank erosion since the program was shut down by the previous government. The Rivercare group are eagerly awaiting the resumption of this great program. 


Some of the participants from those earlier programs found a love of the outdoors, going on to get work on golf courses, with landscape businesses and bush regeneration projects, and even treating noxious weeds. But, overall, the self-esteem developed by these young people is beyond financial measure. The skills learned then are also expected from the new programs, including the development of effective workplace communication and the development of confidence and motivation to remain strongly connected to the community and community service activities. This is an opportunity to develop a work ethic, including team work, and achieve a level of personal positive growth. These are practical skills and attributes that are relevant to gaining ongoing employment, and the training options are some of the best foundations for future work. The additional aspects of the Green Army projects where planning, problem solving and progress review are essential will always stand these young people in good stead for future employment. In addition, they will have a chance to develop a network of industry contacts, training providers and community members. These provide opportunities for ongoing employment and training, assisting them to make informed career and work choices into their future based on the experiences gained from the project.


Gilmore already has a commitment for four Green Army projects and I will be proud to see them start in the new financial year. One project is based on the bushland area near Jerrara dam. This is an area in Kiama that has been worked on for many years by Neil Hawkins and landcare groups to re-establish native species and replant many of the trees that were harvested for timber in the settlement days. This arboretum will gain low-impact pathways, possible plant identifiers and bush regeneration. Eventually, the local community would like to see an outdoor classroom in this location.


The second project is in the Killalea State Park, part of the South Coast Network and established in consultation with the Shellharbour City Council. The rangers and training teams are well prepared and well structured for the benefit of the young people to be involved. This a missing link between two significant and iconic locations, Shellharbour village and Killalea, providing tourism outcomes and opportunities for local residents. This is a great connection between a built-up urban area and a spectacular passive environmental area with famous surfing beaches.


In the Shoalhaven, we need urgent riverbank treatment to prevent further flood scouring and to maintain the land mass between farmland, a road reserve and Bolong Road, which is an alternative route for the South Coast when the Princes Highway is closed due to accidents. This project will have the combined efforts of council, farm owners, Rivercare and businesses, all working with the Green Army for a great outcome. A second Shoalhaven project in Lake Conjola builds on the original work carried out by a similar program more than 20 years ago, but the work was not completed. The foreshore needs repair and extensive replanting is required to protect the edge and preserve the area. 


The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 has a multitude of benefits for many, initially by allowing the appropriate financial set-up and support systems so that it is responsible in the way the taxpayer dollar is used and, more importantly, by allowing young people who wish to engage with their community to have an opportunity to learn work skills and team contribution and to build self-esteem. At the same time, the community will gain from the human potential being expressed and the improvement to an environmental asset. There would be very few who would not recognise the amazing potential of this scheme, particularly in a regional area with significant levels of youth unemployment.


It is important with this bill that we ensure that the young participants will be in receipt of a single scheme of taxpayer financial support. The Green Army allowance is a great way to assist these young people while they get involved in a program that already has a proven record of success in Gilmore. The only possibly disappointing part of this program is the dark cloud developing from those members sitting opposite and their colleagues in the Senate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might ask why this is the case. The Green Army Program is part of a suite of changes that will allow young people the right to get training and participate in a great community project. It is possible that those on the other side of this chamber may choose to block these changes in the Senate. They may put their political agenda as the most important task they have in this House rather than the welfare of our unemployed youth.


For six months now, I have witnessed legislation placed before the members opposite that had some incorporated Labor commitments that were stated and advertised before the last election. Yes, I did say we have taken some of their commitments into our own legislative agenda. What is the reason for my concern? Those opposite have rejected these very pieces of legislation in the Senate. There is absolutely no consistency at all. As a new member of parliament, I find this somewhat confusing. We are 150 representatives for our nation and I believe we are here for the overall betterment of Australia. One of the most significant issues for us all is, of course, youth unemployment.


Many Australians who are usually not too interested in politics are also confused. We have all been waiting for the Senate and those opposite to realise that they actually lost the election. The overall vote in Australia told us that the everyday Aussie wanted a change in direction. We went to the election with a very explicit set of commitments. The Australian voters have put their faith in us to fix what we all saw as a nation in decline. Signals such as debt climbing to levels never seen before, unemployment by Labor's own estimates set to increase and policies made on the hop with little thought as to the consequences all made Australians vote for change.


The Green Army Program is symbolic of this change. It is environmentally worthy. It offers personal growth for many unemployed youth to re-engage with the community at so many different levels, and it is part of a legislative program for change. There are many groups in Gilmore eagerly awaiting the rollout of this program. In fact, there are community groups that have given me additional possibilities for other sites where this program would work and work well. The projects in Shellharbour, Kiama and the Shoalhaven will most likely address the needs of some of our Indigenous youth who have yet to gain employment. In particular, our Indigenous young people find it a great way to mix with other members of the community. The level of cooperation between young people of many different experiences and backgrounds who have never before worked together or socialised is heart-warming.


We as a community need projects like the Green Army to engage youth, to grow their potential and capitalise on their ability to really get involved, which is very often their most important desire. I wonder if those in opposition have any idea how projects such as the Green Army will change the lives of these young people, build their self-belief and reinforce to the community at large that they have the potential to give back to their nation, that they are wonderful contributors and that they are valuable and worth our every effort to re-engage. We owe these young people our assistance in the construction of their self-belief, as they acknowledge their own value and growing confidence. We owe it to them to help them to stop living in a holding pattern of unemployment and disengagement. In so many cases this can lead to social isolation, depression and other mental illness behaviours. I wonder if those opposite have the courage to put aside their political agenda for the sake of our youth. The moral fibre here is to look after our young people rather than look after our own political position. Surely, that is our task, first and foremost. Will those opposite cast doubt, yet again, on such a great initiative? Will they finally decide that, for the greater good of our nation, they should allow this legislation to actually pass in the Senate?


Perhaps it is also time for those opposite to acknowledge that pure ideology is no justification for their 'no' position on the repeals of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent taxâ€”both of which are impacting on the ability of businesses to offer employment. This impact is not just on our youth but also on other people unable to find employment, although they truly do want to work. These two taxes increase input costs on business, slowing growth and reducing the bottom lineâ€”both of which are reducing potential employment. Our youth, our Australian families and our businesses are all experiencing the negative fallout from the political posturing of those opposite. Our government as a whole owes to the people of Australia stability and a positive financial outlook that will lead to opportunities in employment.


The Green Army is a very symbolic example of a program that encapsulates optimism for the future. We have a difficult legacy to overcome, and the Green Army is one step in addressing youth unemployment. That should be a priority for us all. Previous speakers referred to the naivety of this program. I invite all of you to come to Gilmore to see the successful evidence of the work done. Talk to our Rivercare and Landcare groups rather than spruiking ill-informed opinions. Come and see with your own eyes and talk to the supervisors, who cannot wait to see the program reintroduced. I commend this bill.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (20:39):  I rise today to support the amendment moved by the member of Port Adelaide to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014, which is before the House. The fundamentals of this program are, after all, very much part of Labor's heritage, stretching back more than 20 years to a Keating government initiative introduced in 1992. The program, then called the Landcare and Environment Action Program, or LEAP, focused on providing work opportunities for young people and fostering good environmental outcomes. These are core Labor values, and we are proud to have supported this program through its various iterations under the governments of the last 20 years. While Labor continues to support the Green Army initiative in principle, the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide is absolutely needed to broaden debate on this bill to allow much wider discussion than one focused solely on social security entitlements. This debate needs to address a wide range of issues, including how participants are protected if injured, what training is or should be provided, what supports will be provided to assist people to actually make the transition into ongoing employment and what risks there are for displacement of existing workers. It is only prudent to do so.


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. We know well the dignity that comes from having a job. Every individual who can work should be given that chance. But we know that can only happen with appropriate support and protection. Regretfully, the government, as expected by the people whom I represent in Newcastle, has not laid out the detail required for a proper analysis or discussion of this program. If we take a look at this program from the point of view of it being perhaps an environmental initiative, then we really need to look at this government's environmental record, because this government lacks all credibility when it comes to the environment. Its record in just six short months is truly astounding. From climate change to heritage icons, from conservation to shark culls, it is wreaking havoc across the whole portfolio. One is left wondering if this government is looking to send the Environment portfolio the same way as Science, and obliterate it from the government benches altogether.


Soon after coming to office, the Abbott government began rushing through a series of highly controversy environmental approvals. While rubber-stamping approvals that actually endangered our environment, the government also missed important opportunities to protect it, like with the disallowance of the endangered community listing of the River Murray from the Darling to the sea. The government also went against all reason and advice and sneakily had the world's largest marine reserve system reproclaimed to undo the management plans that give it effect. The management plans for the marine reserves were based on extensive scientific analysis and informed by serious community and industry consultation. Twenty years of hard workâ€”work that started under the Keating Labor government and, indeed, continued under John Howardâ€”is all now thrown out the window. Not satisfied with the effective abolition of Australia's marine reserve system, the Abbott government has also begun the process of handing over extensive environmental approval powers to the states, giving Campbell Newman control over the Great Barrier Reef and allowing Colin Barnett to reign over the Ningaloo Reef. Environmental sites of national significance are now being controlled by state based interestsâ€”an act that flies in the face of all common sense and good practice.


This government has also all but abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York region added to the World Heritage List and has approved every request for development in the Great Barrier Reef catchment that has landed on the minister's desk. It has given these approvals despite UNESCO threatening to list the Great Barrier Reef as being in danger. But it does not end there. Sharks in Western Australia are on this government's hit list, too, with the minister approving an exemption to the WA government to allow drum lining off the coast despite the complete lack of evidence that it will have any effect in reducing shark attacks. It is not just members on this side of the House that are against the shark cull. The member for Bowman also publicly called for a hold on shark culling. When originally approving the initial cull, the environment minister used a mechanism designed for national security issues to do so. This is all despite the fact that more people die from bee stings each year in Australia than shark attacks. This Abbott government is systematically destroying our international reputation on the environment. In fact, that is how it won its first award. In November last year, the government won the Climate Action Network's international 'Colossal Fossil of the Year Award'. I read from the network's website an explanation of the awarding of the fossil:


The new Australian Government has won its first major international award â€“ the Colossal Fossil. The delegation came here with legislation in its back pocket to repeal the carbon price, failed to take independent advice to increase its carbon pollution reduction target and has been blocking progress in the loss and damage negotiations. Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi!


To wrap up their impressive environmental record, most recently the government has approached the World Heritage Committee to de-list 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, while the new Liberal Premier of Tasmania has promised to tear up the Tasmanian forest agreement. This is a devastating outcome for the Tasmanian economy as well as the environment, and this government's record on the environment is shameful by any reckoning. It is this government to which we will be entrusting our young people for the Green Army Program. The government has been entrusted with one of the greatest honours in public life: to protect and promote Australia's magnificent natural assets. Instead it is intent on destroying them, and the Prime Minister is not embarrassed for the whole world to know what he is doing.


But let us have a look at whether this program is in fact intended to be a form of labour employment program. We need to have a look at issues of protection for workers health and safety, workers comp and rehabilitation. We on this side of the House think that the bill in question today does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme, namely in the areas of workplace health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. If the government were truly concerned about these matters, they would ensure that the participants are deemed employees and, as such, are covered by a range of Commonwealth laws, including the Fair Work Act, the Work Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


Given the bill provides alarming exemptions from those acts, it is imperative that the consequences of such exemptions be considered in detailâ€”detail that is yet to be presented. This government makes a point that people are to be paid a comparable training wage. If that is the case then why are participants not treated as workers? Like everything, Australians are right to be suspicious of the motives of this government. The government has made clear that health and safety and looking after those who need help to get back on their feet are not priorities.


The government is also seeking to deceive the Australian public into believing that this is an environmental program, because they do not have a coherent environmental policy. But make no mistake: this is an employment program and, as such, participants should be treated as employees. We acknowledge that the Green Army participants will be paid at the equivalent of a training wage, which while not overly generous will be more than the income support payments that many of them would likely be on. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training and education. But, unlike trainees or apprentices, participants in the Green Army are under the supervision of the Commonwealth. Denying them the status of Commonwealth employee leaves them in a no-man's land in terms of employer-employee relationships, which afford a range of workplace rights.


A further concern of Labor is the concept of additionality or the potential to displace existing workers from other agencies and organisations. The government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other organisations and authorities that their employees will not be displaced and they will not rely upon Green Army participants to do their work. This is a very real concern. I have noticed in our own community the shedding of jobs in local government and the influx of volunteers doing a whole range of local government work. That is something that we need to be particularly mindful of. Volunteers are to be congratulated for the outstanding work they do in communities, but this should not be at the expense of displacing people in paid work. There is simply no justification for a program like the Green Army that can provide employment pathways if the participants then go on to displace existing workers. The pathways provided need to be new jobs, not supplementing good jobs that already exist. This potential displacement needs to be addressed by the government in its design of the program. We currently have no detail to give us confidence that this will not occur.


This amendment to the social security legislation as proposed by the government omits much of the detail related to workers rights, benefits and protection. The associated statement of requirements is equally thin on detail. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, causes great hardship to individuals, their families and their communities. Entrenched unemployment also undermines the economic strength of Australia. Labor believes in helping people to get a job through the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the appropriate level of support. I must digress slightly and emphasise that this is another reason why Labor is such a strong supporter of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the statement of requirements as an optional component of the program to be negotiated with each participant. That is right: optional registered training. This gives no confidence that participants will actually gain access to training.


The government is seriously short on detail when it comes to the training components of the Green Army Program. In which vocations and skill sets will training be provided to participants? Are these areas that have been identified by the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency as areas of emerging future skill needs? If they have not been identified as areas of emerging or future need, why have these been selected as priority areas of the government?


Labor supports providing training to young people but believes that this training should be aimed at providing them with marketable skills that are in demand by employers. In May 2011, AWPA identified a number of areas of emerging future skill needs in the green and energy efficiency skills sector in their report Energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings: jobs and skills implications. AWPA identified that energy efficiency initiatives call for jobs and skills in auditing and reporting, installation and maintenance of energy efficient appliances to meet revised building standards, assessment of new and existing buildings against rating systems, monitoring data output from energy management systems, tuning buildings for peak performance, marketing new and existing buildings in both commercial and residential sectors and drawing up green leases. In the green and energy efficiency skills sector, we have the opportunity to ensure that Australians have the skills to contribute to our response to the challenges of environmental sustainability. The government has a real opportunity to provide our young people with jobs for the future in this area and to provide a pathway from training to employment in this emerging industry. The training provided to young people needs to be accredited, it needs to have quality assurance, it needs to be meaningful and not just tick-a-box training. There is no work experience better than paid employment in a real workplace with serious support mechanisms to ensure all young people get to reach their full potential.


Labor believes that environmental based work and training programs can be an effective pathway to work for many job seekers, as well as providing environmental benefits. Workplace training programs have the potential, if well designed and implemented, to achieve these twin goals. If we do not address youth unemployment, there will be massive future costsâ€”not just in terms of welfare and social support, but also in terms of an individual's lost opportunity.


Just last month I raised in this place the concerning youth unemployment issues faced in my electorate of Newcastle and more broadly across the country. Proper, needs-based school funding, university and training opportunities are all issues that this government is not taking seriously.


Real employment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable communities and economic development. Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. Every individual who can work should be given that chance, but that can happen only with appropriate support. The government needs to entrust the Australian people with details of its Green Army program. We deserve nothing less.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (20:54):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Program) Bill 2014. It is a great pleasure to make a contribution on this very important piece of legislation. The Green Army says much about our government's commitment to the environment, to real and practical environmental programs, and to investing in skills and training for young people. 


In my first speech in this place, I spoke of the importance of caring for the environment for me and for the people of my electorate. Corangamite is a beautiful part of the world. It includes incredible coastline, surf beaches, national parks, precious creeks, rivers, rainforests, rolling farmland and of course the mighty Great Ocean Road. Many people move to my electorate because of their love of the environment. In my first speech I said that the Liberal Party has a strong tradition of practical environmentalism. It was the coalition which established stage 1 of Kakadu National Park and ended whaling in Australia. It was the coalition which put the Great Barrier Reef on a sustainable footing a decade ago. We are now delivering a 15,000-strong Green Army and tackling climate change. I commit myself to being a passionate defender of our precious environment.


In the contributions we have heard tonight from the member for Parramatta and the member for Newcastle, it was quite incredible that they said we must do everything to address youth unemployment. What do they think this scheme is? This scheme is about investing in young people, building pride, giving young people the opportunity to work in a team and to learn new skills. It is a very positive scheme with very important safeguards, which members opposite seem to be ignoring. Perhaps it indicates that those opposite do not really understand what it is like to be young and unemployed, because sometimes it is really tough to get your first job in full-time paid employment.




Dr Chalmers:
  And you do?




Ms HENDERSON:
  I will tell you what I know. I travel around my electorate. I speak to lots of young people in my electorate in Colac, in Belmont and in the federal electorate of Corio. I can see the impact that this is having on young people. Through this scheme we are valuing young people. We are helping to build pride, we are helping to give them skills because for so many people, under the previous federal government, they sat there day without a job! This is a scheme that is positive, this is a scheme that we are proud of. 


The Green Army will make a real difference to the environment and to the local communities in my electorate. As I mentioned, it will be a 15,000-strong Green Army by 2018â€”the largest standing environmental workforce in Australia's history. It will recruit local people aged 17 to 24 to give them the hands-on experience, the skills, the training to boost their employment prospects. Up to nine eligible participants will work on one project with at least one team supervisor. It is a very substantial commitment of $300 million over four years. The government will provide an additional $222 million in 2017-18 and $289 million in 2018-19. 


In my electorate of Corangamite, we are very excited by four Green Army projects that were announced prior to the electionâ€”in Lorne, in Apollo Bay, in Colac and in Queenscliff. The project in Queenscliff is a really good example of why members opposite have got this so wrong. This is not about replacing people in work; this is about creating new opportunities. In Queenscliff there is a real problem with the foreshore. The local council could not get funding, so we have committed the money required to completely rejuvenate the foreshore and to build a boardwalk. In fact it was such a problem that a local, Alistair Lang, who runs the local IGA, started a petition and raised 1,000 signatures in his supermarket. People were so upset about the state of the foreshore and I really do commend the work of Alistair Lang and the many others who joined forces to say, 'We want some action'. We are delivering. 



I also want to commend the Borough of Queenscliff, who has worked so hard to pull together plans to rejuvenate the foreshore as well as the Bellarine Catchment Network and the Swan Bay Environment Network. Queenscliff is a wonderful historic town with so much to offer and the rejuvenation of their foreshore will make an enormous difference. Also, in Lorne, there will be a major project at the Lorne St George River tramway track to the west of Point Grey. Before reliable road transport emerged in the 1930s, it was an extensive tramway network which enabled heavy loads to beâ€” (Time expired)

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (20:25):  This bill for an act to amend the law relating to social security for related purposes opens the door of opportunity for the Green Army projects to be rolled out. The Green Army is a hands-on, practical, grassroots environmental action program that supports local environment and heritage conservation projects across Australia. Young Australians aged 17 to 24 will have a chance to gain training and experience in environmental and heritage conservation fields, and explore careers in conservation management. Our youth will build on their levels of self-confidence, while participating in projects that generate real benefits for the Australian environment.


Green Army teams of 10, up to nine participants and one team supervisor, will be working across the country to help local communities deliver local outcomes. The Green Army Programme is ongoing, and initially up to $300 million is available over three years from 1 July 2014. The program will support 250 projects this year, 500 in 2015-16, and 750 in 2016-17. We have heard that those opposite see this proposal as a way of displacing existing workers. There is apparently considerable confusion on the other side about the program rollout. These Green Army projects are not a part of the existing project line-up of works for councils, but are additional wish list projects that currently have no money for labour.


The previous Green Corps projects were extremely well coordinated, with an excellent array of courses that equipped young people with skills and a work ethic that enabled them to enter the workforce, and many of them did. This is not designed to be a direct work pathway, but more importantly it is a preparation to be work ready, to be work motivated, and to have a successful outcome behind them so they have something to build on for their future. In no way is the Green Army a substitute workforce, and to interpret this legislation in that way is just wrong. Those opposite even refer to these young people as volunteers. One of the previous speakers used this exact term. These young people are not workers, they are volunteers, and as a consequence there are different regimes that support this scheme.


The previous schemes were effective and successful, trying not to be distracted by red tape implications. This legislation is about people and human capacity. This truly is a value for money initiative, with overlapping benefits. A sound approach to our future is to have different portfolios overlap for increased benefit. So how do we evaluate the interaction between youth initiatives that build self esteem, the environmental benefit, and the economic benefit of the future? To coldly dismiss the human capacity of our unemployed youth is callous at best, and discriminatory at worst. Environmental repair does not have to be done solely by experts. In fact some catchment management authorities actively advise that bush regeneration can be achieved in overgrazed paddocks by simply closing the gates.


Green Army participants will most likely be engaged full-time for around about 30 hours per week on a project, and they will undertake formal training in areas such as work readiness, conservation and land management, heritage conservation, leadership, project and human resource management, and trades. Where possible the young people who are part of this scheme will be assisted to obtain Certificate I or Certificate II qualifications. Extra units may also be undertaken towards more advanced levels. All participants will be paid an allowance.


The concept of a group of young people working on an environmental project for community benefit is not new to Gilmore. In the past there were a number of very successful Green Corps projects. Many of the mangroves and casuarinas on the banks of the Shoalhaven River are testimony to the great work that was done. Over the last years, Charlie Weir has become the celebrated mangrove man, working as an amazing volunteer to continue this work, growing and planting seedlings to prevent riverbank erosion since the program was shut down by the previous government. The Rivercare group are eagerly awaiting the resumption of this great program. 


Some of the participants from those earlier programs found a love of the outdoors, going on to get work on golf courses, with landscape businesses and bush regeneration projects, and even treating noxious weeds. But, overall, the self-esteem developed by these young people is beyond financial measure. The skills learned then are also expected from the new programs, including the development of effective workplace communication and the development of confidence and motivation to remain strongly connected to the community and community service activities. This is an opportunity to develop a work ethic, including team work, and achieve a level of personal positive growth. These are practical skills and attributes that are relevant to gaining ongoing employment, and the training options are some of the best foundations for future work. The additional aspects of the Green Army projects where planning, problem solving and progress review are essential will always stand these young people in good stead for future employment. In addition, they will have a chance to develop a network of industry contacts, training providers and community members. These provide opportunities for ongoing employment and training, assisting them to make informed career and work choices into their future based on the experiences gained from the project.


Gilmore already has a commitment for four Green Army projects and I will be proud to see them start in the new financial year. One project is based on the bushland area near Jerrara dam. This is an area in Kiama that has been worked on for many years by Neil Hawkins and landcare groups to re-establish native species and replant many of the trees that were harvested for timber in the settlement days. This arboretum will gain low-impact pathways, possible plant identifiers and bush regeneration. Eventually, the local community would like to see an outdoor classroom in this location.


The second project is in the Killalea State Park, part of the South Coast Network and established in consultation with the Shellharbour City Council. The rangers and training teams are well prepared and well structured for the benefit of the young people to be involved. This a missing link between two significant and iconic locations, Shellharbour village and Killalea, providing tourism outcomes and opportunities for local residents. This is a great connection between a built-up urban area and a spectacular passive environmental area with famous surfing beaches.


In the Shoalhaven, we need urgent riverbank treatment to prevent further flood scouring and to maintain the land mass between farmland, a road reserve and Bolong Road, which is an alternative route for the South Coast when the Princes Highway is closed due to accidents. This project will have the combined efforts of council, farm owners, Rivercare and businesses, all working with the Green Army for a great outcome. A second Shoalhaven project in Lake Conjola builds on the original work carried out by a similar program more than 20 years ago, but the work was not completed. The foreshore needs repair and extensive replanting is required to protect the edge and preserve the area. 


The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 has a multitude of benefits for many, initially by allowing the appropriate financial set-up and support systems so that it is responsible in the way the taxpayer dollar is used and, more importantly, by allowing young people who wish to engage with their community to have an opportunity to learn work skills and team contribution and to build self-esteem. At the same time, the community will gain from the human potential being expressed and the improvement to an environmental asset. There would be very few who would not recognise the amazing potential of this scheme, particularly in a regional area with significant levels of youth unemployment.


It is important with this bill that we ensure that the young participants will be in receipt of a single scheme of taxpayer financial support. The Green Army allowance is a great way to assist these young people while they get involved in a program that already has a proven record of success in Gilmore. The only possibly disappointing part of this program is the dark cloud developing from those members sitting opposite and their colleagues in the Senate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might ask why this is the case. The Green Army Program is part of a suite of changes that will allow young people the right to get training and participate in a great community project. It is possible that those on the other side of this chamber may choose to block these changes in the Senate. They may put their political agenda as the most important task they have in this House rather than the welfare of our unemployed youth.


For six months now, I have witnessed legislation placed before the members opposite that had some incorporated Labor commitments that were stated and advertised before the last election. Yes, I did say we have taken some of their commitments into our own legislative agenda. What is the reason for my concern? Those opposite have rejected these very pieces of legislation in the Senate. There is absolutely no consistency at all. As a new member of parliament, I find this somewhat confusing. We are 150 representatives for our nation and I believe we are here for the overall betterment of Australia. One of the most significant issues for us all is, of course, youth unemployment.


Many Australians who are usually not too interested in politics are also confused. We have all been waiting for the Senate and those opposite to realise that they actually lost the election. The overall vote in Australia told us that the everyday Aussie wanted a change in direction. We went to the election with a very explicit set of commitments. The Australian voters have put their faith in us to fix what we all saw as a nation in decline. Signals such as debt climbing to levels never seen before, unemployment by Labor's own estimates set to increase and policies made on the hop with little thought as to the consequences all made Australians vote for change.


The Green Army Program is symbolic of this change. It is environmentally worthy. It offers personal growth for many unemployed youth to re-engage with the community at so many different levels, and it is part of a legislative program for change. There are many groups in Gilmore eagerly awaiting the rollout of this program. In fact, there are community groups that have given me additional possibilities for other sites where this program would work and work well. The projects in Shellharbour, Kiama and the Shoalhaven will most likely address the needs of some of our Indigenous youth who have yet to gain employment. In particular, our Indigenous young people find it a great way to mix with other members of the community. The level of cooperation between young people of many different experiences and backgrounds who have never before worked together or socialised is heart-warming.


We as a community need projects like the Green Army to engage youth, to grow their potential and capitalise on their ability to really get involved, which is very often their most important desire. I wonder if those in opposition have any idea how projects such as the Green Army will change the lives of these young people, build their self-belief and reinforce to the community at large that they have the potential to give back to their nation, that they are wonderful contributors and that they are valuable and worth our every effort to re-engage. We owe these young people our assistance in the construction of their self-belief, as they acknowledge their own value and growing confidence. We owe it to them to help them to stop living in a holding pattern of unemployment and disengagement. In so many cases this can lead to social isolation, depression and other mental illness behaviours. I wonder if those opposite have the courage to put aside their political agenda for the sake of our youth. The moral fibre here is to look after our young people rather than look after our own political position. Surely, that is our task, first and foremost. Will those opposite cast doubt, yet again, on such a great initiative? Will they finally decide that, for the greater good of our nation, they should allow this legislation to actually pass in the Senate?


Perhaps it is also time for those opposite to acknowledge that pure ideology is no justification for their 'no' position on the repeals of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent taxâ€”both of which are impacting on the ability of businesses to offer employment. This impact is not just on our youth but also on other people unable to find employment, although they truly do want to work. These two taxes increase input costs on business, slowing growth and reducing the bottom lineâ€”both of which are reducing potential employment. Our youth, our Australian families and our businesses are all experiencing the negative fallout from the political posturing of those opposite. Our government as a whole owes to the people of Australia stability and a positive financial outlook that will lead to opportunities in employment.


The Green Army is a very symbolic example of a program that encapsulates optimism for the future. We have a difficult legacy to overcome, and the Green Army is one step in addressing youth unemployment. That should be a priority for us all. Previous speakers referred to the naivety of this program. I invite all of you to come to Gilmore to see the successful evidence of the work done. Talk to our Rivercare and Landcare groups rather than spruiking ill-informed opinions. Come and see with your own eyes and talk to the supervisors, who cannot wait to see the program reintroduced. I commend this bill.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (20:39):  I rise today to support the amendment moved by the member of Port Adelaide to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014, which is before the House. The fundamentals of this program are, after all, very much part of Labor's heritage, stretching back more than 20 years to a Keating government initiative introduced in 1992. The program, then called the Landcare and Environment Action Program, or LEAP, focused on providing work opportunities for young people and fostering good environmental outcomes. These are core Labor values, and we are proud to have supported this program through its various iterations under the governments of the last 20 years. While Labor continues to support the Green Army initiative in principle, the amendment moved by the member for Port Adelaide is absolutely needed to broaden debate on this bill to allow much wider discussion than one focused solely on social security entitlements. This debate needs to address a wide range of issues, including how participants are protected if injured, what training is or should be provided, what supports will be provided to assist people to actually make the transition into ongoing employment and what risks there are for displacement of existing workers. It is only prudent to do so.


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. We know well the dignity that comes from having a job. Every individual who can work should be given that chance. But we know that can only happen with appropriate support and protection. Regretfully, the government, as expected by the people whom I represent in Newcastle, has not laid out the detail required for a proper analysis or discussion of this program. If we take a look at this program from the point of view of it being perhaps an environmental initiative, then we really need to look at this government's environmental record, because this government lacks all credibility when it comes to the environment. Its record in just six short months is truly astounding. From climate change to heritage icons, from conservation to shark culls, it is wreaking havoc across the whole portfolio. One is left wondering if this government is looking to send the Environment portfolio the same way as Science, and obliterate it from the government benches altogether.


Soon after coming to office, the Abbott government began rushing through a series of highly controversy environmental approvals. While rubber-stamping approvals that actually endangered our environment, the government also missed important opportunities to protect it, like with the disallowance of the endangered community listing of the River Murray from the Darling to the sea. The government also went against all reason and advice and sneakily had the world's largest marine reserve system reproclaimed to undo the management plans that give it effect. The management plans for the marine reserves were based on extensive scientific analysis and informed by serious community and industry consultation. Twenty years of hard workâ€”work that started under the Keating Labor government and, indeed, continued under John Howardâ€”is all now thrown out the window. Not satisfied with the effective abolition of Australia's marine reserve system, the Abbott government has also begun the process of handing over extensive environmental approval powers to the states, giving Campbell Newman control over the Great Barrier Reef and allowing Colin Barnett to reign over the Ningaloo Reef. Environmental sites of national significance are now being controlled by state based interestsâ€”an act that flies in the face of all common sense and good practice.


This government has also all but abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York region added to the World Heritage List and has approved every request for development in the Great Barrier Reef catchment that has landed on the minister's desk. It has given these approvals despite UNESCO threatening to list the Great Barrier Reef as being in danger. But it does not end there. Sharks in Western Australia are on this government's hit list, too, with the minister approving an exemption to the WA government to allow drum lining off the coast despite the complete lack of evidence that it will have any effect in reducing shark attacks. It is not just members on this side of the House that are against the shark cull. The member for Bowman also publicly called for a hold on shark culling. When originally approving the initial cull, the environment minister used a mechanism designed for national security issues to do so. This is all despite the fact that more people die from bee stings each year in Australia than shark attacks. This Abbott government is systematically destroying our international reputation on the environment. In fact, that is how it won its first award. In November last year, the government won the Climate Action Network's international 'Colossal Fossil of the Year Award'. I read from the network's website an explanation of the awarding of the fossil:


The new Australian Government has won its first major international award â€“ the Colossal Fossil. The delegation came here with legislation in its back pocket to repeal the carbon price, failed to take independent advice to increase its carbon pollution reduction target and has been blocking progress in the loss and damage negotiations. Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi!


To wrap up their impressive environmental record, most recently the government has approached the World Heritage Committee to de-list 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, while the new Liberal Premier of Tasmania has promised to tear up the Tasmanian forest agreement. This is a devastating outcome for the Tasmanian economy as well as the environment, and this government's record on the environment is shameful by any reckoning. It is this government to which we will be entrusting our young people for the Green Army Program. The government has been entrusted with one of the greatest honours in public life: to protect and promote Australia's magnificent natural assets. Instead it is intent on destroying them, and the Prime Minister is not embarrassed for the whole world to know what he is doing.


But let us have a look at whether this program is in fact intended to be a form of labour employment program. We need to have a look at issues of protection for workers health and safety, workers comp and rehabilitation. We on this side of the House think that the bill in question today does not provide adequate protections for participants in the Green Army scheme, namely in the areas of workplace health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. If the government were truly concerned about these matters, they would ensure that the participants are deemed employees and, as such, are covered by a range of Commonwealth laws, including the Fair Work Act, the Work Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


Given the bill provides alarming exemptions from those acts, it is imperative that the consequences of such exemptions be considered in detailâ€”detail that is yet to be presented. This government makes a point that people are to be paid a comparable training wage. If that is the case then why are participants not treated as workers? Like everything, Australians are right to be suspicious of the motives of this government. The government has made clear that health and safety and looking after those who need help to get back on their feet are not priorities.


The government is also seeking to deceive the Australian public into believing that this is an environmental program, because they do not have a coherent environmental policy. But make no mistake: this is an employment program and, as such, participants should be treated as employees. We acknowledge that the Green Army participants will be paid at the equivalent of a training wage, which while not overly generous will be more than the income support payments that many of them would likely be on. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training and education. But, unlike trainees or apprentices, participants in the Green Army are under the supervision of the Commonwealth. Denying them the status of Commonwealth employee leaves them in a no-man's land in terms of employer-employee relationships, which afford a range of workplace rights.


A further concern of Labor is the concept of additionality or the potential to displace existing workers from other agencies and organisations. The government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other organisations and authorities that their employees will not be displaced and they will not rely upon Green Army participants to do their work. This is a very real concern. I have noticed in our own community the shedding of jobs in local government and the influx of volunteers doing a whole range of local government work. That is something that we need to be particularly mindful of. Volunteers are to be congratulated for the outstanding work they do in communities, but this should not be at the expense of displacing people in paid work. There is simply no justification for a program like the Green Army that can provide employment pathways if the participants then go on to displace existing workers. The pathways provided need to be new jobs, not supplementing good jobs that already exist. This potential displacement needs to be addressed by the government in its design of the program. We currently have no detail to give us confidence that this will not occur.


This amendment to the social security legislation as proposed by the government omits much of the detail related to workers rights, benefits and protection. The associated statement of requirements is equally thin on detail. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, causes great hardship to individuals, their families and their communities. Entrenched unemployment also undermines the economic strength of Australia. Labor believes in helping people to get a job through the right training, work experience, incentives and, most importantly, the appropriate level of support. I must digress slightly and emphasise that this is another reason why Labor is such a strong supporter of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the statement of requirements as an optional component of the program to be negotiated with each participant. That is right: optional registered training. This gives no confidence that participants will actually gain access to training.


The government is seriously short on detail when it comes to the training components of the Green Army Program. In which vocations and skill sets will training be provided to participants? Are these areas that have been identified by the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency as areas of emerging future skill needs? If they have not been identified as areas of emerging or future need, why have these been selected as priority areas of the government?


Labor supports providing training to young people but believes that this training should be aimed at providing them with marketable skills that are in demand by employers. In May 2011, AWPA identified a number of areas of emerging future skill needs in the green and energy efficiency skills sector in their report Energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings: jobs and skills implications. AWPA identified that energy efficiency initiatives call for jobs and skills in auditing and reporting, installation and maintenance of energy efficient appliances to meet revised building standards, assessment of new and existing buildings against rating systems, monitoring data output from energy management systems, tuning buildings for peak performance, marketing new and existing buildings in both commercial and residential sectors and drawing up green leases. In the green and energy efficiency skills sector, we have the opportunity to ensure that Australians have the skills to contribute to our response to the challenges of environmental sustainability. The government has a real opportunity to provide our young people with jobs for the future in this area and to provide a pathway from training to employment in this emerging industry. The training provided to young people needs to be accredited, it needs to have quality assurance, it needs to be meaningful and not just tick-a-box training. There is no work experience better than paid employment in a real workplace with serious support mechanisms to ensure all young people get to reach their full potential.


Labor believes that environmental based work and training programs can be an effective pathway to work for many job seekers, as well as providing environmental benefits. Workplace training programs have the potential, if well designed and implemented, to achieve these twin goals. If we do not address youth unemployment, there will be massive future costsâ€”not just in terms of welfare and social support, but also in terms of an individual's lost opportunity.


Just last month I raised in this place the concerning youth unemployment issues faced in my electorate of Newcastle and more broadly across the country. Proper, needs-based school funding, university and training opportunities are all issues that this government is not taking seriously.


Real employment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable communities and economic development. Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. Every individual who can work should be given that chance, but that can happen only with appropriate support. The government needs to entrust the Australian people with details of its Green Army program. We deserve nothing less.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (20:54):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Program) Bill 2014. It is a great pleasure to make a contribution on this very important piece of legislation. The Green Army says much about our government's commitment to the environment, to real and practical environmental programs, and to investing in skills and training for young people. 


In my first speech in this place, I spoke of the importance of caring for the environment for me and for the people of my electorate. Corangamite is a beautiful part of the world. It includes incredible coastline, surf beaches, national parks, precious creeks, rivers, rainforests, rolling farmland and of course the mighty Great Ocean Road. Many people move to my electorate because of their love of the environment. In my first speech I said that the Liberal Party has a strong tradition of practical environmentalism. It was the coalition which established stage 1 of Kakadu National Park and ended whaling in Australia. It was the coalition which put the Great Barrier Reef on a sustainable footing a decade ago. We are now delivering a 15,000-strong Green Army and tackling climate change. I commit myself to being a passionate defender of our precious environment.


In the contributions we have heard tonight from the member for Parramatta and the member for Newcastle, it was quite incredible that they said we must do everything to address youth unemployment. What do they think this scheme is? This scheme is about investing in young people, building pride, giving young people the opportunity to work in a team and to learn new skills. It is a very positive scheme with very important safeguards, which members opposite seem to be ignoring. Perhaps it indicates that those opposite do not really understand what it is like to be young and unemployed, because sometimes it is really tough to get your first job in full-time paid employment.




Dr Chalmers:
  And you do?




Ms HENDERSON:
  I will tell you what I know. I travel around my electorate. I speak to lots of young people in my electorate in Colac, in Belmont and in the federal electorate of Corio. I can see the impact that this is having on young people. Through this scheme we are valuing young people. We are helping to build pride, we are helping to give them skills because for so many people, under the previous federal government, they sat there day without a job! This is a scheme that is positive, this is a scheme that we are proud of. 


The Green Army will make a real difference to the environment and to the local communities in my electorate. As I mentioned, it will be a 15,000-strong Green Army by 2018â€”the largest standing environmental workforce in Australia's history. It will recruit local people aged 17 to 24 to give them the hands-on experience, the skills, the training to boost their employment prospects. Up to nine eligible participants will work on one project with at least one team supervisor. It is a very substantial commitment of $300 million over four years. The government will provide an additional $222 million in 2017-18 and $289 million in 2018-19. 


In my electorate of Corangamite, we are very excited by four Green Army projects that were announced prior to the electionâ€”in Lorne, in Apollo Bay, in Colac and in Queenscliff. The project in Queenscliff is a really good example of why members opposite have got this so wrong. This is not about replacing people in work; this is about creating new opportunities. In Queenscliff there is a real problem with the foreshore. The local council could not get funding, so we have committed the money required to completely rejuvenate the foreshore and to build a boardwalk. In fact it was such a problem that a local, Alistair Lang, who runs the local IGA, started a petition and raised 1,000 signatures in his supermarket. People were so upset about the state of the foreshore and I really do commend the work of Alistair Lang and the many others who joined forces to say, 'We want some action'. We are delivering. 



I also want to commend the Borough of Queenscliff, who has worked so hard to pull together plans to rejuvenate the foreshore as well as the Bellarine Catchment Network and the Swan Bay Environment Network. Queenscliff is a wonderful historic town with so much to offer and the rejuvenation of their foreshore will make an enormous difference. Also, in Lorne, there will be a major project at the Lorne St George River tramway track to the west of Point Grey. Before reliable road transport emerged in the 1930s, it was an extensive tramway network which enabled heavy loads to beâ€” (Time expired)

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (21:00):  Today my fellow co-convenor of the parliamentary friends of Palestine, the member for Reid; the convenor of the UN parliamentary group, the member for Fremantle; and I had the pleasure of hosting the launch of the United Nations Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. This commemorative year was initially launched at the beginning of the 2014 session of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People in January this year following a decision by the UN General Assembly on 26 November 2013 proclaiming 2014 as the Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and requesting that the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People organise activities throughout 2014 in cooperation with governments, relevant organisations of the United Nations system, intergovernment organisations and civil society organisations.


The objectives of the IYSPP are to promote solidarity with the Palestinian people as a central theme, contributing to international awareness of (a) core themes regarding the question of Palestine, obstacles to the ongoing peace process, particularly those requiring urgent action such as the settlements, the question of Jerusalem, the blockade of Gaza and the humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and (b) the mobilisation of global action towards the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting solution of the question of Palestine in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.


I welcome the UN Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. For many years now the Palestinian people have asked for the international community to stand with them to broker a just and lasting solution to this very protracted issue in the pursuit of peace and security for both sides to this conflict. The UN Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People is an opportunity for us as a parliament to look at how we can assist this process for the benefit of both the Israeli and Palestinian communities and also look at how Australia can effect a fair and balanced approach on this very important matter.


Today's launch here in Parliament House was attended by over 70 people, including members of parliament, senators, ambassadors, members of DFAT, members of the local Palestinian community and advocacy groups, as well as representatives from the international Australian charity the Global Gardens of Peace. Speakers included Ambassador Izzat Abdulhadi, the head of the General Delegation of Palestine to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific; Mr Christopher Woodthorpe, the Director of the United Nations Information Centre for Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific; and Bishop George Browning, the President of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network. It was a very successful event, which gave us all the opportunity to hear and exchange views on this very important issue.


On another matter related to the Palestinian issue, I would like to table a petition from Just Peace for Palestine Brisbane, which is a subgroup of Just Peace Queensland Inc. This advocacy group aims to raise awareness about the ongoing human rights violations in Palestine. I wish to table in parliament their petition of 747 signatures. This petition was considered at a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on Petitions and is certified as being in accordance with standing orders.




The petition read as followsâ€”



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of concerned citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the House the United Nations Children's Fund report released in February 2013 'Children in Israeli Military Detention'. UNICEF reports on ill treatment of children who come into contact with the Israeli military detention system. The report concludes that the ill-treatment of children within the military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process from the moment of arrest until the child's prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing.


We therefore ask the House to consider the UNICEF report and its recommendations and to report back to the Parliament on what actions will be taken by the Australian government to support Palestinian children suffering ill-treatment in Israeli military detention, in contravention of the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.


from 747 citizens


Petition received.




Ms VAMVAKINOU:
  Several countries have repeated these accusations in the UN General Assembly. For my part, and in conclusion, I hope the continuous efforts of those affected by the situation in Palestine will help the international community in brokering a peaceful and acceptable result for all. It is my hope, and certainly of those who attended this afternoon, that Australia will be on the right side of history and use its standing on the Security Council to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (10:30):  Yesterday I had the privilege of attending the program launch for the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, something I know the Deputy Speaker would be fond of. The Woodend Winter Arts Festival started 10 years ago. Over the June Queen's Birthday long weekend it brings together acclaimed Australian and international talent in music, literature and the arts. It also brings together the community of the stunning Macedon Ranges The result is a world-class showcase in the heart of Victoria's best food and wine region of both vibrant and traditional thought-provoking performances and events.


The Woodend Winter Arts Festival was the brainchild of local arts director Jacqueline Ogeil and the president of the committee, John O'Donnell. The committee was established in 2004 and the festival quickly became one of the hallmark events on the calendar for the arts in our region. The festival is held every year over the long weekend and brings some energy and warmth to a community which otherwise would be shivering in the dead of winter. It attracts over 5,000 visitors to the Macedon Ranges annually and has grown to a program of more than 30 events. The program involves music, such as the classics and jazz, and literature events, as well as a visual arts program. It brings together young and old through a series of free events in the community as well as through some paid events, which help fund the program annually. The festival's classical music program is broadcast annually over ABC Classic FM and also internationally through the European Broadcasting Union, which speaks volumes for the talent in the festival.


This year is a special year, as it celebrates the 10th anniversary of this festival. This year's program is one of the most ambitious yet. It will include opera, a string quartet from Vienna and a leading international cellist from Singapore, as well as a few favourites, including the Italian violinist David Monte. It is a rare opportunity to bring opera to the Macedon Ranges, and I am sure it will be a success.


The Bendigo electorate is home to a number of growing arts professionals, and the festival is one of our local success stories. With the right mix of commercial, public and community investment, our cultural industry will continue to grow. But funding for this festival is an ongoing struggle. Whilst we have the commercial and community investment, what we do not have is public investment. It is time for Regional Arts Victoria and Regional Arts Australia to get behind such fantastic festivals as the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, which, I am sure, this year will be another success.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (11:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes:


(a) Australia's co-sponsorship of the 2012 United Nations General Assembly Human Rights Council resolution calling on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of Sri Lanka and to take credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans;


(b) Australia's co-sponsorship of the 2013 United Nations General Assembly Human Rights Council resolution expressing concern at continuing reports of violations of human rights in Sri Lanka, and reiterating the call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the Commission's recommendations and to fulfil its commitment to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law;


(c) reports of continuing violations of human rights in Sri Lanka, intimidation of and reprisals against human rights defenders, members of civil society and journalists, threats to judicial independence and the rule of law, and a rapid rise in violence and discrimination on the basis of religion or belief in Sri Lanka; and


(d) the conclusion of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that national mechanisms have consistently failed to establish the truth and achieve justice in Sri Lanka, and her recommendation that the Human Rights Council establish an international inquiry mechanism to further investigate the alleged violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law and monitor any domestic accountability processes; and


(2) calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) maintain Australia's strong record of support for human rights at the 25th session of the Human Rights Council; and


(b) join with the United Kingdom, United States of America and other co-sponsoring nations and commit the Australian Government to the strongest possible support for draft Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/25/L.1.


In moving this motion I want to focus on Australia's strong record of supporting human rights and ensuring justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation. I would like to acknowledge the work of the shadow foreign minister, the member for Sydney, for her support of this motion and the commitment to human rights around the world and indeed of Australian governments of all political persuasions who have played their part in that process over the decades.


Three weeks ago I was joined by members of this parliament from all sides of politicsâ€”Labor, Liberal, the Greens, minor parties and independentsâ€”to discuss human rights in Sri Lanka with visiting Tamil National Alliance MP Mr MA Sumanthiran. I was extremely pleased to see such broad representation from Australia's parliament so present, something which highlights that this is an issue which indeed crosses political boundaries, and I note the advocacy of many members of the government on this issue, particularly the member for Reid.


This is a motion I have particularly pursued because my electorate of Greenway is home to a large Sri Lankan population. Many have fled persecution, had family members flee during the civil war or still have family living in an unreconciled homeland. Ultimate reconciliation of Sri Lanka and active accountability processes to acknowledge the injustices that were, and still are, occurring are therefore major concerns.


For some time now I have been on the record supporting the cause of human rights in Sri Lanka and accountability for atrocities committed by all sides in that conflict. I wish to stress, Deputy Speaker, that this is about reconciliation in terms of the acts of all sides of the conflict. I made this point to former foreign minister Bob Carr and expressed my preference for Australia to reconsider its involvement in the recent CHOGM event, but I was told of Australia's preference for engagement over isolationâ€”a perfectly valid preference, which I can respect. I made similar representations to the current foreign minister and I noted publicly that, while this was a decision consistent with Labor in office, my hope was that human rights would continue to be on Australia's agenda. So, this is now a process of engagement and, as such, I urge the Australian government to maintain Australia's strong record for the support of human rights in Sri Lanka at the upcoming 25th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. 


I also want to bring to the attention of the parliament that today a letter has gone to the Prime Minister from a number of eminent Australians across the political divide, including the Hon. John Dowd AO, QC, former New South Wales Attorney-General; the Hon. Gareth Evans; Malcolm Fraser; Owen Harries, the former Australian Ambassador to UNESCO; Geoffrey Robertson QC; and Gordon Weiss, the Adjunct Professor at Griffith University and founding adviser and consultant expert to the International Crimes Evidence Project. I quote one of the paragraphs in their letter:


This resolution is of real relevance to all citizens of Sri Lanka. Any credible investigation into violations committed by both sides would provide all Sri Lankan communities the space and environment to come to terms with crimes committed in their respective names. The Australian Government must support this resolution, as without meaningful truth, justice and accountability for the alleged crimes committed during the war, there will be no genuine opportunity to set Sri Lanka on the path to reconciliation and lasting peace.


The 2012 UN General Assembly Human Rights Council resolution called upon the government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of its Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and to take credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation is achieved for all Sri Lankans. Similarly, the 2013 UN General Assembly Human Rights Council resolution expressed concern over the continuing reports of violations of human rights in Sri Lanka. It called upon the government to implement the commission's recommendations for 2012 and to fulfil its commitment to investigate all allegations of violations of human rights law. I note that Australia was, rightly, a co-sponsor for both the 2012 and 2013 resolutions.


This motion calls upon the Australian government to honour our strong and proud record of support for human rights at the upcoming 25th session of the Human Rights Council. I note that the resolution entitled 'Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka' does recognise that some progress has been made in this respect. It calls upon the Sri Lankan government to continue to do this. It also reiterates that it take all necessary steps to fulfil its obligations under the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. 


I believe that accountability and transparency are crucial for reconciliation to be achieved in Sri Lanka. An important step towards this is an investigation into the atrocities performed by all sides during the civil war. The harrowing reports of further violence and violation of rights must be dealt with in a transparent and in-depth manner in order for genuine reconciliation to take place. I represent, as I said, a large population of people from a Sri Lankan homeland and they want nothing more than reconciliation in their homeland. I believe the Australian government should use this as a platform to promote it.




Ms Hall:
  I second the motion.

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-03-24,"



Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (11:05):  The coalition government is committed to international standards of human rights and takes seriously all allegations of abuse. As someone who served on Australia's initial deployments to Afghanistan and southern Iraq, and as a senior public servant managing our international defence relationships, I confirm that these issues are front of mind for our senior military officers and bureaucrats. I acknowledge the ongoing human rights concerns in Sri Lanka, on both sides of the civil conflict that ended in May 2009. I know that members of this House aspire to genuine reconciliation and a less violent future for the people of Sri Lanka. 


As history has repeatedly proven, governments are at the heart of genuine reconciliation. The Sri Lankan government is no different, and the terrible events on both sides of the conflict must be explored. That includes accountability for alleged crimes, as the member for Greenway says, by both sides of that conflict, both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan government. We further this aspiration by engaging the government of Sri Lanka, not isolating it. My career as a senior military officer and senior public servant working within the international system has repeatedly reinforced the value of working with states in relation to human rights, not shouting at them from the sidelines. 


Instead of finger-pointing from a distance, Australia raises issues of human rights directly with Sri Lanka's government and we remain in regular contact with political, official and community representatives on Sri Lankan issues here in Australia. Just a few weeks ago, on 5 March, foreign minister Bishop met Mr M.A. Sumanthiran, of the Tamil National Alliance, to hear his views. In the margins of CHOGM in Colombo last November, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Bishop raised human rights at the most senior levels of the Sri Lankan government. And in relation to our participation in CHOGM in Colombo, Bob Carr got that call absolutely right. Our high commission in Colombo regularly does the same, including, most recently, with the secretary of Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry about the 16 March arrest of Father Praveen and Ruki Fernando. We are very pleased to see that they have since been released. 


We continue at a variety of levels to urge the Sri Lankan government to give the highest priority to implementing the recommendations of its Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission process. As for co-sponsorship of the US-led resolution on Sri Lanka, this decision, as with all good policy decisions, will be based on due consideration of the final text and an evidence-based consideration of all factors. It is important to acknowledge the Sri Lankan government's progress on resettlement of internally displaced persons, de-mining and infrastructure development in the war-ravaged north and east. I note that Australia has provided an aid contribution for de-mining and reconstruction of housing and schools in these areas in the north and east of the country. 


The September 2013 Northern Province Council election, which was won by the Tamil National Alliance, was an important step forward. A political settlement between the central government and the Tamil community is critical for reconciliation. Properly implemented, Sri Lanka's commission of inquiry on disappearances which was established late last year will also be an important contributor to accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Transparency, inclusivity and early progress with concrete results will be key for such a large and difficult undertaking.


So at every level of our polity and of our bureaucracy, our engagement with countries like Sri Lanka both bilaterally and in multilateral forums assists in taking that process of reconciliation forward, and we do that most effectively when we participate. Throughout my career I have found that furthering the cause of good governance, furthering the cause of strengthened institutional structures in countries in our region, is best accomplished from within than without. I know that I join every member of this House in wishing the Sri Lankan people the reconciliation and brighter future they deserve.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydneyâ€”Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11:10):  I rise today to speak in support of reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka and I commend my colleague the member for Greenway on her motion. On a visit to Sri Lanka last year the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that after a vicious and debilitating 27-year conflict the fighting is over but suffering is not. The high commissioner has consistently reiterated the need for a full, transparent and impartial investigation into a conflict that saw numerous war crimes and other violations committed by both sides.


The situation in Sri Lanka following the decades long war has been the subject of Human Rights Council resolutions in 2012 and 2013 and in both instances, in 2012 and 2013, Australia supported the Human Rights Council resolutions. In these resolutions the United Nations urged the government of Sri Lanka to adopt the findings and recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The commission's recommendations highlight the need to credibly investigate allegations of extrajudicial killings and disappearances; demilitarise the north of Sri Lanka; implement land dispute resolution mechanisms; re-evaluate detention policies; strengthen civil institutions; reach a settlement on the devolution of power to the provinces; promote and protect freedom of expression; and, finally, enact rule of law reforms.


This week the UN Human Rights Council will again consider a report on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka including through an independent international investigation into violations and abuses of human rights by both parties in Sri Lanka. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has acknowledged the progress made by the government of Sri Lanka since 2009 in relation to de-mining, resettlement and reconstruction and rehabilitation. The high commissioner has also welcomed the elections to the Northern Provincial Council in 2013. Likewise, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons also acknowledged what he described as the government's impressive strides in rebuilding. 


But the high commissioner has also observed that physical reconstruction alone will not bring reconciliation, dignity and lasting peace for all citizens of Sri Lanka. Her report concludes that national mechanisms have not yet been successful in establishing the truth and achieving justice. Against this background, the high commissioner recommends the establishment of an independent international inquiry mechanism which would contribute to establishing the truth where domestic inquiry mechanisms have failed.


Our call on the Australian government to support the draft resolution before the Human Rights Council is with a view to preventing recurrence of violations and abuses and puts us in company with all of our usual allies when it comes to foreign affairs decision making. In line with the position taken by the Australian government in 2012 and 2013, the motion before the council supports the entitlement of all Sri Lankans to the full enjoyment of their human rights regardless of religion, belief or ethnicity in a peaceful and unified country.


I want to turn just briefly in the time I have remaining to the letter that has been sent to the Prime Minister from a range of eminent Australians suggesting that Australia ought support the US-sponsored UN resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. I think this letter shows that the Australian government has a balanced position, acknowledging that there were wrongs on both sides of the Sri Lankan conflict and seeking clarification and enlightenment that is impartial and focused on the facts. This letter shows that the support for that position is truly bipartisan, with the eminent Australians including John Dowd; Gareth Evans; Malcolm Fraser; Owen Harries, the former Australian ambassador to UNESCO and visiting fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy; Geoffrey Robertson; and Gordon Weiss, an adjunct professor at Griffith University who is the founding adviser and consultant expert to the International Crimes Evidence Project, a former UN spokesperson and author. All of these eminent citizens are calling, as we do today, for Australia to support the US sponsored UN resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:15):  This motion calls, amongst other things, for the Australian government to 'maintain Australia's strong record of support for human rights at the 25th session of the Human Rights Council'. Of course we will. Australia is pre-eminent in supporting human rights. We have a country with a culture that acknowledges the oppressed and does its utmost to ensure that if there is anywhere in the world that needs peacekeeping, whether it is in our near neighbourhood or further afield, Australia is there. So of course we will continue to give strong support to human rights at the 25th session of the Human Rights Council. But the motion goes on to say we should:


â€¦ join with the United Kingdom, United States of America and other co-sponsoring nations and commit the Australian Government to the strongest possible support for draft Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/25/L.1.


Well, we have not as yet seen the final text of that resolution and, like all governments and all sensible minded persons, when we do see the final text then we will decide our position.


I do welcome this motion because it is about a country that is near and dear to the hearts of Australians. We long ago drew close to the Commonwealth country of Ceylon. The name of its capital city, Colombo, will forever be celebrated in one of our earliest and most successful foreign aid ventures, the Colombo Plan. Many of today's most influential workers in government and business throughout our near region went through that Colombo Plan many years ago.


The modern Sri Lanka has just come through 30 years of a most bloody civil war, a most difficult time for them when the country was in turmoil. They had extraordinary deprivation and destruction, and the infrastructure, particularly in the north, was decimated. I had the privilege of going there recently at the invitation of the Sri Lankan government. We went up to the north and I was shocked to see the complete destruction of what was once a marvellous irrigation system for rice growing. It was completely destroyed as a result of the 30 years of war. When we flew over the forest we could see wild cattle which were once domestic animals and very important to local agribusiness, but there they were wild in the forest. We went to Jaffna and spoke with the military and the civil service before going on to the camps. You can no longer call them camps of internment, because the gates are all open, but a lot of the population, particularly the women and children, go back there at night to have a meal. It is where their children go to school and they get health services and where they are working from to re-establish the infrastructure, particularly in the north.


The Australian government has helped build schools in that area. We visited one very big new primary school and I must say that the young children lining up, many with bare feet and standing in burning hot sand, showed real perseverance. I felt very anxious that we should walk past them quickly so they could move into the shade. These young children were thirsting for knowledge and their parents were so anxious that they restore the educational opportunity they had been deprived of over the 30 years of war.


Sri Lanka is a country that has a long history as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multilingual society. It has been a practising democracy for a very long time and has had universal adult franchise since 1931. It is a country which now looks to its democratic roots, including having Tamils represented in the parliament. I met a number of these Tamil parliamentary representatives. We have to understand that Sri Lanka will require a long period of rehabilitation and re-establishment of infrastructure. We stand by all that Sri Lanka is trying to do to bring about restitution and reconciliation amongst its individuals.


We certainly also ask that they implement fully the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of Sri Lanka, and take credible and independent actions to ensure that there is justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans.


I heard that sentiment expressed again and again when I was in Sri Lanka just recently. I think we have to acknowledge the enormous difficulties for a country re-establishing after such a bitter time. I do acknowledge that the diaspora, particularly those in Australia, are anxious to see that the country moves forward. I strongly support a strong, democratic future for Sri Lanka.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-03-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:20):  I rise in support of the resolution. At the outset, while I think we all recognise that we might have different opinions, these resolutions are extraordinarily hard. They are hard on two counts: one is that, of themselves, dealing with the matters at the heart of this is very tough because of what has been felt and experienced by people, particularly in Sri Lanka. The other element that makes this difficult for Australians broadly is to appreciate that we have savoured and long protected a climate of peace and it is difficult to reconcile in our own minds those events that happened in other parts of the globe that we would never imagine and would never want to have visited on us here in this nation.


However, they do happen, and Australia has played a role in times pastâ€”a very productive roleâ€”in being able to be promoters of peace, not just by word but by deed. I think our principal role has been helping in our regionâ€”for example, Cambodia, at the tail end of its time of terrible things occurring within its boundaries. We were able to play a very important role in bringing peace there, and we should be looking to do likewise using our role here in being able to achieve that.


Australia has a lot to be proud of when you look at the fact that we have been able to become home after World War II to seven million new citizens, some of whom have been drawn from parts of the world that have been bedevilled by conflict, and have been able to make a country that others look and aspire to in terms of being able to create much more harmonious relationships within borders.


While some may not necessarily agree that we should involve ourselves in these matters, I think, as I have said, that it is important to do so. I have a community that is largely built from people of a Tamil background, who I am proud to call friends. I also have a lot of Sinhalese in my community, and they likewise feel very strongly about this as well. There have been, as has been acknowledged, terrible acts committed in Sri Lanka, and while they have occurred through the path of this conflict over many years I think a lot of people recognise that the Tamils bore a huge load of pain at the tail end of the conflict in 2009.


While there have been a lot of divisions that have held Sri Lanka back from being what it could be as a nation, I think the unity that does exist for the common ground is that people recognise that those on either side who strayed beyond the boundaries of what would be considered humanity should feel the arm of justice reach them, and that they are held accountable for terrible acts. That is what needs to happen.


We cannot see Sri Lanka become the country it can be and we cannot find a way to combine the ambitions of both Sinhalese and Tamils without finding a way to hold accountable those who went beyond what would be considered humane. In many ways that is why we have had the UN focus, to try to encourage that justice to occur. Justice should not be viewed as a vehicle for vengeance, because it will ultimately fail if it is that. But, as I said, justice is important if we want to combine the ambitions of the Sinhalese and the Tamils to build something that all Sri Lankans can be proud of in their country.


And so in 2012 and 2013 we have had Australia supporting Human Rights Council resolutions that have urged the government of Sri Lanka to adopt the findings and recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of Sri Lankaâ€”principally to highlight the need to investigate credibly allegations of extrajudicial killings and disappearances, calling for demilitarisation of the north and finding ways to resolve, amongst other things, land disputes. These things are critical if we are to see people being able to join concretely and ensure that Sri Lanka can move ahead and prosper.


If there are elements of doubt about what has occurred and those ill feelings that exist and continue to exist amongst both sides, but particularly those terrible things that were visited upon the Tamils, Sri Lanka cannot conceivably believe that improvements to physical infrastructure alone, for example, can bring people together. What will bring people together is being able to have a sense that those who committed wrong have been brought to justice, an acknowledgement of that hurt and a commitment to work together to ensure that Sri Lanka can move forward concretely.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (11:15):  As I rise today to speak on this motion I wish to emphasise from the outset that this government takes seriously all allegations of human rights violations and international crimes and, as you will appreciate further in a moment, this is the government's approach when it comes to human rights concerns involving Sri Lanka. We recognise that there are ongoing human rights concerns in Sri Lanka. 


As speakers earlier have noted, it was only a few years that ago that Sri Lanka was engulfed in civil conflict, and we acknowledge that there are still ongoing issues of accountability and reconciliation. That is why it is important that a constructive approach is taken by all parties to any UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka. Any resolution must be aimed at assisting the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka. As Labor and the Greens well know, we have yet to receive the final text of the resolution. When we do receive the final text, we will carefully consider whether to co-sponsor a US-led resolution. We will make a decision after giving due consideration to the final text and balancing all of the issues; we will not be pushed into a position or be rushed into making decision by Labor or the Greens. We want to assist Sri Lanka to make genuine progress on human rights, accountability and reconciliationâ€”all of which requires the cooperation of the Sri Lankan government. 


This government wants to see the allegations of serious international crimes, committed by both sides during Sri Lanka's bloody civil war, independently investigated and transparently prosecuted. Pursuing those responsible for these terrible events and working towards reconciliation is clearly vital for Sri Lanka. The government has consistently and directly raised these issues with the Sri Lankan government and urged it to facilitate independent and transparent investigations. 


We also have a regular dialogue with other political, official and community representatives on Sri Lanka related issues here in Australia. As recently as 5 March, our foreign minister, the Hon. Julie Bishop, met with Mr MA Sumanthiran, from the Tamil National Alliance, to discuss the resolution and the situation in Sri Lanka more broadly. On the margins of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last November, PM Abbott and Ms Bishop both raised human rights issues at the most senior levels of the Sri Lankan government. Our high commission in Colombo regularly raises human rights issues, including registering our concern at the 16 March arrest of Father Praveen and Ruki Fernando in northern Sri Lanka, whom we were pleased to see subsequently released.


Both our foreign minister and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison, have an appreciation and understanding of the on-the-ground situation in Sri Lanka, having visited the country in February last year. At every opportunity our government engages with the Sri Lankan government to help advance progress on human rights and accountability. It is this approach, rather than one that seeks to isolate the Sri Lankan government, that we consider will ultimately achieve real progress in addressing human rights concerns. It is an approach that we will continue to take. 


We acknowledge that progress has been limited in some areas, such as in implementing the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the LLRC, which we have pressed upon the Sri Lankan government should be implemented with great urgency. In other areas, progress is being made, such as with the resettlement of internally displaced persons; de-mining; and infrastructure development in the north and east of the country, hard hit by the civil conflict as well as the September 2013 Northern Province council election.


Australia will continue to encourage the Sri Lankan government to build on this progress and to take the further necessary steps towards addressing human rights concerns in that country.


Debate adjourned.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkesâ€”The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:02):  I rise to speak about the travesty that is Meat Free Week, a conspiracy by the Greens, a campaign that is trying to stop Australians from eating meat. They want us to become vegetarians and vegans. They will stoop to anything to stop Australians eating meat. Indeed, we saw Animals Australia, during their campaign to stop live exports to Indonesia, giving cattle human names and human characteristics, such as: 'This is Barry. Barry is a Santa Gertrudis steer. Barry was happily munching grass on his farm in the Barkly Tableland, and these evil men came in the middle of the night and took him off to Indonesia and cut his throat.' It is this sort of nonsense that we are going through from the Greens.


But, I have to tell you, you need meat. Meat develops proper cognitive functions. It increases your lifespan. It develops strong muscles and ensures a healthy balance of hormones within the human body. Vitamin B12, which can only be obtained from meat, is crucial to a healthy nervous system. So I am in support of the campaign by my colleague the member for Dawson, George Christensen, not for Meat Free Week but for Free Meat Week. I would encourage everyone that works and resides in this place to join the member for Dawson tomorrow at lunchtime for a free Aussie barbecue and support our meat industry.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:45):  If Medicare was a Facebook page it would have around 23Â½ million 'likes'. It is every Australian's favourite brand. Peter Dutton and the coalition claim that they are Medicare's best friends. They are waiting until after the Western Australian election before they hit the 'unfriend' button. Peter Dutton says he wants to start a national conversation about the future of Medicare, but it is not a real conversation because if you are going to have a real conversation you listen to what the other side is saying. He has already concluded what he wants to doâ€”he is just not letting on. A national conversation would be welcome, but that is not what the government plans.


The Minister for Health has refused to release the Commission of Audit recommendations on health spending, but he revealed last week that he knows what the cuts are that are in the Commission of Audit report, he knows what the recommendations are, he is just not going to let on. He has got it sitting on his desk, and the only thing that is sitting on top of it on his desk is the polling on the Western Australian election. As soon as that is out of the way we will see the commission of horrors and what it means for the health system and the future of Medicare. The coalition are clearly considering means testing Medicare. The minister is flying a new kite every week on this one. He wants to create a multitiered system by restricting the amount the Commonwealth pays GPs for seeing certain groups in the community. He will not tell us what he has decided but he will tell us what he thinks, and what he clearly thinks is that some people should pay more when they go and see their doctor.


We on this side of the House say that it is not up to the minister to decide who is and is not capable of affording to go to see their doctor when they are sick. This is, and should remain, the privilege of the GP. Each and every GP who knows their patients and knows their own community is going to be in a better position than the minister sitting here in Canberra to determine what is in the best interests of those patients. The coalition's plan would clearly remove the discretion that currently lives with the community GP. Make no mistake about it, what is being planned here is a radical downgrade of what we know and love: Medicare Australia. Introducing a tiered systemâ€”and that is what is seriously being proposedâ€”means that the GP's Medicare rebate would be the highest for those people on concession cards and their children. They will get the highest level of Medicare rebate and everyone else will get different treatment. The Medicare rebate for family tax benefit A patients would be less again, and for everyone else it would be lower still. Bulk-billing would be for concession card holders and their kids onlyâ€”nobody else. Obviously, this style of health system is going to put pressure to open up private health insurance to GP services as well.


We have said in the past that this is going to hit people who are poor, but that is only half the picture. Make no mistake about it, this is an attack on the middle class. The AMA's recommended GP consultation cost is currently around $72. Just because you do not qualify for a concession card does not mean you are a high-income earner; it does not mean that you can afford to pay out-of-pocket fees every time you need to see your GP. That is very short-sighted. About 12.8 million Australiansâ€”almost 55 per cent of Australiansâ€”have private health insurance, so the majority of middle-income earners already pay out-of-pocket expenses each month for their health care. Private health insurance costs are going up and up and up. Recently the coalition approved the largest ever increase in over a decade for private health insurance premiums: around 6.2 per cent or $21 a month. They go on and on about the impact of carbon pricing, but you will not hear them say a word about their own decisions and the impact that they are having on private health insurance rebates, because this is their plan for the future of health care in this country.


Direct impacts will hit the hip pockets of millions of working Australians. Millions of working Australians have their own stories to tell, like Kim Parker, a casual casino worker in Tasmania. Kim's daughter contracted gastroenteritis when she was nine months old. It was in the middle of the night. Kim took her daughter to the emergency room at a local hospital for treatment. It took over three hours and she still never received that treatment. Kim signed up for private health insurance after that experience. It costs her $140 a fortnight. That is a huge chunk of her take-home pay, but she pays that money to make sure her family is healthy. People like Kim exist all over Australia. The cost of health cover is going up and up and up, and make no mistake: for middle-income earners and for people like Kim, under the coalition's plan these costs are going to skyrocket. Many simply will not be able to afford it.


Introducing a fee does not fix the problem; it just creates another one. Dr Hambleton of the AMA says that the federally funded costs associated with GP visits have actually flatlined relative to the cost of hospitals and state government budgets, so this manufactured crisis that they are trying to fix does not exist. The average cost of somebody going to a GP for a Medicare visit is now $36. The average cost of going to an emergency ward in a public hospital could easily be 10 times more than that.


The big drivers of healthcare costs are not spending in general practice. They are public health challenges that the current assistant health minister could not be less interested inâ€”things like tobacco, alcohol and obesity from the sorts of foods that we are eating and encouraging our kids to eat. These are chronic lifestyle diseases that can only be prevented by better health care, better health planning and more affordable access to GPs.


In my electorate, Throsby in the Illawarra in New South Wales, we have a higher-than-national-average incidence of a lot of chronic diseases, and diabetes is one of these diseases. The incidence of diabetes is about 5.6 per cent of the population nationally. In my electorate it is over six per centâ€”closer to 6.5 per cent, almost one percentage point above the national average. The people who have this disease need more intensive healthcare management. There is a reason for that: if you are able to provide greater care, it means that they are less likely to be hospitalised and less likely to suffer the worst results of having those chronic diseases. This is why bulk-billing rates in the Illawarra are also at historically high levels. They have increased over the last five years, to 91.7 per cent. GPs understand that patients in my electorate require bulk-billing in order to have access to basic primary health care. They need to make sure that patients continue to get access to GPs so we can do health promotion and preventive care and keep people out of the expensive part of the healthcare system, the public hospital system.


So there are three things that we can be absolutely certain will happen if Prime Minister Abbott's plan succeeds. The first is that patients will shift from GPs to the emergency waiting rooms in public hospitals. The second thing is that there is going to be a shift of the cost onto individuals, many of whom are already paying increased costs for private health insurance, particularly middle-income earners. The third will be the unavoidable cost pressure on private health insurance premiums. They will go up and up and up as well.


We only need to look at the US to see what this looks like. We can see that there are spiralling costs in health care. We can see they are paying a greater percentage of GDP than we pay here in Australia for their health services and getting a worse health outcome. The USA today spends the equivalent of 17 per cent of GDP on health care. The total Commonwealth expenditure on health care is about nine per cent of GDP in Australia, less than the OECD average of 9.3 per cent. So we have the American path or we have the Australian path. We know what is going to work.

Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  As I was saying before the division, if Medicare were a Facebook page we would have 23Â½ million likes, and that is because it is a great system. Australia spends less on health care than any other country in the world for better outcomes.


Australians have an opportunity in the Western Australian Senate election to send a real message to Tony Abbott and the coalition: 'We do not want your plan for health care'. He says that they are the best friends that Medicare has ever had; well, real friends do not do this.
