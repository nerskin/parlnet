"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I move:
That the amendment be disagreed to.
The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003, which is the subject of the amendment, contains an omnibus collection of measures, one of which relates to the availability of a benefit to public hospitals in terms of their access to exemptions from fringe benefits. While public hospitals were traditionally paid a rebate in lieu of tax liability for fringe benefits, with the introduction of the new tax system in 2000 that was codified in access to a $17,000 gross taxable value per employee of public hospitals that were also public benevolent institutions. 
Public hospitals self-assess, like other participants in the tax system, and, depending upon the governance and control arrangements over the administration of public hospitals, there has been doubt that they remain a public benevolent institution or drift into the legal classification of a government organisation, thereby disqualifying them from access to the $17,000 tax-free FBT benefit per employee. 
The purpose of the amendment in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003 is to extend the protection to public hospitals whether or not they are public benevolent institutions—in effect, to secure that benefit and to extend it. That was a recommendation of the report of the Inquiry into the Definition of Charities and Related Organisations which the government was implementing. To that amendment the opposition have moved that ambulance services ought to be placed on the same footing as public hospitals, presumably to ensure their entitlement to the $17,000 gross taxable value continuing entitlement. The government is opposing the amendment, partly because of the historical reason that public hospitals were the subject of this piece of legislation. If we had intended to deal with other aspects of the public health system, we would have done so in the measure. 
The other concern with the amendment is that the bill may actually have a deleterious effect on the availability of tax concessions to ambulance services. For example, ambulance services that are at present public benevolent institutions are entitled not to $17,000 but to $30,000 gross taxable value per employee. If we look at an organisation like the St John's Ambulance Association—which, for example, is providing ambulance services under contract to the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments—as a public benevolent institution but not as a public hospital we see that St John's is currently entitled to the higher value of $30,000 per employee. It seems to me on first reading of the opposition's amendment that there is a real possibility that, if St John's were to be treated in the same way as a public hospital, they would lose that higher entitlement. I am sure that is not the intention of the opposition but that appears to me to be a likely consequence of the amendment. So for those reasons the government will be opposing the amendment.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,5,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The opposition can see very little reason for treating ambulance services and public hospitals differently, and that is the reason for this amendment. I have taken note of the parliamentary secretary's words of caution about $30,000 relative to $17,000, but I suspect that, as this is a belt-and-braces piece of legislation in that we are assuming that public benevolent institution status continues until the time that a court takes it away, the loss of $30,000 would occur as a result of court action and not as a result of this bill. That is my lay legal reaction in the minute and a half that I have had to consider the issue.  
I want to point out and put on the record that there are other aspects of this bill which, having now been settled by the Senate, it is highly desirable to pass quickly even though the opposition had previously opposed them and moved amendments. I am talking in particular about the schedules relating to excessive termination payments and to tax losses. Particularly with regard to tax losses, there are companies that have to file tax returns and they had been anticipating that those measures would be passed when they went into consolidation. The opposition has no desire now to hold this legislation up and create any more uncertainty for the businesses that are in that position; so I can advise the House that Labor will not be insisting on this amendment when it goes back to the Senate. I have, however, had discussions with Senator Murray, from the Democrats, and I think we will both consider moving a similar amendment to this one to subsequent charities legislation when that comes before the House. On that occasion, we may be rather more determined in our resolve to achieve the outcome that we desire.
Question agreed to.
Mr ROSS CAMERON (Parramatta—Parliament-ary Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.40 a.m.)—I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendment and I move:
That the reasons be adopted.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—In continuing this debate on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003, it is probably worth our while to reflect on the role that Australia has played in the international aviation regime, particularly since the construction of the Chicago Convention in 1944, and to recognise the role that Australia has played in ICAO—the International Civil Aviation Organisation—in all things aviation but particularly in areas of security. This legislation is a continuing upgrade of the security that we are providing for aviation, for our airports and for the screening of passengers and freight. I do not think that this will be the last time that we will see amendments to these bills coming before this House, because obviously this is going to be an ongoing operation for many years to come. The initiatives that have been put forward in these particular bills and amendments are going to give effect to areas such as the 100 per cent screening of baggage on international flights—and, indeed, ultimately on domestic flights—and I understand that they will be coming in a full 12 months before the ICAO deadline.
It is interesting to note the developments that have occurred in the United States in the equipment that is being used to screen baggage and passengers. While there has been quite a large investment in this equipment for Australia, unfortunately, because of the nature of things, that investment is going to have to continue. I think we should all be very much aware of the cost of these provisions to the aviation industry and ultimately, I guess, to the passengers who fly in and out of Australia.
Australia's aviation record in terms of safety has been spectacular inasmuch as we have not had too many major incidents. There are only three major incidents that I can remember: the Mr Brown hoax on a Qantas 747 in the early 1970s, an incident involving a Fokker Friendship aircraft in Central Australia, and, of course, the hijacking of a DC9 aircraft out of Coolangatta en route to Brisbane. All of those resulted in the aircraft and all people on board being saved, but what we are facing today is a much more treacherous and much more demanding situation because of those who, through aviation, are dedicating themselves to interfering with the safety and security of a country.
The provisions of these bills are manifold. Having just made reference to the screening of passengers' baggage, I will also say that there will be much stricter provisions for regulating those who can work at airports. There will be security checks on all those who will be working air side. There will be checks on all those who have any contact with the aircraft, and rightly so. 
Because the provisions in the United States have been so tough in recent years one would think that we would have seen a marked improvement in the provision of aviation security in that particular country. But we should remind ourselves that the United States has not been without its problems. There was a recent incident where a young student managed to board four aircraft at an airport and plant devices on them. Over and over we are seeing that people are finding ways of being able to go and interfere with aircraft if they really want to cause trouble. Thankfully, that particular incident in the United States was devised to prove to the authorities that the security provisions there were inadequate. I guess we in Australia are also going to face this sort of thing from time to time and hopefully the provisions in these particular bills will make sure that we minimise that completely.
One of the big growth areas in the aviation industry in recent years has been air freight. I know there has been some controversy over the way we should administer safety provisions for that particular sector of the industry. There are somewhere in excess of 800 operators either directly or indirectly involved with the carriage of air freight around Australia. For those who administer the aviation safety provisions—particularly DOTARS—this must be a nightmare.
While there has been the installation of much more effective equipment in airports—and I understand that has been extended to sea ports—that, too, is going to very much be an ongoing requirement if we are going to maintain the safety standards within our industry.
I would also like to pay tribute to the committee that has been set up by this parliament—the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—for the inquiry into aviation security it is undertaking. It is looking at all sorts of regulations that apply to regional services, and it is the regional areas that are providing some concerns at the moment. It is also looking at the requirements of airport operators at the major and regional airports, the requirements of airlines to comply with Commonwealth security and the impact of security requirements overseas on what we provide here. It is also looking at the cost of security upgrades—that applies particularly to regional airports. There are some other areas concerning privacy and the ongoing development of technologies that will also be within the committee's purview. I have followed the hearings of that particular committee and think it has addressed its very big task very well indeed. 
Its report is going to be interesting because there is concern in the regional areas that they could have aviation safety incidents if they do not have the ability to undertake the kinds of security checks that are provided at other airports. It is true to say that this particular legislation is very much directed at the 11 major airports. In particular, it is being directed at the international and main line domestic services, although I understand that the baggage screening provisions will now also be covering all propeller driven aircraft.
As I say, Australia has always been at the forefront of making aviation security provisions. We can hold our heads fairly high because, in many respects, we have been anticipating the greater requirements for aviation safety provisions. The reviews that have been going on were started a long time prior to September 11. I understand that the latest round of upgrades has been underway for more than four years now and is going to be very much a continuing process. 
Getting back to the cost of providing these services, invariably we hear of and read about debates between the airline operators and the regulators as to who is going to pick up the tab for the provision of these services. When it comes to aviation safety there has to be a realisation within the community that it is an obligation that is going to fall on everyone associated with the aviation industry. Ultimately, it will be reflected in passenger charges in one way or another, and that is one of the things that we are going to have to face and live with. I hope that we will see a more pragmatic approach to some of those debates and a realisation that we cannot afford to let our aviation costs get out of control.
There are other means by which we can reduce some of those charges, even when security eats up so much of that money. At a time when we hear of a tremendous investment being put into the Australian tourist industry through the tourism white paper we must remember that aviation in Australian terms is a major contributor to that tourism flow. At a time when the industry has been hard hit internationally by things like SARS, the terrorist incidents and, indeed, the war in Iraq, we want to make sure that when we spend that sort of promotional money we remain competitive in terms of our international appeal. We do not want to see any excuse for people not being able to come here because the cost is too high.
I certainly commend the government for their ongoing approach to aviation safety. As I say, it is not an easy area at all, and one that will need ongoing attention. It is an area where the realisation that we have been lucky in the past is now coming through.
I will make reference to some of the new sections of the act which cover personnel. I mentioned these briefly before. There have been concerns that the new security checks that will be undertaken by aviation workers, whether in the security area or in the ground handling area, may be an invasion of privacy. I understand there has been concern, particularly among members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as to whether we are going too far in having security services check people working in the aviation area at our major airports.
In one of the hearings of the committee the idea was raised of having ASIO take part in checking these people. There are of course provisions within our security acts to make sure that there are appeals available to anyone who thinks they have been hard done by in a security assessment. But let us not weaken on that aspect at all. Never before have we had such a requirement to ensure that the people working in the aviation area at our major airports are absolutely clean. We have already had examples where people who may be of doubtful background have been involved in the provision of those services. Ultimately, if not checked, this may have led to some difficulties.
I conclude my contribution by commending the government for their efforts in this area. I encourage them to continue the ongoing review and to continue upgrading the equipment required for the provision of these services. As I said earlier, we all look forward to the report of this parliament's committee on what the provision of these services is going to mean, particularly in regional airports.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003. I will be supporting the legislation, but I will use this opportunity to talk about some of the issues that are not included in these bills. I take on board the comment made by the member for Fadden that this legislation may have to be revisited from time to time, because we are in a changing world and there are circumstances which may require the government to act again. I apologise to the member for Fadden; I had not realised, when I stood, that he was in front of me, and I was not trying to interlope. 
There are issues which apply particularly to security at regional airports which are not included in these bills which I believe should be. I am encouraged, from discussions I have had, that the government is contemplating further changes down the track. I have mentioned security at regional airports a number of times over the last six to nine months. The member for Braddon has raised concerns he has, particularly in relation to Devonport airport but also in relation to Burnie airport and other regional airports in Tasmania. Other members of parliament are also concerned about security issues at major regional airports.
I have a number of airports in my electorate, the two major ones being at Tamworth and Armidale. At the moment, if you board a 50-seat Dash 8 aircraft out of Tamworth, for instance, there is absolutely no security at all. I think that is common to many regional centres, including Dubbo and Wagga. I am not certain about Albury but I think it is also the case there. At regional airports in Tasmania and in other states there is no security at all.
I have made some inquiries about this from time to time, and the minister's officers and officers of the department say that over the years there have been different approaches to different airports and that the security assessments are based on risk assessments. In answer to a question in this parliament about six months ago, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—or it may even have even been the Prime Minister—said that a copy of the risk assessment report for Tamworth airport could be made available so that I could have discussions with various people as to how the risks for Tamworth and district commuters had been assessed and how the conclusion was reached that no security was required at that particular airport.
I have been unable to see that risk assessment. To be quite honest, I do not think there really is a proper risk assessment. How can you assess the risk of terrorism? Do you base it on the experiences of the past 20 years? Do you base it on the size of the aircraft or the number of years of experience the captain has? What sort of assessment process would be valid? What sort of assessment process would suggest that a 50-seat aircraft leaving Tamworth or Wagga to travel to Sydney, for instance, has a lesser risk than the very same aircraft travelling between Sydney and Canberra? I have travelled on such aircraft in my normal arrangements for getting from Tamworth to Canberra. Why should I be treated differently in Sydney from the way I am when I leave the Tamworth airport?
I do not think these questions have been answered. The government uses a mythical risk assessment, based on some historical arrangement the minister hides behind. The government says that, if regional airports believe they are in some way insecure—even though they do not have access to the risk assessment that has been done by these shadowy figures—and they want to look after their citizenry to a greater extent, this has to be done at the cost of local government. Local government has to bear the cost if there needs to be any upgrade to the security of regional airports.
This bill is before the House now because of the change to global circumstances. What the government seem to have concentrated on addressing are the international circumstances and some of the rules and regulations that have worked effectively internationally. The government have been looking very much at major airports and international flights. It is almost as if the process for assessing the risk of terrorism is based on how big a plane's fuel tank is or how many passengers are on the plane. In my view that really has very little to do with the amount of damage that can be done—or is a person in a 50-seat aircraft worth less than a person in a 300-seat aircraft? These are the questions that need to be answered. 
Obviously, all governments have problems with costs and to impose a wider security net to cover the range of commercial airports across Australia would cost a lot of money, but my argument is essentially about equity. If there is a risk of terrorism at our airports in Australia, let us secure all our airports and let us do it as part of our defence process. We keep hearing from the Prime Minister and others that the globe has changed, that it is not like it used to be when you sent the troops up the beach with a .303; this is a new world we are fighting in. We have to be secure, our borders have to be secure, we have to be wary. Our fridge doors have to be tightened up so that we are protected from the evils that may well get inside!
That is the message that the government is giving the Australian people, but when it comes to the practicalities regional airports are ignored. It is almost assumed that regional airports are not at risk and that terrorists when they come to Australia are urban people who would not like to visit the country. They mostly cannot drive cars because they would not be able to drive from Sydney to Tamworth or from Sydney to Wagga to access an aeroplane. So they are urban creatures who will do everything possible to get through the security screening arrangements at the major metropolitan airports to get access to a potential weapon. If that is not the case, we should have equity in security for all our airports. If terrorism is not a problem, if our airports are safe anyway, why have any security? I think it is the inequity of the process that disturbs a lot of country people.
Only a few days ago Southern Cross, an independent aviation group, released a report which voiced a number of concerns about the security at regional airports. Their concerns were about not only perimeter security and screening passengers boarding aircraft at those particular airports but also the security in the car parks and the location of car parks near fuel facilities et cetera. These are various targets that I would have thought the government would have been looking at very closely—for example, the fuel used at airports is highly explosive, there are large quantities of it and there is the issue of the security of the aircraft overnight and whether people have access to it. These are the sorts of things that the bill was looking at, but they are international arrangements and the issues are not being addressed at the regional level. I guess the government will always retreat behind, `We've had this system in place. Airports are rated differently. We have a risk assessment process. Trust us.' I am sure any terrorist will take that on board and use that as part of his defining parameters when looking for potential weapons!
But it is not just the country people who travel in those aircraft who are at risk—and this is where I think the government is letting the nation down—it is also the people on the ground, if in fact we believe that there is a terrorist threat to some of our airports. It could be the people in this very building. If terrorists gained access to a 50-seat Dash 8 aircraft, heaven forbid, at some regional airport and were determined to do something to this place, not only the members but also the other people who work in this building could be under threat. It could be the people on the Harbour Bridge, for instance. It could be people in any number of circumstances, and I think that is something that the government really does need to look at in its future security arrangements for regional airports. The member for Fadden raised that issue. I thought he spoke quite well, and he obviously has a lot of background in this area. But the government is going to have to further investigate security matters at our airports. 
The government listened to the concerns that were raised in the parliament—and I thank them for that—some months ago now, and put in place the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit review of aviation security. To date I do not think the report of the committee has been released, but there has been commentary given from time to time. Hopefully, that report will come out with something a bit more constructive on the issue that I am talking about. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services has also made some recommendations recently; I think there were 28 recommendations. One of them was based on this very issue, relating to security at airports with over 30,000 users, or it may have been communities with a population of over 30,000. The important thing is that it made a recommendation that identified the inequities out there, and the government should at least be looking at those issues.
In conclusion, the government has said—and I agree with the government on this issue—that we are living in a new world and we are not going to be fighting conflicts in the way in which we have in the past. That suggests to me that we have to identify the areas where we are at threat and where, heaven forbid, some madman might like to access destructive weapons. It has been identified internationally—and this bill before the parliament acknowledges this—that aircraft and airports are high-risk areas. I believe that, in that sense, the government really has to address this problem as a defence issue and stop talking about the past assessment process and then leap into the future—the politics in this place—and frighten people about terrorism. The government has to make up its mind: if there is a risk of aircraft being used by terrorists, all areas should be treated the same—even though that may mean a cost.
The Prime Minister as recently as yesterday, and even this morning, said that the key issue from his perspective as leader of the nation is the stability of the nation in an economic sense and the security of the nation, whether that be border protection or internal security. This is a key issue that the government needs to address. It should not be addressed after something terrible happens. It is something that has been identified. It has been identified in a number of reports. The Southern Cross report made it very plain that what a lot of people have been saying is out there, looking at us. If there are people out there who have ill intent in their minds—they are not fools either—they will be looking at it as well.
I urge the government to look very closely at removing the responsibility for the minor regional airports—if I could put it in that sense—from local government and view this as a defence matter for not only the people who fly within those aircraft but also the people who might be at threat if the aircraft were used in some untoward way.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I thank the member for New England for giving prior notice of his brevity—although I do not think his speech was quite as brief as some of us were expecting. I rise today to add my support for the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003, which is before us in this chamber for debate today. I note one very specific comment that the member for New England made—and I took very clear note of it. He said, `We should have security at all our airports.' 
—Regional airports.
—The words were—and I think if you check Hansard you will see this—`We should have security at all our airports.' The member for New England may then qualify that by saying `All our regional airports,' but does that mean that Keith airport or airstrip—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Barker knows full well that I was referring to regional airports.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The honourable member for New England will resume his seat.
—That is something I cannot agree with. I would suggest that, if the member for New England spoke to my constituents or to his constituents, he would find that most of them do not want their regional airports to have the same security as major city airports. Perhaps I can use this analogy: if you are going to your local shop in a small country village, you do not have the same security there that you would have in a large shopping centre in the city. I do not know what it is like in New South Wales but I can say that, when I drive my car in one of the local towns in country South Australia, I do not lock my car. But if I am in a large city like Adelaide or Melbourne I certainly do lock the car. So you have different ways of handling things depending on the size of the place and the security risk.
I happen to like flying out of Mt Gambier and Kingscote in my electorate—what would be termed fairly large regional centres; probably servicing 40,000 or 50,000 people at Mt Gambier—where there are something like 70,000 or 80,000 flights a year. I think most of my constituents happen to like the fact that they can roll up there in a typical country manner, 10 or 15 minutes before they have to leave, and they do not have to worry about security. But, when they arrive at a major airport like Adelaide or Melbourne—to which there are regular flights from Mt Gambier—the security checks occur. People are quite happy with that and they certainly tell me that they do not actually want the same sorts of security arrangements that they have in major city airports. They like their relaxed way of life and want to keep it as long as they can. I do not think regional airports need the same sort of security that they have in a major city airport. Some people might say that that is putting my constituents at great risk, but I do not think that is the case. You will never have a zero risk situation, but surely the chances of a terrorist coming from a country regional airport are far less than their coming from a city airport. And you have to look at what it is going to cost.
Traditionally, Australia has remained largely unaffected by world events, and we in the country happen to like it that way. We are quite proudly known around the world for our status as the lucky country and the safe country. Tourists could travel around our shores without great fear of major aeroplane crashes and without major fear for their personal safety. In many instances, the thought of a terrorist attack would not even have entered their minds. Unfortunately, times have changed. I agree with the previous speaker, the member for New England: times have changed. September 11 and Bali have certainly taught us that we can no longer be complacent about our security and we can no longer assume that international events will not be directed at us or not affect us. But you have to put it in perspective. The perspective is that we need this security for major city airports, but the country people I speak to certainly do not expect the same sort of security arrangements at their local country airport that a major city airport would have. 
Only recently we paid tribute to those who lost their lives as a result of that despicable act by persons who think that violence is the only way to get their message across. These heartless people took away friends and loved ones from many people in Australia. September 11, 2001 and, in particular, 12 October 2002 changed the way that we as a nation viewed ourselves and our activities in the international sphere. In the travel realm, these tragic events have forced us to give great consideration to the political and social environments of our destinations and the way in which we view our arrangements to travel there has changed as well. That is not to say that we have become fearful, but we certainly have become more aware of the potential risks which in some cases may be associated with travelling.
While we should be aware of the possible risks, there is no way that we should be awed in fear. At all times the Australian government, like the governments of our allies—and I would suggest that even if the opposition were in government, God help us, they would have the same view—has maintained that it will not give in to these threats made by the extremists, who believe that violence is the answer to all their perceived problems, because they cannot win the argument on logic.
Australia has an outstanding aviation safety record, but September 11 brought home to us just how much more vigilant we need to be at our major city airports. In keeping with this, the federal government has given much consideration to how we can make our aviation services less penetrable by people wanting to cause harm. We have made a commitment to ensuring a safe and secure aviation environment and through comprehensive policy reviews have identified a number of measures which will help to strengthen an already robust regulatory framework. The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 seeks to implement these measures.
Having recently travelled overseas, I can vouch that Australia's security measures are amongst the best in the world. Whilst not intrusive of passengers, the security arrangements that we have here already allow for proper security checks of passengers and their baggage.
—Not in regional airports, they don't.
—I totally agree with the member for New England and, as I said, I do not lock my car in a small country town and I do not expect to have the same sorts of security arrangements in a regional airport, because the risks are not anywhere near as high as they would in be a major city airport. Security arrangements are in place when people arrive at a major city airport. Whilst it is not intrusive of passengers, we do have proper security checks of passengers and their baggage.
Every time I get on a plane to come to parliament, I am comfortable with the travel arrangements—whether I come from Kangaroo Island or Mount Gambier in my electorate of Barker and go via Adelaide or Melbourne to Canberra—knowing that the airline companies have made all the proper checks to ensure the safety of our passengers. Notwithstanding that, the Howard government are always conscious that vigilance must be maintained and, as such, are always looking at ways we can improve our already superior systems.
As a founding member of the Chicago convention, Australia must ensure that we comply with the aviation security standards outlined under annex 17 of the convention, which understandably since September 11 has had a number of amendments made to it. In fact, even prior to September 11, the Department of Transport and Regional Services—DOTARS, as many of us know it—were working continually to revise the legislative framework for aviation security. In 1998 the Australian National Audit Office—the ANAO—released the Aviation Security in Australia report, stating that the department had: 
established a regulatory regime which ensures Australia's compliance with the standards embodied in Annex 17—
of the 1994 Convention on International Civil Aviation, or the so-called Chicago convention. The report also stated that, while this was the case, there were further actions which could be undertaken in order to strengthen the security regime even further. Following September 11, amendments identifying additional areas of concern, clarifying aviation security objectives in a changing environment and recommending changes to authority delegation, information sharing and response mechanisms have all been made to annex 17, and the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 reflects these amendments.
Partly as a result of the ANAO report, DOTARS have already started a revision of most of the legislative framework for aviation security along with associated regulations, including regulations regarding the screening of passengers and baggage, the reporting requirements for unlawful interference and aviation airport security arrangements. However, following September 11 and the International Civil Aviation Organisation's examination of ways to further improve aviation security, Australia is now looking at ways it can incorporate regulations which represent the requirements of the aviation security plan of action as endorsed at ministerial level by the ICAO in February 2002.
In the current security environment it is necessary that this government ensures not only that it meets its international obligations but also that it provides Australians and international travellers with the safest possible travel environment by way of a reasonable and adequate response. The action plan looks at measures such as: regular, mandatory, systematic and harmonised audits to enable evaluation of aviation security in place in all member states of the ICAO; identification, analysis and development of an effective global response to new and emerging threats; integrating timely measures to be taken in specific fields including airports, aircraft and air traffic control systems; strengthening of the security related provisions in the annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, using expedited procedures where warranted and subject to overall safety considerations, notably providing for the protection of the flight crew; and international cooperation relating to threat information—to name a few. It is very important that we note that the action plan talks about using procedures where warranted. That is where the difference is between the security required at an airport that might fly a few planes a week and the security required at a busy city airport, which obviously has a greater risk and a greater amount of traffic.
This piece of legislation acknowledges not only that but also that the responsibility for a safe aviation environment lies with all participants within the aviation industry. It seeks to clarify the role of the government and the role of the different industry players, particularly with regard to emergency and contingency arrangements. However, it is not simply a matter for the regulations to be tightened with no consideration for the broader impact that these regulations will have on the industry.  
The government recognises the difficulties that participants within the aviation industry may face in trying to meet security obligations, and for this reason the government, through this bill, has sought to allow the industry greater flexibility in achieving security outcomes. We are not simply laying down a black-and-white law that says, `You must take this exact action to comply with the regulations or there will be trouble'; rather, we are setting guidelines and offering the industry the flexibility to determine for themselves the best way in which their own specific business can comply with these regulations and ensure their passenger and airline safety.
What we must remember is that while these companies are commercial operations and while the operators will at all times be looking to make them viable operations, we should never underestimate the dedication of these operators to the safety of their passengers and the safety of their staff. The imperative is there; they want security and safety for their passengers because they know that if they do not have it they will not continue to be an airline. For this reason we are offering them various options as to how they comply with the security regulations. We know that they will take the responsibility and meet the regulations in the best possible way to continue the viability of their operations. There is no point in going out there and saying, `You're going to have all these things,' if they cannot actually afford to fly. We will not have airlines if we do not have this flexibility.
This legislation has been well researched and well thought out. It aims to improve the structure of the aviation security regulatory framework and provide adequate flexibility in order to reflect a rapidly changing threat environment. It allows for future amendments to be made and allows for it to be extended to other transport sectors in need. This is a very important point: it is very important that this legislation remains flexible and that we continue to work to have dynamic legislation which can change in keeping with the security needs of the times we find ourselves in.
Most importantly, however, it addresses the issues raised in the Australian National Audit Office report, which was tabled earlier this year, and provides for more focused auditing, increased compliance across all players in the aviation industry and a greater range of enforcement tools. To start with this bill contains a flexibility to require additional persons, such as cargo agents, airport tenants and key security controllers, to hold and maintain a security program, if considered necessary—and that is the important point—in keeping with the recognition that aviation security is the responsibility of all industry participants. Section 9 of this legislation defines the term `aviation industry participant' as those listed previously plus: 
	(a)	an airport operator; or
		...	...	...
	(d)	a person who occupies or controls an area of an airport ...
	(e)	a person (other than an aviation security inspector) appointed by the Secretary under this Act to perform a security function; or
	(f)	a contractor who provides services to a person mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e).
By doing this, it gives a very clear indication of who this legislation intends to affect and how. It also provides for an obligation to comply with, and not hinder compliance with, another person's aviation security program.
In addition the bill provides for an extended geographical jurisdiction so that if an offence occurs outside of Australia, as long as there is some Australian connection, these regulations may be applied to the offence. Should the offence be committed by an Australian citizen, resident or company, or be committed on or involve an Australian aircraft, this amendment would mean that these regulations could be applied to this offence even though the offence may not, under previous laws, have been committed where Australian jurisdiction applies. Australia still requires all international airlines to operate under the Australian security program when operating within Australia and these regulations will apply accordingly. 
This legislation also defines the meaning of `unlawful interference with aviation'. Integral to the understanding and application of this bill, the definition clearly sets out what is considered to be unlawful interference with aviation, in what situations an act may be considered to be unlawful interference and why. Previously, unlawful interference pretty much started and stopped with what was defined as taking control of an aircraft by force, threat of force or by any other intimidation. In short, regulations pretty much started and stopped with hijacking. In the current security climate there is obviously still a real concern that this kind of unlawful interference may well take place; but this legislation broadens the definition of what is considered unlawful interference, as there are many other ways that the safety of an aircraft may be jeopardised.
Notwithstanding that, as I have said, this government will endeavour to provide the most dynamic and effective aviation security laws possible. Being a frequent flyer I have witnessed the many changes and improvements in airports, including regional airports, and aircraft security and I have to say I feel more comfortable for them. What many people consider to be an inconvenience, many more consider to be a necessity in order to prevent the likes of September 11 2001 from happening again. I take this opportunity to commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—Before I focus on my formal remarks on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003, I will react to some of the remarks just made by the member for Barker. He talked about the relaxed atmosphere at regional airports and how it is difficult to imagine that terrorists would threaten his constituents. The recent incident at Sydney Airport, when it was closed down as a result of people flying in from Tamworth and entering a sterile area of the airport, even though they had not had a security threat, surely should indicate to the member for Barker and people in this House that this is a very serious issue that affects all Australians.
People living in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere in regional Australia, like the member for Barker, have to imagine that they are linked into the security problems that affect all Australians, especially at the major airports. We should remember that the greatest terrorist incident in modern times, September 11, began in Portland, Maine, where we all saw the grainy pictures from the security cameras of Mohammed Atta and his confederate boarding a plane unchecked by security that enabled them to then get into transit at Logan Airport in Boston and commence their evil work. The suggestion that people in regional Australia cannot imagine or do not want strong security measures is something that I cannot believe, and this matter needs to be addressed.
The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 brings the framework for aviation security up to date. It has been revised continually by the Department of Transport and Regional Services over the past four years. This has become a more vital process in light of the increased security threat to aviation since 2001. Despite the need for this bill, there are some important changes that Labor believes need to be further incorporated in it. We need to reassure the travelling public that they are not risking their lives by travelling on aircraft. This must be done through ensuring that the legislation surrounding aviation transport security is consistent and removes all foreseeable risks. Unfortunately, the current legislation fails somewhat in consistency and fails to protect passengers travelling from regional airports and on charter aircraft. This needs to be looked at. 
In its present form, the bill provides extensive powers to the departmental secretary to work with and, if necessary, direct the aviation industry in Australia regarding aviation security. Much of the secretary's powers are already in delegated legislation—the air navigation regulations. We are proposing an amendment that the new powers go to the minister, not to the departmental secretary. They should go to an elected representative who can be held accountable to the parliament for the decisions they make. However, the bill incorporates some important additions, such as the special security directions covered in the new sections 66-74. They are designed to allow the government to respond quickly to threats of unlawful interference with aviation where the current standards or measures are insufficient, inappropriate or do not adequately address an emerging situation or technology. There are no equivalent provisions in either the Air Navigation Act 1920 or the Air Navigation Regulations 1947.
The power to issue special security directions lies with the secretary of the department. They can only be issued according to new paragraphs 67(1)(a) and (b) where `a specific threat of unlawful interference is made or exists or is a change in the nature of an existing general threat of unlawful interference with aviation'. Presumably the decision about where these circumstances exist lies with the secretary. There is no requirement for the decision to be made on reasonable grounds. There needs to be some form of criteria stipulating what circumstances give the secretary or the minister the grounds to issue such special security directions. We need to ensure that we balance the need for increasing security with civil rights. The departmental secretary should not have the power to issue special security directions; this should lie with the minister, as I have said.
In some cases the bill sets out very substantial powers for aviation security personnel, accompanied by prison terms for hindering the exercise of these powers—particularly new sections 84-85. The extent to which such additions are strictly necessary to implement Australia's obligations under the Chicago convention is probably open to debate, but there is little doubt that there is a public expectation of stringent control of aviation security post September 11 2001.
The stop and search power may be exercised in relation to both people and vehicles in airside areas if the officer `reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so for the purposes of safeguarding against unlawful interference in aviation'. The search of a person may be an ordinary search or a frisk search. These searches can only be done on persons or vehicles that have stopped in an airside area. The officer must identify themselves and inform the person why they are being stopped or searched. A person who hinders or obstructs—including by failing to do something—an officer in exercising their stop and search power is subject to imprisonment for up to two years. For such an offence to have occurred, the person must have intended to engage in hindering or obstructing conduct and been reckless as to its effect on the ability of the officer to stop and search. 
There is no stop and search power in the existing Air Navigation Act 1920 or the Air Navigation Regulations 1947. Indeed the power to conduct a search of a person without the need by the relevant officer to reasonably believe that the person has committed or is committing an offence is unusual. Even the proposed `stop and search' section 18B of the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003 has the requirement of the `likely ... commission of an offence'. The effect of the key phrase `purposes of safeguarding against unlawful interference in aviation' in new subsection 84(1) of the bill is potentially rather broad, given the comments made earlier in the digest about the definition of `unlawful interference in aviation'. The explanatory memorandum states:
...this power is required is required because [airside areas] are high risk in terms of potential unlawful interference with aviation.
The most important element of the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003 is item 2 of schedule 2, which is an expansion of Australian Protective Services officers' power to arrest without warrant. Item 2 also acts to import other significant new law enforcement powers proposed under the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003. Again, increased powers of searching and arrest without warrant need to be balanced with the civil rights of individuals in Australia. Standards and regulations need to be put in place across the country ensuring security staff are trained consistently and have clear a understanding of what are reasonable grounds for exercising these increased powers. We have proposed a second reading amendment, which the member for Batman has discussed in this House, which:
 (7)	calls on the Government to require that the regulator consult formally with aviation industrial organisations—
such as the LHMU—
on an ongoing basis in respect of security matters ...
It also:
(1)	condemns the Government for the unnecessary confusion that will be caused by its insistence on using a whole new terminology in its legislation instead of using and building on the terminology already used in the industry and recognised inter-nationally;
(2)	calls on the Government to ensure that the regulations spell out agreed, clear and consistent roles and respons-ibilities for land-side security between the different operators and authorities;
(3)	calls on the Government to improve the accountability and transparency of the aviation security rule making, compliance and incident investigation governance arrangements;
(4)	calls on the Government to discuss with industry appropriate ways to close the security gap caused by the ability of unscreened service personnel and unchecked vehicles to access aircraft;
(5)	calls on the Government to impose stricter controls, cross-checking and audit arrangements on who is using ASIC passes, to minimise the number of missing passes;
(6)	calls on the Government to use the proceeds from the Ansett `ticket tax' to have screening equipment and related physical infrastructure provided in respect of the airports at;
(a)	Burnie;
(b)	Devonport;
(c)	Dubbo;
(d)	Albury;
(e)	Wagga Wagga;
(f)	Gladstone
(g)	Port Lincoln;
(h)	Tamworth;
(i)	Port Macquarie; and 
(j)	Kingscote
if requested by the relevant airport managers ...
Surely the incident that I outlined with Tamworth and Sydney airport indicates the necessity for this. Further, the amendment:
(8)	calls on the Minister to ask the House Transport and Regional Services Committee to conduct a post-implementation review of the new security arrange-ments within 12 months of the bills commencement”.
These seven changes should be incorporated to ensure we have an optimal aviation transport security system. In 1998, prior to September 11, when the extent of the threat posed to passenger aircraft became apparent, the Australian National Audit Office released a report entitled Aviation security in Australia. The report found that, although aircraft security was satisfactory and ensured Australia's compliance with the standards embodied in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, there were areas where Australia's aviation security regime could be strengthened, including the screening of passengers and baggage. Five years after this report and two years after the devastating use of passenger aircraft in the September 11 attacks, there are still some areas of weakness in passenger aviation security in Australia. This bill goes some way in addressing these issues, but in my view it does not go far enough.
The continuing threat to passenger aircraft, even with the increased security since September 11, is evident in the spate of incidents in Australian domestic airports and with domestic airliners. For instance, in June this year a Sydney man wielding a Stanley knife got on board a Virgin flight from Sydney to Cairns. On 29 May, a man armed with two sharpened wooden stakes allegedly tried to hijack a Qantas jet between Melbourne and Launceston. Recently, I read of a newspaper reporter and a photographer who just strolled on to the tarmac at Bundaberg Airport. The reporter said: `I cannot comment on other regional airports throughout the state, but Bundaberg security appeared relatively easy to breach. Surely there would be a bigger chance of someone wanting to get on a flight from Bundaberg to Brisbane, rather than the other way around.' That is precisely the point. The reporter had gone through all of the security at Sydney airport and come back to Bundaberg, but flying the other way he had exactly the same experiences as Mohamed Atta had—no security. He was able to get on at a regional airport with very little security and come to a major airport without having been checked properly.
Another example of this kind of threat is what Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, did on a Paris-Miami flight. According to the FBI, he packed in the soles of his shoes enough high explosives to blow a hole in the fuselage of the aircraft, which would have caused the aircraft to explode, killing all of the 197 people on board. Luckily, he was overpowered by passengers. I remember an extraordinary report that noted that 37 men donated their belts to restrain him and he was sedated by an onboard doctor until the flight was diverted to Logan, where he was arrested. Although Reid was initially assumed to be operating independently using an Internet bomb recipe, it was later discovered that he had receiving training in Afghanistan by al-Qaeda. The bomb inside his shoe was sophisticated. In fact, it turned out to be a favourite of European al-Qaeda operatives. This case illustrates how security systems can be infiltrated and what the continuing risks that we are facing are, even with more advanced security.
It is essential that legislation relating to aviation transport security is not just satisfactory but optimal. That is why I found the remarks of the member for Barker a little too relaxed and comfortable. We cannot allow risks such as these to remain. We need to ensure that assessments of the security situation are undertaken at overseas airports used by Australian carriers. This presents a risk to Australian aircraft travellers and to domestic targets. For example, in June this year a Qantas flight from Perth to Singapore had a security scare where a knife believed to be a box cutter—the same type as used in the September 11 hijackings—was found on board. A spokesman for transport minister Anderson said he believed the knife was smuggled on in Jakarta, where Australian Qantas staff have no control over screening procedures. 
I have drawn the attention of the Australian people to the possible need to include on civilian aircraft military style anti-missile devices, which have been used and are being successfully developed by our Defence Science and Technology Organisation for the equivalent of 737s. This is another area that links in very carefully with the potential threat in South-East Asia, particularly in Jakarta, Bangkok and Denpasar, where Qantas aircraft are at risk from the increased activities of al-Qaeda's local franchise, Jemaah Islamiah. The Air Navigation Act 1920 stipulates that the screening of passengers applies to regular domestic public transport aircraft and charter aircraft that are fitted to carry 100 passengers or more. However, a plane carrying fewer than 100 people is still capable of doing a great deal of damage. The lives of 99 people deserve as a stringent passenger screening as the lives of people at the artificial figure of 100. This cut-off point means that charter planes taking off at the moment from large cities such as Sydney and Melbourne, as well as from smaller cities, could become easy targets.
In February this year the hijacking of a light plane occurred in Central Queensland. A man forced a pilot to fly a Cessna 210 from Hedlow airfield near Rockhampton to Mackay. Small planes obviously have the ability to cause damage. Remember that in early 2002 a 15-year-old American student committed suicide by flying a light plane into a high-rise building in Florida. Real risks are still present. Even charter planes with international destinations are only required to screen passengers when they are fitted to carry 38 passengers or more. Again, in my view, this presents a real threat to travellers and targets not only domestic but also international.
As planes only require passenger screening where they are fitted to carry 100 passenger or more, a number of regional airports do not have passenger or carry-on-baggage screening. This includes destinations such as Burnie, Devonport and Wagga. According to the Department of Transport and Regional Services, 161 regional airports Australia-wide handle commercial flights without regulated security screening. There are approximately 200,000 passenger movements per year using Rex and Qantas Link aircraft and servicing a population area of 90,000 citizens. These do not have any passenger or luggage screening procedures at all; this is before taking into consideration passenger movements of smaller aircraft such as Airnorth and charter aircraft companies. In my view, this is a real and present danger.
An independent review conducted by the Southern Cross group found that regional airports presented a real risk of terrorist attacks against capital cities because of poor security, staffing and resources. It was found that commercial passenger aircraft were being left unguarded overnight on regional airstrips. The safety of regional airports is something that needs to be addressed more consistently by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The Australian National Audit Office's report said that there were limitations in terms of monitoring the current security arrangements. In January 2003 the ANAO released a report on aviation security. The report, which was relatively narrow in scope, examined the progress of the Department of Transport and Regional Services against key recommendations of the 1998 audit. This 2003 report concluded: 
As the body with regulatory responsibilities, DOTARS could show more pro-active leadership to effectively engage the various organisations and people involved in delivering aviation security, particularly as security relies on everyone playing their part to ensure an effective outcome ... DOTARS can demonstrate stronger leadership by setting, monitoring and reviewing performance targets for industry, and by using a wider range of management strategies to encourage industry to achieve them. In this context, progress in implementing the recommendations from the 1998 audit has been limited. Instead, DOTARS efforts have been focused on modernising the aviation security regulatory framework.
The Australian government is not providing any funding for increased security measures, and the airlines are responsible for funding the new requirements the government is putting into place. Qantas has been installing enhanced security doors to cockpits in its aircraft at a cost running to millions. The Australian government is the only Western government not contributing directly to the increased costs of airline security. This places airlines in Australia at a competitive disadvantage—particularly Qantas, which competes internationally.
I will conclude by saying that I think the Australian government and the minister for transport are being too relaxed and comfortable about the measures as a whole, particularly in relation to regional airport security. The shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, has focused on this area forensically and it ought to be taken far more seriously in understanding the pattern of how these regional airports have been used by terrorists such as al-Qaeda. We have the clear example of what they did in Portland, Maine; it was from there they took the aircraft, which they got onto at Logan in Boston, by which they were able to commit their evil deed. I am not saying that the same thing will be repeated in Australia, but that is why the issue of regional aircraft security should be taken very seriously.
Similarly, I believe that the possibility of Australian aircraft being damaged or attacked in South-East Asia has to be taken very seriously by this government. The issue of anti-missile devices for key Qantas aircraft, provided that they are affordable, ought to be looked into. It perhaps should not be the sole responsibility of airlines to look into these matters. The Australian government should follow and do what has been done by the US Congress.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 is about safety—the safety of our people and of our economy. We all know that aviation transport is an integral part of Australia's infrastructure and that it is essential to many regional areas and to a variety of business sectors. For Australian businesses to prosper and for our economy to grow, we must ensure that our aviation industry is both safe and reliable. In fact, we have to do more than that. The government and the industry working together have to ensure that people can be confident in the safety and reliability of the industry.
Since September 11, 2001, governments throughout the world have been working with the aviation sector to find ways to make security controls more effective—a focus which was intensified by the Bali bombings. We saw downturns occur with airlines throughout the world as people stopped flying. People became fearful of hijack and sabotage. Many did not want to expose themselves to the possibility or the threat of terrorist acts or expose their families to the worry of their travelling; so many simply stopped flying. The Howard government is committed to safeguarding Australia and responding to the changed security environment in the best possible way. This legislation is part of that commitment. It is aimed at protecting our airports, the aviation industry and our economy; but, more importantly, it is aimed at protecting the people of Australia—at keeping them safe and at helping them to feel confident in that safety. 
A secure aviation environment requires regulations that prevent incidents of unlawful interference, such as hijack or sabotage. This bill is therefore aimed at the deterrence, the detection and the prevention of such attempted hijack or sabotage. It aims to do so—that is, deter, detect and prevent—as safely as possible for airline and airport workers as well as for the travelling public. The current aviation security regulatory framework is spread across a number of legislative tools, which has resulted in unnecessary complications in administering those laws and ensuring compliance. These difficulties not only inhibit accountability and transparency but also, worse than that, endanger our security.
The Australian National Audit Office tabled a report on 16 January 2003 which clearly states that government action is needed to consolidate and simplify aviation security. The Howard government has responded. We have before us a bill which not only replaces and simplifies the current range of legislative tools but also incorporates a range of ANAO recommendations to overcome what the ANAO saw as problems or loopholes in security systems. At the same time, this bill brings Australia into line with international standards of aviation security by including measures outlined in annex 17 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the Chicago convention. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit picked up that report of the Auditor-General, which was tabled in parliament in January, and is currently carrying out an inquiry into aviation security. It is probably not proper for me to comment on the progress of that inquiry until the chairman reports to the parliament, but many of the concerns expressed by other speakers about security at regional airports are being addressed by that inquiry. That committee will report to parliament.
You cannot have an aviation industry separate from the rest of the world. Australians cannot say, `This is our country. We don't care what laws operate in other countries,' because our airports are connected to the rest of the world by multiple flights every day. It is therefore impossible to have aviation security without international agreements regarding the security of airports, passengers, cargo and luggage. These international standards for aviation security are framed in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the Chicago convention, of which Australia is a founding member. This bill recognises the global importance of aviation security and ensures that our standards align with the international aviation security standards outlined in annex 17 of the Chicago convention. This bill conveys the message that aviation security is everyone's responsibility, that everyone has an obligation to comply with security measures so that that security is not compromised. The responsibility does not lie solely with the security guards, the airlines, the airport management or even—despite what some people may think—the government. It belongs to all those groups—the government and members of the industry—as well as members of the public.
This legislation will clarify the roles and responsibilities of the different parties and enhance the capacity of the government to monitor and improve compliance with industry standards. Its provisions reflect the aviation industry's primary role in delivering security outcomes and the Commonwealth's role in regulating for those outcomes, monitoring compliance and encouraging their achievement. This bill aims to ensure a consolidated, consistent, modern and transparent framework for aviation security. We have looked at why we need this legislation, but before I move on to the specific measures and safeguards contained in the bill I would like to quickly list those reasons again, because they are important. We need this bill in order to provide security standards that will protect both the aviation industry and our people; to provide standards that align with agreed international standards; to provide a single legislative framework for those security standards instead of a jumble of parts of different acts; to ensure legislation that can be quickly modified to meet any evolving security threat; to ensure that members of the industry know what their role is in delivering security outcomes; and to ensure public confidence in industry compliance, and therefore in aviation security and safety. 
Airports have been categorised by the department according to the potential risk of unlawful interference being committed at that airport. For instance, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne are all category 1—the highest risk—while Maroochydore, in my electorate, is category 4 and Weipa, in Far North Queensland on Cape York, is category 5. Many small airports have not been included in any category but can be categorised if their potential risk changes. The allocated category determines the airport's security requirements, with category 1 requiring a more robust and comprehensive mix than category 5 requires. This allows much more flexibility than having the same security requirements for all—for example, having the same requirements for Sydney airport as for the airport at Longreach.
Within those security controlled airports, designated by the secretary, there will be gazetted airside and landside areas. Within each of these areas, one or more security zones can be established, which therefore allows security regulation appropriate to the need in a number of different areas of the airport. This means that the more stringent measures can be applied in key areas, with lesser, more appropriate, measures in other areas. This allows for flexibility and commonsense without detriment to security. The government is aware that being categorised as a security controlled airport has a significant effect on the business of an airport operator. However, it has tried to balance the need for security—the need to prevent unlawful interference with aviation—with the need for commercial efficiency and cost-effective services to regional Australia. The term `unlawful interference with aviation' comes from the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Perhaps we should take a serious look at what it means; how it is defined in this bill and in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. Let us look at exactly what this bill is aimed at preventing.
The list covers hijacking, sabotage, planting or detonating a bomb, interfering with air navigation aids such as beacons or signals, or doing anything on board that puts the safety of the aircraft or its passengers at risk. Let me repeat some of those—hijacking, sabotage, planting a bomb, deliberately causing a plane crash by interfering with navigation aids. These are not minor offences. They are real dangers—potential disasters in both human and economic terms. Unfortunately, we have seen in recent events that there are forces of evil who are willing and eager to perpetrate these offences.
These bills therefore requires that, in order to operate their business, certain aviation industry participants need to have a security program that demonstrates both their understanding of their roles and responsibilities regarding aviation security, and their ability to meet those security obligations. Although this currently only applies to operators of security controlled airports and operators of a prescribed air service, clause 12(c) of the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 allows, if necessary, for regulation to be made regarding other specific participants, thereby allowing flexibility to react quickly to a new security threat.  
More specific security measures already familiar to air travellers—such as the screening of passengers and luggage and the carrying of weapons or prohibited items—are dealt with in part 4 of the bill. This part also allows for regulations to be made to the management of passengers in the cabin, pre-flight checks on the cabin and other parts of the aircraft, and the security of baggage before and during loading. It provides regulations for the security of persons in custody at airports or on an aircraft, and permits the pilot, in some circumstances, to refuse to allow such persons on board. 
Part 5 of this bill ensures that people who are integral to the security of our airports, planes and people—aviation security inspectors, law enforcement officers, airport security guards and screening officers—have the necessary authority with which to do their job. For instance, screening officers can ask a person to remove items of clothing, or a law enforcement officer can stop and search a person or a vehicle in particular areas. 
Because this government is about balance—between responsibility and accountability; between authority and responsibility—there is balance in these bills. While the bills quite rightly and reasonably endow authority, they also rightly and reasonably establish restrictions on that authority. For instance, on the one hand, a person who obstructs an aviation security inspector commits an offence; on the other hand, an inspector `must not subject a person to greater indignity than is necessary and reasonable' in performing his or her duties. Let me give you another example. Under this legislation, a law enforcement officer can stop and search people or vehicles in particular areas of an airport, but the officer must then identify himself or herself, tell the person why they are being stopped and why they are being searched. That is only fair. But, in the pursuit of fairness and balance, we should not lose sight of what we are trying to achieve here—the safety of our people and of Australian aviation. Some of the offences dealt with, therefore, are criminal offences; however these bills also provide enforcement flexibility by allowing a range of options such as infringement notices, enforcement orders, injunctions and a demerit point system. 
I do not believe that the Labor Party can genuinely argue against the need for aviation security or against these bills, which are designed to meet that security need. But I would like to touch on why the government should be doing all the regulating—why the industry cannot be self-regulating. Ensuring aviation security is like building a rock wall with a range of materials from large boulders down to small rocks. The range of rocks, big and small, must be fitted firmly together to ensure the overall strength of the structure because any breach, any weak area, in the wall threatens the whole secured area. In the aviation industry there is a diverse range of participants and, even with consulting processes, the power differentials among participants could be to the detriment of parity and universal compliance.
The only way to ensure a complete framework of regulation and universal compliance with that regulation is for the government to grasp the responsibility. Lack of compliance, like a weak spot or hole in the wall, may lead to a breaching of the wall. It is too important to leave to self-regulation within the industry. These bills will provide the industry with required outcomes—minimum security requirements—but will still allow those industry members discretion in how they meet the prescribed standards in the most cost-effective manner. True, there will be some cost to industry in meeting the standards. But those standards minimise the risk of a significant aviation security incident—do not forget that we are talking of sabotage, hijacking or bombing—which would cost the industry much more.  
These bills address shortcomings, ambiguities, loopholes and omissions in the existing range of acts, providing a legislative framework for aviation security that will enhance certainty and transparency. They provide the framework for government and industry to work together to provide safety, security and confidence in the Australian aviation industry. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003, which update the regulatory framework under which aviation security is conducted. They seek to align Australia with international civil aviation standards and respond to the changed threat environment which the aviation industry now operates within. These bills, as we have heard from many of the speakers in this House on this debate, are important, and I will be supporting them, alongside the amendments that the shadow minister will be moving.
In Australia we have been pretty complacent about security. We often think that security incidents will not happen to us personally and that they cannot happen here in this country that is so lucky. We have had a pretty happy-go-lucky approach to the world; it is part of our charm as we travel around as international tourists and as international tourists travel to our country. To some extent, that complacency is part of our charm. But, since September 11 and Bali, we have had our eyes opened to the reality of terrorism and to the reality that the world we live in is full of conflicts and hatreds that we now have to understand and know a lot more about. That means that we have to get real about security and to minimise, as far as is humanly possible, the risk to our people. 
We have been incredibly fortunate in this country that the aviation security incidents that have occurred have not been related to terrorism. They have on the whole occurred due to domestic grievances. That does not make them any less serious in their possible consequences, but we have not, to date, faced on our shores a direct terrorist threat to aviation security. Our job as parliamentarians is not, however, to just sit back and say, `We have been pretty fortunate; isn't that terrific'. Our job is to assess the risk of what might happen and to, as far as we can, introduce systems and procedures that will prevent threats to aviation security.
One approach to law-making that has grown exponentially under this government is the development of regulations, the number of which has exploded. In effect, the government has been moving away from the complex content of decisions coming from parliament, and they have come far more from the bureaucracy. I know that this does allow for greater flexibility and speed in changing regulatory regimes—and that is an important factor, particularly in a changed security context—but it also often leaves the opposition and minor parties in the difficult situation of having to consider complex legislation without having seen the regulations. This happens time and time again to us, and it is a procedure that the government has increasingly used. The principles of the legislation are often things that we support, but I think that most people know that the devil is in the detail and that is the problem for the people on whom the regulations impact the most—often the people we represent, particularly in regional seats such as mine. 
The regulations underpinning the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 have been provided, which I guess is at least something, but they have been provided pretty late in the day. As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit inquiry into aviation security, I have yet to have a good look at them. The Senate has been unable to scrutinise them in the context of debating this bill, and the latest version of the regulations is not, as I understand it, being distributed particularly widely. 
I want to turn to some of the parts of the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003. The bill is constructed in 10 parts, The preliminary part looks at the objects of the bill, its application both inside and outside Australia, and definitions. I will not go into the details of those; they are broadly supported. But the issue of the detailed definition of `unlawful interference with aviation' is intended to provide greater clarity within the bill. There have been some concerns raised about what it means in terms of industrial action that has been taken on airport sites, and I hope that there is going to be some clarity provided in the minister's response to the speeches on the second reading of this bill about the impact of industrial action and the definition of `unlawful interference'—if there is going to be any conflict between those two.
The other parts of the bill relate to transport security programs. This part requires various aviation industry participants to develop and comply with a transport security program. These programs will regulate the operation of all persons performing a security function on behalf of the program holder. Regulations will provide additional detail on the content and form of the transport security programs. The programs will be approved by the secretary of the department if they are adequate, they may be cancelled by the secretary in certain circumstances, and they will be reviewed over time to maintain relevance.
Part 3 looks at airport areas and zones; part 4 deals with other security measures; part 5 looks at the powers of officials; part 6 is about reporting aviation security incidents—and I want to talk a bit more about some concerns I have in relation to those; information gathering is contained within part 7; part 8 looks at the whole issue of enforcement; part 9 deals with review of decisions; and part 10 has a range of miscellaneous items that I will not go into detail about. 
As I have said previously, the legislation is a vital part of our security system within Australia, but it has been a long time coming. The bill has had a long period of gestation, and the fine details of the regulations underpinning the bill are still, as we debate them, being discussed and massaged into shape. The Australian National Audit Office first recommended improvements to aviation regulation in 1998. A bill was introduced in 2001 but was not passed before the proroguing of the last parliament. The bill was reintroduced in the same form in 2002 but then replaced after a rethink, on the government's part, on the policy direction. The follow-up Audit Office report, which was released earlier this year, found that while the Department of Transport and Regional Services had responded effectively to the events of September 11, the department had not acted on the recommendations in the 1998 report.  
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is now undertaking an inquiry into aviation security, and we have taken over 70 submissions and had hours of public hearings. Our report is currently being drafted and, whilst it is inappropriate to pre-empt the committee's recommendations and the chairman's report from that inquiry, there are some clear themes that have emerged during the submissions and public hearings that I want to reflect upon. They include concern about lack of screening at regional airports and other security measures. Of course, we have also heard evidence about the cost of introducing those measures and the need for a balance but, if our primary concern is improving aviation security, we have to look very seriously at what is happening at our regional airports.
We also heard evidence about concern over the integrity of the ASIC pass system, particularly for those people who have left employment in the aviation sector. We also heard evidence about the ease with which ASIC passes could be forged. There was also concern over the non-ASIC passholder system—for example, what is happening with relation to casual staff and visitors to airports who are making deliveries. We also heard evidence in relation to the action, or lack of action, taken when breaches have occurred; evidence about the lack of action on implementation of security on aircraft, particularly in relation to cockpit security; and evidence on the lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities in aviation security and the interaction with aviation safety.
We have also had evidence presented to us about breaches of security at Customs and DOTARS that attracted some publicity. Whilst we are advised that the breaches have not resulted in a risk to aviation security, they have led many of us to question whether the culture of security in our own government departments is adequate. These departments are now part of the whole aviation system; as such, any regulatory regime must apply equally to their part of the system. This leads me to raise an issue I have, not with the legislation itself, but with the policy idea underpinning it. That is about the investigation of security breaches. Currently, DOTARS writes the aviation regulations, monitors and audits their compliance, and investigates security breaches or breakdowns. From a policy point of view, this is not good process. It means that there is little transparency or accountability in these investigations.
DOTARS is not an independent regulator in the aviation security system. It is now very much a part of that system and, in my view, should not be responsible for investigating incidents. The system that operates in aviation safety would seem to me to be a far more transparent and appropriate process. There are several other areas where the bills should be enhanced and improved in looking at trying to separate the investigation of incidents out from DOTARS.
The first is in relation to consultation. The most valuable evidence that the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit has received in its aviation security inquiry has been from workers within the aviation sector. We have heard from ground staff, both permanent and casual, and a range of other staff who have spent a lot of their working lives in airports. Rather than glossy sanitised presentations that have been full of acronyms and bland assurances, we have heard from workers on the daily workings of airports and the large contrast between what management says is happening and what is actually happening.
For that reason alone I want to encourage the government and the department to consult with workers and their representatives in the trade union movement. There is a real danger that, with people within DOTARS and senior management in the aviation industry often far removed from the realities of the daily workings of airports, that we will end up creating a system of regulation for aviation security that looks pretty good on paper but in reality is not worth much more than that. 
It is really important for the government and the department to understand that often it is the workers—who in their daily working lives are being asked to implement these regulations—who have the best ideas about how these regulations might be formed. I understand the Flight Attendants Association and also Air Services Australia have asked to be formally included as industry participants for consultation with these regulations.
One of the other aspects that has been hard for us to sort through as we inquire into aviation security is the complex array of relationships between state and federal police, Customs, aviation safety and aviation security operators, various industry bodies and the various sections of government departments. The relationships are complex. Of great concern to me is that the responsibilities of each are often not very clear. This has been exacerbated in the bills because they introduce a whole new set of terminology that is not necessarily built on the current known set of terminology that operates within the aviation industry. It is really important that within the regulations there is a strong emphasis on the clarity of responsibilities and roles.
I have spoken previously about the issue of regional airports. Of the aviation security incidents that have occurred this year, we heard evidence at the inquiry that three of these involved people arriving from regional airports that were previously not categorised by DOTARS. One of these incidents in particular resulted in a major metropolitan airport being shut down. Again, it is incumbent upon the government to look seriously at the issue of regional airports. We have regional airports at Burnie, Devonport, Dubbo, Albury, Wagga Wagga, Gladstone, Port Lincoln, Tamworth, Port Macquarie and Kingscote which, to my understanding, currently do not have baggage screening. Many of these airports carry over 75,000 passengers each year.
Another issue that we have heard a lot of evidence about concerns ASIC passes and non-ASIC pass holders. There needs to be a much clearer understanding of this issue in the regulations and a much clearer government responsibility for what happens to the ASIC pass system, particularly when workers finish within the industry. Also, I would like to see a much clearer understanding of the ease with which those passes can be forged. I also want to know a little bit more about how they are updated and how people's security clearances are updated. I would like to see the government take far more responsibility for that.
Another complex issue is that airports are incredibly busy places, as most people who have flown anywhere in this country or driven around airports would know. There are people coming and going not just to take flights but to make deliveries every day. There are a large amount of goods and services moved through our airports and also a large amount of goods that are delivered to airports that are utilised there, either in the catering services or other businesses. Many goods need to be delivered to the shops within airports.
Part of the evidence that we have heard is that there are real concerns about visitors to airport. That is particularly in relation to those visitors who can potentially have access to airplanes or secure or sterile areas. I do not think that issue has been adequately addressed within what I have heard so far about the regulations. It is certainly not addressed enough within this bill. We need a stronger system in relation to the ASIC passes. 
Another issue that I have spoken about is in relation to DOTARS investigating security incidents. I want to talk a little bit about some of the evidence that we heard about the slowness of response to incidents. I want to highlight why it is important that we have a better system of incident investigation and incident reporting. Being on this inquiry has been a real eye-opener, I would have to say, to the sorts of incidents that have occurred.
I know that in the media we tend to highlight or worry far more about terrorist threats. Obviously, they are the prime concern that we all have. But the reality is that there have been a number of other incidents, 19 of which have occurred this year. While they have resulted generally from a domestic grievance—where someone has had something happen to them personally and has seen fit to try and do something on an airplane—the possible consequences of those are very serious. These regulations have to look at the whole spectrum of incidents that can possibly occur in aviation security.
We heard evidence from one of the ground staff about an incident that happened in July of this year. It is on the Hansard in the committee's hearings but I want to reflect on some of the things that were said. We heard from Mr Lipman about an incident that happened on 27 July. He said that security really is only as good as your last or most recent incident. This last incident involved a passenger who was travelling on a foreign airline and managed to get through three security doors in the international terminal and down onto the tarmac. He reportedly hopped into a vehicle and possibly drove it around the airport. Mr Lipman was not sure whether that happened; no-one actually saw the person driving the vehicle but some people said that they thought the vehicle had been moved.
The passenger was finally noticed by one of the ground transport workers. They are not 100 per cent sure how much time he spent on the tarmac, but he had certainly managed to get through three security doors to get there. He was brought to the attention of Mr Lipman and his colleagues working in the crewing office, which is at a fairly remote area of the Melbourne airport. When they asked who he was and how he got there, he refused to speak. My understanding is that, once they notified security, it took some 15 minutes and two calls before anyone came and took the man away so they could get some work done.
The concerning thing is that neither Mr Lipman nor his colleagues were involved in the debriefing about that incident. These were the people who actually apprehended the person; they saw what happened and where the security breach was. After collectively working for 32 years in the aviation industry, they would have some pretty good ideas about what happened and what might prevent it happening again, and yet they were not involved. They were not involved in the debriefing, they were not involved in the incident reporting and they were not involved in asking, `How might we prevent this ever happening again?' Apart from the trauma that happened to them—and I think they were offered counselling a bit later—you would hope that, in incidents such as this, management would consult with the workers about what happened and how this breach could be prevented from happening again. Unfortunately, that did not happen.
Mr Lipman said that there were other issues. Part of the problem the police had in attending the incident was that they could not find the area. It was a fairly remote area, but the map of the airport was far too complex. Mr Lipman said there were no emergency or duress buttons available for them to use, so phoning was really their only option. As I said, it took two calls and some 15 minutes before anybody came, and at the same time there were 30 to 40 other alarms going off within the airport. 
I only know about the incident, which was not widely reported in the media, because Mr Lipman had the courage to come and give some pretty strong evidence to our committee. To me, that shows we really need a much stronger and more competent system for the investigation of incidents. If, as Mr Lipman said, your security is only as good as your last or most recent incident, then we have to learn from such incidents to improve security. From the evidence we have heard so far regarding the incident on 27 July, it does not appear that we learnt very much from it at all.
I certainly hope we do not see another such incident. It seems to me that, in this age of heightened security, for someone to be able to get onto the tarmac of the international airport in Melbourne midway through this year is really not good enough. That is one of the things we have to look at. You can have all the regulations in the world but, if you do not involve and actively engage with the workers who are policing and working in the aviation field every day, then you are really not going to get very far. I want to again highlight how important the opposition see the issue of aviation security as being. We have been very complacent about aviation security in this country, and I hope we can work together. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2003-12-03,"—It is a sobering thought to realise that we have just marked the second anniversary of the September 11 atrocities, which claimed the lives of approximately 3,000 people in New York and Washington and on a lonely Pennsylvanian field. In a series of well-planned, deliberate, reprehensible and abominable acts, jet aircraft were transformed into flying missiles and used against an unsuspecting, unprepared and undeserving public. Nations such as ours, which abhor all forms of terrorist activity and oppose them in every way, can still be labelled as undeserving of such atrocities but no longer can it be said that Australia or any like-minded nation is either unsuspecting or unprepared.
The legislation before the House deals specifically with issues which have arisen since the atrocious events of September 11, as well as with more overarching concerns about domestic aviation security. The government has introduced a raft of legislation to strengthen our border security, build on our intelligence capabilities and protect our citizens from terrorist outrages. The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003 add to those measures.
I am sure those on the opposition benches appreciate the efforts of the government, and I trust we will see a measure of bipartisanship on this legislation. Airport and aviation security has been something of a bugbear for some time, even to the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union. On 30 May this year, the National Secretary of the LHMU Airport Security Union, Jeff Lawrence, called on the Australian government to provide:
... consistent standards across Australia at all airports—which demands a new commitment to resources from the Federal Government, from airlines, from airport operators and from security companies. 
This legislation delivers those standards, and its capacity to strengthen national aviation security is indicated by the 10 separate parts which make up this bill. The bill comprehensively addresses issues such as airport security programs, special secure zones within or around Australian airports, the powers of various officials overseeing airport security, reporting and information-gathering activities central to aviation security, and the enforcement of all aspects of the bill. In a nutshell, the bill replaces parts 3 and 3A of the Air Navigation Act 1920, simplifying the aviation regulatory regime and clarifying the responsibilities and accountability of all industry participants so both government and industry can act quickly and proactively in matters of aviation security.
As everyone in this building knows, Australia's aviation sector has undergone a rigorous, thorough and uncompromising series of security upgrades following the events of September 11. In no small way, this bill will build on those. But, even before the introduction of those new measures, Australia's history of airport and aircraft security has been quite remarkable, with only six major incidents occurring since commercial flights began in Australia.
To ensure that we maintain this exemplary record, I believe it is necessary to recognise three key points behind the government's introduction of the bill. First, we cannot and will not compromise on the security of the general public, and the sheer scale and scope of these regulations necessitates federal legislative measures. Second, the aviation industry is a pivotal player in the global economy, both as a contributor to and facilitator of economic activity. The aviation sector depends on consistent patronage to maintain cost-efficient international and domestic services, and any significant negative impact virtually guarantees unsustainable cost increases and a decline in market operations. Of course, this has a flow-on effect on almost every other industry and the market in general. Third, the only way to combat the ever-present threat of domestic and international terrorism is through a concerted multilateral effort, from government down to all parts of the nation, involving all peace-loving participants.
We all have a role to play in ensuring aviation security—everyone from the largest airport operator down to the individual passenger. This is one situation where the weakest link in the chain could result in the death of thousands. I had a security incident myself when I went to visit my son who manages resorts in the Caribbean. We could not take our full complement of luggage to the small island where he lived so we had to leave some of it at the major airport of Grand Cayman. When we came back, my luggage was just sitting to one side of the airport. I do not know how long it had been there. Although it was locked, one of the catches was up, which concerned me a bit, so I insisted the airport authorities go through my luggage with me just to make sure that it had not been tampered with. I think we all have to take that sort of responsibility, although I concede that that situation would be most unlikely to occur in Australia.
Earlier this year, aviation security consultant and former head of security for the British Airport Authority, Norman Shanks, raised this very issue while in Australia. In his professional opinion, a measured approach is the only way to craft a stricter and suitably appropriate security regime, even though Australian airports and planes are no more vulnerable than most airports around the world. His precise words were:
We have to look at this in terms of a) what is the real risk, b) how can we address that risk, and c) put measures in which are relative to that risk.
This legislation has been crafted around those concerns. Australia has always played a responsible role in international aviation security. We are a founding member of the Chicago convention, which goes back to 1944—a convention that frames global standards, including benchmarks and practices, in international aviation. This convention is amended and updated in a timely fashion to take into account changing technology, political environments et cetera, and these practices are even more important in the wake of that dreadful September 11 attack. As a signatory to the convention Australia is obliged to keep pace with these amendments, and this bill will bring our own legislation into line with those global amendments. 
One of the most important and highly visible steps in this process is the tightening of security in and around our major domestic and international airports. This bill and its amendments will allow for further tightening of our aviation security regime by building on the existing powers of airport security officers in relation to passenger and check-in bag screening. It will also give aviation security inspectors the power to control the movements of aircraft in flight or on the ground and to compel other aviation industry participants to establish their own security programs.
The move to introduce both airside and landside security zones is one which I wholly endorse,  particularly the creation of landside security zones, which will allow security-controlled airport operators to have greater control over the movement of people, vehicles and goods within public areas of airports. I think this is a most pertinent aspect of the bill; after all, many thousands of people walk into and out of major domestic airport terminals on a daily basis without receiving so much as a cursory glance. If a terrorist chose to attack a check-in line rather than a planeload of passengers, the end result would be the same: the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians, and chaos within the aviation sector. So bringing some security measures to the landside of airports is entirely justified in this day and age. Such measures are proposed for categorised airports, which are the 38 Australian airports, ranging in size from Sydney's Kingsford Smith through to Burnie in Tasmania, and which are already required to have a security program in place.
—Do they?
—That is what it says.
—I know what it says!
—Passenger screening is also required at 29 of those 38 airports that handle jet aircraft, with another three airports in the process of being added to the list. Those airports with a throughput of fewer than 30,000 passengers a year which are not serviced by jet aircraft—a couple in my electorate come under that category—will not be affected by this piece of legislation. But I do hope that, as the minister has said to me, there will be a continuing pattern of risk assessment and prioritisation that will filter down to smaller airports.
There has been a lot of comment in recent days about indemnifying our smaller, regional airports against the effects of this legislation. I have heard comments about the lack of security screening at some regional Queensland airports—words to the effect that a small twin-propeller aircraft which had been tampered with could pose a significant security risk once it landed at a larger, categorised airport. I can see the legitimacy of this argument, but I come back to the point that we must look at this issue realistically. Our security agencies have found absolutely no evidence that small aircraft have been or will be targeted by terrorists.
Having said that, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in its current review of aviation security in Australia, has already heard some concerns about security practices at our small regional airports as well as the costs associated with implementing improved security protocols. The inquiry is looking into matters of security regulation and compliance by airport operators and airlines, the impact of overseas security requirements on Australian aviation security, the cost of security upgrades and privacy implications, and opportunities for improvement afforded by new technology. 
To date, the inquiry has received 70 submissions. One of the key areas of concerns is the cost associated with the implementation of a new security regime at categorised airports. With respect to Bundaberg and Gladstone airports in my electorate of Hinkler, responsibility for implementing and maintaining security matters falls primarily to the local government authorities. I have no doubt that each of them would face tremendous difficulties in funding such high-level security measures if they were to be included under the umbrella of this legislation. 
As chairman of the government's inquiry into commercial regional aviation services in Australia and transport links to major populated islands, I have had the privilege of insight into the issues and problems facing our domestic airline services. Our committee—the report for which we tabled on Monday—received more than 190 submissions, heard from 111 witnesses, had 33 exhibits and 14 days of public hearings. We looked into many aspects of what was impeding regional aviation. This is not the forum to go into those in detail, but I will touch on the issue of security.
One of the recommendations in the report was that, for cities with a population of fewer than 30,000—and that is not to be confused with an earlier part of my speech where I talked about throughput of 30,000—it was our view that it would be very difficult for councils to continue to maintain the standard of airports, especially runways, tarmacs and essential maintenance, without some form of Commonwealth assistance. We recommended a 50 per cent subsidy for those airports—perhaps a hub airport being run by a small council—where there is not a rate base to look after that. Where there were less frequent RPT services but perhaps major charter, crop-dusting or aerial ambulance, we recommended a subsidy of 33 per cent.
We went on in our recommendations to say that when the joint standing committee's report on aviation security comes down, if it is deemed that security should be put in place in those airports, for cities with a population of fewer than 30,000, consistent with the recommendations about the essential maintenance and the upgrading of runways and tarmac areas, we believe that the Commonwealth should help the councils or airport boards that are running those airports. If we are forced to implement the same security standards in those smaller airports, we could find a funding crisis within the ranks of local government. Many of them are already subsidising their airports and many councils see this as a cost shifting to them.
At this stage, the bill is relevant only to Australia's categorised airports. I am sure all members understand the need for flexibility in updating security practices at Australian airports—it is simply to stay one step ahead of those who would seek to use aircraft or airports as weapons against the wider community. Legislation must reflect the needs and expectations of a nation. To that end, the bill today also includes a number of amendments which add to and enhance Australia's current aviation security regime. Through these amendments, the government will achieve a comprehensive aviation security network which addresses both on-the-ground safety measures and security in the air.
The `powers of officials' amendment will give screening officers further powers when it comes to screening people at airports. Screening officers will have the right to conduct limited frisk searches of individuals—with their consent—if they are unable to be security cleared by normal practices, such as passing through a metal detector. It will also allow for an individual to undergo a frisk search should they prefer not to be screened electronically. People with, for example, pacemakers may prefer not to go through those devices, and this will allow them to have an alternative practice. 
Let me make one thing abundantly clear: security officers cannot conduct frisk searches without an individual's consent, and this bill does not stipulate that frisk searches are mandatory. This government are well aware of the privacy implications that may be raised by these practices, but we are serious about people's security. In the event of an individual refusing to be frisked—and presumably not going through a screening device—they will not be allowed entry to the security controlled section of an airport, let alone an aircraft.
On 29 May this year, we saw a man try to hijack a jet flying from Melbourne to Launceston in Tasmania. Members of the House would be aware of this incident. He was armed with two wooden stakes, and managed to stab two flight attendants and injure two passengers before he was subdued and taken into custody after an emergency landing at Melbourne airport. The man in question had passed through metal detectors prior to boarding the aircraft—and of course the metal detector failed to pick up the wooden stakes. By codifying the power of screening officers to request frisk searches and to prevent the further passage of an individual who might refuse, we will, to the best of human ability, prevent such incidents occurring in the future.
An incident at Sydney's domestic terminal early last November, where airline staff were detected using their own passes to admit passengers to a terminal, demonstrated the effectiveness of the security and screening procedures already in place. The department of transport's First Assistant Secretary, Transport Security Regulation, Andrew Tongue, told a recent Senate estimates hearing that the airport's response—the evacuation and closure of the terminal and the re-screening of all passengers—was according to the book. So we are already seeing our security regime working, even in an overt incident like that.
I think there will be general consensus that the bill contains measures that are sensible and responsible. They underscore the government's commitment to the safest possible aviation environment for Australians—within their own country, going overseas and coming back into their own country. I have no hesitation in commending this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 is indeed a very important one, as all members of this House and this parliament recognise. We are talking about air safety—the safety of the travelling public and of our aircrews—and, of course, associated with this security bill is discussion about safety on the ground in our local communities. It is part and parcel of national security—that is how important it is.
It is interesting to note that in this House there have been very few voices heard in discussion of aviation transport security in regional Australia, though I notice that the independent member for New England has been one who has spoken. I have been surprised by the absence of comment in this House about the lack of aviation security in regional Australia. I suspect that many of those arguments are based on cost; I certainly hope those arguments are not based on a lack of concern for those people who live in regional Australia. I have gotten the distinct impression over time, when we have been talking about aviation security, that regional Australians are regarded as second-class citizens. When you do raise the issue of aviation security—as I have and as the member for New England has in this House several times; and not just here but in correspondence with the minister, and I will return to that later—you are given the impression that you know nothing and that you are a country bumpkin, that we do not know anything about security assessments. 
To live in a region as I do on the north-west coast of Tasmania, which has two categorised airports—I am not talking about airports in the outback dealing just with light aircraft; I am talking about categorised airports, and in this legislation categorised airports are categorised because they have security risks—and to be told that I do not know anything about security assessment, or `what would my people know,' and that I am a scaremonger and so forth is an insult to me and to the communities I represent. I was heartened by the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, that now we have reviews going on which are starting to take note of the concerns of regional Australia, as should be the case. That is the issue I want to raise in relation to aviation security and this legislation.
The shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, on this side of the House, has responded comprehensively to this legislation, pointing out both the positives and, importantly, some of the flaws that we regard as being present in this legislation, and is moving amendments that deal with those flaws. Indeed, they number eight, one of which—amendment (6)—relates specifically to regional airports and the ability to finance security screening at those airports. I will return to that in a moment. The minister, in his second reading speech on the Aviation Transport Security Bill, opened his remarks by saying:
We are all deeply conscious of the need to be vigilant about aviation safety. The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 recognises the responsibilities of all aviation security participants, from the largest airport operator down to the ordinary passenger. We must all be involved in aviation security.
I took the minister up on his invitation, and what better way to do that—other than by asking questions and raising issues in this House—than to write to the minister. That is my responsibility as a member of parliament; I would be derelict in my duty if I did not. Of course, if the minister disagrees with me—apart from pooh-poohing me in the House as he has several times and having comments made by his spokespeople in my region to attack some of my comments—then I expect the minister to reply to my official correspondence and deal with my issues there.
On 6 November 2001, not long after the terrible tragedy that occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001, I wrote to Mr Anderson about my local airports at Burnie and Devonport. I remind the House that I come from a region of around 112,000 people: we now call it the Cradle Coast region, which takes in King Island, parts of the west coast of Tasmania and the north-west coast itself. Devonport Airport is assessed at category 4 and Burnie Airport is category 5, and they deal with over 200,000 passenger movements a year. I wrote to the minister pointing out that, in light of September 11 and the heightened security situation both worldwide and in Australia, we did not have any passenger screening at my local airports at Burnie and Devonport. What was the minister going to do about that? How could we secure at least the rudiments of some basic security screening of passengers and their hand luggage? 
The irony of all this is that the passenger screening that I am speaking about—that is, the screening of the person and the hand luggage—in actual fact occurred before September 11. Through some great scheme of review, this was no longer required and now these things are sitting in storage. I believe that one of them is now being used by a fishing company to screen its catch—but they are not in my airports to screen my constituents and me. They were abandoned and sold off. It may be laughable to some here, but in light of all this on 6 November 2001 I asked the minister: can you tell me what you are going to do about my airport and other regional airports like mine throughout Australia? That was 6 November and of course I received no reply, which seems to be the pattern of this minister: return to sender.
I have incredible patience on this issue and, having raised these matters in parliament, I wrote to the minister again on 4 December 2002. The interesting thing is that the minister's comments to me about my comments on aviation security in my area were passed on by some lackey from his department, through a member in my area, criticising me in a newspaper. In my letter to the minister on 4 December I asked him about his process of ASIO security assessments. I just happen to have a person who works with me who has been involved in security assessments and who knows a little bit about this. In fact, they had been involved in security assessments for the department in the past. They would not give me the details, obviously; they are professional in what they do. But we have a fair idea of what is required in airport security, and I asked the minister to answer a few questions for me in relation to their assessment procedures. That was on 4 December 2002. Of course, I received the standard answer from the minister: no reply; return to sender.
I am a persistent little tyke: on 17 December, as things were gradually being heightened in aviation security in this country and with increased threats to national security, I wrote to the minister again. Surely my letters must have been waylaid; surely the minister would not ignore a properly formulated request from a member of parliament about security in his region. In my letter on 17 December I particularly asked the minister to furnish me with further information about how one might go about financing improved security and screening arrangements at my local airports and about how some others go about this throughout regional Australia. Of course, it was the standard reply: no answer; return to sender.
Again, I persisted, as one must in this House; all members know how you have got to do this. I said to myself: `I'll give him a couple of months. Be fair about this; he's under a fair bit of pressure. Will he stay or will he go? What is going to happen?' Of course, I gave him some time, but by 3 June I had had enough. I had listened to the minister in this House prattle on after his National Press Club announcement of new security measures for Australia. He was talking about possible measures in regional Australia, so I listened with bated breath: `Minister, what are you going to say about regional Australia and categorised airports, and security in those airports?' I listened to him prattle on, and then he said: `If an airport wants to upgrade its security, we'll mandate it. If you want to do it, we'll pass a regulation to say you've got to do it if you want to do it. But you'll pay for it yourself. The people in that region will pay for their own security.' That was the answer.
The member for Hinkler, who spoke previously, has alluded to this conundrum that affects regional Australia; so too has the member for New England, as well as some members on this side of the House. Indeed, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's inquiry into aviation security in Australia has received submission after submission on this issue. I encourage any members of parliament and members of the public who are interested in this issue to read the submissions to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's aviation security review. I have made a submission to that committee. 
After listening to the minister's speech, I was concerned enough to ask him a series of questions. I asked some rather comprehensive questions relating to what he had to say. Some of these were related to, for instance, how I could find out from the minister and his officers the results—without going into too many confidential details—of their risk assessments of airports. It is interesting that the member for New England, who is in the House, asked the Prime Minister the very same question about Tamworth. It is worth listening to the Prime Minister's reply to the member for New England's question. The Prime Minister's reply in question time on 2 June was:
... I am informed by the Deputy Prime Minister that Tamworth—
in this case—
does have a security plan and that it is based on a risk assessment. I am quite sure that, if the honourable member wants some more information about that, it will be provided by the Deputy Prime Minister.
There you go; there was a blatant invitation to the member for New England—unlike me, who does not get a reply to a bagful of mail that even Santa could respond to. The member for New England was given an opportunity. All I asked the minister to do for me was to give me the opportunity to see—without going into too many confidential details—the risk assessments of the Burnie and Devonport airports in my region. Of course, I was waiting with bated breath to see the answer in relation to that. In his statement to the National Press Club, the minister also said:
It is a fact that we have in place in Australia one of the most robust systems in the world.
I was scratching my head and I said: `That's pretty good. Just how robust can you be if you don't have any?' It would be like a prize fighter going into a fight with no arms. This guy just comes out with this stuff and we are expected to believe it. But when you question it and ask for details—which is my responsibility as a member of parliament—absolute nonsense comes out.
There were also very serious comments about the implementation of upgraded cockpit security measures. I asked the minister a number of questions about the security issues that may be related to turboprops. Anyone can see when they are on these aircraft that in our instance the toilet is right next door to the cockpit access point. People make their way through and, as the steward is moving through the aircraft or down the back of the aircraft, they have easy access to the cockpit. I have seen how flimsy these doors are. On a number of flights they are just open, unless that is an automatic call for coffee from the pilots. I do not know, but I asked serious questions about this and I want answers to them.
I also asked the minister to give me a response to my suggestion that the surplus of the Ansett tax be used to help finance basic screening and security arrangements and other infrastructure arrangements at some regional airports, where those communities deemed as such. I wrote on 3 June with all the patience in the world and, I believe, with due diligence, and the response I got was a big fat nothing again—no response; return to sender. That is how serious this minister is about answering the concerns of my constituents—112,000 people. We take our security pretty seriously and we try to be responsible about how we go about it. 
I have outlined in my submission to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit how to deal with this in what I believe is a fair and reasonable way. The comments by the member for Hinkler and some of the thinking that is coming through from the committee on this give me some heart, but we have to wait and see. I made the point that there are excess funds that can be used to fund basic security at regional airports. I am glad to say this is outlined by the shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, in point 6 of our amendment, which calls on the government to use some of the proceeds from the Ansett ticket tax to have screening equipment and related physical infrastructure provided at the airports listed—two of those are Burnie and Devonport—if requested by the relevant airport managers.
The crux is that we appreciate the fact that, if you mandated security screening for categorised regional airports, particularly those in categories 4 and 5, that is an incredible cost burden on those local operators and those local communities. A reasonable compromise is to help finance the introduction of basic screening equipment and other infrastructure that may be required to secure those airports—certainly the arrangement would be better than it is now, which in many instances is zilch.
I do not need to remind the House of the number of headlines about the lack of airport security throughout regional Australia. I will point out a few recent ones. The headline `Airports launch pads for terror' does not give one much heart in terms of New South Wales—that concerned an independent review by Southern Cross Group, Australasia. Another headline comes from the Sunday Telegraph: `Security gaps leave airports open to terror'. That is just to name a few, but here have been plenty of editorials in regional newspapers to that effect.
I note with interest that just today and, as we are debating this bill, lo and behold, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, has said he is going to announce later this week security measures, including the installation of metal detectors and trace detection equipment, at some regional airports. I gather that this will in fact be part funded by the Commonwealth or certainly have the Commonwealth doing its bit. Do not say that we in regional Australia are the only ones holding our hands out asking the government to assist us. I have a copy of a letter from Max Moore-Wilton—that is a familiar name—from the Sydney Airport Corporation begging the federal government to use the Ansett tax surplus to do some of their infrastructure, security and screening. So he is on the ball. I must be on the ball, but I bet he got a letter of reply from the minister for transport—unlike me, which is disgraceful. No doubt the minister probably has it stuck in his pocket and forgot to post it to me! It is not good enough. The people in regional Australia are not satisfied. We demand more—we are not second-class citizens. We want basic security and screening, and we want to feel safe at our airports and in the air. I urge this government to put its rhetoric into practice.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2003-12-03,"—We certainly just heard some rhetoric—that is for sure. I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003. It has been said before that September 11 changed a lot of things, and quite obviously it did. One thing this government has proved is that it is more security conscious than any of the political parties that surround it, and certainly more security conscious, by a country mile, than those across the benches in terms of Australia's best interests. What came out of the tragedy on September 11 was quite obviously a global need to readdress domestic and international security, sometimes right down to a regional level. For most of us that tragedy was a terrible wake-up call that nowhere is out of reach. If the most powerful nation in the world can be so easily penetrated, then as a country known very well around the world in recent times we have to look at our own security. We certainly cannot be complacent, and one thing this government has not been is complacent on security. 
As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am one of those responsible for looking at aviation security. As the previous speaker, the member for Braddon, mentioned, airport security is under ongoing review at the moment. I think my electorate of Parkes has the highest number of registered airports in Australia—not all of them part of a normal service. Being one of the more remote areas and electorates and having airports in places like Broken Hill, Dubbo, Parkes, Cobar et cetera that are in full-time use, we have a very real interest in this. But I think every member of parliament has a very real interest in ensuring our security, be it in the air or anywhere else. The committee's terms of reference are pretty specific. The committee is to inquire and report on:
a) regulation of aviation security by the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services;
b) compliance with Commonwealth security requirements by airport operators at major and regional airports;
c) compliance with Commonwealth security requirements by airlines;
d) the impact of overseas security requirements on Australian aviation security ...
And the list goes on. It is very comprehensive. The committee has visited airports in recent times. I was interested to hear some of the interjections by the member for New England earlier, because we went to Tamworth and Coffs Harbour recently and—despite the interjections about it being disgraceful that we do not have screening at every airport in Australia regardless of its size, location or anything else—when we spoke to the operators of Tamworth Airport they seemed very confident that they did not need this type of screening. Coffs Harbour, on the other hand, which has a lot of jet travel and a lot of tourist travel, wanted screening. I believe that is mainly because—and they were pretty forthright about it—the tourist trade feels better about it. If that is what works and is what is required, then I believe we have to go that way. But to simply try to put a blanket solution across Australia, regardless of airport size or location or the type of aircraft that use it, is plainly ludicrous.
We obviously have an ongoing commitment to strengthen domestic security. We have to align ourselves with the changing international security standards, and we have to be a lot better equipped to handle breaches. Despite what members across the bench might say, it was recently put to us that some of our security measures are as good as anything that exists anywhere. If you want to take absolutely no chances, which is obviously never possible, you are going to have to go to some ridiculous lengths. If you wanted to ensure that nobody is ever killed in a motor car, you could put a 10 kilometre per hour speed limit on them; people would stop using cars and would walk, and they would never get anywhere. If you want to close down the airline industry, you simply put restrictions on it that are impossible to comply with—or perhaps have a huge cost factor which closes down airports and industry. 
A huge measure of commonsense has to be used with security. Of course, we are not going to take risks which are not justified, but there is a measure of risk in setting any control or regulating anything, and security is no different. As I just said, if you want to take absolutely no risks with motor cars, you slow them down to an extent where nobody will use them. If you want to take absolutely no risks with airlines, then you put restrictions on them that make it impossible for airlines and airports to operate. Of course there has to be a judgment on a particular airport. Of course judgments have to be made. That is part of the responsibility of government. However, I do see it as rather ridiculous when Independents and members across the way simply want to get in the news and make people think they are caring about them. They should look at the facts, sum them up and make a judgment rather than simply calling for the media.
Even before the onset of international uncertainty in the aviation industry, DOTARS had been working on revising the legislative framework for aviation security, and that legwork identified a number of measures to strengthen what, to be quite honest, was already a robust regulatory framework, which the Aviation Transport Security Bill seeks to enhance. The bill has 10 main provisions, but I would like to touch on only a couple of the key points.
Under part 3, the secretary of the department may declare an airport or part of an airport to be security controlled. This is simply a commonsense measure. It is about flexibility, not about treating every airport the same regardless of its size, regardless of the planes that use it, regardless of the passenger throughput. It allows the department to look at airports on a casebycase basis and even to look at an airfield or airport on a part-by-part basis, rather than having to simply treat every airport the same, which in Australia they most definitely are not. Even within my electorate, airport landings go from one plane a day to up to a dozen, from very small planes to quite large ones. This takes into account the physical and operational features of every airport and the fact that each airport may have its own unique circumstances. Flexibility is, without doubt, a key part of the amendments. These arrangements are designed for categorised airports, and there are a total of 38 of them in Australia. I do not have one of those in my electorate, but I do represent an area which feeds into many of those categorised ports.
Part 4 of the bill establishes fundamental security requirements that go beyond the concept of area-based security controls, as in part 3, and deals with the screening and clearing of people, goods and vehicles. Obviously, the challenge for government is to provide a security framework that recognises and anticipates threats and breaches but does not unduly punish the airport or make it impossible or impractical for them to operate. It is quite obvious that after September 11 there was a lot of fear and a lot of uncertainty. Passenger numbers plummeted right around the world, and certainly in Australia. We had to react to that, and the immediate thing to do was to make people confident that in Australia, at least, they did not have to fear unjustified risk taking.
The government's commitment to security, defence and border protection has certainly gone a long way in Australia to restoring the confidence of our own domestic travellers and the tourist travellers who come here, right around Australia and in regional situations. With passenger numbers in regional and metropolitan Australia, we are now back at the two per cent annual growth rate we were experiencing before September 11. Numbers, thankfully, continue to trend upwards. Regional airports are starting to play a much greater role in domestic travel; they obviously feed many of the jet operators that service major cities and international destinations. As has always been the case, regional airlines play a very prominent role in aviation in Australia and further partnerships are starting to emerge. One I can think of is Regional Express, which services so much of south-eastern Australia, from Adelaide through to Brisbane, which recently forged a partnership with Virgin for the ongoing transfer of baggage. So we will be benefiting from a much more comprehensive network. 
It is these changing situations that security has to take into account. We have to ensure the safety and the confidence of passengers. I think to a very large measure we have done that, and the increase in passenger numbers is proof and testimony to that. Domestic carriers are making a very real effort to improve their customer focus and, at the same time, we are starting to do a very good job of providing a quality, affordable service. I notice that in the last 12 months the price of domestic travel within my electorate has come down quite markedly, and I congratulate Regional Express on being a very big part of that and for doing deals with some local government areas that have made it possible to provide a better, more efficient service.
A working paper by the Bureau of Transport Economics entitled `Regional Aviation Competitiveness' found that over the 10 years to 1998 regional airline passenger movements grew at over 13 per cent. Those airlines now carry 15 per cent of all passenger movements while at the same time moving 5.7 million people on a traffic-on-board-by-state (TOBS) basis, over 5,000 tonnes of freight and 17 tonnes of mail. In carrying out those operations, about 286 aircraft are used and about 2,700 people are directly employed. It is a very big industry and it is a very competitive industry today—and, by and large, it is a very efficient one. Of regional airline passengers, about 65 per cent are business travellers and 77 per cent can access a discount fare. I believe that the security and the certainty we have put back into regional aviation is now becoming apparent as the numbers of those travelling increase. The business community probably stuck with travelling by air all the way through; but the increasing number of casual travellers and tourists is testimony to the way DOTARS, the minister and the government have put certainty and security back into the minds of our travellers.
We are faced though with a challenge, and we all must rise to that. Security has to be paramount—noone knows that better than we do, and nobody has a better record of dealing with it than this government—but we have to ensure that the aviation industry continues to be viable. It has gone through some tough times, and I do not think we can ignore that fact. We must provide a very flexible framework for industry to operate within and for people in using that industry. Without doubt, that is what this bill does. John Anderson, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Leader of The Nationals, has stated:
... this bill allows industry greater flexibility in meeting the standards set by government.
And that is what it does. It takes into account the growing role of regional airlines. Without them, we would have no competition. Without regional airlines, most entrepreneurs or business leaders—the people who make things happen—simply would not come to an electorate like mine or even bigger electorates such as Grey, Kalgoorlie and Lingiari, because they could not afford the time to travel any other way.
This bill enables passenger screening at categorised regional airports and ensures more accurate screening which matches the emerging role of regional airlines in carrying high volumes of jet airline passengers. At the end of the day, as I said earlier, a judgment has to be made and somebody has to take responsibility in making that judgment. We would hope to do that without error, but there are no certainties in this world. Those who are screaming and bellowing about simple security without actually looking at the issues probably need to stop and think that a terrorist today does not necessarily repeat himself. It is probably a lot easier for one to drive a truck into the middle of the Sydney Harbour Bridge with far greater effect than to go out to a regional airline and hijack a 19- or 30-passenger plane. However, we do have to make a judgment and we have to take all those issues into consideration. 
We should remember too that regional airports, by and large, are owned and operated by local government. I can assure you that local government in my area is not jumping up and down to install screening once it sees the stats and knows about all the issues we are discussing here. As some airports develop—and there is a chance in my electorate that airports could become more involved with international flights—this may change, and nobody is suggesting for one second that any system will be put in place in concrete. We have to keep looking at them and deal with them as they arise. But at the end of the day there is no getting away from the fact that judgments have to be and will always have to be made. ASIO has spent a great deal of time reviewing aviation security, particularly with regard to regional airports, and obviously we have to act on its advice or take it into account in the main. The advice thus far suggests that it would be overcautious to implement, at uncategorised regional airports, security measures the like of which we have been talking about. We have to take all the advice and we have to act on it, but I think we also have to use a lot of commonsense rather than a lot of rhetoric.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I rise to comment on the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003. This bill goes to very important matters affecting the nation against the background of September 11. I think it is fair to say that this matter should have been reviewed prior to 2001, and certainly before today, but it is now before us. The opposition have concerns about some of the elements of the bill. We support the bill and have sought to move amendments. In the end, we support the bill despite its deficiencies, because it is critical for our national security.
I live in Sunbury, an airport town. It has suffered economic and social consequences as a result of the collapse of Ansett. There are many other aviation industry employees residing in that town and the outlying areas so I get the opportunity to speak to many aviation industry employees: caterers, cleaners, security guards, receptionists, pilots, flight attendants and so on. I get a chance to hear their views as people who work in the industry. They have expressed concerns to me about the need to review our security system.
The member for Batman, the shadow minister, yesterday indicated that, quite rightly, up until very recently we have been a very lucky nation in not having to be too security conscious. We like to boast about the fact that we do not have too many security dimensions to our lives. That provides, I think, a much better quality of life. Indeed, it is a much better thing that we did not—in the past, at least—have to tend to those things. Prior to September 2001, even this place was less security conscious. We have had to tighten our security in the parliament, and indeed in parliaments across Australia, as a result of terrorist activity offshore. Aviation security is a particularly important dimension to our security. That is not to say, however, that we are not mindful of all the other entry points and exit points for our nation—other industries that bring people to our shores. I rise to support this bill and to make some references to the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Batman. 
I have read a number of the submissions made to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and I want to make a number of references to some of those submissions. As I have said, I live very close to Melbourne airport. Melbourne airport is a very important airport for the nation—it is obviously one of the biggest. I think there are about 157,000 aircraft movements and in excess of 16 million domestic and international passengers handled each year within a single terminal complex in Melbourne airport. So it is a very significant airport. I therefore took the opportunity to read the submission made by the Australia Pacific Airports Corporation, the owner and operator of Australia's second major airport, Melbourne. They have some interesting things to say about what to do in this important area. They have made it very clear that the government have to be the regulator of this process. The reason for that is that they are the only ones who have the intelligence sources to make the necessary risk assessments, which are the foundation of any aviation policy. From the outset, I think that is a very significant point which should be properly acknowledged—and, indeed, is acknowledged by this bill. There are questions about costs and who is to pay. They are issues that, I think, have not been entirely resolved.
I turn now to the substantive parts of the bill. The member for Batman indicated that he had concerns with a number of elements of the bill. For example, he raised a concern that the whole terminology had changed—the aviation industry lexicon, if you like—in the bill. He was concerned that that was not a very clever move given the fact that terms such as `sterile area' and others are well understood and known within the industry. However, he did not think it possible—and I defer to him in relation to that—to amend the bill to change that deficiency. I think the government should certainly consider that problem in this bill. Further to that, I note that the government were considering whether to use a demerit points system. I understand now that the bill has introduced a specific power to introduce a demerit points system for penalising breaches of aviation security but will not actually have it applied. In effect that means that, while the government want to retain the power to introduce the system, they are not going to write regulations to commence that section at this stage. Clearly the level of industry opposition has caused the government to rethink their original position. I think, therefore, the government have been sensitive to the concerns of the industry. The opposition concurs with the government in relation to that matter.
The second reading amendment moved by the member for Batman calls for a post-implementation review of this bill to be conducted in a year. That is about ensuring that the parliament and the industry are accountable for the implementation of the bill. It is one thing to pass legislation; it is another thing to see it properly enacted and implemented. I therefore support the shadow minister's amendment in relation to ensuring a review of this piece of legislation after a year of it being passed to see whether or not it has been properly implemented.
In these uncertain times, I do not think there is a more important issue than this one to be vigorously reviewed and considered by this parliament. I add my voice to those who have spoken on the second reading amendment on the post-implementation review. 
I referred earlier to the Australian Pacific Airports Corporation. They are held in very good regard and are a very important organisation in the industry. They have raised concerns about a number of security matters. They hold the view that the department must continue setting standards for aviation security in the country. While the airport operators' role in managing and controlling airport security should be strengthened, they understand, as I said earlier, that in the end the regulator must be the government. 
They said in their submission that the measures introduced by the government should include: a clear definition of accountabilities under the various user security programs; a strengthening of compliance and enforcement mechanisms; enhancement of already good consultative arrangements; and, on a broader scale, a need for a strategic approach through risk based security management systems. Of many submissions made to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audits, their submission is one of the better ones. It should be closely examined by the government, if it has not already done so, and it should be considered in the context of any review if this bill, when passed, is found to be deficient and does not provide the necessary security for this country.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003, as we have heard already this morning, aims to improve transport security and civil aviation through several means—namely, adding to the current structure of aviation security and allowing for flexibility to respond to the changing international aviation threat. Labor supports this move and, as such, supports this bill, along with the amendments that the shadow minister has moved and those yet to be moved. 
This bill will ensure a higher level of public confidence and trust in what is currently a turbulent and uncertain area. Overall, there is significant evidence to substantiate the need for the changes outlined in this bill, particularly in relation to security, safety and ensuring a greater level of public confidence. Members of this House will remember the terrifying incident only a few months ago—on a flight to my hometown—when Qantas cabin attendants thwarted an attempted hijacking on a flight from Melbourne to Launceston. While the flight attendants sustained minor injuries, they averted what was potentially a lethal situation. I note that they were recently awarded international aviation security awards for their behaviour. 
Sadly, these horrible incidents occur more frequently than anyone would like. This was highlighted recently by Qantas, who reported 239 air rage incidents between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2003, of which 13 were classified as violent. The incident on flight 1737 to Launceston and the many other incidents that have occurred this year alone demonstrate that it is critical to safety and security to have sufficient, well-trained cabin crew. On this point, I want to acknowledge that the cabin crew are a vital component in an operational safety and security team. But, despite government rhetoric and comments by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—who was supporting the role of cabin crews in the context of security, particularly immediately after flight 1737—I note that the minister's department did not consult with the Flight Attendants Association of Australia in the development of this bill. 
Unfortunately, this is the tenet of the Howard government's policy development: keep consultation with stakeholders to an absolute minimum and only consult with those who are going to agree with your proposals. Why would this completely arrogant government feel the need to take into consideration the needs of others, particularly the workers—the people who are employed in this industry? As the member for Ballarat alluded to earlier in the House today, the most valuable insight into the effectiveness of this bill will actually come from the workers, not from the shareholders. The workers have the operational experience—this is experience which the government should take advantage of rather than completely shun. As we heard today, the regulations underpinning this bill are still being massaged, so, once again, no doubt the devil will be in the detail. 
The other guiding principle that this government has chosen to act upon is to shift responsibility and to blame others. Recently, the minister opened the Safeskies Conference in Canberra where he discussed the merits of this government's aviation initiatives. It was during this presentation that the minister discussed what he calls the `three persistent myths about our security measures'. It is a nice turn of phrase, but I think this little attempt for language to shape reality falls particularly short of the mark. The minister outlined these myths. 
The first is the idea that the government should pay the cost of aviation security. The minister knows that that is a myth only because he desires it to be so. The minister is forcing industry to bear the huge costs of responding to increased security arrangements at a time when airlines are under intense financial pressure. Of course, it goes without saying that industry will transfer these costs to the travelling public. So, through a lovely little sleight of hand, this minister will increase the cost of air travel. The minister is quite firm: the government will not pay; the public will. What a surprise! Here is another hidden Howard tax. Those opposite are pretty shifty; they shift the costs for their policies to others. Labor holds the view that security measures, which in most part are dictated by government regulations such as the one that we are currently debating, can be introduced with a level of government funding support that reflects the government's role in protecting our national security.
The minister's second myth is the claim that the occasional screening breakdown, such as the recent incident at Melbourne airport, demonstrates that there is a fundamental problem with aviation security. That is not a myth. There are deficiencies, and the occasional screening breakdown can have serious consequences. We have heard in this House today of various incidents that have occurred, such as box-cutters and other inappropriate items making their way onto aircraft. I would hate to think that I am nave in this area, but I would have thought the minister would be aware that there is enough evidence to show that steps need to be taken immediately to make improvements. But, no, the minister and the government claim that all is okay, because screening is only one part of a `layered security system'.
The reliance on intelligence and police work, while generally very effective, is not always going to ensure that terrorists do not make it to the airport. I mentioned earlier the dreadful events on a flight from Melbourne to Launceston. Sadly, intelligence and police work did not foresee this event—because they could not. That is the point that we have to remember. How can this minister and this government talk about a layered security system when you can just waltz into many regional airports with no security checks whatsoever?
That brings us to the minister's third myth. The minister claims that there is a security problem at regional airports. The minister states, `We do not require passenger screening at many regional airports, because there is a lack of evidence that there is a sufficient threat to justify it.' Perhaps there is a bit of softening of the minister's arrogant stance on this issue, because I read earlier this week that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is pushing for security at regional airports to be upgraded. I hope that that department and the minister actually have a conversation at some stage. 
You can walk into Flinders Island airport—in my electorate—and, apart from the person who looks at your ticket and the pilot who loads your bag onto the plane, there is not a soul in sight. There are definitely not going to be any security checks. This is also the case at Burnie airport, in the member for Braddon's electorate—no security, no nothing. The member for Braddon has already highlighted today the difficulty in getting answers from this minister as to why there is nothing and why the minister has done nothing to secure Australia's regional airports. In the minister's backyard, in the New England region, at Armidale airport, for instance: absolutely nothing! At Inverell—we cannot really talk about Inverell, can we, because Inverell is now a town without a regular public transport air service, thanks to the minister's revolutionary set of aviation reforms. I think Gunnedah might also be without a regular public transport air service these days. But, should an RPT service be returned to Inverell or Gunnedah, there will not be any security infrastructure in preparation for that. In response to a recent question about what is being looked at in the area of domestic airport security, the minister stated that `Nothing is off the table except idiotic and far-out ideas.' 
Having regional airports with no security at all is idiotic; so the baseline the minister and the government have established leaves us with a lot of room to develop a sensible approach to address this obvious gaping hole. The minister will, of course, be aware of the Making Ends Meet report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services that the member for Hinkler mentioned in his contribution to this debate. Indeed, the minister's Nationals colleague, the member for Hinkler, did an excellent job of chairing this inquiry, and I want to pass on my support and congratulations to him again. In chairing this inquiry, he focused on commercial regional aviation services in Australia and transport links to major populated islands. I note that the member for Hinkler stated earlier that terrorists look for the weakest link in the chain to target, and such an incident may result in the death of thousands. I support the member for Hinkler's concern in this regard. This goes to the heart of my concern. A light plane originating from a regional airport involved in such an incident could result in the death of a large number of people. None of us want this to happen, and that is why we on this side of the House are trying to get the government to listen and take steps.
Amongst its recommendations, the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services calls for a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance. I hope that the minister embraces the airport ownership subsidy scheme, particularly as it relates to smaller regions struggling to cover the maintenance and upgrade costs of their airports. In this context, perhaps the proposed airport ownership subsidy scheme could provide the funding mechanism to assist smaller airports in regional Australia in the task of aviation security. As the member for Hinkler noted, many councils are struggling to cover the costs of maintenance and they are concerned about the Commonwealth's cost-shifting to them. I hope that the `evidence' being sought by the minister does not materialise.
Most people would argue that terrorists seek weaknesses to exploit, rather than trying to attack secure targets. It would appear that a glaring weakness exists in our aviation security that the minister is not prepared to address. As the so-called `champion of the bush', I would have thought that the minister, of all people, would seek to deal regional Australia a better outcome. It is not okay that regional Australia is exposed in this manner. The local airport is a critical piece of economic and social infrastructure. The right thing for the government to do is to assist regions in securing their airports. I call on the minister to provide adequate funding to regions to enable them to improve the security arrangements at their airports. The minister has labelled valid community concerns as myths. These concerns are not myths, rather they are truths. These concerns are persistent because the minister is not properly addressing them. I urge him to take note of the Prime Minister's department's call for increasing security at regional airports.  
I started my speech by highlighting the need to ensure a greater level of public confidence in aviation, and I think I will finish on this theme. There are fundamental problems in aviation, and they have been further compounded by the minister's recent changes to national airspace operations. The minister needs to rethink his approach to aviation management. He needs to withdraw the National Airspace System reforms, improve security at regional airports and restore confidence in the aviation sector that he has sharnied.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2003-12-03,"—As members would be aware, the events of 11 September 2001 changed the way the world viewed aviation security. Following these events the Australian government undertook a review of aviation security policy and regulatory settings, focussing in particular on access control, aviation security identification cards and passenger and checked bag screening.
By developing a new aviation security regulatory framework, we were able to streamline the existing aviation security provisions of the Air Navigation Act 1920 into a cohesive package, incorporate the outcomes of the government's policy reviews and provide flexibility to adapt to a changeable threat environment.
Development of the Aviation Transport Security Bill 2003 and the Aviation Transport Security (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003 has also allowed the government to address the Auditor-General's recommendations arising from his recent report, Aviation security in Australia, such as the need for more focussed auditing, an increase in compliance and the introduction of graduated penalties and enforcement measures. At the same time, the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been reviewing its aviation security standards. These bills will align Australia's aviation security framework with these revived ICAO standards.
The bills are structured to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility and responsiveness in the regulatory regime. The bills provide a broad and robust framework, with extensive regulation making powers providing detailed and specific measures for industry. In summing up, I am very pleased to highlight these very important measures as a conclusion to the debate on the sound bills that the minister has brought to the House.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Martin Ferguson's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The legislation before this parliament today—the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003—essentially is designed to weaken the bargaining power of those workers in the building and construction industry who choose to be represented by trade unions. That is what it comes down to in the end. There is a very complex set of provisions in this legislation, but they are all designed to make it harder for workers who choose to be represented by trade unions to achieve their aspirations for secure pay, working conditions and safety.
The legislation before us establishes two new regulatory bodies: the first is the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the second is the Federal Safety Commissioner. The legislation severely restricts legally protected industrial action, therefore making most industrial action unlawful. The legislation limits the right of trade unions to enter work sites and it imposes severe penalties for unions and officials who contravene any of these or related provisions. Finally, the legislation enhances access to damages for unlawful conduct. The bills taken together propose a highly regulated approach to an industry—a one-size-fits-all approach—when, in fact, the industry varies a great deal in different states and territories. Curiously, this government is fond of its deregulatory rhetoric, saying that the best outcome for the economy and society tends to be a deregulated system, yet this bill is chock-full of regulation and restrictions.
We know that, if these bills were passed, the government would seek their extension to other industries. How do we know that? The former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, now the Minister for Health and Ageing, let the cat out of the bag. I found it really quite difficult to track down transcripts of the statement that he made when he introduced an exposure draft of this bill for discussion in the parliament earlier on. But I do recall that, in response to a question as to whether, if this particular bill passed, it might be extended to other industries, the minister said he would be stupid not to consider doing that.
In letting the cat out of the bag, the minister has revealed that the government's agenda is to use this legislation as a stalking horse to allow these sorts of provisions to prevail on the statute books and then gradually widen them to other industries. That is the caper, that is what the minister is up to, and he did let the cat out of the bag. For that very reason, I say to all workers around Australia, whether they are construction workers or workers in confectionery factories or workers in just about any industry in this country, that they have an interest in this legislation. The government's agenda is plain and clear: it wants to use this legislation as a stalking horse to extend the provisions to other industries. 
If we need any further evidence of that, we need only look at the second wave of industrial relations legislation in 1999, which failed because the Senate—in its wisdom, in this case—decided that there had not been sufficient time for the first wave of industrial relations legislation to be fully tested in workplaces around Australia and that this second wave crashing in so quickly behind the first wave was unacceptable and would flood over the top of the remaining rights of working Australians to bargain collectively and to get a fair go in their negotiations with employers.
In respect of the full second wave of industrial relations legislation, the Senate said, `No, we will not pass that, because it is crashing to shore too closely behind the first wave.' The government came to appreciate that it had no hope of getting this second wave of legislation through in the one large bill, so it decided to break the one large bill up into smaller bills so that each bill would `lap to the shores' and perhaps the Senate would not notice them or would not consider each bill too offensive. But, of course, if they were recombined into one bill they would be found unacceptable.
This has been the government's tactic ever since. That is why I have said in this place before that the government has a total of a dozen bills sloshing around in the parliament—the small components of the second wave of industrial relations legislation—and each is designed to weaken the bargaining power of working Australians and to strip away the hard-won and long-held working conditions and wages of working families in this country. So that is what the government did. The government broke it up into 12 bills—the `dirty dozen' bills—and this legislation is the 13th bill. It is specific to one industry, the building and construction industry, but it contains the same provisions that were brought into the parliament in 1999 for the whole second wave of industrial relations legislation.
So, in addition to the 12 bills sloshing around the parliament, which apply to all industries, the government has brought in a 13th bill that applies to this industry, and that is why it is a stalking horse. The government is trying to do it two ways; it is trying to convince the Senate on two grounds. Firstly, with the 12 bills, it is saying that if we pass each and every bill in succession, perhaps no-one will notice that, combined, they constitute that large second wave. On a different stream, in relation to this legislation, the government will seek to apply all the important provisions of the second wave to one industry in the hope that the Senate will say: `This isn't too bad. It just applies to one industry, the building and construction industry, and there've been a few problems in that industry, so maybe if we apply it just to that industry there won't be any great harm in it.' That is the government's aspiration but, fortunately, all indications are that the Senate has wised-up to that caper and is not going to allow that happen. Certainly, I can say on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will oppose this legislation in its entirety.
The government sought to use as a pretext for this legislation—as an excuse for it and to gather some power behind it—a royal commission. The royal commission, under Commissioner Terence Cole, was established by the government way back in August 2001 and it reported on 24 February 2003. As I indicated, an exposure draft on the principal bill was released on 18 September 2003. The government provided four weeks for interested parties to lodge submissions relating to the draft but on the day the minister spoke in relation to the bill, in a tabling statement, he revealed that, yes, this bill would effectively be a stalking horse for other industries. 
What is contained in this legislation? Certainly it applies beyond construction sites. In establishing a case that this government is seeking to expand the operation of this legislation beyond the building and construction industry, I think it is very important to note that the legislation's very broad definition of `building work' includes parts of the manufacturing sector, particularly those industries that manufacture made-to-order components used in the building industry. I know that the Australian Industry Group has expressed concerns in the past about the broadening of the coverage of this legislation into the manufacturing sector and beyond what would ordinarily be regarded as the building industry.
The bills establish the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the Federal Safety Commissioner. The ABCC is described as an industry watchdog. Its role is investigation, enforcement and prosecution designed to achieve `lasting cultural change'. It is starting to sound like George Orwell, isn't it? `Lasting cultural change' is straight out of the Ministry of Love and of course that other famous ministry, the Ministry of Truth. Inspectors from the ABCC will have broader powers than current inspectors have, including the right to summon witnesses for questioning. It certainly highlights the concern—indeed, the conviction—we have that this is not in fact to be an industry watchdog but an attack dog. The Federal Safety Commissioner is supposed to monitor and enforce health and safety on Commonwealth funded projects, but we express a concern that the Federal Safety Commissioner will reduce the capacity of both unions and occupational health and safety bodies in the states to regulate occupational health and safety on building sites.
The legislation severely restricts the taking of industrial action. These legislative aspects are really the second wave legislation that I spoke of applying to the whole of the Australian economy but in this case being applied to the building and construction industry. The provisions are really very restrictive. They establish so many technical hurdles that it would be almost impossible to take legally protected industrial action. Of course, if you legislate to the effect that working Australians represented by a union cannot take industrial action, then you take away just about all of their bargaining power. If you take away their bargaining power, that ultimately allows employers to have much stronger bargaining power than the employees, tilting the bargaining table very heavily in favour of employers, which has been this government's practice since it got into power in 1996. In particular, all industrial action would have to be preceded by a secret ballot to be lawful. A valid secret ballot would be extraordinarily difficult to achieve in this industry, given the 30 pages of attached requirements, including approval by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Separate ballots would have to be held for union members and non-union members participating in the action. The bills also provide for cooling-off periods of 21 days that would follow 14 days of industrial action, even if these 14 days are not consecutive.
The bills would also make pattern bargaining impossible. They would prohibit it, and injunctions could be made stopping such pattern bargaining. The Industrial Relations Commission would have greater power to suspend or terminate bargaining periods, thereby ending lawful industrial action. This is consistent with one of the bills that this government brought into parliament—the 14th bill in fact, so there is no shortage of them—which is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003 and which this minister is personally sponsoring. That bill was introduced into parliament on the very same day that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 was brought in, and it too would effectively remove the capacity of working Australians to take industrial action. Madam Deputy Speaker—I am sorry, I should have said Mr Deputy Speaker; Mr Deputy Speaker is horrified, as he should be— 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that the comment of the member for McMillan is not accurate.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The honourable member should ignore the comment from the honourable member for McMillan in this case.
—I am trying very hard to. The legislation increases penalties for unlawful action. It reflects the provisions of another one of the dirty dozen bills, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill 2002, which is currently before the Senate and is opposed by Labor. This bill applies increased penalties for unlawful industrial action, as yet another one of the dirty dozen bills does, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill 2003, which is currently before the Senate and is also opposed by Labor. Industry participants are explicitly able, under this legislation, to recover any losses they suffer due to unlawful action and the usual 72-hour period that precedes an employer being allowed to commence a tort claim in respect of industrial action is removed. The existing prohibition on strike pay is strengthened. There are severe restrictions on the right of entry by unions; a range of new restrictions would be introduced. For example, to talk to workers a union official must have given notice to both the employer and the ABCC at least 24 hours prior to entry. The bill exempts decisions made under this legislation from the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. There have been a number of changes since the exposure draft: some narrowing of aspects of the definition of building work, strengthening of freedom of association provisions, removing the minister's capacity to direct the ABCC and the FSC on individual cases and, finally, extending right of entry provisions to work sites covered by state industrial relations systems.
This legislation is unacceptable to Labor because it is in fact the second wave of industrial relations legislation that failed in the Senate but is applied in this case to a specific industry. The government thought that, if it could identify an industry where there have been some difficulties in the past—and we all acknowledge that—then the Senate, and parliament in general, might see merit in this legislation. We do not see any merit in the legislation, and for that reason we are not only opposing it but moving a second reading amendment which would condemn the government for bringing this legislation into parliament and for weakening, so systematically over such a long period of time, the bargaining capacity of working Australians to protect and enhance their pay and working conditions. So we say no to these particular bills and we say no to the government's dirty dozen bills. When I was first appointed to this portfolio, I said that if legislation on industrial relations were brought into this parliament it would almost certainly be against the interests of the working men and women of Australia, and on that basis we would oppose it. My prophesy has been fulfilled. There are now in this parliament 14 industrial relations bills all designed to weaken not only the bargaining capacity of working Australians but also their very right to be represented by a trade union in this country. This is a right that working Australians have had for more than 100 years, but this government does not like it and the Prime Minister of Australia, in a speech to the Business Council of Australia, recently boasted about his achievements in this regard. I will have a lot more to say about this when the debate resumes. 
—Order! As it is 2 p.m., under standing order 101A the debate is interrupted. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Rankin will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The interest rate increase announced by the Reserve Bank today adds further pressure to the already stressed living standards of young Australian families. Any Australian who has recently bought a house at the current wildly inflated prices is really vulnerable as a result of this further interest rate increase. Young families who are striving to get into the housing market will find that this interest rate increase may well put their first home even further out of reach. This is, of course, a big problem for all those young families, but it is also a big problem for their parents, who are increasingly concerned about when their children will get the opportunity to break into the housing market.
It is not as if the government have not been warned. They have been warned time and again—not just by the opposition but by the Reserve Bank, independent economists and international commentators like TheEconomist magazine and the OECD. But the Treasurer has refused to act. That is typical of this Treasurer. He is a fair-weather sailor, always keen to take the glory when things go right but missing in action when things get tough. He has conspicuously failed to act on the dramatic increase in household debt in Australia. It has been escalating. Everybody knew that this meant that families would be more vulnerable when interest rate increases started, but the Treasurer did not want to acknowledge there was a problem. 
Everybody knew that there was a need to regulate the property seminar industry, but the Treasurer was basking in the short-term glow of the wealth effect as more and more Australians were attracted to the overly inflated residential property market. So he did not want to do what he needed to do to regulate the property seminar industry. Everybody knew that the housing cycle was unsustainable and that the government should be doing what it could to smooth it. TheEconomist said so, the OECD said so, independent commentators said so—and, of course, the opposition, and particularly the new Leader of the Opposition, have been saying so for a long time. But the government failed to act. They virtually forced the RBA's hand. It must be clear to everybody on the Reserve Bank board that, if they do not act, no other arm of the government will. 
There is one more thing I want to highlight. Usually, when interest rate rises occur, as with other economic changes you expect there to be losers and winners. In this instance the losers are clear: they are people with high debt, particularly people with high mortgage debt and particularly young Australian families. The winners should be independent retirees and pensioners who depend on interest income for their lifestyle, those who have paid off their mortgages and have a small or sometimes not so small deposit in the bank. But today's report makes it clear that the banks are failing to pass on the interest rate increase to depositors. They pass it on as quick as a flash to borrowers but not to depositors. The government should be using its powerful advocacy role to pressure the banks to pass on these increases quickly and in full to those independent retirees and pensioners and other depositors dependent on this for their income. And what do we get? Not one word—nothing.
Let us look at the impact of these changes on families. The RBA's decision to increase the rate by another quarter of a per cent—that is half a per cent in the last two months—has left Australian families increasingly under pressure. They are paying more for their education—and maybe even more after today if the government get their proposal through the Senate—and they are paying more for their health services, with bulk-billing falling and the rate of non-bulk-billed services going up. It is harder to find child care for their young children and babies and even harder to find affordable aged care for their parents and grandparents. Australian families are now using record levels of their disposable income to repay debt, including mortgage repayments. The government like to deny this and they come up with fudges. The Treasurer was at it again today, fudging the figures in a way that Ross Gittins exposed them for, and I will come back to that in a moment.
Let us look at the Reserve Bank data. It shows that Australian families are paying more in mortgage interest repayments as a proportion of their disposable household income. The RBA's own data shows that mortgage interest payments are chewing up more of the household budget than ever before. These figures show that in 1996 the average new mortgage was $96,700, with monthly repayments of $922. If the minister thinks these figures are not right, he is welcome to quote some different ones. But the RBA's data says mortgage repayments on the average new mortgage in 1996 were $922. Today, average monthly mortgage repayments for a standard mortgage are around $1,300 per month, up by $58 a month in just the last month.
Of course, that is because the debt level is so much higher. It is simple arithmetic. You are paying interest on more debt, you are paying higher repayments, and the government do not seem to have worked out that you actually have to pay the money back as well: it is called principal. You pay higher interest and you pay higher principal. It comes back to more money that you have to pay. The figures come together very dramatically with another set of figures that we have debated here before and with which members will be familiar. These figures make it clear that Australians are paying on average $8,000 per year more in tax to the federal government since the Howard government came to office—$8,000 more per year because it is the highest taxing government in Australian history. But Australians are also paying more than $400 per month more on the average mortgage; that is $5,000 a year more in average mortgage repayments. In other words, families are $13,000 a year worse off after paying their tax and mortgage, not to mention the extra payments for education, health, child care and aged care. That does not mean every family is worse off; there are some whose position has improved. But young families, who are moving into first homes, taking out a mortgage for the first time, if they can get into the housing market— 
—Record low access.
—which is a terrible crisis, because home loan affordability is at a record low—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Fraser does not need any assistance from the shadow front bench.
—the percentage of first home buyers in the housing market is at a record low, and every parent in Australia is worried about whether their children will be able to get into the housing market—whether they will be able to do what NATSEM says and get over that hurdle into their first home.
Home ownership has been the bedrock of Australian society for at least 50 years. Not only has home ownership in Australia been important to individual families and driven a lot of economic activity in the home building industry—and, as people do renovations and additions, which we all seem to be doing endlessly, that has been good for the economy—but it has also been fundamentally important to our society. The bedrock of our stability and of our equity is that Australians have access to first home ownership, and it is in crisis today. Let us look at a quote from that radical organisation that is always of course very critical, the Reserve Bank of Australia:
In 1990, a 10 per cent deposit on the median priced house was equivalent to 25 per cent of average household income. Today the figure is around 45 per cent.
From 25 per cent to 45 per cent—that is why people are finding it hard to get into their first home. Housing affordability is a crisis for the younger generation. They face the prospect of being excluded from the great Australian dream. But it is not only housing; it is having a big impact on small business as well, so I am very pleased the Minister for Small Business and Tourism is here, because Australian small business will be affected. 
The Leader of the Opposition this morning correctly said that these rate rises would impact on small businesses who were seeking to share in the benefits accruing to larger companies and corporates. The Treasurer often quotes his beloved tables in the Economist magazine. However, if we look at the most recent interest rate tables in the Economist, particularly the 90-day rate, which is what drives most of the leasing and other contracts for small business, what do we find? That Australian businesses are paying the highest interest rates of any country in that list. We are No. 1. And we are the only country in which those 90-day rates have increased in the last 12 months—the only country on that OECD list.
What does that mean for Australian businesses? It means that they are paying interest rates more than four per cent higher than their counterparts in the USA, three per cent higher than those in Canada and more than three per cent higher than those in the Euro area. For all of them that are exposed to world trade and world markets, they are at a significant competitive disadvantage even before you look at the question of the impact of the dollar. 
Let us look more immediately at the effect of today's decision, which affects the overnight rate and took the Australian overnight rate to 5.25 per cent. I will refer you to the interest rates of other OECD countries: Austria, 2.09 per cent; Canada, 2.82 per cent; Denmark, 2.1 per cent; Finland, 2.0 per cent; Germany, 2.0 per cent; Greece, 2.0 per cent; Ireland, 2.0 per cent; Japan, zero; New Zealand, five per cent—nearly as high but not quite; Portugal, two per cent; and Spain, two per cent. Turkey is above Australia. We are doing better than one country in the OECD. The Turkish rate is 26 per cent. The UK rate is 4.06 per cent and the US rate is 1.08 per cent. So we are just ahead of Turkey in the OECD—second only to Turkey.
I suppose the Treasurer will claim that we are doing very well—our rates are much lower than Turkish interest rates. But with respect to the short-term rate which affects small businesses—particularly the 90-day rate—we are at the top of the range, and it is putting more and more pressure on their capacity to compete with bigger businesses who can borrow internationally at more competitive rates and competitors from other countries who can borrow at much lower rates.
Before I conclude, I want to return briefly to the question of independent retirees. Today's Australian Financial Review details a report by industry researcher Infochoice, which found that most banks had not adjusted their interest rates on savings accounts and that the interest rates on basic savings account that most Australians have have not changed at all. Where there is more competition, they have started to move in things like term deposit accounts and cash management rates. The major banks raised their rates for term depositors by an average of 0.16 per cent but they raised their rates for borrowers by 0.25 per cent. When interest rates went up, the rate for the people paying the banks went up immediately and in full and the rate for those the banks were paying went up later and by 0.16 per cent. I do not believe the government should step in and regulate that sort thing—those days are long gone—but we do need the government to put some pressure on the banks to protect the interests of independent retirees and pensioners.
The data that has been quoted today makes it clear that housing affordability is at an all-time low. The budgets of young families are under enormous stress. Today's interest rate increases will only make the pressures on those young families in the housing market or aspiring to get into the market even greater. It will put them under even more pressure. It is equally clear that a significant part of this responsibility needs to be sheeted home to the inaction and ineptitude of the Treasurer. Everybody who has had the opportunity to comment on this matter has warned the Treasurer that he needs to act on the explosion in debt—and he has done nothing. Every commentator warned him that he needed to act on the extent to which the property seminar industry has been getting out of control—was he the only person in Australia who did not know that Henry Kaye existed?—artificially inflating the residential housing market, particularly in the investment housing area, and leading people more and more into inflated prices. Everybody has been warning the Treasurer on the need to take some initiative to smooth the housing cycle—most particularly the current Leader of the Opposition—and the Treasurer has consistently refused to act. It is easy for us to establish that it is the Treasurer's failure; the only problem is that it is not he who pays the price. Young Australian families are paying the price in their mortgage payments or in the increasing gap between them and entry to the housing market. The purchase of that first home has been a cornerstone of stability in Australian society for decades. It is now under threat like never before. Housing affordability is at an all-time low.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—That effort from the member for Fraser was a little disappointing, a little lame. There was not a lot of passion and not much enthusiasm, but there was a whole lot of political rhetoric that means little to not only the 1.1 million small businesses out there but also, significantly, the many self-funded retirees, home owners and a range of others—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Batman has already been warned.
—Christmas is coming. It might have come yesterday for us—and I will give the reasons for that in a minute when I refer to the member for Werriwa's comments on rising interest rates, the impact of debt and so on. I want to read into the Hansard today's statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He said:
In Australia, the indications are that the economy has strengthened considerably since mid year. The pace of consumer spending has accelerated sharply, business confidence is high, and the labour market has firmed over recent months.
... notwithstanding some early signs of a change in sentiment in the housing market, the overall prospects are for strong growth of the Australian economy.
He went on to say:
Monetary policy is continuing to have a stimulatory effect on the economy through domestic credit expansion.
That basically means that Australians continue to borrow considerable amounts of money. Further, he said:
The growth of credit remains rapid and indeed has picked up further in the past few months. The prevailing level of the cash rate after the November increase was still below neutral, and interest rates of financial intermediaries remained low by the standards of recent years.
That final comment is so true: interest rates today are considerably lower than they have been for the last 30 years and are certainly much lower than they were under the Labor Party.
Why are interest rates still low by comparison with previous years? It is due to a combination of factors. There is the fact that the government is running surplus budgets and does not have to go into the marketplace and compete with home borrowers for the same limited pool of money that is available to be borrowed, which means that, without competition in that marketplace, interest rates are lower. With the government running a fiscal surplus not only are we able to avoid borrowing but, importantly, we are able to buy back some of the debt that was out there. This effectively means that we are freeing up more cash to be made available to potential borrowers, which reduces the margin in the marketplace, making borrowing more affordable for so many Australians.
The second point is this: Australia has an extremely strong economy. The member for Fraser was keen to quote the Economist. I refer the member for Fraser to the economic growth forecast in the Economist—and this is even with the rapid improvement in the state of the American economy. All of these economies are off a low base, so you would expect them to have high growth coming out of either recession or significant economic downturn. Taking all that into account—and even taking into account the fact that the Australian economy did not dip into recession in the last few years but in fact remained one of the strongest economies in the developed world during the period when so many of our trading partners were in recession or depression—it remains a fact that, even on the Economist's own forecast, the fastest growing economies in the world in 2005, in order, are Ireland, Australia, Finland, the United States, Canada, Spain, Britain, Belgium, Sweden and Portugal. 
That says that the Australian economy is extremely strong. It means that for all those small business people out there who may have higher interest rates as a result of the independent Reserve Bank decision today the key ingredient to the growth of any small business is customers coming through the door, and those customers are coming through the door in bucket loads. That is not just reflected in the growth indicators of the Economist; I refer to the Sensis business index, which is the old Yellow Pages index, where after surveying 1,200 small businesses they found that confidence among small businesses is now at its highest level since 1994.
What about the ACCI small business survey? It says that the ACCI small business barometer has risen significantly in the last quarter. This represents the fourth highest level since the series began. How about the Dunn and Bradstreet business index released in October this year, which says:
Sales growth was above expectations. Profits were just above expectations. Capital investment eased slightly but remains greater than expected.
And importantly, it states:
92 per cent of businesses indicated that an increase in bank lending rates as a result of a rise in official rates would either have no effect or a moderately negative effect on their business.
In that time since that survey came out, there has been improved economic growth—well beyond the expectations of even the government—and, as the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank clearly indicates, the economy is stronger than even we had predicted.
It is no time for complacency. The member for Fraser focused today on the fact that—he claims—people are paying more in dollar terms in repayments to banks than they might have done a few years ago. That is the claim of the member for Fraser. We can always claim that. We can claim that today we are paying more for our cars than we might have done in 1950, because they might have been 4,000 in those days and cars are about $12,000 now. Do you know what? I do not need to shoot down the member for Fraser; I just refer to the words of the member for Werriwa. He will do it. I quote him—and this is April 2002, not 10 or 15 years ago. This is the now Leader of the Opposition in April 2002 saying to the Sydney Morning Herald—and I want the member for Fraser to listen to this: `Debt is always relative to assets.' He says that in the mid-1980s Australians held $4 in assets for every $1 in household income—today they hold $6.50 in assets for every $1. That is not Joe Hockey or Peter Costello or the Governor of the Reserve Bank or anyone else; that is the member for Werriwa. You elected him leader—well, you did not do it, but your colleagues elected him leader yesterday.
—The minister will address his comments through the chair.
—The leader of the Labor Party has stated unequivocally that debt is always relative to assets. Over the last few years there has been a massive growth in the assets of Australians and therefore they have chosen to borrow more money. But do you know what? This government believes in safety nets. We think it is appropriate to be there to help those people who may want—and may need, more importantly—a bit of a hand. That is why we introduced the home owners grant. That is why we introduced a $7,000 grant to people who are buying their first home. That is something that the Labor Party could only have ever dreamed of. 
—The member for Fraser has had his opportunity to speak.
—We introduced that because we wanted to help people to get into homes, and now we have record levels of home ownership in Australia. I would also like to point out that the member for Werriwa is on record saying he wants to provide tax disincentives for people in Western Sydney to own their own homes. Do you know what he wants? He wants a growth levy; he wants to put a tax on homes in Western Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition wants to put a tax on homes in Western Sydney to dissuade people from living there. That is bizarre economics—voodoo economics.
The member for Fraser asks how is this going to affect families. I ask the member for Fraser: why did the Labor Party oppose the baby bonus? That helps families—$170 million a year—and the Labor Party wants to abolish the baby bonus.
—It was a bit of a disaster, wasn't it?
—What did you say?
—It's a bit of a disaster that one, Joe, don't you think?
—Okay; the member for Braddon says the baby bonus is a bit of a disaster—
—Yes.
—and confirms that the Labor Party is going to abolish it. Is that right, Sid?
—No, I did not say that.
—It is a disaster, but they are not going to abolish it.
—You will end up doing that.
—The member for Braddon!
—He asked me a question.
—The member for Braddon is warned!
—He needs help. The family tax benefit: in nominal terms, the government has increased expenditure on family assistance by $2,000 million a year.
—By how much?
—By $2,000 million a year! Why did the Labor Party oppose that? Why did the Labor Party oppose us helping families? What about child care? The government has spent more than $7,000 million on child care in its first six years in office. That is a 70 per cent increase in real terms; a 70—seven zero—per cent increase on the Labor Party. Why does the Labor Party oppose that? Even our financial counselling program—$2.3 million—the Labor Party opposes.
So let us get this right: the Labor Party opposed the abolition of provisional tax; the Labor Party opposed the abolition of wholesale sales tax; the Labor Party opposed our cuts in income tax where we reduced income tax on individuals so that 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar; the Labor Party opposed the abolition of FID; and the Labor Party opposed the abolition of bank accounts debit tax. And do you know what? That is the tip of the iceberg. The Labor Party opposed those initiatives, and now they have elected a Leader of the Opposition who supports taking the capital gains tax to the family home, who believes you should have growth levies on homes in Western Sydney and who wants to abolish negative gearing. 
What sort of picture are we getting here? That picture is pretty clear: it is that the Labor Party believes in higher tax; the Labor Party believes, therefore, in higher interest rates; the Labor Party believes in hurting families—not trying to help them—because every initiative that we have put in place that helps families, the Labor Party has opposed. Here we are doing the hard yards on economic reform, undertaking budget reform, trying to undertake industrial relations reform and undertaking significant macro and micro economic reform that deliver real benefits to Australia—delivering stronger economies even in the face of the most difficult trading environment Australia has probably faced in a decade, if not longer—and the Labor Party has opposed us every single step of the way.
If we truly believe in doing the right thing by the Australian people—and we do—then we call on the Labor Party to join us on the journey. We call on the Labor Party to join us in implementing real reform that is going to deliver real benefits for Australian families and not go down the path that the Labor Party wants to go down of increasing tax on families, increasing interest rates for families and small businesses, and putting in place speed humps and impediments that are only going to slow the Australian economy and, at the end of the day, worsen the standard of living for far too many Australians.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Interest Rates</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The trouble with this government and its attitude to interest rates is that it can only see one figure. Every time the question of housing affordability comes up, the Treasurer trots out the level of interest rates under Labor—as this minister has just done—and the Prime Minister tells us how much the average household is saving on mortgage payments each month. But that is not the whole picture. In fact—and listen to this, Minister—out there in the real world a lot of households are doing it tough, but this government wants to pretend that everything is rosy. From here in Canberra, you can easily be fooled into thinking in terms of averages. But we should all remember the statistician who drowned wading across the river with an average depth of one metre. Averages do not tell us what it is like at the margin; they do not tell us much about those households suffering mortgage stress or just how many households are suffering from mortgage stress.
I am grateful for the Parliamentary Library research note No. 16, which sheds some light on the effect of interest rate rises and who is affected. The paper defines mortgage stress:
... as a situation in which homebuyers are paying 35 per cent or more of their income on home loan repayments.
The reason for that definition is that an accepted rule of home lending is that home loan repayments should not exceed one-third of household income. But we also need to take income levels into account. The paper also shows that for income levels of less than $21,000, more than half of all households experience mortgage stress. But for incomes over $100,000, less than four per cent of households are affected.
Importantly, levels of mortgage stress are much higher in some parts of Australia than in others. In looking at stress by electorate, we find that the top 10 most affected are all in Sydney. While the silvertail electorate of Wentworth ranks the highest, the electorate of my colleague the member for Reid ranks number two. My own electorate of Fowler ranks eighth highest, with Barton, Watson and Blaxland ranking even higher. But while Wentworth has the third highest household income in Australia, Fowler has the lowest household income of any metropolitan seat in Australia. That is the picture that the government is missing. It is definitely missing that picture. It cannot see that for tens of thousands of Australian families, mortgage stress is a reality; it is a fact of life. 
As a result of today's increase in interest rates by a quarter of a per cent, coming on top of a similar rise in October, many of those families face an increase of $20 a week or $80 a month in their mortgage payment. That is $20 a week that will have to come out of an already tight family budget. For families which we can define as suffering from mortgage stress, that $20 a week can be, and will be, the straw that breaks the camel's back. Remember, mortgage stress is higher for low-income households. But the research paper also tells us that 88,000 households are paying more than 45 per cent of their income on loan repayments. Two-thirds of them are low-income households earning less than $36,000 a year. That is 88,000 households that are doing it tough, and many of those are in the so-called middle ring suburbs of Sydney.
So while the Prime Minister says that he does not get many complaints from people saying that the value of their home has risen, the reality is that the dream of home ownership in Sydney is fading fast for many younger families and first home buyers. With median home prices over $400,000, young families have been priced out of areas that are close to family support. The Reserve Bank figures show that the average mortgage for first home buyers has increased from $92,000 to $162,000 since 1996. But try to tell a first home buyer in Sydney that they will need a mortgage of only $160,000 and they will definitely laugh at you. The fact is that most new first home buyers in Sydney are taking out mortgages of over $300,000, and even then they would need to save up a $100,000 deposit just to buy an average home.
The figures I have quoted have been looking back over home loans made in past years, but we face a blow-out in mortgage stress in the years to come, as higher and higher mortgages are taken on to purchase homes in areas of Sydney. One of the most significant impacts of that is that families are delaying having children until they can get ahead on their mortgage payments. But if family income falls, mortgage stress will affect many families.
To get some idea of the impact of the recent interest rate rises on families, let us look at a typical family in my electorate of Fowler. I will call them the Tran family. The Trans bought a town house in Canley Vale last year and have a $260,000 mortgage. With the quarter per cent increase in October and this month's quarter per cent rise, they now have to find an extra $80 a month to meet their mortgage repayment. That means something has to be cut. The family will go without. If you have a high income, you can probably do without a few luxuries. But if you are like the Tran family and are paying more than 35 per cent of your income in mortgage payments, that is sad. Their life has just got a lot harder. That $80 a month might be for your basic private health insurance. It might be for music lessons for one of the kids or it might mean shaving a bit off each item of household spending. Whichever way you look at it, what it means is $80 a month that you do not have anymore. Just imagine that. Take four $20 notes out of your packet and tear them up. That is what these interest rate rises mean to the Tran family and that is what they mean to hundreds of thousands of Australian families today.
As I said at the start, the government always trots out the line about interest rates under Labor. I was interested to read the story of Labor's high interest rates in the late 1980s. In his autobiography, former Labor Minister John Button gives a frank account of the time. What is revealing is that John Button admits that he and other Labor ministers at the time simply could not appreciate the hurt that high interest rates were causing. Here they were, in this same ivory tower in Canberra that we sit in today, looking at the figures that gave them a picture of the average mortgage. They could not see the mortgage stress. They could not see the hurt that they were causing to families. They learned their lesson the hard way. This government will learn its lesson the hard way at the next federal election. 
But this government is no different. It still talks of averages. The Prime Minister still thinks that rising home values are good for all Australians, and the Treasurer is too busy talking about ancient history to see how Australian families are hurting under rising interest rates today. So we can expect interest rates to increase even further. The pain of mortgage stress will affect more and more Australian families. They will become the interest rate rises that we have to have, just like the GST that we had to have. When you look past the statistics and the Reserve Bank reports, when you look beyond the averages to see how those families on the margins are affected and when you look at what each quarter per cent rise does to the family budget, you see a different picture. Running an economy is not just about pulling levers. Interest rates are a blunt instrument for controlling the economy, and they will go up.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2003-12-03,"—It is always a revelation when we hear the acting shadow Treasurer, the member for Fraser, raising the issue of interest rates. I would say that the credibility of the member for Fraser in the area of interest rates is probably very similar to the credibility of Henry Kaye in the area of property investment. In fact, the opening premise in this matter of public importance is incorrect. I will quote it. It says:
The impact on families of the Government's decision to raise interest rates ...
The member for Fraser has got it wrong again. It is in fact the Reserve Bank's decision—the decision of an independent body—to raise interest rates, not a decision of the government. The member for Fraser was speaking about how the government should be controlling the property market, either through some means other than interest rates or by perhaps having pressured the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates sooner. I wonder if he is actually raising the proposition of removing the deduction on negative gearing to take the steam out of the property market. That is an interesting proposition that has been put forward by the member for Werriwa. Investor debt is a major element in the property market at the moment and certainly the member for Fraser seems to be advocating that.
When it comes to the issue of families, one of the best things that governments can do for families is provide a strong and stable economic environment where families can prosper. This government has done a great deal for families. This government has provided over one million new jobs. This government has reduced unemployment from 10.9 per cent under Labor to 5.6 per cent. Creating jobs is a great way to assist families and achieve a stable society. This government has paid back $66 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt, so we can put that interest saving into providing services, such as health and education services, for the benefit of families. In fact, the level of government debt as a proportion of GDP is the lowest in 20 years.
This government has provided tax cuts, both through the new tax system and in the last budget. That has been a great move for families. This government has presided over a dramatic fall in interest rates. Even with the 0.25 per cent increase in interest rates announced by the Reserve Bank today, housing interest rates are in the order of 10 per cent lower than they were under the Labor Party at the peak of their rule, when the interest rate for families on the family home was 17 per cent. This reduction in interest rates has been achieved on the back of strong economic growth. It is a tremendous quinella to achieve not only low interest rates but also at the same time strong economic growth. 
If we look at the position of families, I wonder whether they would invite the Labor Party back to the Treasury bench. If you have a look at a $190,000 mortgage, the current interest rate increase would cost the average family with a $190,000 mortgage around $40 a month. If I were to go back to the Labor Party regime of 17 per cent interest rates, it would be $1,600 a month extra. We do not want to go back to that. I do not know too many families out there that would invite Labor back to the Treasury bench on the promise of increasing their monthly mortgage repayments by some $1,600. Why has the government been able to keep interest rates low: because of sound economic management. This government runs consistent surpluses, compared with the endless Labor spending binge. Labor's excessive spending binges meant that the Labor Party were endlessly competing with families out there in the mortgage markets—they were borrowing the money that families needed to buy their own homes. Because they could not manage the Treasury or their government budgets, they pushed the interest rates up for families and for small business.
The member for Fraser was in fact part of the dream team of the early nineties, when they were spending like there was no tomorrow. How much was the deficit back in those days, when the member for Fraser was actually over here on the government side? Was it $10 billion? No, it was more than that—it was in the order of $15 billion. They were out there driving families out of their homes through high interest rates, crippling small businesses and driving them out of business. They were throwing countless Australians on the unemployment queue. They think that is a good policy for families, but I think not. It is not a good formula for a cohesive society. It is not a good formula for strong families.
The message that I think the average Australian would like to send to Labor is: `Keep your grubby hands out of our pockets and let us manage our own families with dignity. Let us provide for ourselves. Give us the opportunity to prosper and to achieve an improvement in wealth.' Another issue that has been raised in this debate is that, in fact, the level of net financial wealth of families is increasing. For each dollar of household debt, the average family has in the order of $2 in financial assets and $6 in total assets. The net wealth of households has been increasing at the rate of about 10 per cent per annum or about eight per cent in real terms. So it is a fairly good story and it is quite a good story for families.
Labor cannot help itself—it just spends and spends and taxes and taxes. I think the average family would be saying to Labor, `Keep your hands off the keys to the Treasury.' The member for Lilley, the shadow minister for family and community services, wants to spend an extra $1 billion on welfare. The member for Sydney wants to pour a lot more money into universities. She does not provide any details as to how that would be paid for, but she wants to pour a bit more into universities. She thinks that is not a bad idea. The shadow minister for education has a bit of a problem budgeting as well. She came up with a $218 million error in her calculations. So we have shadow ministers running around everywhere with spending proposals, all of them a bit different. But what is the moral to the story? It is that, if you get enough Labor shadows together, you get a black hole. That is exactly what the families of Australia do not want—they do not want another budget black hole. They do not want the government in there competing in the marketplace for finances and driving up interest rates, just like the Labor government did in the nineties. They do not want that to happen. They want good, solid government and they want the government to run a balanced budget. They want the government to continue to pay back debt. They want good, strong economic growth in a low interest rate environment. 
What about the state Labor governments? What are they doing for young families? What they are doing is imposing an incredible burden on first home buyers through stamp duty. I have heard the members opposite bemoaning the plight of first home buyers, and we sympathise. Getting your own home is one of the greatest things that you can ever do. How are the state Labor governments contributing? They are contributing a huge stamp duty burden. Bob Carr is ripping off first home buyers—ripping off all home buyers—with a massive stamp duty take. But he is not content with the benefits he is getting out of stamp duty; he is also adding about 40 per cent in total in charges, stamp duty and levies on insurance policies. So the first home buyer not only has to pay a huge figure in stamp duty; he also has to pay a massive state government levy on his insurance premium. That is what Labor in government do to help families. They impose a huge stamp duty impediment and a huge cost on your insurance premiums.
This government has provided strong economic management, a low-interest rate environment and jobs. It has provided welcome relief for families after those hard years of Labor. In addition, the government has quite a range of policies that are specifically targeted to assist families. The government has allocated about $19 billion in assistance to families through the family tax benefit, parenting payments and maternity and immunisation allowances. The family tax benefit is estimated to be worth about $11.25 billion per annum, child-care benefit worth $1.59 billion, parenting payment worth $5.94 billion and the maternity and immunisation allowances worth $222 million. And then there is the baby bonus. The members opposite scoffed at the baby bonus. I think the member for Braddon said that their policy statement is going to remove it. The government has allocated $170 million for the baby bonus. Then there is the fairer tax system. As I said before, there are tax cuts for families—a great move.
This government is providing a range of initiatives for families. It believes the family is the cornerstone of our society and should be supported. The government has supported the family with targeted programs and strong economic management. The opposition provide a high-interest rate, high-cost, high-taxing scenario, which I do not think the Australian people are going to welcome, and they are certainly not going to be encouraged to give the opposition the keys to the treasury bench.

That the amendments be disagreed to.
The government is committed to promoting equity, diversity and non-discriminatory practices in the workplace, and these practices are integral to the ability of the Defence Force to maintain operational capability and effectiveness. The Senate has proposed amendments to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 that would recognise same sex couples for the purpose of eligibility for the Defence Home Owners Scheme. Existing Australian Defence Force policy prohibits discrimination and harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation. Accordingly, applicants for the Defence Home Owners Scheme are not asked about their sexual orientation, and sexual orientation is not taken into consideration when determining an individual's eligibility for the Defence Home Owners Scheme. 
The existing policy arrangements across most government programs for the recognition of a member's spouse are based on two pieces of Commonwealth legislation. The first of those, the Marriage Act, provides that marriage according to Australian law is the union of a man and a woman. The second, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, defines a de facto relationship as being with a person of the opposite sex. The amendments proposed by the Senate take an ad hoc and overly simplistic approach to this issue. Any decision to recognise same sex couples for the purpose of eligibility for government funded financial benefits would need to be taken in a whole-of-government context. At this time, there are no plans to extend recognition to same sex couples.
The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 contains many important measures that are intended to: reform and revitalise various actions in the defence portfolio, such as the improper use of service decorations and falsely representing service personnel; ensure the application of contemporary standards of judicial independence and impartiality in the military discipline system; and modernise the name of the Australian Defence Force cadets. These measures have enjoyed bipartisan support, and the passage of the bill should not be delayed for further consideration of these ad hoc amendments. Accordingly, the House should not accept these amendments.",REPS,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The ALP indicated our support for the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 when it was debated in this chamber last week. We supported this omnibus bill because, among other things, it contains increases in penalties for people who impersonate veterans or wear medals to which they are not entitled and which they have not earned. For some reason, the government did not progress the bill for many months, and we believe the veteran community has waited far too long for this promise of increased penalties in relation to medal fraud to be delivered. We do not intend to delay this bill here today but, in support of the Democrat amendments moved in the other place, we would like the government to more clearly explain why they oppose those amendments. I listened to what the parliamentary secretary had to say, but I do ask the government to tell us why they rejected the amendments and what problem they have with those amendments, which simply appear to remove some discriminatory practices in the area of Defence Force home loan assistance for same sex couples who are members of the ADF.
In the other place Senator Chris Evans, the shadow minister for defence, reiterated that it is the ALP's strong position that this bill should pass through all stages of the parliament this session. We do not intend to delay that passage. We do, however, take this opportunity to call on the government to reassess its position on the amendments or at least explain its rationale for opposing them. The ALP have given a commitment to the defence community to get this bill through this session because of the medal fraud issues. We called on veterans groups to assist us to put pressure on the government to get this bill, which has sat on the NoticePaper for so long, dealt with, to get it through this year. We do not intend to renege on that commitment. We simply ask the government to spell out the rationale for its objection to the reasonable Democrat amendments and to get this bill back to the Senate, where it can be dealt with and passed this week.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. I welcome the Democrat amendments and the Labor Party's support for those amendments. Like the former speaker, I would ask if and when the government is going to support the removal of same sex discrimination from federal legislation. It has the opportunity in this instance to support that, but I think it is all very clear to us that the current government is not prepared in any way to look at this issue in any real detail or with any real thought of removing this discrimination within the Australian community. That is a real shame. I heard the debate in the other place last night, and it was good to hear that the opposition have detailed plans, when they do eventually get into government, to look at this issue in great detail and generally get rid of a lot of the problems in respect of same sex couples that exist in our legislation at the moment. I welcome that, and I hope it comes sooner rather than later. It is a shame that the government really has shown its hand here and does not want to remove this blatant discrimination against certain sections of the Australian community. The Australian Greens are very supportive of these amendments. It is a shame that the government does not address this issue, especially as it has the opportunity to do that at present.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I move:
That amendment (3) be disagreed to.
Firstly, this particular amendment passed by the Senate would prescribe that a rule maker must ensure that appropriate consultation is undertaken where a legislative instrument is likely to have a direct or substantially indirect effect on business or any other sector of the community, human rights or civil liberties or natural and Aboriginal cultural or built environment. This is no longer an indicative list when consultation is particularly appropriate but is a prescriptive list. At the same time it lists circumstances so broad and vague that they are difficult as to precise definition. Secondly, the amendment creates doubt as to who determines the appropriateness of consultation and whether it has been undertaken. The provision requires the rule maker to ensure that the appropriate consultation is undertaken but is silent as to who forms this opinion. This creates the risk that the validity of the legislative instrument may be challenged on the basis that appropriate consultation was not undertaken. 
Thirdly, even to the extent that meaning can be given to the requirements, what is appropriate is essentially a matter of individual judgment. There is no basis for any objective standard that the rule maker can refer to. For example, how is a rule maker to ensure that appropriate consultation is undertaken in relation to an instrument that affects any other sector of the community? Fourthly, the amendment requires consultation even when this is not reasonably practicable. This places an onerous obligation on rule makers. Accordingly, the House of Representatives should not accept this amendment.",REPS,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,20,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—As we have indicated, the opposition broadly support the Legislative Instruments Bill 2003—indeed, it may well be the case that we are more supportive of the principles of the bill at this point in time. We think it is sound policy and we have been extremely cooperative to secure its progress through the parliament, but I will comment on this specific amendment—that is, amendment (3). It was an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, which we recognise. The amendment was supported by Labor. It would encourage consultation before the making of delegated legislation in a wider range of circumstances beyond those listed in the bill. We believe that the government should agree to the amendment, which would provide stronger encouragement to the government to consult not just on delegated legislation that impacts on business and restricts competition but also on delegated legislation that impacts on the human rights of all Australians.
We believe that such a process of consultation could, over the longer term, try and reinvigorate—at least to a limited extent—the input of the Australian population in terms of delegated legislation, which is ever increasing in modern democracies in the impact that it has on lifestyles. Regarding the framework of our democratic system, it is firmly the view of the opposition that we should be encouraging more rather than less consultation. For that reason, we thought the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats was sensible and would have encouraged greater consultation and should have been supported, so we oppose the government's not agreeing to that amendment.

Schedule 1—Amendment of other legislation
There are five new government amendments that have been prepared to enable the government to insist on a proposed change dealing with the date of effect of subordinate instruments whether legislative or non-legislative. When this legislation was before the Senate, amendments dealing with this matter were defeated. The legislation has now been returned to the House. Because the transitional and consequential amendments bill is returned unamended, it is necessary to amend the Legislative Instruments Bill 2003 so that the change made indirectly to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 by the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 is now made directly by an amending schedule to the Legislative Instruments Bill 2003.
Amendments (1), (2) and (3) are merely technical to facilitate that change. In relation to amendments (1) and (2), let me just say they provide that the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act made by schedule 1 commence immediately after the enactment of the transitional provisions and consequential amendments bill. Amendment (3) is technical, inserting reference to the new schedule.
Amendment (4) replaces the existing provision with a provision based on the existing words in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This amendment restores the status quo and reflects the current operation of the Acts Interpretation Act. It has always been the government's intention that this provision should apply to the commencement of legislative instruments under the Legislative Instruments Bill in the same way that the Acts Interpretation Act provision operates for regulations and other disallowable instruments. This means that when an instrument is to commence on a particular date, it commences at the beginning of that date. This provides certainty as to when an instrument commences. It avoids the law changing part way through a day. This is the effect of the existing provision of the Acts Interpretation Act and it provides certainty as to an instrument commences. Redrafting, in an effort to modernise the provision in the Acts Interpretation Act, has caused an unintended error in the current provisions set out in the bill. The need to revisit this provision was foreshadowed by government officials in answers to questions on notice when there was a hearing by the Senate Regulations and Ordinance Committee on 10 September 2003.
Amendment (5) inserts a new schedule 1 in the Legislative Instruments Bill. Schedule 1 will amend the Acts Interpretation Act, which was amended by the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, to replace the existing provision dealing with commencement with a provision based on the Acts Interpretation Act. The reasons for the amendment are the same as for government amendment (4). ",REPS,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,20,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The opposition opposes amendments (1) to (5). It is interesting that these amendments arise, as the Attorney-General says, from what was said to be an original drafting error contained in the original legislation. As I understand that original provision, it is as currently appears in the bill as returned from the Senate. Lines 31 to 32, on page 16, seek to prevent retrospective operation of a legislative instrument. They say that if a legislative instrument is expressed to take effect from a time before it is registered, it will take effect from that time. What the government wants to insert is:
A legislative instrument, or a provision of a legislative instrument, has no effect if, apart from this subsection, it would take effect before the date it is registered ...
That circumstance obviously arises in respect of the recent situation of the Minasa Bone and the regulations excising islands off Northern Australia. We surmise that the amendment has more to do with enabling the government to undertake similar measures in terms of excising islands on a day, even though the rights may have materialised; for instance, as a result of a claim for asylum being made before the act of excision takes effect. We believe that is the motivation for the government replacing the reference to `time', which obviously could be a time during the course of a day, with the word `date'. We believe that the government should stand by its original wording.
As I have said, the amendments redraft the provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill relating to that aspect of prejudicial retrospective commencement of legislative instruments. The reasons for the opposition not agreeing to these amendments were set out in the debate last night in the Senate, where we went through this issue in some detail. However, in essence, we believe that this is an instance of the government itself backsliding on its own legislation as originally drafted when it belatedly realised it was potentially in conflict with its course of action in respect of the Minasa Bone. Let me say again, from the point of view of cooperating with the passage of this legislation, we will not divide on it, but in my speech we have officially recorded our disappointment at what the government is seeking to do in this respect.",REPS,<title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—Let me reaffirm the point I made in my earlier comments on the Legislative Instruments Bill 2003. This is a question of principle. The Acts Interpretation Act has operated since about 1901. All regulations have been dealt with in this way under governments over a long period of time. It was only in relation to the Minasa Bone that people became alert to the way in which those provisions would operate. The government is certainly not of the view that what happened then was in any way inappropriate, and we certainly would not wish to make amendments that suggested that we accepted that it may not have been appropriate. We put that beyond doubt.
The advice that we have is that what is occurring here may not have any impact on any future regulation excising islands in the way in which we sought to in the regulations that were enacted several weeks ago. That is an issue that we have asked about, as to whether it would affect that. I am told that some advice suggests that there are other forms of legislative instrument that might be affected but not necessarily regulations for the purposes of an excision. But whether they are or not, it seems to me that it is not desirable to have provisions which would operate under the Acts Interpretation Act in one way and, because you have made these amendments, in the legislative instruments act would be dealt with in another. That is an important issue. 
I go back to the point that was made in the earlier comments. We do believe that there is a need for certainty, and to have a situation where regulations come in and you have to find a particular point in time in the day that they commence means that you might have to keep precise records of times at which regulations or other instruments are given effect to. You have to record it because, if somebody wants to test that, you have to introduce evidence in a court. It is clearly a much easier route to adopt, for all cases, to have a point of time in the day at which the operation of an instrument would occur. That is the substantial reason, and the measures ought to be supported. I thank you for the facilitation here, and hopefully the Senate will see the good sense of these amendments as I have proposed them.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of off-base housing for Defence at Queanbeyan, NSW.
The Defence Housing Authority proposes a major residential development to provide 40 new residences at Queanbeyan in New South Wales. The role of the Defence Housing Authority is to provide suitable housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of the Department of Defence. The Defence Housing Authority satisfies defence accommodation requirements by a mixture of construction off base, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; construction on base to accord with defence operational or policy requirements, if such construction is the most cost effective for all concerned; direct purchase, with a view to retaining the properties or selling them with a lease attached; and direct lease from the private rental market.
In locations where there is a high level of defence demand, constructed housing delivered through bulk procurement contracts is the most effective provisioning option, because plans can be geared to defence requirements. This project involves developing a residential site previously used as a pitch and putt business in Queanbeyan. The site is presently vacant.
Defence Housing Authority surveys undertaken with defence personnel based in the Australian Capital Territory region have shown a clear preference for detached dwellings, with townhouses being the second choice; apartments are the least preferred. Taking these preferences into account, it is proposed to construct 40 residences, comprising 33 detached dwellings and seven townhouses. The new residences will be fully compliant with current defence and community standards. 
The proposed project will have a positive effect on the local economy during the construction period, both through persons working directly on the site and through the many more persons working off site supplying material, plant and equipment. The construction of these new dwellings is not expected to affect either the sale market or the rental market for residential accommodation in the Queanbeyan area. The estimated cost of the proposal is $12 million.
In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed. Subject to parliamentary and Defence Housing Authority board approval, the construction program is planned to commence in February next year, with the delivery of all completed dwellings expected to occur by November 2004. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support.  I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—On indulgence and very briefly, I strongly support the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Development of off-base housing for defence is an excellent project for the Queanbeyan area. Certainly residents were not all that happy about losing their pitch and putt area, but a decision was made by the private owner at the time to move on—and I think this is a very good use of that land.
Consultation with various property owners in the region has been excellent. Some concerns were raised about traffic, but a redesign has certainly helped in that regard. I am really pleased that the Defence Housing Authority has taken those concerns into account with the redesign and we have ended up with a very good result. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know that you also were at the hearing and had a look on the ground. I think the aspect is excellent. It will provide very good accommodation for defence personnel and will be a great addition to the Queanbeyan community. Contractors and materials for the projected earthworks, building and all those sorts of things will be gained in the region, which is another great stimulus the project will provide.
I certainly commend this project and thank the DHA for being so visionary in what it has put together for the Queanbeyan community and defence personnel. Many more defence personnel are gradually coming into our region; their numbers will increase even further when Headquarters Australian Theatre, between Queanbeyan and Bungendore, progresses over the next couple of years. I commend the project to the House and to the people of Queanbeyan.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a respecified Immigration Reception and Processing Centre on Christmas Island.
The Department of Finance and Administration proposes to construct a respecified purpose-built immigration reception and processing centre on Christmas Island. On 21 March 2002, the House of Representatives passed a motion agreeing that the initial Christmas Island immigration reception and processing centre project proceed without referral to the Public Works Committee, due to the urgency of the project. The initial project was expected to include the construction of a facility for 1,200 residents. 
The work completed under the original contract, primarily carried out by Walter Construction Group, included a concept design for a facility for 1,200 residents, including a range of options; construction of a 350-person village to accommodate construction workers; bulk earthworks; and associated works, such as fencing and site safety measures. There has also been external infrastructure installed to support the facility, including the construction of a new port facility, staff housing, and electricity and water mains connecting the site to Christmas Island central facilities.
In February this year the government announced that, due to the success of the government's unauthorised arrivals deterrence policy, the scope of the project would be reduced. In light of the less urgent time line for the completion of the facility and the reduced and changed scope of the works, further work on the initial project and the contract with Walter Construction Group was terminated. The government now proposes a new project, which involves revised specifications in relation to the precise facilities to be provided and the project delivery mechanism to be used.
The size of the facility is to be reduced from 1,200 beds to 800 beds, with both purpose-designed and contingency accommodation. Further, the project delivery time has been increased and the delivery methodology amended from fast track to a traditional delivery method involving fixed price tenders based on a detailed design developed to meet specifications from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.
The scope of works for this respecified project will involve: the design of the facility based on the brief for the new facility; completion of platforms to accommodate the buildings; site works and fencing; construction of the required accommodation and central facilities; and associated information technology, security systems and necessary infrastructure. The total estimated capital cost of the proposed works is $276.2 million, which includes $197.7 million for the Department of Finance and Administration to manage and meet the cost incurred in delivering the project from 19 February 2003 to completion. The balance of funding of $78.5 million was allocated to the original immigration reception and processing centre that was given parliamentary authority to proceed on 21 March 2002.
In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project should proceed subject to its recommendations. The Department of Finance and Administration accepts the recommendations of the committee. Subject to parliamentary approval, main works construction is scheduled to start in the third quarter of next year, with completion expected in the first quarter of 2006. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed Christmas Island community recreation centre.
The Department of Transport and Regional Services proposes to construct a new community recreation centre on Christmas Island. In March 2002, the government announced that it would construct an immigration reception and processing centre and fund a dedicated community recreation centre on Christmas Island. The Department of Transport and Regional Services, in conjunction with the Christmas Island community, developed a scope of works for the recreation centre in the period that the infrastructure for the immigration reception and processing centre was being built. 
Following completion of the infrastructure works for the immigration reception and processing centre and a community consultation process, there is now a strong community expectation that the Commonwealth will commence construction of the recreation centre. The proposed centre on Christmas Island will be in the form of a dedicated sports facility and will include: a swimming pool, a multi-use recreation hall, change rooms, and ancillary rooms and service areas. This project has been identified to serve the community needs of an increased population. With major projects such as the immigration reception and processing centre and the Asia Pacific Space Centre project still to be built, the long-term forecast for the population growth of Christmas Island has been estimated at 5,000.
The recreation centre is to be constructed adjacent to the existing community sports oval. This location, on the upper plateau, provides the most comfortable environmental conditions on the island for active sports. The new community infrastructure would achieve the following: support the objective of the government to provide conditions and services that are aligned with those in comparable mainland communities, provide all-weather sporting infrastructure and create short- and long-term job opportunities for the local community to help relieve unemployment and develop the skills base of the island. The proposed new community recreation centre is designed to balance the commercial and social benefits for all Christmas Islanders in this unique Commonwealth territory.
The works for the recreation centre will comply with all relevant Commonwealth and Western Australian town planning, building and safety regulations. All works will be undertaken to ensure that any potential environmental damage to the area is minimised. A comprehensive community consultation program has been implemented throughout the planning and development stages of the proposed community recreation centre, involving the Christmas Island administration, stakeholders and the local community. The estimated cost of the new proposal is $8 million. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed subject to its recommendations.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—Before my contribution on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003 was so effectively interrupted by question time, I was referring to the Prime Minister's proud boast at a speech just a few weeks ago of his achievements. Right at the top of his list of achievements was the reduction in the proportion of the private sector work force represented by trade unions to 18 per cent. It is obvious that the Prime Minister thinks that the lower that figure the better and that, if he could get his way, there would be no trade unions in this country at all. But he fails to recognise that those who are represented by trade unions in this country total 1.8 million working Australians. 
There are 1.8 million proud trade union members; they have joined a union because that was their desire, despite a hostile regulatory environment. The first wave of industrial relations legislation was passed in 1996, making it more difficult for members of the work force to be represented by a trade union and for trade unions to discharge their responsibilities and services back to those members. Yet 1.8 million Australians remain represented by the great Australian trade union movement and that great movement has strong links to the great Australian Labor Party—links of which we are all proud. 
We are proud of our links with the trade union movement in this country. I also point out that the 1.8 million proud Australians in this country who are members of trade unions have relatives, sons, daughters, wives, husbands and friends. They are a very big force in this country—a force for fairness and for a sense of a fair go. Mobilising these 1.8 million Australians with their families, their friends and their relatives is a very worthy task, because with that sort of force behind the Australian Labor Party we will be incredibly hard to defeat at the next election. 
The Prime Minister might think that this de-unionisation is a good thing. We do not think it is a good thing at all. We support the right of working Australians to be represented by trade unions, and we will reinstate the right of Australians to bargain collectively. Employers will recognise that, when Australians choose to be represented by a trade union, they will need to bargain with that trade union. 
In respect of this legislation, a Senate inquiry has been established—and for excellent reasons. The Cole royal commission was effectively a hatchet job on trade unions in the building industry. Its terms of reference were set up that way, and that was the outcome. It was anything but an even-handed or an unbiased royal commission. In my view, it helped tarnish the reputation of royal commissions in this country—so heavily biased was its conception, its political motivation, its operation and its report. 
I will not go to enormous lengths in explaining the deficiencies of the commission's voluminous report, other than to point out that very important issues in the building and construction industry in this country were either glossed over or ignored, and hence the need for a proper Senate inquiry. That is why the Senate established a reference inquiry into the building and construction industry—to look at the matters that were effectively ignored or glossed over by the Cole royal commission. I refer in particular to the non-payment of workers' entitlements, the non-payment of superannuation entitlements, and the use of phoenix companies to avoid these obligations and to evade tax. 
In addition, given that this industry is one of the most dangerous in Australia where one worker dies on average each and every week in this country, the Senate reference committee will look at the adequacy of health and safety in this industry—and so it should. Young Joel Exner fell off a building under construction a few weeks ago in Sydney and died. He was just a young boy, a 16yearold, who was working on a very unsafe building site. There was no harness, no guardrail and no scaffolding, and a young boy—16 years of age, and with his life in front of him—fell off that building and died. 
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations says that a couple of unfortunate incidents involving assaults makes the case for tough new anti-union laws in the building and construction industry. It does no such thing. There is already a crime called assault; it is a criminal offence and it does not require this minister to bring into parliament a building and construction industry bill to deal with the crime of assault. But when a young boy like Joel Exner tragically falls off a building under construction and dies, you do not hear the minister for workplace relations saying that maybe we should toughen up our laws on occupational health and safety in relation to, for example, employers in the construction industry who allow building activity to go ahead on very unsafe work sites. I do not hear the minister for industrial relations saying that perhaps we need tough new laws there; but, when there are a couple of incidents possibly involving union officials, it is there that we need tough new laws. 
I think the minister's behaviour in relation to this has been disgraceful and despicable. He ought to have a look at the circumstances of the death of Joel Exner and consider whether there is any case—and I think he should consider this very seriously—for looking at the adequacy of the occupational health and safety laws in this country. I do not think he will doing that, because this government always approaches these issues from one side—always from the side of the employer and always, conversely, against the interests of the working men and women of Australia, and certainly against the interests of those working men and women who choose to be represented by a trade union in this country. 
So this Senate references committee will proceed; it has already started its work and has a well-established program. There is, therefore, no clear merit in having a debate on these bills before the conclusion of that Senate inquiry. But here we are, in the last week of the parliament before it rises for the Christmas break, and the minister brings in this legislation for debate. I do not see the sense in having this debate because the Senate inquiry will, you would think, come up with a set of recommendations. If the minister were fair dinkum he would examine those recommendations and incorporate the good ones into legislation; therefore any final legislation would be very different from the bills that are in the parliament now and being debated. But he is a very determined minister. He is obviously going to proceed along a particular course irrespective of the hard work and the deliberations of that Senate inquiry.
Labor has always made the case that if there are areas in this industry that warrant reform, the best way of going about it is through cooperation, not conflict; but this government is brimful of conflict and rejects the course of cooperation. The National Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet, wrote many months ago to the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and offered a conciliatory approach—a process of examining reform proposals that involved cooperation among all of the key players in this very important industry. But, predictably and sadly, the former minister rejected that approach, as has the current minister. The minister's rejection is evident in the fact that he is pressing ahead with this legislation. This legislation will be debated here in the House of Representatives, but when it gets to the Senate I would imagine that the Senate will consider not examining it in any detail while the Senate inquiry takes its course.
I think it has been poor tactics on the part of this government to bring into this parliament a poorly conceived, misguided piece of legislation. It is legislation that is designed to not advance the building and construction industry in this country; it is designed to fail. Then, when it does fail, the minister feels that he will be able to go to the industry and say, `See? I tried.' That is not good enough. That is not from a true legislator but just a political operator who does not want any improvement in this industry. If he did, he would be talking to us about a cooperative approach. It is for all those good reasons that I move:
That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
`the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and condemns the Government for:
(1)	persistently seeking to erode the bargaining capacity of working Australians;
(2)	its one-sided, confrontational approach to reform in this industry; and
(3)	failing to address the non-payment of employee entitlements and tax evasion in the building and construction industry'.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—These bills, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003, are the most significant reform ever attempted in the building and construction industry. This legislation is the government's response to the report by the Cole royal commission, which was tabled in March this year. The member for Rankin favours a Senate committee to examine this bill, but that makes no sense. These bills came out of a royal commission—an inquiry which had more wide-ranging powers of inquiry than any Senate committee could have. The inquiry has been done. The time for examining this and for further inquiry is over. This requires action, and that is what the government is doing by bringing on these bills at this time.
The royal commission was the first national review ever undertaken on conduct and practices in the building and construction industry in Australia, and its report is quite staggering. As you read through the volumes of this report, it is easy to feel like you are reading about another country where the rule of law, freedom of choice and freedom of association are not taken for granted and are not part of the culture. The report says that at the heart of its findings is a culture of lawlessness which is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the general law, breaches of the criminal law, breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1966 and a lack of respect for occupational health and safety. It says that, when courts or tribunals make orders, some union participants, particularly those in the CFMEU, regard those orders as binding only if it means a benefit for them or for their union. Otherwise, they simply ignore it with impunity, because one of the problems in the industry is the weakness of current enforcement mechanisms.
There is an attitude that adherence to industrial law is optional because there is no body with the function, capacity or resources to enforce it. Head contractors and subcontractors cave in to union demands because of the severe cost penalties for any delayed completion resulting from union action if they do not comply with those demands. Every one of us on this side of the House has had builders and people in the construction industry who have given us specific examples over the years of that sort of behaviour.
According to the report:
The findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy ... They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform.
That is an appalling verdict and one this government intends to rectify. It intends to provide that structural and cultural reform, and does so in these bills. It is not about penalising or picking on the industry, the unions, employees or anyone else; it is about trying to get it right for the good of all parties, as well as for the economic welfare of our country.
Let me tell you why. The building and construction industry is critical to both the welfare and prosperity of Australia and Australians. In the year 2001-02, total production in the industry was $59.7 billion. It accounted for 5.5 per cent of Australia's GDP and 7.5 per cent of employment. But indirectly it accounted—and accounts—for much more. Obviously, it is an industry that is significant to our economy. But its impact is much greater than those figures suggest because every business and every person uses the built environment and that has a flow-on effect.
However, over the past five years productivity growth has been less than average for the market sector. Economic modelling shows that if productivity growth in the industry were to at least meet that of the market sector then it would mean an accumulated gain in real gross domestic product over the next seven years of approximately $12 billion. As the minister is reported as saying in the Australian Financial Review, the Cole royal commission made a compelling case for change which would boost the Australian economy. The current problems mean higher prices, fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for everyone. Obviously, increased productivity would mean a gain not just for the industry but for allied industries, for the workers and for the economy. 
To unlock these possible productivity benefits, and to ensure that commercial and industrial safety standards are met within the industry, the royal commission said that there were four areas of structural and four of cultural reform necessary. This legislation meets all of those requirements. I will outline the structural changes it found essential.
Firstly, we need to ensure bargaining at the enterprise level, and prohibit pattern bargaining in the industry. Chapter 5 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 does that. Secondly, mechanisms are required to ensure that participants of unlawful industrial action are responsible for any loss caused by their action. Chapters 6 and 10 of the mentioned bill do that. Thirdly, mechanisms must be in place to ensure that disputes are resolved in accordance with legislation or agreement. The rule of law must replace industrial might. That is inherent in each chapter of these bills.
Fourthly, there needs to be an independent body to ensure that participants comply with both general law and industry specific law. Chapter 2 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 does that by establishing the office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. These structural changes all relate to mechanisms of the law, and are therefore easier to institute than cultural changes—changes to attitude—that the report deemed necessary.
The first cultural change goes to the heart of the problem:
There needs to be recognition by all participants that the rule of law applies within the industry.
The structural changes contained in these bills, including establishing the independent offices of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the federal safety commissioner, as well as the introduction of a code of practice—the building code—will assist this cultural change. Secondly, all parties need to recognise that in Australia there exists freedom of choice to join or not to join an employee association or union. Chapter 7 of the bill covers freedom of association.
Thirdly, there needs to be an attitudinal change of participants regarding management of projects, because to avoid financial penalties—to get the job done—contractors often surrender management control to the unions. These bills cover awards, industrial action, discrimination, coercion, accountability and enforcement, all of which work towards ensuring that both sides do the right thing so that no side is forced into doing the wrong thing by coercion or standover tactics.
The fourth and last essential cultural change is in the attitude to safety not just by contractors and workers in the industry but by governments and clients as well. All employees have the right to expect a safe working environment. This bill addresses that need by establishing the office of Federal Safety Commissioner with responsibilities for promoting occupational health and safety, disseminating information about the building code and ensuring compliance with it. 
You can see from this that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 encompasses the main structural and cultural changes recommended by the royal commission. Its main objective is not to penalise one side or the other but to provide an improved workplace relations framework for work in the industry to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.
I believe it is worth reading the aims of the legislation. I will not go through them—they are in the explanatory memorandum. How can the opposition, or anyone, argue against those aims? How can they argue against promoting respect for the rule of law and respect for the rights of all parties or against improving occupational health and safety? Only those who have no respect for those values in the first place could argue about enhancing them. On the other hand, this government is committed to ensuring the rule of law applies in the building industry as it does in other workplaces.
As you heard from the member for Rankin, the same cannot be said of the Labor government. For example, the Western Australian Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection denounced this legislation as being impractical and unfair to unions. The assistant secretary of the CFMEU welcomed that response, reportedly saying that unions should not be expected to change how they operate. That comment is astounding if you have read the royal commission report on Western Australia. I will give some examples from the report. It says:
Doing business in the industry in Western Australia means doing business in accordance with the prescriptions and to the satisfaction of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU). 
It indicates that the industry:
... is marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct. Fear, intimidation and coercion are commonplace ...
The CFMEU exercises a position of dominance and power often disproportionate to its on-site presence ...
Threatening and intimidatory conduct by the CFMEU is a hallmark of the industry.
The editorial in the West Australian on 25 October was more realistic. It said:
... WA was found by the Cole royal commission to be the national home of unlawful ructions, intimidation and questionable dealings—
and that the Labor minister's response showed `he is still a prisoner of the militant unions'. The fact that the problems are particularly bad in Western Australia does not mean they are not extensive in other states. In my own state of Queensland, for instance, the report says that there was evidence of a long list of problems, including `a culture of disregard for the law, and the rule of law'. It says that building sector unions often use `actual or threatened industrial action, most of which is unlawful, coercive and intimidatory' to get their way.
In 2001, there were 18,500 working days lost in Queensland as a result of disputes in the construction industry. I know the effect this can have on a business, a family and a community. I speak with builders, contractors, their clients and their workers in my electorate on the Sunshine Coast, where the building and construction industries are key to the local economy. A good example of what this legislation is all about involves a dispute at Nambour Hospital, which is in my electorate. Four unions combined to form a picket line from 23 May until 16 July to prevent employees and contractors of JM Kelly gaining access to the site. Workers were abused, threatened and intimidated. Many feared for their safety, and contractors and workers suffered financially. 
—Progress was held up too.
—The commission found that all four unions had acted unlawfully. Hopefully this legislation will eradicate such violent and unlawful behaviour. As the member for Fisher interjects, the project at the Nambour Hospital, which was badly needed by the community, was held up for months. Unfortunately, the opposition's workplace relations spokesman said that Labor is going to play games and delay this legislation for months by sending it to a prolonged Senate inquiry—because, he said, the government designed the legislation to fail and actually wants it to fail. If Labor really believes that, then all it needs to do is pass the legislation and see what happens—see if it fails for the government and for the economy. After all, what would such failure mean to Labor? It would seem that it does not support the government, the economy or the rule of law in the construction industry.
Not all opposition members are former union leaders, but many are part of the culture that condones and protects those union leaders who believe it is their right to behave in the manner deplored by the royal commission. At the very least, Labor acquiesces to this culture in the interests of retaining union, and therefore Labor, power. The opposition spokesman on workplace relations reportedly expressed concern over the fact that this legislation makes it compulsory to have a secret ballot before taking industrial action. We are lucky that we live in a democracy in this country but, unfortunately, the opposition and union leaders do not believe in democracy for all, especially not for their own union members.
Union leaders believe it is their right to tell their members how to vote and to then stand and watch to make sure individual members toe the line. Such union leaders believe it is their right to deprive their members of genuine freedom of choice, and they are fiercely supported by the Labor Party. It would be a very interesting exercise to conduct a secret ballot of all union members on whether or not they want the right to hold secret ballots before taking industrial action so they would have not only the right but also the freedom to say yes or no without fear of retribution. I think most of us in this House know what the result of such a referendum, vote or secret ballot would be.
It goes without saying that union members are also hardworking, law-abiding community members. Quite rightly, they seek to protect their jobs, their families and their communities. Of course that means negotiations—and maybe tough negotiations—but I do not believe most union members would deliberately seek to damage their employer or the economy in the process. Any reasonably intelligent person knows it does not make sense to deliberately endanger the future contracts of their employer, because such damage also endangers their job and the economic welfare of their family and perhaps the wider community. Unfortunately, that does not stop some union leaders, because to those leaders it is a power game. They gain power from the acquiescence—voluntary or otherwise—of union members and contractors. And, if they become powerful enough, they might even be given a safe Labor seat.
The optimum result for workers, contractors, governments, clients—and Australia—is for everyone to work together. To do that you need rules and accountability. You need respect for the law, you need a culture of cooperation instead of intimidation and you need an independent referee. With this legislation, the government has shown it is committed to working towards such an optimum result. This legislation provides rules and accountabilities with the means to enforce them so they cannot be blatantly ignored. It provides structures and law to help change the current culture in the industry, and it provides independent referees in the offices of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the Federal Safety Commissioner. All previous reform attempts by both coalition and ALP governments have failed. The Howard government has taken heed of those past lessons and endeavoured to provide a structural framework and enforcement agency that will enable lasting, positive reform to the building and construction industry. I commend the legislation to the House. 
Before I conclude, there is another issue I wish to raise. I am very disappointed with the response of ASIC to parts of the royal commission's final report. Chapter 11 of volume 10 of the royal commission report is entitled `Sunshine Coast Regional Group Apprentices Ltd'. The organisation conducts valuable training apprenticeships for people in the building industry and other industries, such as tourism, recreation and hospitality; there is no doubt about that. But the activities of the directors for a long time have been nothing short of disgraceful. These activities were brought to the attention of the royal commission, and the royal commission examined them. There are 31 pages in the report where the royal commission condemns the activities of this group called SCRGAL and the people associated with breaches of the Corporations Law.
The disappointing thing to me was the response of ASIC. The royal commission clearly identified breaches of the Corporations Law. I believe those breaches were serious. Some of the breaches would have brought fines of about $250,000 or over $1 million for a corporation, but ASIC decided not to prosecute and enforce the Corporations Law. I believe that that gives the wrong message to people in the building industry. I hope that the measures in this new bill will never allow that to happen, and I would urge the Treasurer, who is in charge of ASIC, to examine the findings of this royal commission and go ahead and do what the people of the Sunshine Coast expect them to do so that justice is done.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I rise to make some remarks about the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and its cognate bill, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. The member for Fairfax certainly considers that there are some parts of this legislation that would go towards improving productivity in the workplace in the construction industry, and it may well be the case that he is genuine in that view. However, from the time that the government initiated the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, it was clear to many observers inside this place and to independent commentators that the government's intention, in the main, was about going after a strong trade union, a union that represents many thousands of employees who are hard workers and contributors to the Australian economy. The building industry is a very important industry to the economy.
I think it is fair to say that there are clearly echoes of former Minister Reith's efforts in the maritime industry, where we had training of replacement employees in Dubai—secret training outside Australia—and we had goons, balaclavas and attack dogs. Those things were done with the imprimatur of this government. This legislation is just another step in the government's plan to undermine and weaken collective bargaining in this country.
This government likes to boast that it believes in a market economy, it believes in deregulation and it believes in parties making decisions. But this legislation reminds us that what the government really wants to see is an obsequious work force, a tame work force, a divided and dispirited work force, that is not able to bargain genuinely and does not have the capacity to bargain equally with its employers. It is clear to me why there is no examination of other industries. I am sure there is some corruption in the building industry; there is corruption in every industry. There are people who act unlawfully in all industries. There would be members of the CFMEU who have acted criminally—there are over 100,000 members of the CFMEU. There are doctors who have acted criminally, there are teachers who have acted criminally and I am sure there are lawyers who have acted criminally. But we do not blame the AMA because doctors have acted criminally. 
So what we see here is a government that is quite happy to see a deregulated industry where there is very little bargaining power for those employees. If they are not unionised, they have very little collective capacity to bargain equally with their employer, and the government is happy. You do not see any intervention by this government when employees are having difficulty bargaining equally with their employers. The only occasion in which you see this government intervene in an industry is where the employees are bargaining effectively and collectively. That is what we see here: a pattern where the government argues that it wants to encourage a market economy but where the government itself becomes the greatest intervener in the market where employees are bargaining genuinely, collectively and effectively. That is clearly the intention of this government—and that, I think, exposes the plan of this Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who has of course inherited these tactics from his two predecessors, and the intention behind this bill.
If, for example, this bill had genuinely looked at occupational health and safety matters in the building industry, I might have at least a tempered view on it. If the royal commission that was established had genuinely considered the deaths and injuries that have occurred in this industry, I might have a different view of this bill. If the royal commission had been charged with the responsibility of seeing how they could stop underpayment of employees in the industry by unscrupulous employers, then I would think it was a balanced effort by the government to consider problems.
But the government was not able to do that, because it had one agenda and one agenda only: to go after a strong trade union and go after working people—who are, as I said, a very important, productive part of our economy—because they choose to bargain collectively. That is really what is happening here, and I think it is a disgrace. I think it is the wrong thing for any government to do, particularly one that keeps saying that there should not be too much intervention. When you argue that you want almost a laissez-faire approach to the economy, it is very hard to then explain what you are doing intervening so heavily and so proscriptively in an industry, which is what occurs in the building industry.
I have some grave concerns about the intentions of this government on this matter because they cannot be trusted. The government cannot be trusted, because they are ideologically in pursuit of unions. I use the word `ideology'—a word that is perhaps not used very often anymore—but this government's ideology can be defined by what they hate or what they would like to deny people rather than something that I could define as being positive.
Clearly, this government wants to see people denied bulk-billing. It set about to diminish the capacity of the Medicare system to provide proper health care. Clearly, this government is quite happy to see children behind barbed wire. We have made a plea to the Prime Minister—an effort was made by the Leader of the Opposition today; he beseeched the Prime Minister—to allow those children out before Christmas. But this is a cruel and harsh government which has no regard for children behind barbed wire. 
The government has no concern for people who are having to pay back enormous amounts of money because of the faulty tax benefit system—a system where people have accrued enormous debts and are now in a position where they have to pay back moneys. The way in which this government set this up is another indicator that this is a government that does not care about ordinary working people or about recipients of social welfare in this country. Ordinary working Australians are the natural enemy of the Liberal Party, of this government.
With all the effort that has been put in and the millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars that have been spent on the Cole royal commission, the government still could not make effective recommendations to sort out the deaths, fatalities and injuries that have arisen in what is a pretty tough industry, a hard industry. To work as a builder on a construction site is a tough and potentially dangerous job. To put up a scaffold or to work harnessed is very dangerous, and the government have no regard for that.
—Where did you ever work? Did you ever work?
—I understand that the minister wants to have a go at me.
—Were you a union official?
—I am happy to respond to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism—though the only thing small about him is the fact that he represents small business. I have worked in many jobs, but I am not here to speak about myself. I know that Joe likes to talk about himself all the time.
—What jobs?
—I have done a lot of jobs in factories and all sorts of places.
—Actually working in the factory or a union official?
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—Minister, you are out of your chair.
—I am very happy for the minister to provide me with an opportunity to explain that I have worked on assembly lines in factories, at petrol stations and as a cleaner in hospitals. I am happy to say that I have rubbed shoulders with decent, ordinary working Australians of this country. I have done that for many years, and I am very happy to say that. Unless Joe had goggles and a white overall on and he was touring a factory for a photo shoot, he would not be in a factory. He would never have been in a factory unless he had been there for a photo shoot—and that is obvious. That is where the divide is between the two major parties in this country. We know what ordinary working people aspire to and we know those people because we work amongst them—we always have—unlike the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who has never rubbed shoulders with ordinary working people.
It is a shame that he thinks that this is such an unimportant matter that he wants to make fun while I am talking about fatalities in the building industry. The government has not responded to the concerns of many who have said that, if this commission had at least attempted to look at some of those other matters, there would have been a belief that, whilst not agreeing with the government on all points, they were being fair dinkum in at least some areas. Unfortunately, the terms of reference of the royal commission were too narrow to take in the genuine concern of those who represent the employees in the industry that more had to be done about health and safety. 
One of the concerns I have with this bill is that it tries to prevent people stopping work in the event that there may be an OH&S dimension to the matter. In other words, there are attempts in this bill to diminish the capacity for people to stop work if they think the workplace is unsafe. As the shadow minister, the member for Rankin, has said, this legislation is designed to restrict the capacity of unions in this industry to represent their members and take lawful industrial action. It appears to me that the only reason we have this bill focused purely on this industry—and not upon other places where there is very little collective bargaining—is that this industry is collectively organised. The government therefore reveal their enmity towards ordinary working people who choose to collectively bargain.
I will make reference to some other matters in the bill. As the member for Fairfax said, the commission was established in August 2001 and it reported to us in, I think, February this year. There are some real concerns about some of the provisions. Firstly, there is a concern that the definition of `building work' is very broad and includes parts of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, even though players in the manufacturing industry were not called in to be examined evidentially, if you like, this bill may apply to the employers and employees who were not even involved in the commission.
There are also concerns raised by many on this side of the House about the attempts to establish the ABCC—the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner—and the Federal Safety Commissioner. However, the establishment of the Federal Safety Commissioner's position, in my view, is the government's weak attempt to show that it is addressing occupational health and safety issues. In other words, that position is the only thing that has been achieved out of this commission with respect to occupational health and safety. It is window-dressing in an area of such importance. Clearly the government has paid scant regard to that very important area.
It is also important to note that the provisions being considered are restrictive and establish so many procedural and technical hurdles that it would almost be impossible to take legal protected industrial action in the building industry. I do not want to live in a country where people do not have the lawful right to withdraw their labour. The only countries I can think of where, historically, citizens have had no right to withdraw their labour are those that in many cases have been under fascist regimes and Communist totalitarian regimes. I do not want to live in a country that would deny, in effect, the right of ordinary working Australians to withdraw their labour if they are looking to bargain for their conditions, wages and entitlements. Indeed, there is no reference to the employers' capacity to lock out workers—there is no attempt to diminish that capacity. The focus has been on looking at the way in which they can prevent employees taking industrial action.
Really what is happening here is that the government are making a special case for these employees. I have said already that I think this effort really exposes the government's agenda—that is, they will punish work forces that collectively bargain and they will leave with no protection at all those workers who are non-unionised or who are not bargaining collectively. They are very happy with that. But if there is a growing effort in an industry to come together and negotiate at the table on behalf of a large workplace or the work force as a whole, then this government will be after them. That is what this bill highlights: this government will be targeting those employees who democratically choose their right to bargaining collectively. 
Another concern I have had with respect to this bill is that there is an effort to limit the right of entry to workplaces. The right of entry of a union official is critical to a democratic workplace. The right to enter workplaces on notice has been allowed for over a century. With that right comes responsibility. I accept that there needs to be responsibility with that right and therefore of course there needs to be notice provided to the employer. A union official is an agent for a principal: in agency law a union official is acting on behalf of another in the same way that a lawyer or, indeed, any advocate is. To deny a group of people the right to have representation, whether it is about a matter that relates to dismissal or their rights in general, is to deny natural justice—the basic human right to allow people to be represented. There are enough lawyers in this place, and I know the Minister for Small Business and Tourism would agree that you should not deny people the right to be represented. I think there are efforts made to diminish the capacity for people to be properly represented in the workplace, and that to me is a worrying sign as well.
We know the reason behind the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, setting up this commission. It was about going after a union that effectively represents the work force. I do not know how many stages there were but this was the second stage—the first stage being the attack dogs and the balaclavas and the goons at the waterfront. I think the Australian public know that the efforts of this government are driven by an ideological hatred of registered organisations that represent employees. The government is on the wrong track if it thinks ordinary Australians believe the way to go about things in this country is to attack democratically organised unions. Those governments that have done that most brutally in our history, of course, are dictatorships. Countries without unions that have the capacity to bargain are dictatorships. That is the way we are moving and I ask the government to reconsider its position.

"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I have been listening to the member for Burke going on about how this is an attack by a government that is ideologically biased against unions and how the democracy of our nation is at stake because of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003, and it is just laughable. I want to say to the member for Burke that he and his colleagues should go back and re-read what this bill is all about. It has been totally misrepresented and, if anything, the ideological opposition to this is because of the single-minded hatred by members on the other side of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. That is what it is all about. This is just an attack against the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What the Australian public know and know all too well—and they did not need the Cole royal commission to tell them—is that the building industry is corrupt and it has been corrupt for many years.
I will address a little later on some of the comments by the member for Burke, in particular, regarding occupational health and safety and the undermining of its safeguards that he alluded to. But before that, I want to say that this bill really has come about as a result of the much publicised Cole royal commission and the recommendations made by the commissioner to clean up the industry. I welcome this opportunity as action against lawlessness and inappropriate conduct in the building industry is long overdue. The findings of the Cole commission are a real wake-up call: to the government, the opposition, building employers and the employees of Australia associated with that industry. The Cole commission found that, over time, a culture of lawlessness has developed in the building industry. This has led to a widespread disregard for criminal, civil and industrial law. 
As I said, there would not be a single Australian who, if asked, would disagree with the proposition that the building industry has, for too long, been corrupted—principally by lawless union officials but also, in some cases, by shonky building industries all too willing to cut a deal with a union. And while the Cole royal commission was eagerly awaited and clearly overdue, the task now is for the government to respond to the findings in an astute and responsible way.
The newly elected Leader of the Opposition talks about doing things that are right for this country—advancing this nation in a bipartisan way. This is a great opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition, who has stated through various speeches and writings over time that the union movement has got too big and is not really representing the interests of a lot of ordinary people out there in the work force. It is the government's and the parliament's response that can put statutory substance to the commission's recommendations, and it is the responsibility of the government and the opposition to make sure that lawlessness does not go unanswered in this country. Wherever it may be—whether with the employers or with the union movement itself—it needs to be addressed in an urgent way.
I urge all members of this House to take all matters into consideration when considering this bill, not to be ideologically biased but to really read through the commission's findings, to read through some of the evidence that was given and to read through the recommendations that were made rather than simply hold onto some sort of pathological hatred towards the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. It can help send a strong signal to anyone in the building industry who threatens to flout the law, and it sends a message that thuggery and intimidation cannot and will not be tolerated.
The building industry, as in other workplaces, is governed by laws designed to regulate disputes. Perhaps even more important than this, these laws are designed to protect the health and safety of all industry members. Unfortunately, the building industry has provided numerous cases of these laws being blatantly and dangerously flouted. This bill was designed to place resolution measures into law, which is a deficiency within the current Workplace Relations Act. When the former workplace relations minister, Tony Abbott, introduced the bill on 18 September this year, he highlighted such problems. In particular, Minister Abbott specifically mentioned that the onus for compliance lay with the parties involved. Businesses were obliged to enforce the law against unions while unions were to enforce the law against businesses. The problem with this scenario is that it enables workers all too often to be caught in the crossfire.
I want to voice concern that the building industry will remain flawed as long as the union movement is determined to preserve an undue dominance. The Cole royal commission's findings reveal that this dominance is extreme, unhealthy and tantamount to a quasi monopoly. To breathe life into the ranks, the building industry needs to embrace individualism and to stamp out the blatant disregard for freedom of association laws.
I am not alone when I express my concerns about widespread malpractice within the building industry. The Cole royal commission identified that, in many cases, building sites were tantamount to a law unto themselves. The commission's findings were a real wake-up call for the building and construction industry. These included extensive illegal and improper payments, a blatant and chronic disregard of legally binding agreements and regular flouting of orders issued by courts and the Industrial Relations Commission. But sadly, the commission's findings highlighted more sinister problems at grassroots level namely—a culture of coercion and intimidation. And not only does such a culture affect the efficiency and productivity of the industry; it is also detrimental to the health and safety of its workers, which all of us in this place must find simply unacceptable. 
The Cole royal commission was an extensive and necessary inquiry. All up, the commission conducted 171 days of public hearings in which over 700 witnesses gave evidence. I find it pleasing that the commission also received over 20 official submissions from interested parties throughout the building and construction industry. It plainly demonstrates the gravity of concern that malpractice such as union thuggery generates.
During the life of the commission 1,489 summonses to attend public or private hearings and 1,677 notices to produce relevant documents were issued. This is no small breach taking place in the building industry. The sheer numbers involved in the summonses and in the hearings indicate how widespread the malpractices and the lawlessness have been within the building industry. I believe that the depth of this inquiry shows how critical the building and construction industry is to the Australian economy in general.
Let us have a look at some of the figures. In the 2001-02 period, the total production of the commercial construction industry was $40 billion. This represents 5.5 per cent of Australia's GDP and 7.5 per cent of the nation's employment. Not only does a culture of lawlessness have a significant negative effect on the Australian economy; it also permeates the lives of workers and their families. The industry makes a huge and multifaceted contribution to Australia. A 5.5 per cent contribution to GDP is no small industry, and to allow an industry of such magnitude to continue to operate in a lawless way is really a dereliction of our duty as law-makers in this nation.
The establishment of the Cole royal commission resulted from, amongst other factors, calls for an inquiry from significant participants in the construction industry. Above all, problems in the construction industry led to higher prices, fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for all. I believe that these problems are serious and it would be foolish for a parliament not to act on them when they can be addressed.
In all, the Cole royal commission made 212 recommendations in its final report. This bill seeks to implement over 120 of these recommendations, giving the federal government and the parliament a tangible opportunity to tackle the corruption in the building and construction industry head-on. The commission was a thorough and damning appraisal of the industry. This bill provides a chance to act on these findings and implement the real and lasting reform of the building industry that I believe is so desperately needed by the community.
Members across the floor may well have conflicting views on what the commission's in-depth investigation into the building industry set out to achieve. Indeed sections of the union movement, to which the Australian Labor Party is spiritually and financially beholden, have claimed that the Cole royal commission was an anti-union witch-hunt or, more blatantly, a war on workers. I cannot see how attempting to get to the bottom of an industry where backhand deals and blatant thuggery are rife is a witch-hunt. Change is the essence of what this bill is about, and the opposition has a real opportunity in its new found role with its new leader to make that step and improve the industry—for the sake of not only the industry but the very workers it purports to represent. 
The blatant failure of current workplace relations measures on building sites is apparent. The report from the Cole royal commission highlighted several key instances where union officials have used thuggish, strongarm tactics to express their concerns. This is of particular interest to me as a demolition firm, Able Demolitions and Excavations Pty Ltd, based in my electorate of Deakin, was one of those organisations that had been targeted by the union and is also one of those industries that gave evidence to the Cole royal commission.
In late 1999 to early 2000, Able—not an insignificant demolition company, by the way; it is a prominent demolition and excavation company with specific experience and expertise which very few others have—tendered for a demolition contract in the reconstruction of the National Gallery of Victoria. After winning the contract, Able took control of the NGV site in July 2000, with its workers covered by a mutually agreed 1998 enterprise bargaining agreement with the Australian Workers Union. The conditions of this agreement, although mutually recognised, angered the rival CFMEU. In an effort to express their anger, the CFMEU confronted Able and the AWU, a fellow union organisation, at the NGV site on 10 August 2000.
Rather than using conventional channels for industrial action, the CFMEU used strongarm, thuggish tactics by violently entering the site. Once inside the site, CFMEU members proceeded to damage property, threaten Able staff and campaign aggressively against—of all organisations—a fellow union, the AWU. It perplexes me that such behaviour is tolerated, let alone promoted, by senior union officials. By not allowing this bill to go through, the opposition is condoning that very behaviour.
During the CFMEU's protest at the NGV site, union leader Martin Kingham blatantly flouted health and safety laws. These laws were in place to protect the welfare of workers, the interests of whom he claims to represent—the same health and safety laws which the member for Burke said were important and needed to be protected. Once the forced negotiations between site management and the CFMEU fell through later in the day, Kingham's response was to continue occupying the site and, in turn, force a strike upon the Able workers. To implement this so-called strike, the CFMEU left 20 of its henchmen to prevent Able staff from returning to work. The move was backed up with a threat from Kingham. He argued that any move by Able to return to the site would result in 600 CFMEU members flooding back to beef up the picket line.
I believe that the actions undertaken by the CFMEU highlight a blatant disregard for the law. Able workers were covered by a mutually agreed EBA with the AWU. The company competed in an open tender for the NGV demolition contract and they won it. The thuggish actions of the CFMEU merely represent the desperate tactics that sections of the union movement within the building industry will resort to. Such tactics attempt to maintain a level of power that is detrimental to competition, detrimental to the industry and detrimental to workers.
Sadly, Able have continued to be targeted. I understand that, since they gave evidence to the commission, they have struggled and there have been a lot of impediments in their way to winning some of the state government contracts. There is no doubt that there has been some level of intimidation—a phone call made by the CFMEU to state government ministers basically saying that Able are on a black list. Yet they are the dominant demolition company in the industry. Their participation in the Cole royal commission has been to their financial detriment. 
Thankfully, through an administrative arrangement and on the recommendation of Commissioner Cole, a building industry task force has been set up. This building industry task force is effectively, using the former minister's terminology, `a cop on the building industry beat'. Its task is to ensure that the rule of law and order is adhered to on building sites. The task force has direct power to inspect sites under the powers of the Workplace Relations Act, but its other powers are limited, which is one of the reasons why this bill is needed, why a commissioner for the industry is necessary and why a commissioner for safety is also being recommended through this bill.
In response to the member for Burke with regard to safety and the establishment of a commissioner, let me remind the member for Burke that the new rules will not prevent an employee from stopping work based on a genuine concern that there is an imminent risk to health and safety. The rules promote the use—the genuine use, not the fraudulent use—of OH&S issues as agreed through the workplace procedures. But what we found through the royal commission was that it is very common for unions in the building and construction industry to manipulate occupational health and safety issues in order to advance their industrial agenda—not the safety agenda, but their industrial agenda. Contrary to what the member for Burke was saying, this tactic trivialises occupational health and safety and undermines genuine efforts to improve OH&S in the industry. The bill aims to limit the scope for spurious occupational health and safety concerns to be used to justify industrial action about other issues, while maintaining the right of employees to stop work without penalty where there is a genuine and imminent risk to a person's health and safety. They are the safeguards. It is not just about cleaning up the lawlessness in the industry; it is also about ensuring that a highly dangerous industry such as the building and construction industry has safeguards and that it has a commissioner to look after the interests of the employees when it comes to safety and occupational health.
Thuggery and lawlessness are not new in the union movement. From a general perspective, reforms should begin at the grassroots level. To their credit, a few influential union officials have attempted to crack down on violence and intimidation. As many in the House will be aware, one such official was Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. However, as we found out in recent times, because of the pressure he brought to bear to weed out violence, Mr Cameron himself became the victim of a vicious bashing outside his home. Workplace relations minister Kevin Andrews touched on this issue on 2 December. Minister Andrews informed the House that the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Greg Combet, had clearly stated that he has been trying to clean up this sort of intimidation and thuggery. I believe that the bashing of key union officials, such as Mr Cameron, shows that these apparent moves are not working. Another bashing and hospitalisation of a Victorian plumbing union official last week at, of all places, a strategy meeting demonstrates that the culture of the building industry needs true reform. This bill offers true reform that puts paid to the hard work undertaken by the Cole royal commission. Lawlessness and thuggery in the industry, even within the union movement itself, must come to an end. 
I find it perplexing that members on the other side of the House argue that the efforts to weed out such lawlessness are purely ideological. I disagree with this and argue that they are logical. As former Minister Abbott stated on 18 September:
Econtech also estimates that if labour productivity in commercial construction matched labour productivity in housing, the CPI would be one per cent lower ...
This is a very significant improvement. On the one hand, the issue of ideology is all the more evident when applied to the Australian Labor Party. On the other hand, they have taken a high moral ground and attempted to distance themselves from corruption, extortion and criminal behaviour in the building industry. However, Labor's rusted-on links with the trade union movement see them oppose this bill. Why wouldn't they oppose this bill when, between 1996 and 2000, the Labor Party received over $3,866,669 in fees and donations from the CFMEU? This bill is a bill about cleaning up the industry. This bill needs to be supported by all members of this parliament.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak in opposition to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and to also remind members on the other side of the House that, since the election of the Howard government, there has been a calculated strategy to try and destroy the effectiveness of organised labour. Very early in the piece, the government actually nominated the industries that they thought would take the focus. They named the waterfront industry, the meat-processing industry, the coal industry and the construction industry. We saw with the waterfront industry a strategy different to this one but a strategy that failed in the end to do what the intention was—and that was to get rid of the MUA as the organised union on the waterfront. The strategy then was different. It was the sacking of a whole work force and the training of people in Dubai to come back and work as scab labour. The union movement responded magnificently and collectively in defence of the rights of those workers to continue to be represented by the union of their choice.
We have seen prolonged disputation in the coal sector. Cases have been before the commission for years and years. We have seen industrial provocation in the meat processing sector and now in the fourth industry that was on the hit list—the building and construction industry. The government missed with their strategy on the waterfront, because it repelled the ordinary Australian to see images of men with balaclavas and dogs on chains and of workers being transported offshore to be trained in union busting. So, at the end of the day, as I say, the MUA continues to remain the union of choice of workers in that industry, and it continues to remain a highly unionised sector.
In construction we have seen a quite different strategy but with the same outcome. Clearly there was an attempt to erode the bargaining strength of a very well organised union, the CFMEU. On this occasion we saw an absolute waste of $60 million of taxpayers' funds to set up a royal commission, which was nothing more than a witchhunt into the industry. To any fair-minded person, the commission was flawed because of its narrow focus, which concentrated almost exclusively on the union delegate structure and the membership of unions. To those who want to argue that it was fair and impartial let me just say that, of its hearing time, the commission devoted 90 per cent to allegations that were adverse to unions and only three per cent to allegations against employers. 
I am told by the unions that the commission was provided with the names of about 200 companies suspected of illegal or inappropriate behaviour but only one company was thoroughly investigated. And yet we know that in that industry there continues to be a pattern of employer breaches on issues such as tax avoidance, collusive tendering, use of strategic liquidations, failure to comply with OH&S standards and small companies going out of existence and leaving their employees without their legitimate entitlements. We also know that it is an industry rife with the use of illegal immigrants—who, obviously, are employed to drive down wages and conditions in that industry. So again I say to members who want to argue it was an impartial assessment of the industry: the record speaks for itself. Incredibly, there was not one finding of unlawful conduct relating to underpayment of workers' entitlements, debts owing to small business or issues of tax avoidance, sham subcontracting or phoenix companies. Given all this, it is not surprising that 87 per cent of findings of unlawful conduct were made against workers and unionists.
We hear incredibly sweeping generalisations made by the government about this industry. I will just quote one coming from the previous minister. He talked about an `entrenched culture of lawlessness coupled with widespread inappropriate practices that act against choice, productivity and safety'. I know that industry well; I know the people who work and operate in it—and I reject those wide-ranging generalisations. In fact, if we look at the incidents of so-called `illegal action' in the commission, we see that many of them were unprotected action of short duration which involved a stoppage of no more than a few hours and frequently involved issues to do with site working conditions and occupational health and safety matters. That is the appropriate responsibility of unions—to ensure that site working conditions and safety standards are maintained.
I want to raise very quickly the issue of occupational health and safety in that industry. In jobs in the building and construction industry, approximately one worker dies every week. Recently we had the tragic death of a young man—I think it was on his third day at work—who, working without a safety harness, fell through scaffolding to his death. Not long before that, a couple of years ago, a similarly employed young man, an apprentice at the time, also met a tragic death resulting from unsafe practices at work. I find it amazing that some years down the track, even though clearly the employer was found negligent, the amount of money awarded in that case was a mere $20,000 for the loss of life. Just in the last couple of weeks, his family has reported that the company has gone belly up and the family has received only $1,800 of that very small settlement that was awarded for loss of life.
Let us not underestimate the difficulties in this industry. It is a difficult industry; it is an industry that, on international standards, is doing well in terms of productivity measures. I do not think we want to be confused into thinking that the kind of rhetoric we hear from this government applies to the overwhelming majority of people on both employer and employee sides who work in that sector. Of course, to deal with any alleged illegal or standover activity, any allegations of criminal behaviour, we have a police force. Noone on this side of the chamber would ever argue that, if someone acts in a manner that is inappropriate—for example, exhibiting any kind of standover behaviour—they should not be dealt with by the authorities with the powers to deal with that kind of behaviour. 
So let us not confuse the issues and use these sweeping generalisations. We know what the agenda is. It is an agenda that has been relentless. It has been pursued since this government was elected. It has been pursued on the waterfront, it has been pursued in meat processing and it has been pursued in the coal industry. Now, finally, after a political witch-hunt, it appears that the government wants to wreak revenge on the CFMEU and its members. Looking at the details of the bill and the detailed proposals, we are really getting a rerun of all the provisions of the so-called second wave of industrial changes which, thankfully for all concerned, have been rejected consistently in the Senate. We have here a revisiting of all those provisions—but now to apply specifically to one industry alone.
We are told that there will be a new commission: the Australian building and construction commission. Really it is a new police force on sites—the new cop on the beat. We are told that this office will be a statutory body but it will receive written instructions from the minister—so how can it be truly independent? All it will end up being is another partisan political institution, like the Office of the Employment Advocate. So it is totally unnecessary and undesirable, and it achieves nothing.
This sets up a climate of fear for people on the job. I am particularly concerned about the proposed power of the commissioner to require people to attend a hearing and answer questions in relation to any investigation he is undertaking. For example, this would allow people to be called in to answer questions under oath about why they did or did not take certain forms of action or why they did or did not vote in a particular way. I think that is quite a frightening prospect: to be dragging people from the shop floor in front of a commissioner of what will, in the end, be a truly political outfit. I am concerned also that the power of the commission enables it to engage a loss assessor to determine the cost of industrial action to an employer. It makes the possibility of adverse damages findings very real, which is a very real deterrent to the taking of legitimate industrial action. Essentially, it amounts to intimidation designed to create fear amongst those who work on building sites and fear for those whose responsibility is to protect their best interests. So we do not need a new police force on the beat on construction sites.
Similarly, the bill re-runs the proposition of outlawing pattern bargaining in that industry, even though both unions and employers see the benefits of pattern bargaining in that industry. It suits their needs. Here we have a government which talks on the one hand about employers and employees reaching agreement but which, in a very interventionist way, is telling this industry alone what agreements are and are not acceptable.
I want to talk about award stripping. This is a common refrain. I can remember very clearly the Prime Minister in his election speeches assuring Australian workers that nobody would be worse off. You only have to look at their real experiences to know how much worse off people have been under this government. The award-stripping exercise was one of the very early proposals introduced by this government. Now here we have it again for the building industry. You can understand why workers and unions get very upset—because a lot of these conditions have been written into their awards as a result of longstanding campaigns that go back many years.
I want to read from the list of issues that are potentially at stake in the building and construction awards. Workers may lose such things as: accident make-up pay, the times of day that count as ordinary time or overtime, and the times at which rostered days off can be taken. Workers will lose the clauses requiring an employer to record start and finish times and hours of work. As I say, accident make-up pay will be left out of the minimum conditions of their award, as will another important provision—that is, the ratio of apprentices to tradespeople. Clauses relating to training and education will go. The right of their award to specify a particular super fund will also be abolished, as will any restrictions on part-time and casual work. We all know that job insecurity and the growth in precarious employment is a really big issue, and here we see it again. The government wants to delete any restrictions on part-time or casual work in their award. So you can see that we have another re-run of the award-stripping exercise and the possibility that unions and their members will lose the conditions of entitlement that have been written into their award over a long period of time. 
Another issue is limiting the right of a union to enter work sites. This is clearly in breach of freedom of association provisions. It is just ridiculous to think that, under these provisions, the union would have to give both the employer and the commission 24 hours notice before going onto a site. I believe the provision is that if they have gone on to a site with the purpose of recruiting new members to the union, quite a legal activity, they are not allowed to follow them up for six months after that. That is just absolutely ludicrous. You go onto a site to provide a service and yet you are going to be constrained in terms of any follow-up meetings that may occur as a result of your recruiting activities on the job. The bill, again, pays lip-service to the notion of freedom of association while trying to erode it in a very mechanistic manner.
The issue of secret ballots again raises its head. It is very apparent in the bill that the government wants to severely limit the right of workers in this industry to strike. Again, that is in defiance of international conventions, but that does not seem to worry the government. The International Labour Organisation has repeatedly told this government that Australia's laws about freedom of association and the right to strike do not conform to minimum standards adopted in ILO conventions. Specifically, the ILO has already said that these fall short of the convention, because current practice does not provide that legal protection extend to industrial action taken on a multi-employer or industry-wide basis. Also there is no protection under current law for action taken in sympathy with protected action taken by other workers. Furthermore, the Industrial Relations Commission's power to terminate a bargaining period goes well beyond the scope of essential services, and we have no protection in this country applying in the case where industrial action is taken in support of workers' social and economic interests.
The ILO has already made rulings on the kinds of proposals that have been brought to this House in the bills that we are debating. So it seems that you can completely ignore the fact that we are signatories to these labour standards, and have been for a long time. We are seeing here, once again, an attempt to introduce punitive and restrictive measures on the right to freely organise and the right to strike, despite the ILO's concerns about those measures not meeting minimum standards. 
In conclusion, I support the sentiments that have been expressed by our shadow minister, and I want to reinforce them. We are voting against this bill because we see it as part of a persistent pattern by this government to erode the bargaining capacity of working Australians. This bill and its transitional provisions again confirm that this government has a one-sided, confrontational approach to reform.  
If there are matters to be resolved, let us look at them. My understanding is that the Secretary of the ACTU has already made the constructive proposal that the parties ought to sit down and deal with any issues that need to be dealt with. That is a very practical suggestion but, again, one that has been rejected—because this is not about real solutions to real problems; this is, yet again, a one-sided, confrontational approach that is so common from this government. The bill does nothing to address the very serious issues that confront many workers in that industry, like the non-payment of employee entitlements and the well-known practices of tax evasion and tax avoidance. 
It is for those reasons that we will be rejecting these bills, as we have rejected numerous others that have been brought to this chamber. I think our shadow minister has referred to the `dirty dozen bills'. I think we are now up to 13 or 14, and the pattern goes on and the rejections continue.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—It is a pleasure to be able to speak this evening to the  Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. It is interesting to follow one of the industrial relations dinosaurs of this House, the member for Throsby, a former ACTU president. The House is a retirement village for ACTU presidents. We have the member for Batman, the member for Hotham, the member for Throsby and we had the former member for Wills, Bob Hawke. What do you do when you retire from the ACTU presidency? The union give you a sinecure here because it is better than any retirement they can give you. So why would they not support this legislation? Because they cannot. They are wedded to union industry so tightly that, if they come down here and work against the union movement, their preselections will be up for grabs.
But let us look to the meat of the bills first before we get into the interesting little nuances in terms of the members and the reasons why they cannot do anything but oppose this legislation. These bills are designed to introduce specific workplace relations and occupational health and safety regulations for the Australian building and construction industry by establishing an Australian building and construction commissioner—ABCC, for later reference—and a federal safety commissioner. These bills will also alter the bargaining framework by focusing on genuine bargaining at the enterprise level, restricting pattern bargaining and providing for mandatory cooling-off periods, during which protected industrial action is not permitted. 
It will make unlawful all industrial action within constitutional limits other than protected industrial action, with industry participants able to recover any losses they suffer due to unlawful action. It will strengthen freedom of association provisions so that a wider range of behaviour identified by the royal commission is effectively dealt with. It will amend the right of entry system to clearly spell out the parties' rights and responsibilities. It will limit the scope for state law to be used to circumvent federal requirements. It will ensure that registered organisations are accountable for the actions of their officials and employees, and it will strengthen the compliance regime by increasing penalties and increasing access to damages for unlawful conduct. 
The Cole royal commission was a landmark hearing into something that had been required in the Australian construction and building industry. Such a hearing had been wanted for years, and it was desperately needed by those involved in the industry—business and workers. One of the great myths here is that the opposition talk about workers' rights—that is very important—but how about the right to work, which this legislation will address?  
The Cole royal commission report is an extensive document; it goes to 23 volumes, including the Little Red Book—which will eventually determine who needs to have further examination under our legal system. The Cole royal commission came up with 212 recommendations, and this government has met and decided that it would implement 120 of those recommendations—and this is what the bills are designed to do. It is very important that this legislation is passed. It is very important for the future of Australia, the welfare of Australia, its work force and, in particular, its construction industry. We are talking about a $60 billion industry, which cannot go on unchecked, which is its current state. 
As I said, there are 23 volumes and associated information in the report. As a member from Western Australia, I will talk about the Western Australian climate in terms of the building industry, the evidence from the Cole royal commission and the reason that this legislation needs to be enacted. Western Australia is almost considered to be the heart of darkness in terms of this industry because of a historic event that occurred when Brian Burke was premier. The BLF was out of control and was deregistered around Australia, expect in Western Australia. `Burkey' looked after his mate Norm Gallagher; he made sure that Norm did not get deregistered in Western Australia. The BLF's resurrection as the CFMEU in Western Australia has festered and become a pus on the work force body over there. As a result, it has gotten away with absolute wanton damage to an industry which provides so many jobs to so many people.
As has been stated by others in this House, if these reforms were to come through there would actually be an economic boon for this country because they would add something like $23 billion in economic benefits to the workers and the industries of this country. So it is very important that it happens. Interestingly, the royal commission says: 
There is widespread disrespect for, disregard of and breach of the law in the building and construction industry. The criminal, industrial and civil law is breached with impunity. Agreements made are not honoured. The result is that industrial power, not right or entitlement, determines outcomes. Short term commercial expediency prevails.
There are volumes of quotes that I could note here, but I wish to focus on Western Australia. As the commissioner said, `In Western Australia, the rule of law has little or no currency in the building and construction industry.' A differentiation needs to be made between the domestic building industry and the commercial building industry in Western Australia. We have a very buoyant, very vibrant domestic building industry in Western Australia, and it is going ahead in leaps and bounds in the current climate which is fostered by this government. But the commercial building industry, particularly in the CBD of Perth, is rotten to the core.
Interestingly, the CFMEU in Western Australia, which has been identified as a main culprit by the Cole royal commission, has a slogan on its building sites in Perth which says, `We build this city.' It is amazing, because nobody else is allowed in—so of course they build the city. But at what cost? `We build this city because we are not letting anyone else in.' That is the whole problem. The `no ticket, no start' workplaces in Western Australia are an absolute disgrace, and the Premier, Geoff Gallop, is complicit in this. He sits in his office—and he can see down St George's Terrace in Perth—and there are signs all over the place which say `no ticket, no start'. He knows it is illegal and he somehow, some way, justifies the signs staying up there, illegal as they are. What does this do for the small subcontractor who does not want to belong to a union? We talk about freedom of association; he cannot go on those sites. He cannot go and do his business because `no ticket, no start' is alive and well in Western Australia. 
The report of the Cole royal commission said that the size of the building industry in Western Australia is something like 11 per cent of the national industry. However, it also says that the rate of industrial disputation in the industry in Western Australia is far greater than 11 per cent. So Western Australia punches above its weight in terms of industrial anarchy; and Western Australia runs second only to Victoria in amount of disruption. In other states—for example, South Australia—there is little disputation. The real culprits in this are Victoria, one, and Western Australia, two. It is an absolute disgrace that this is allowed to happen.
Large building contractors from my state say to me, `We've been caught up in this, and your government wants us to abide by the rule of law and not get involved in casual tickets and illegal arrangements. But we are the meat in the sandwich. If we do not do this sort of arrangement, we get black-listed. We do not get contracts.' One only has to see what happened recently with a company called BGC in Western Australia—a company associated with a gentleman named Len Buckridge. He went to the Cole royal commission and gave evidence, and what happened? His mate, Tom Stephens, who was minister for housing, decided that he would not get contracts over a certain value. He was actually using some federal money to do this, and we did not like it. We made it very clear to the Premier and to Tom Stephens what would happen if he used this punitive measure for somebody who gave information to the Cole royal commission. Ultimately, through legal action and through pressure by media—and I congratulate the media for being onto this—and through members in this House and Cheryl Edwardes, the opposition spokesperson for industrial relations in Western Australia, it was overturned. Tom Stephens lost his job; he lost that part of his portfolio and was disgraced because punitive action was taken against somebody who had given information to the Cole royal commission.
This is the sort of thing that happens if you take on the CFMEU in Western Australia. We know that there are many good unions in Western Australia—the AMWU, et cetera—who get on with their job, provide a service to their workers, and ultimately benefit the work force that they represent. But not the CFMEU. Their state secretary, Joe Bullock, says, `We do this because we are a militant union.' What sort of a justification is that? `We are a militant union so we can do what we like. We can be bovver boys and thugs and justify it.' It is unbelievable that the main characters in this can get away with what is tantamount to anarchy, as I have already described. We only need to go to the Western Australian section of the Cole royal commission to find some prime examples. As well as stating that the rule of law in Western Australia has no currency, the report states that the CFMEU is involved in inappropriate conduct and that there is a culture of fear and intimidation. It also says:
The CFMEU exercises a position of dominance and power often disproportionate to its on-site presence, in terms of the number of workers on-site ... Threatening and intimidatory conduct by the CFMEU is a hallmark of the industry. It occurs in relation to securing union-endorsed EBAs ... 
The report also states that the CFMEU organises unlawful strikes and threats of strikes and that the risk of injury is significant because the CFMEU is more interested in its own control than in representing its workers.
When you look at a few examples from that royal commission—for example, the Blue Water Apartments project case—you see the same names cropping up: Kevin Reynolds, the WA branch secretary of the CFMEU; and Joe McDonald, the WA assistant branch secretary. Then there are luminaries like Cam McDonald, Graham Pallott and Darren Smith. They end up in all of these. For example, when you look at the Doric Group Holdings case, it says, `Finding against Joe McDonald and Graham Pallott.' If we look further, for the Graham Farmer Freeway and Kwinana Freeway civil construction projects we find the same thing. Who were involved? Joe McDonald and Pallott again. The same names keep coming up.
The interesting part about all this is that these men are luminaries in this industry in the state and they have done very well from being the heads of this rogue organisation. These are people who share a partnership in hotels with major builders. These are people who race expensive race horses. These are people who go overseas not at their own expense. There are pay-offs from the builders for industrial peace. Girls are organised for them in Bali when they get over there. That is all part of the package deal. Why wouldn't you pay for a few titillating side bits like that just to get industrial harmony? At the end of the day, this is what you are dealing with in Western Australia. It is an absolute disgrace and that is why this legislation is needed.
The Cole royal commission did extensive examinations into Western Australia. The major builder in Western Australia is Multiplex. I know John Roberts and members of his family quite well. I am quite surprised that Multiplex did not get any more mention in this royal commission than it got. It is the major builder over there, and the no ticket, no start provisions are the biggest on their sites. That is done in conjunction with the CFMEU, largely, and its operatives, such as Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds. They buy industrial peace this way and by inducements et cetera.
As a result, I cannot believe that Multiplex was not further scrutinised, particularly in Western Australia, which is its birthplace. The royal commission erred in that respect, if I can be a little critical of it. It did not look closely enough into the activities of that company. It looked into everybody else's but not closely enough into Multiplex's.
Why does there have to be a building industry commission? The fact is that in Western Australia under the previous state coalition government they had a very good building inspectorate—a prime example of one—which was loosely termed the `keirath cops'. There were only three members of that task force. They were able to go onto industrial sites and examine any terms, threats, intimidations, unlawful entries, inducements et cetera. It did not really gain teeth until the head of that task force was given special powers as a constable in conjunction with the state police. Once the ability to lay charges—along with the proper criminal sanctions—was given to that task force, industrial peace featured on the Western Australian landscape far more than it had ever done. In fact, it is stated in the Cole report that the inspectorate's stopping of intimidation, extortion and other illegal and improper conduct on building sites was quite successful. It maintained good relationships with WorkSafe Western Australia on the safety aspect of construction sites and established a reputation as a very efficient and successful agency. This was attributed to the fact that it vigorously enforced the law, and industry participants became increasingly aware that if they breached the law they would be charged and prosecuted. 
There was a change of government. What happened? Along came the Labor government, which disbanded that task force that had been running since 1994 and put their own in. However, the state Labor government have now established a building industry inspectorate, later known as the building industry special projects inspectorate. It has no teeth. It is not doing anything on industrial work sites. It is not enforcing the rule of law. It is a lackey to the Labor government. They have a weak industrial workplace relations minister in the form of John Kobelke and a compliant government. As we know, the Labor Party are so closely wedded to this form of the union movement that they cannot and will not stand up against them.
So basically the building industry in Western Australia has gone backwards since the change of government because they have a toothless tiger as an inspectorate. That is why the Commonwealth building and construction commission needs legislative power. If it does not have legislative power to do what it is entitled to do under this bill, it will also be a toothless tiger.
One of the problems is that the judiciary is almost complicit in this. If you were to use this kind of extortion and thuggery as a member of the Mafia, you would be charged and locked up. But for some reason the courts see industrial anarchy in the union movement and on building sites as something of a lesser evil when these people come before the courts. For example, Joe McDonald, who escaped police custody and ran back to the work force still in handcuffs, was fined $500. He even joked about it and said that was `folding money in the back of his pocket'. You need teeth in these operations to see that things happen.
I know the Labor Party will not support this because they will not support anything that will require them to stand up to their union mates. The Greens certainly will not. I appeal to the Democrats—and Andrew Murray in particular as a Western Australian senator—to help clean up this industry. I know that people like Kari Rummakainen from Broad Construction Services have been to see Senator Murray because without his support this legislation will not pass and the industry will not be cleaned up. For the betterment of Australia, our industry and our workers we need the support of the Democrats. We need to pass this legislation for all the people of Australia and the national interest generally.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The opposition are proud to oppose the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003 as this legislation is just another attack on the trade union movement and, as we call it, the wider labour family. That is something we have come to expect from this government. Hopefully this is the last time we will see legislation like this introduced by the government before workers across the country have their say at the next election and elect a Latham led Labor government.
The purpose of this legislation is to introduce specific workplace relations and occupational health and safety regulations for the Australian building and construction industry by establishing an Australian building and construction commissioner and a federal safety commissioner, and by altering the bargaining framework by focusing on genuine bargaining at the enterprise level, restricting pattern bargaining and providing for mandatory cooling-off periods during which protected industrial action is not permitted. It makes unlawful all industrial action within constitutional limits other than protected industrial action, with industry participants able to recover any losses they suffer due to unlawful action. It strengthens freedom of association provisions so that a wider range of behaviour identified by the royal commission is effectively dealt with by amending the right of entry system to clearly spell out the rights and responsibilities of parties. It limits the scope for state law to be used to circumvent federal requirements, it ensures that registered organisations are accountable for the actions of their officials and employees, and it strengthens the compliance regime by increasing penalties and increasing access to damages for unlawful conduct. By laying the purpose of the legislation out in this way, I have detailed every single reason why we are opposed to it. 
This legislation has come about following recommendations made by the Cole royal commission, which was set up by the previous Minister for Workplace Relations in this place, Minister Abbott. To put this legislation in context we need to talk about the facts of the Cole royal commission. In reality, the Cole royal commission was a trial of those who dare to organise and improve the lot of building workers—their pay, conditions and safety. The Cole royal commission was a coalition government set-up, designed to justify taking draconian measures against the building and construction unions and to give the coalition an election issue to beat up the Labor Party with. We say: `Bring it on.'
Minister Abbott found $60 million to ferret out the so-called truth. Government lawyers received $19.1 million of this, at a cost of $50,000 per hour of sitting. Cole himself received $660,000 per year plus houses supplied in both Melbourne and Sydney, allowances and air fares home to Sydney. In excess of 90 per cent of the commission's efforts could be categorised as inquiring into anti-union, anti-worker activities. The commission ducked the big issues in the building and construction industry—namely, lack of compliance by employers with awards, agreements and superannuation and payroll tax obligations; workers compensation premiums; workers redundancy entitlements; and the all-important paramount issue of the health and safety of construction workers.
The CFMEU analysed all the public transcripts, witness appearances and witness statements of the Cole royal commission. The analysis showed that the royal commission spent the overwhelming majority of its time investigating anti-union and, in particular, anti-CFMEU topics. Its efforts to investigate neutral topics were minor, tokenistic and away from the gaze of the national media. I have been provided with a summary of the CFMEU's analysis of that material, and I would like to go through a few points from that.
Of public hearing time, 90.33 per cent was spent investigating anti-union topics. None of the public hearing time was devoted to investigating anything positive about trade unions, while 3.3 per cent of public hearing time was devoted to topics which adversely reflected upon employers and 34,874 minutes of public hearing time was devoted to topics which adversely reflected upon the CFMEU. Most of the commission's time was spent on matters relating to the CFMEU in some way. The commission spent 81.06 per cent of public hearing time investigating anti-CFMEU topics, and it spent more time investigating anti-union topics in Sydney than in any other capital city, including Melbourne. This is indeed significant, given that the commission was based in Melbourne and heard all of its nationally based matters in that city.
Of the time spent by counsel assisting in delivering long statements—usually referred to as opening statements—93.1 per cent was spent on anti-union topics. Of the time large employers spent in the witness box, 62.2 per cent was spent making accusations against unions, while 82.6 per cent of the time other employers spent in the witness box was spent making accusations against unions and 80.1 per cent of the time union officials spent in the witness box was spent defending accusations about unions. Only 419 minutes of public hearing time was spent with a worker in the witness box, while 17,554 minutes—which is 41 times more than 419 minutes—was spent with an employer, or a representative of an employer, in the witness box. Union officials spent 11,981 minutes in the witness box. 
The style of questioning of the counsel assisting changed depending upon the kind of evidence being given. Where witnesses were defending accusations made against unions, counsel assisting usually questioned them in an accusatorial manner. In contrast, when witnesses were making allegations against unions, counsel assisting became more friendly and gave them an easy time. The analysis concludes that, in general, counsel assisting interrogated union officials and delegates while giving employers an easy time.
We are all aware that the $60 million Cole royal commission was set up from the start to undermine and attack organised labour in Australia, particularly the construction union. Royal commissions should not be used as political tools. This process has shown a great disrespect to the institution of the royal commission and shows the government is prepared to bring into question the use of royal commissions when such blatant political purposes are behind them.
A worker has every right to expect that he or she will return home uninjured and alive after each day of work. The fact that the commission did not examine this issue with the depth that it deserves is absolutely outrageous. The shocking reality is that, on average, one building worker is killed each week in Australia—and those are just the reported deaths; how many go unreported? The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission figures show that one in every 10,000 construction workers will die on the job. Comparing the risks with other industries, around 20 per cent of all workplace injuries happen on building sites. The safety commission estimates that the annual cost of building industry deaths and injuries is $20 billion.
In 1998-99, 54 construction workers died as a result of their work and 12,630 suffered non-fatal injuries. As I said, one in every 10,000 construction workers will die at work. More than one in five construction workers have suffered a workplace injury of some kind. In the Cole royal commission, workplace safety was confined to a two-day conference. In an industry where one person dies every week, not one employer was put in the box to be examined about poor safety practices.
I would like to now go to the so-called confidential volume, volume 23, of the royal commission report. To do this properly I need to quote from an article that was published in the Australian Financial Review on 29 September this year, entitled `Cole inquiry's empty charges'. I would like to go through a couple of the points made in that article:
While the $60 million, 18-month-long Cole royal commission generated some sensational headlines about violence, there are just 10 possible assaults listed in the secret section of its report. The worst case involves a union official “punching” an employer's hand, causing an object to be knocked to the ground during a heated conversation. 
Still, the 26 cases documented in this volume paint an industry marred by an undertone of violence, where employers and unions intimidate, threaten and speak abusively to get their way.
Most of the alleged crimes in the volume emanate from this sort of behaviour. About 70 of the proposed charges relate to threats to spark industrial action to inflict financial damage or to extract payments or threats to harm someone or their family for similar ends.
	...	...	...
Just five of the possible Cole report charges relate to - relatively minor - property damage. In fact, there is no mention of some of the most sensational allegations made during the hearings, involving payments to underworld figures, vandalism of building sites and bribery.
This is the volume that the government did not want to see. The article goes on:
Of the 31 people accused of crimes, 22 are union officials and nine are employers or managers; none are so-called “colourful identities”...
Along with threats and assaults, the charges range from fraud, contempt, obscenity, disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly and trespass to more arcane acts such as uttering ...
	...	...	...
So far, only two CFMEU officials have faced civil charges arising from Cole.
CFMEU state secretary Martin Kingham was prosecuted for contempt of the commission for failing to hand over documents. But a magistrate said he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the document sought by the inquiry existed. He said he was “more satisfied” that Kingham “at no time had the documents in his actual possession, custody, power or control”.
	...	...	...
The only other criminal prosecution to have occurred is that of Salvatore “Sammy” Manna, a NSW CFMEU official who was charged with perjury after he told the commission that he had had sex with the wife of the manager of a Sydney building company.
Further on, the article says:
... [the] head of the interim taskforce established by the Howard government to crack down on unlawful practices in the building industry, told a parliamentary committee that it had dropped 32 of the 84 matters referred by the royal commission because they were too old, because there was insufficient evidence or because witnesses had refused to co-operate.
	...	...	...
Cole [himself] highlighted in the introduction to his 23rd volume the fact that the commission's threshold for making findings was much lower than in a court of law. ... “Most of the matters investigated by the commission `might' have constituted a breach of civil or criminal law,” he said.
Also, unlike the HIH royal commission, Cole only allowed limited cross-examination of witnesses. Extensive cross-examination might have highlighted any failings in the evidence given.
Cole said:
In my opinion, procedural fairness does not invariably require commissions to permit cross-examination ... That is so even where evidence has been given that is adverse to the interests of the person who wishes to conduct the cross-examination.
So that article, published in the Financial Review at the end of September, highlights the lack of integrity (1) of the royal commission itself and (2) of the procedures of the royal commission with regard to some of the allegations and charges that were laid during the commission but which have not eventuated. Yet the government has seen fit, on the basis of that royal commission, to bring into this place legislation—which does not look at the health and safety of construction workers—to totally regulate the building and construction industry and also to attack and try to dismantle the CFMEU, the trade union that covers the construction industry.
Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, you would know that Alan Jones is rarely a friend of the Labor Party, but I would like to quote him, also in September, from the editorial he has on the Today show every morning. He said: 
It tends to be fashionable in this country to have a hit at the union movement.
And I have to say I've been guilty of that in the past.
But when you see the farce that is Ansett and the extent to which companies just go belly-up and leave workers whistling with nothing, then perhaps some sections of the union movement aren't tough enough.
There has been a fairly major exercise in union-bashing going on for some months, calling itself a Royal Commission into the building industry.
Remember, this is the same building industry that delivered the 2000 Olympic Games and all its infrastructure miles ahead of time.
But the Victorian secretary of the CFMEU has been charged and faces a fine or gaol because he refused twice in July and August to give the name of shop stewards who attended CFMEU training workshops in 2001-2002.
So a union official is subject to criminal charges because he refuses to give up the names of union activists.
He simply said he wasn't going to put the livelihood of them and their families at risk.
Well, you might remember that the national secretary of the CFMEU John Sutton, called for the Royal Commissioner Mr Justice Cole to stand down because a report was issued in August critical of the New South Wales branch of the CFMEU, allegedly without hearing evidence from the union.
And the union released at the time some unbelievable figures.
Now surely in all of these things fairness has to be real as well as apparent.
But a bloke refuses to give up the names of his shop stewards and he faces criminal charges.
It sounds fairly un-Australian.
We say it is unfair and unjust. There was a recent survey conducted by Essential Research into community attitudes to the federal government, unions, the royal commission and the building industry. It sends a stark message to members of the government if they continue to pursue this line. In summary, the survey found:
	Unions received positive support from the community on core issues.
	Job security remains an issue of high concern.
	Community support the right of workers to take industrial action to protect wages and conditions.
	The public believe that the role of Government in industrial relations is to bring all sides together to sort problems out.
	Community see that there are corrupt practices in the building industry, and that projects do not get completed on time or on budget.
	The community supports tough action on unions, but a greater percentage support tough action on companies.
	The public do not support de-registration of the union.
	The public believe that the Government is more interested in the behaviour of unions than the behaviour of company directors and executives.
	The public believe that building workers are well looked after by their union, and that they should have a right to belong to whatever union they choose. The public understand that it is a tough industry and that health and safety is a real issue.
In conclusion, the summary states:
	The Government would not be supported if it was seen to be acting unfairly to target the union.
Martin Loosemore, a professor of construction management at the University of New South Wales, says that this legislation arising from the Cole royal commission is `narrow, divisive and confrontational'. Professor Loosemore said that the construction industry needed to lift its game on training practices, contractual reform, human resource management, procurement practices and the fact that price rather than quality drove investment. None of these issues, he said, has been addressed by this legislation. This bill seeks to severely restrict the ability of building workers to take industrial action over safety, wages and conditions. It would introduce massive fines and prison terms for union members who breach its provisions; allow union officials to be barred from the industry, even for technical breaches; and would be policed by a special taxpayer funded task force. 
As I have said in this place, we on this side of the parliament are proud to represent the workers right around this country. We are proud to have alliances with the trade union movement. We are proud to be here. We will be even prouder when we are sitting on those benches opposite and are able to get rid of a lot of this draconian legislation which this government has introduced. If the government wants to fight an election on industrial issues, we say, `Bring it on.' We will win because we have a proud tradition of supporting the workers of this country.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2003-12-03,"—I rise in the House tonight to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003. These bills implement the findings of the Cole royal commission into the unlawful or otherwise inappropriate practice and conduct in the building and construction industry. The royal commission found that the construction industry was rife with lawlessness. It found there were breaches of the criminal law, breaches of the general law and numerous breaches of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It found that many of the participants in the building industry were flouting the law—the same laws that the rest of the Australian community and Australian business are required to follow. There was total disrespect and total disregard for the rule of law. I think that is unAustralian.
What the government is proposing in this legislation are measures to clean up this vitally important industry. The industry is indeed vitally important. In 2001-02 the building and construction industry was a $60 billion industry—almost six per cent of GDP in fact—employing over 700,000 people. This legislation is about fundamental and structural change to fix up the inherent lawlessness which was found by the Cole royal commission to be running rife throughout this very important industry.
The findings identified a number of problems in the New South Wales industry. About one-third of the building and construction industry is in New South Wales. It employs about 30 per cent of the people in the industry, or about 215,000 people. There is a culture in New South Wales which survives because of the symbiotic relationship between head contractors and the CFMEU. The CFMEU has been directly involved in deliberately preventing employees and employers in the industry in New South Wales and other states from having the opportunity of choosing the most appropriate agreement for their particular circumstances because they are effectively compelled to enter into union endorsed EBAs.
The whole notion of freedom of association, along with any sense of the need to obey the laws of the community, cannot apparently be found anywhere. There is no following of this government's highly successful workplace relations reforms. Interestingly, the commission found there is a widespread underpayment of workers' entitlements, and certainly that is something that Australians hold dear—that is, that people should be rightly paid the remuneration to which they are entitled under the law. There is evidence in the commission's findings of nonpayment of workers compensation contributions by employers. The royal commission's findings indicate there have been some improvements in respect of occupational health and safety; however, there still remains a high level of avoidable fatalities, accidents and injuries. 
The building industry task force, which was set up in 1992 to discourage unlawful conduct in New South Wales, was disbanded in 1995. The findings of the Cole royal commission were that since that disbanding there has been a rise in industrial disputation in New South Wales. Unprotected action is a common occurrence and is regularly threatened in the New South Wales industry. The royal commissioner made findings on 25 separate incidents of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, unions and employers in the New South Wales industry. Royal Commissioner Cole said in his report on the situation that in New South Wales the categories of unlawful and otherwise inappropriate conduct which have been identified compel the conclusion that there is an urgent need for reform and cultural change in the New South Wales building and construction industry.
There were also findings handed down about the range of inappropriate actions taking place in the industry—these were not unlawful but only so because the current law is deficient. The commission made a number of recommendations with regard to inappropriate actions dealt with under the law, and this bill acts on those recommendations. The types of inappropriate conduct identified in the royal commission's findings include head contractors and unions jointly applying pressure with the intent of forcing subcontractors to sign union endorsed EBAs; head contractors and unions agreeing to work on a project where subcontractors must have union endorsed EBAs; union officials asserting that union endorsed EBAs are required to work in the industry in New South Wales; union officials making unfounded allegations in an endeavour to force subcontractors to sign union endorsed EBAs; and union officials pressuring subcontractors to abandon their non-union EBAs and enter EBAs which were sanctioned by the union. 
There has also been the inclusion in EBAs of an automatic productivity allowance in circumstances where no productivity rises are foreshadowed or are likely. There have been cases of union officials threatening to prevent subcontractors who employ workers under terms of Australian workplace agreements from working on sites; head contractors requiring all employees of their subcontractors to be union members as a condition of the right to work on a site; and head contractors and subcontractors disregarding proper standards of occupational health and safety, resulting in risk to the safety of workers—and that is vitally important. Many businesses around the country are grappling with the problem of occupational health and safety issues. Occupational health and safety, or the lack of it in many cases, is driving up workers compensation insurance premiums in New South Wales. There is already a range of businesses in my electorate having difficulty competing because businesses in Queensland are enjoying lower workers compensation premiums. Anything that is pushing workers compensation premiums up is not a good thing. There have also been instances of union officials raising safety allegations and requiring work to cease where the cessation of work is manifestly excessive or unnecessary and, finally, unions and their officials and members disregarding the orders and directions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
The government's legislative package, which we are considering here, is targeted at comprehensive reform and a new system of dedicated law enforcement in this vitally important industry. The key measures of the bill include setting up the Australian Building and Construction Commission to monitor and implement new guidelines developed under a new industry code. The commissioner's functions will include site inspections. Furthermore, there will be established a federal safety commissioner to oversee the issues identified in the royal commission's findings on occupational health and safety in Commonwealth funded construction projects; improvements to the bargaining framework by focusing on genuine bargaining at enterprise level; restrictions to pattern bargaining and provision for mandatory cooling-off periods during which protected industrial action will not be permitted; moves to make unlawful all industrial action within the limits of the constitution other than protected industrial action, with industry participants able to recover any losses they suffer due to unlawful action; strengthening of the freedom of association provisions so that a wider range of inappropriate behaviour, as identified by the Cole royal commission, can be effectively dealt with by the law; changes and enhancements to the right of entry system to clearly spell out the rights of the parties and their responsibilities and also to limit the scope of state laws which are used to circumvent federal requirements; moves to ensure that registered organisations are accountable for the actions of their officials and employees; and improvements in the compliance regime through increased penalties and the enhancement of the damages which are available against unlawful conduct. 
There are a great many benefits across the board with these reforms. Independent research indicates that improvements in practices in the building and construction industry workplace could bring a gain in the order of $2.3 billion each year—I will repeat that: $2.3 billion—for the Australian economy, with the CPI falling by one per cent and construction costs falling by 6.5 per cent. They are pretty staggering improvements and I think that the members opposite should support the sort of economic improvement these reforms could bring.
Cheaper building costs will mean savings for businesses and citizens alike. The reforms will create a better working environment for decent employers and employees, with greater choices and a reduction in the entrenched culture of intimidation and fear. The royal commission made a compelling case in its findings for urgent cultural change and systematic reform. The recommendations and the government's response have been welcomed by industry groups, and that is quite fundamental because no industry should have to deal with the kind of unlawful behaviour going on in the building and construction industry. Change is needed, and this government is determined to achieve change. I call on the members opposite to support these vitally important reforms.
Both the Labor Party and the unions are on the record as saying they will not tolerate corruption, extortion and criminal behaviour in the building industry. I call on the members of the Labor Party to support these reforms and this bill, to give up the old Labor dogma and to join us in trying to improve the building industry. But, unfortunately, a Labor Party spokesman has come out and said the royal commission was a politically motivated witch-hunt and against the union movement—the same old chestnuts they dredge up all the time. The question is: does the Labor Party really care about improving occupational health and safety? Does the Labor Party really care about improved economic outcomes? Does the Labor Party really care about a better building industry or is it merely beholden to its union mates? The Labor Party and the unions just oppose, oppose, oppose. The ACTU statement of values says: 
Unions believe that workplaces should be safe, secure, healthy and free from harassment, intimidation, violence and discrimination.
It is about time the members opposite gave up the tired old Labor rhetoric and supported the reforms which are embodied in this bill. There is a compelling case for reform out there. It was clearly identified by the Cole royal commission. We want to get rid of the lawlessness. We want to get a quality industry; we want to get a more economic outcome; and we want a better building and construction industry. If Labor is serious about a safe and productive building industry, it will support these bills. If Labor wants to play its part in the economic and social development of this nation, it will support these bills. If Labor wants to prove to the Australian people that it is not beholden to union thuggery, it will support these bills. If Labor wants to break from its way of doing business in the past, its way of mindless and endless opposition, it will support these bills. Certainly I believe that these bills will result in a welcome improvement in the building industry, and I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-12-03,"—In presenting the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003, the government would have us believe there are serious and critical problems with the building and construction industry. The member for Cowper has just talked about a so-called entrenched culture of intimidation and fear. I would suggest that a lot of the entrenched culture of intimidation and fear is on behalf of the bosses. These bills deal with critical problems within the building and construction industry, and these problems are supposedly centred on workers and their trade unions. That is right; when it comes to workers and unions, this government is all about extremist high drama and attacks on basic rights. And here is an attack in the form of a 200-page bill.
During the term of this government we have seen ugly attacks on unions such as the Patrick Stevedores conflict, with companies employing balaclava-clad security guards—goons as the member for Burke likes to call them—and Rottweiler attack dogs to deal with workers. And now the government wants us to see it all happen again. This time though it is a more clinical approach, where law is used as a weapon against workers and their families. The government has put forward these bills because it is trapped by its own paradoxical ideology, an ideology that seeks to enforce individualism onto workers against their individual will—and most especially, via chapter 6 of the first bill, to restrict the opportunities for collective action, despite the government's preference to decentralise wages and conditions of employment outcomes.
So on the one hand the government wants workers to negotiate directly with employers, but on the other hand it does not want them to be able to do it very well. That is the clear rationale behind these bills—to restrict the ability of workers to secure adequate wages and conditions in the building and construction industry, despite the reams of rhetoric to the contrary. That is why these bills seek to outlaw pattern bargaining, where workers can collectively negotiate against more than one employer or with one employer in more than one place. That is why these bills seek to reduce the instances where employees can take lawful industrial action and to increase the range of penalties if they do not climb legal and administrative hurdles before doing so.
 In fact, the minister for workplace relations stated in his second reading speech to these bills that the purpose of collective action is the defeat of the operation of the law. Excuse me, but surely collective action must first be illegal? Or is that where the government has revealed that it wants to take the Australian community—that is, to outlaw all collective action? The other more realistic and even-handed way of looking at collective action is that it is the only way for workers to improve their pay and conditions in the absence of centralised wage fixing or to protect themselves from unnecessary or dangerous work practices. Under these bills, the government will restrict the ability of workers to do both, which can only be described as reprehensible. 
If these bills become law, the construction industry will be transformed into one where workers cannot protect and advance their interests without first scaling legal and administrative mountains in a workplace where managerial discretion will rule the day. This legislative straightjacket is certain to make it harder for workers and their unions to campaign against unsafe work practices that affect individual building sites as well as the industry as a whole. As a result workers and the community that works, drives or walks on, under or near building sites will be at increased risk of death and serious injury.
Unions such as the CFMEU will be unable to protect their members and the public. Why? Because under section 72(1)(g) of these bills it will be illegal for a worker to take industrial action about safety issues unless they can satisfy a court that the action is:
... based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety.
That is right: real and tragically accurate predictions about the safety of others—including colleagues, pedestrians, inexperienced workers and even government officials—are not and cannot be the business of workers. That is disgraceful. Worse still, if employees are guided by their conscience and take action to protect the lives of others, they would be liable for fines of up to $22,000 each and $110,000 for their unions. What kind of perverse logic is that? It is no more than the punishment of the rescuers; it is akin to suing a surf-lifesaving club for making a rescue or impounding an ambulance for attending a car crash.
Consider the recent tragedy of Sydney teenager Joel Exner, who fell to his death at work. Under the government's scenario, workers who demanded Joel be given appropriate safety training and equipment and then took action to make sure it happened would be liable for prosecution because they would be unable to show that Joel's safety constituted an imminent risk to themselves. I know CFMEU delegates in my electorate of Cunningham who, in recent weeks, have visited numerous sites and informed the bosses of various OH&S problems, but appropriate action has not been taken and the culture of slackness and disregard for basic safety precautions remains.
To be fair to the minister, these bills do create federal safety officers, but there is no certainty that these officers will act with vigour or that they will be adequately resourced. In fact I note that, from page 5 of the bills' explanatory memorandum, the government has allocated just $5 million for both the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to go about their business of protecting workers. That is just not enough. The minister's so-called `cop on the beat' is not very well resourced. Let us do some maths, Mr Speaker: page 18 of the statistical compendium to the Cole royal commission states that in 1996-97 there were 194,300 businesses in the building and construction industry; that $5 million equates to the grand sum of $25.73 per business.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—Government spending on infrastructure has not kept pace with the growing needs of our community. After seven years in government, the penny has dropped and government members are now calling for infrastructure spending. The government claims debt reduction as one of its principle achievements—the corollary of that, of course, is that it has done so through running down spending on key community needs. In a recent report discussing the downwards trend in investment in public infrastructure, the Allen Consulting Group noted that `in some cases the effects extend beyond financial and economic factors and pose threats to public health and safety'.
Even the Institution of Engineers Australia makes it clear that our national roads and national interstate rail system are in a mess. The attempt by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to develop the so-called AusLink initiative is in complete disarray. In an environment where rail is the least adequate transport infrastructure class, the very fact that AusLink seeks to shift demand from road to rail is odd without the Commonwealth committing additional funds to improve the infrastructure. To ensure that infrastructure is effective, it is essential that all three levels of government work together. However, the minister has failed time and time again to engage the states and territories in the AusLink process. The AusLink green paper is farcical in its lack of detail and is a cynical cost-shifting proposal. AusLink raises more questions than it answers.
The government's architect of the Australian logistics industry strategy, Mr John Bowdler, a respected industry consultant, said this on AusLink:
... the Green Paper has a serious deficiency in that it does not address adequately issues surrounding the level of funding likely to be required to meet future infrastructure needs, and where that funding might be best sourced.
He continues:
There is no serious analysis of the Commonwealth's recent record of infrastructure funding, or a balanced discussion of the relative advantages of public and private funding, construction and operation. 
Of course we know that the key industry and community response to AusLink centres on the current level of funding being inadequate, and there is a wide call for additional Commonwealth funds to match future investment. The government has had seven years to demonstrate its commitment to funding public infrastructure. It has failed, and the community know it. AusLink stands as solid evidence that this government is not serious about funding infrastructure; rather it puts the onus on others to fund its shallow promises. In his AusLink submission, Mr Bowdler concluded:
... the Commonwealth must face up to its obligations by looking harder at increasing its own contribution from either the budget or debt instruments.
I could not put it any better than that. But when will we see the AusLink white paper? Who knows? We were told that legislation would be introduced in September 2003 and that the new policy would be at full steam by June 2004.
The need for improved infrastructure funding in regional Australia is an important issue and, as the Allen Consulting Group notes, there is compelling evidence that suggests investment in public infrastructure is inextricably linked to economic development. I question the government's commitment to regional infrastructure funding. In a desperate measure, the government have recently cut $35 million from the Building Additional Regional Networks fund to flesh out their response to the Estens inquiry into telecommunications services. Through this sleight-of-hand funding trick, a taxpayer subsidy will now be delivered through the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme to Telstra to reduce the price of its inflated broadband services. This is purely and simply an act of feaguing. The shame is that organisations building new, competing telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia, which was the goal of BARN, will not benefit through the government's butchering of this fund. 
Let us be absolutely clear on the poor management of programs aimed at improving regional telecommunications infrastructure. The ANAO report No. 12 of 2003-04 stated that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had failed to translate `the government's program objectives into operational objectives that would have helped establish an appropriate performance management framework to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery'. ANAO found that the extent of the increase in telecommunications infrastructure development in regional areas would be difficult to demonstrate because there was no baseline data collected or targets set at the beginning of the program. It just sounds ridiculous. So there are no performance measures, there is no risk analysis and there is obviously no clue—this is Management 101 stuff.
We have a government incapable of managing its existing infrastructure programs. The government has an appalling track record when it comes to the development and implementation of infrastructure programs. The government has no commitment to maintaining infrastructure in rural and regional areas and its management of both AusLink and Building Additional Rural Networks is testament to this.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,Adjournment,29,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—There could be no greater priority for any government, in particular a national government, than to take care of those who have served their country in a theatre of war. Therefore, members can imagine my shock, amazement and anger when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs informed me that the many veterans and war widows and widowers living in my electorate who remain on waiting lists for Home Care assessment will be forced to continue to wait because of, to use her words, a lack of resources. Surely, in a $170 billion budget and in times of economic growth, we can find sufficient money to ensure that our veterans and war widows and widowers get the home help that they are entitled to and deserve. Veterans Home Care is an essential service that is designed to help veterans and war widows and widowers remain in their homes for a longer period and, most importantly, to choose the way of life which is most suitable to them. The services provided by Home Care range from domestic assistance such as housework, gardening and personal care to, of course, home respite care. In the Hunter electorate, approximately 65 per cent of veterans currently receive or have applied for an assessment, and about 22 per cent are waiting for assessment or a service allocation.
These are usually not big requests. For example, recently a constituent contacted my office seeking to have some help once a week rather than once a fortnight—not a big commitment for the Commonwealth to make on behalf of my constituent. It is extraordinary for the minister to say that these people will have to continue to await reassessment because the department simply does not have the resources. As I said at the beginning of my speech, no greater commitment should there be from any national government than to our veterans and war widows and widowers. The government should hang its head in shame. I appeal to the minister to review the situation and assure people who choose to stay in their homes—which is a saving to the government—that they will be allowed to do so with dignity and that they will be afforded the assistance that they require.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am very pleased to speak on this motion about the excellent report brought down by the Transport and Regional Services Committee, which is chaired by the member for Hinkler, and I know that the member for Corangamite, who is in the chamber today, was a member of that committee as well. Various aspects of this report certainly have absolute relevance to my electorate of Eden-Monaro, which is why I want to say a few words on it today.
I guess the three airports within my electorate which are most relevant to aspects of this report are Moruya, Merimbula and Cooma airports. Obviously the other major airport that is relevant to Eden-Monaro is Canberra, which services the Queanbeyan region. Quite specifically, the matters taken up in this report are more directed towards those three airports—Moruya, Merimbula and Cooma. Each of those airports is owned by the local council. In the case of Moruya, it is the Eurobodalla Shire; in the case of Cooma, it is the Snowy River Shire; and in the case of Merimbula, it is the Bega Valley Shire. The Moruya and Cooma airports are run by those councils as well. 
In the case of Merimbula, a number of years ago the Bega Valley Shire Council put the operation of the airport out to tender, and it is now privately operated on a lease basis. The people that were involved in taking over that lease a few years ago were Ian and Cathy Baker, along with Ron and Lisa Finneran. They got off to a great start when they took over the airport. They put a lot of money into it and upgraded it substantially. There has been a real change from what was there before. They have been quite innovative as well and were starting to attract various other flights in and out of the region. Merimbula is a great holiday area, obviously, and the airport operations were going very well until the Ansett collapse. Hazelton had been flying in and out of Merimbula and that all got tied up in the collapse of Ansett. Through no fault of their own, all of a sudden they were a business absolutely fighting for their life. We saw flights taken off, flights put on and schedules changed. When you do that, people who regularly use the airport certainly lose confidence in it, and that made it even more difficult. But they managed to hang in there and see those difficult times through. They put forward some proposals to possibly buy some of the aircraft out of the Ansett sale to operate their own service from Merimbula to Sydney and Melbourne. That did not happen, but gradually—and ultimately with the arrival of Rex—we have seen better and better services back into that region. It is just getting back to a stage where it is not running too badly, but it has certainly been difficult.
I want to pay tribute to Ian and Cathy Baker. Ron and Lisa Finneran are still there at times but do not have the same involvement now as they did originally, but certainly Ian and Cathy have been terrific in the way in which they have provided that great service into and out of Merimbula. They will be welcoming this report and a number of aspects of it, as will the Eurobodalla and the Snowy River shires with their airports. In particular they will welcome recommendation 5, which in part says:
The committee recommends a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance as follows:
	...	...	...
	For communities with a population under 30,000, supporting a regional or hub airport with RPT services, to receive a 50 per cent subsidy and;
	Still smaller communities supporting an airport with low RPT, charter and air ambulance to receive a 33 per cent subsidy.
Each of the councils did make submissions to the inquiry. The Snowy River Shire made the comment about the difficulty of maintaining the airport and the cost of it—they subsidise it fairly heavily. They conducted an independent inquiry into the airport and future options and they said:
Should Council continue to incur losses on behalf of the community owned asset, it will consider implementing whatever options are feasible to lessen the financial risk ... and maintenance burden.
Similarly, the Eurobodalla Shire Council said:
This Council currently subsidises the operation and maintenance of the Moruya Airport by approximately $125,000 per year. This does not take account of the need to carry out extensive rehabilitation of the main runway in 20 years time. 
Similarly, with respect to the Bega Valley Shire and Merimbula, the report states:
The major cost of maintenance and upgrade of airport infrastructure is a significant problem for some local councils. Bega Valley Shire, the owner of the Merimbula Airport, claimed that significant capital investment will be needed in the next five to ten years even just to maintain the current airport standards. A move to possible larger aircraft in the medium term will likely necessitate several million dollars of additional capital works for runway improvements, associated apron trafficking areas and increase in the capacity of the airport terminal. The council stated that it can reasonably address the ongoing maintenance issues of its airport asset, yet its funds for major new capital works to support growth in air services are extremely limited.
So the Bega Valley Shire will certainly welcome the committee's recommendations in relation to that assistance in those circumstances.
The other matter that I want to raise is recommendations 20 and 21, as they are quite relevant to my electorate as well. They relate to Commonwealth employees buying airline tickets consistent with `best fare of the day' and `value for money'. This is relevant because Rex planes travel between Sydney and Canberra, as many would know, and this is one of their major routes in terms of volume, but they also operate flights down to Moruya and Merimbula. It is in the interests of regional aviation that an airline like Rex is profitable on those bigger routes, like the Sydney-Canberra one. 
A number of months ago, their share of the ticket sales was absolutely minuscule. Out of the many thousands of seats going in and out of Canberra each week, Rex were only managing to pick up a couple of hundred. Fortunately, after representations to government and instructions from ministers and secretaries to departments, a lot more travel is now occurring on that route—and rightly so, because they offer a very good fare and the quality of service et cetera is equal to or better than the other options. This provides much better competition as a result, with Rex getting a bit more business from the Commonwealth. That will then make those other routes down to Merimbula and Moruya much more viable. 
I understand that Rex finally got over the line and made a profit in October—they had their first month where they actually made a profit—and I think a lot of that was to do with the increase in usage on the route between Sydney and Canberra. I welcome the support the government has been showing, and I am pleased that I have been able to give some assistance to Rex in their pursuit of a better deal. Recommendations 20 and 21 call for some auditing of these aspects to ensure that the Commonwealth gets the best deal and also shares the business. I know Rex will welcome those recommendations.
I have not mentioned Cooma as much because Rex has not been flying into Cooma. Horizon Airlines were flying into there from Sydney, but they have had some difficulties as well. Unfortunately, they went into administration just recently, but ultimately they have been picked up by a Queensland regional airline. We are still maintaining that service, but it is a difficult area because a lot of the volume happens during the winter period obviously when people go down to Cooma and on to the snowfields, but it is good we are maintaining that RPT service through that new airline. Hopefully, with that area growing and the tourism season getting longer and longer—as the summer season becomes much more relevant as well—those planes which fly into and out of Cooma will have better patronage and therefore it will be more viable. So a number of these recommendations will certainly assist the local council which owns and operates the airport.  
I congratulate the committee on a very comprehensive inquiry. It has taken place over a long period of time, but it is very comprehensive when you look at the issues the committee have raised through the report. It is certainly a great step forward. I am sure that the government will consider the recommendations very closely, because the government is a strong supporter of rural and regional Australia. Many of our towns do not have the other public transport connections—I have no rail down the coast in my electorate and there is no rail going into Cooma—and therefore we rely very heavily on roads and RPT flights into those major centres. We want to ensure that they not only remain viable for the future but also grow and provide an even better service for the people in my electorate of Eden-Monaro.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Transport and Regional Services Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am delighted to participate in this debate, having been a conscientious contributor towards the Report on regional aviation and island transport services: making ends meet. I compliment the secretariat on the comprehensive way in which the report has been put together and I compliment the committee on its recommendations. There are a number of issues, as my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro has mentioned, including local airports and the cost of regional aircraft. It is very difficult for governments to address some of these issues and look after regional communities. I want to make some comments on a few of the issues raised in the report.
I noticed from the overview—and this came out from a number of the witnesses—that government taxes and levies now account for between 25 and 40 per cent of many average airfares. So the government, local councils and state governments are making their contribution to the cost of regional aviation. Members of the committee became aware when they talked to witnesses that one of the fundamental difficulties is the sheer economics of regional aviation, and I would be happy to quote the committee findings because they precisely set out the problems that the committee encountered. The committee found that the key issues affecting regional aviation were costs, returns, service levels, interconnectivity, maintenance of country airports, regulation and coordination. The cost of operating regional airports is high and rising—and a number of witnesses supported that view, so I will talk about that further. Returns to regional operators are often low, and they are declining, because their passenger numbers can be small and variable. Because of the high cost and low returns, the level of service is often poor in terms of the size of the operating aircraft and the frequency and scheduling of services.
There we have, I think, the fundamental problems facing the regional airlines and the sustainability of these regional routes. I was deeply interested in a couple of the witnesses who put the costs in a very graphic manner. Island Airlines Tasmania said that the cost of operating a turboprop aircraft is double that of a piston-engined aircraft and that the economies of scale of a turboprop aircraft are not realised until a seating capacity of 18 is reached. That really demonstrates the problem where regional passengers are keen to have better aircraft—somewhat bigger aircraft—but the cost of those aircraft is considerable and the economies of scale are a problem, no matter what governments do and no matter what subsidies are provided.
Qantas provided some interesting comparisons between a 36-seat aircraft operating on a regional route and a 260-seat aircraft operating on a trunk route. The average passenger in regional Australia draws the obvious comparison when they get to the metropolitan areas and enjoy the bigger aircraft, and I think they are somewhat critical of the smaller aircraft without a full understanding of the costs involved. Qantas said that the crew costs per seat for a 36-seat aircraft are four times greater than for a 260-seat aircraft. So we have that fundamental problem. The maintenance costs per seat for a 36-seat aircraft are more than twice those for a 260-seat aircraft. The aircraft ownership costs for a 36-seat aircraft are more than 50 per cent higher than for a 260-seat aircraft. Landing and en route charges for a 36-seat aircraft are more than 40 per cent higher than for a 260-seat aircraft. We heard a lot of evidence about these landing charges and the difficulties that smaller aircraft encounter at remote airports. 
The costs of running smaller aircraft in regional Australia are quite prohibitive in many cases. Research by the BTRE supports these findings. What they say is interesting: the cost per seat generally declines as the aircraft size increases because the fixed costs are spread among more passengers. I guess that is self-evident and those of us who have been around this industry for some time would know that to be a fact of life, yet a number of the witnesses and people associated with regional aviation really do not comprehend that difficulty. They want to get the service and they want to have it early in the morning and late in the afternoon, but they do not have an understanding of the costs involved. The cost per kilometre flown declines as the stage length increases, and propeller aircraft are cheaper to operate over shorter distances than jets. Again, that is self-evident: the bigger jets, once they are airborne, can cover the comparatively short hauls—in international terms—between Melbourne and Sydney. 
So, obviously, the regional aircraft have a problem in making a return on capital. All aircraft are relatively expensive to operate over distances of up to 200 kilometres, but the cost per passenger declines as the percentage of seats filled on the aircraft increases. Again, it was made clear in the evidence that a number of the regional operators were not able to fill their aircraft and this encroached upon their costs. That was the fundamental argument that I picked up from hearing witnesses all around Australia. On the one hand, the business operators at Flinders Island, for instance, were concerned that they lacked an air service; on the other hand, the airline operators we spoke to were unable to make a dollar out of the operation. I think there had been a number of participants on that particular route who had gone broke over the years.
I would like to refer to the ALOP scheme—the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan, which was instituted by the Hawke government in 1989. I have been around these arguments for some years, and in the broad sense I would say of this plan what Mr Ken Keech, the Chief Executive Officer of the AAA, said:
I have been on record saying for quite some time that my personal view is that the ALOP scheme was the greatest con job of all time.
Basically, he was saying that the government of the day decided to relinquish their responsibility for running local airports. They made capital moneys available and I do not think local councils around Australia fully understood the impact of this offer or that over time they would have difficulty in maintaining their airport, putting down new strips and getting sufficient income from the airports. As a result, the returns for local councils, especially from the smaller airports, were not commensurate with the actual running costs, let alone the replacement of their capital assets. It is interesting that the AAA represents over 255 airports across Australia and, of these 255 airports, approximately 220 are located in regional and rural Australia and are owned and operated by the local community through their local government shire or council. 
We had a number of comments about some of them being effective. Glenelg Shire, near Mount Gambier, is able to operate its airport effectively, although it requires a capital injection to upgrade the airport for modern aircraft. I note that in terms of firefighting, visits by VIPs and natural disasters these airports could play a crucial role, and it would be my judgment that the Commonwealth should support some of the smaller airports as a community service obligation, particularly in times of emergency. I strongly support the recommendation of the committee that the Commonwealth look carefully at the contribution of capital moneys to the smaller airports to keep them upgraded and operational and ensure they are servicing Australia. In my view, aviation is a Commonwealth responsibility. It is portrayed in that way in every other aspect and the Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure that regional Australia is well served by the smaller airports that really have difficulty in paying their way.
If we look at the other policy issue of taxes, I said in my opening remarks that it is interesting that if you add up the taxes involved, especially in terms of some of these smaller airports, the Commonwealth imposed costs are as follows: Airservices' costs are about 4.3 per cent; airport landing and terminal charges are about 6.2 per cent; GST is nine per cent; the noise levy is about $3.60 as it applies to Sydney and Adelaide airports; and the terrorism insurance levy ranges from $2.50 to $10. These costs are add-ons to the cost of regional air tickets with the additional problems of economies of scale that the airlines face. In addition to these significant issues, the committee found that costs imposed at a local level that added to the cost of a ticket included passenger head taxes, landing charges and ground support charges.
We have an interesting situation where, on one hand, the government are not contributing to the operation of these regional airports while, on the other hand, they are very happy to take a number of charges as their due right. We have a real policy dilemma: if the Commonwealth government have responsibility for aviation, they should be making a contribution back to its operation.
Finally, I want to comment on the safety authority. That issue was a matter of considerable debate within the committee and was raised by a number of the witnesses, who complained quite fiercely on occasions about the operation of CASA. I participated in the Plane Safe inquiry and I have heard the arguments from both sides of the table. I have heard the defending argument from CASA, which has the responsibility to maintain a safe air system. I have also heard from some of the smaller operators, who complained that CASA was unduly officious in handling the air safety regulations. I well recall two years of discussions with CASA personnel and a number of witnesses on the Plane Safe inquiry and I saw a bit of a replay of those debates in this particular inquiry.
Suffice it to say that the bigger airline operators such as Qantas and formerly Ansett conduct their operations safely, in my view, although Ansett obviously had some difficulties with CASA because of its financial problems. Qantas is quoted as saying that it has a good relationship with CASA. However, as I have indicated to parliament, it is the smaller operators who are under financial pressure who have problems in maintaining their safety regimes. I suggest that we need to ensure that CASA provides a lead in the development of a safety culture in the smaller regional transport operators. Ensuring that the culture is one of safety is not one of the policeman's roles. We should encourage both sides of the debate to move along that path instead of pursuing the argument that CASA will implement a system of very tight regulation—and I noticed the demerit points approach outlined by the minister in the new set of CASA regulations, which is a step in the right direction. 
I want to quote the Regional Aviation Association of Australia on this issue. The association has stated:
I believe there are better opportunities for CASA to become more interactive with the operators at the lower level, rather than being the policeman. I think they should be looking to move in with a lot of these operators—almost have their local man on the ground and take them by the hand and lead them through the safe culture that they need and that this country will need at the end of the day.
That interesting quotation summarises my view that a culture of safety is the way to go to encourage people, especially at the smaller regional level, to make sure that their planes are safe, that they operate safely and that their spare parts are up to standard. People in this parliament and members at the local level suffer considerably when there are aircraft accidents such as the Seaview accident in South Australia. In such circumstances, CASA comes under considerable political pressure for not executing their task.
I commend the report and the recommendations. I commend the depth of the submissions on a very difficult issue in respect of which people have very strong emotional reactions to a lack of services. If you look at the number of services that have been taken from regional Australia by the sheer pressure of the economics, one must be concerned about the future of regional aviation. I do not think that there is an easy answer because of the economics of regional aviation. Hopefully, over time we will develop a safer, economic system that will serve country people. Roads are improving. We noticed that some witnesses were prepared to drive longer distances to travel on bigger aircraft than smaller commuter type aircraft.
I commend the report and I commend the chairman on his conscientious work. The committee met a great number of witnesses in all parts of Australia—Kangaroo Island, Flinders Island and remote Australia—in an endeavour at least to get the problem aired before the parliament so that the issues are on the table. The solution to these difficulties is not easy but I am confident that the government will at least look at a number of recommendations. The injection of a relatively small amount of capital would be a great help to regional Australian operators.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services report entitled Report on regional aviation and island transport services: making ends meet. As a committee we made a total of 28 recommendations. I congratulate the chair, the member for Hinkler, on his strong leadership of the committee and on his view, which was shared by the rest of us, that having gone to the trouble of collecting so much evidence from so many parts of Australia without fear or favour we needed to make some bold and brave recommendations. So we have not equivocated and we have not tip-toed around the issues, and that is probably a good thing.
I would like to concentrate on a few key recommendations that I believe are of particular relevance to my electorate of Farrer. The committee, as we have heard, recommended a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance. There is no doubt that, since airports were transferred from federal government to local government ownership, maintaining airports to a safe and adequate standard has been a difficult task for local government, which already is facing a lot of cost pressures and is constantly being asked to do more with fewer resources. It has been a challenge for local government, as the committee heard, particularly in rural and remote communities. 
Many councils gave evidence about how they faced great difficulty in maintaining their local airports. We recommended that assistance be provided for communities with a population of about 30,000 if there is demonstrable evidence of an inability to fund major runway upgrades or terminal extensions. But if the community has a population of fewer than 30,000 and is supporting a regional or hub airport with RPT services, it should receive a 50 per cent subsidy. Still smaller communities supporting an airport with low regular public transport, charter and air ambulance operations should receive a 33 per cent subsidy. Those are broad recommendations; the details can be worked out with departmental committees et cetera later on down the track. But the committee saw that, if we are not careful, equity of access for rural communities will be lacking in future. It is true that state governments regulate airline routes, so it is not possible in every case for competitors to cannibalise an aircraft route and put the existing carrier out of business and possibly go out of business itself. State governments play an important role in licensing aircraft routes, but we saw more federal government responsibility in providing funds to allow airports and the important infrastructure to continue operating. If you have airlines, that is great, but you have to have decent airports for them to fly into.
Another recommendation that we made concerned the taxation arrangements relating to the replacement of small ageing aircraft by the end of 2004. We recommended that the Treasury publicly report the findings of this review by the end of 2004 and introduce provisions, perhaps in the taxation legislation, that assist the owners of small ageing aircraft to replace those aircraft. Currently there is a disincentive, which is highlighted in the A New Tax System: upon selling or disposing of an older aircraft there is no ability to roll over the written-down value into the cost of the new aircraft. Therefore, it makes it a more expensive proposition. Coupled with the fact that many in the travelling public are not willing to fly in 10-seater piston aircraft such as Navajo Chieftains—they will just not get into such an aircraft—and are looking for a turboprop or something a little better, the cost for an airline of purchasing or leasing such an aircraft is prohibitive. We felt that it was a measure that we could address simply and directly through the taxation system.
A series of recommendations that the committee raised concerned the regulator: the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Among pilots and flying interests in Australia, this is a body that people do love to hate. The committee certainly recognised—and I recognise—that it has a difficult role to fulfil because it is a regulator and its primary concern must be safety. But I would like to remind CASA that it also does have a role to educate, to encourage and also perhaps to understand how small businesses operate in today's difficult aviation environment. Another controversial character is Dick Smith, who is somebody that pilots and people in aviation in Australia also may love to hate. But I know that Dick Smith summed up many people's feelings when he told the committee:
When you talk to the people at CASA, they are very well meaning but they are destroying an industry. It is the dream job. They can sit there and, without this pressure of cost, they can dream up safer ways of doing things. 
We heard a lot of evidence. The committee had a very productive roundtable in Adelaide where representatives of flying organisations and small charter pilots met and thrashed out a lot of these issues face to face with representatives from CASA and really put their point in a no holds barred fashion, which was good. I personally would have liked to see that roundtable extended and perhaps to have conducted two or three, but time is always of the essence in these things.
We certainly felt that, even though CASA could sometimes back up their case and demonstrate that they had done the right thing, the perception in the industry was so much the other way that they really do need to address that customer relations issue and the very poor perception that pilots and aviators do have of them, so we made a series of recommendations concerning CASA. One of the things we felt lacking was their timeliness in their responses to people, given that, for example, if you wish to have a particular aircraft added to your aircraft operator certificate, CASA may take several weeks or, in some cases we heard, more like months to actually add the aircraft to your AOC. It does impact very heavily on your ability to run your business. If you are waiting for that aircraft to come online so you can carry passengers so you can pay the bank at the end of the day, you need that to happen sooner rather than later. So CASA need to understand the business imperatives under which small airlines operate.
One of our recommendations was that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority review their training processes to ensure consistency of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's interpretation of the law and regulations and introduce an ongoing program of staff training in regulation interpretation to ensure improved consistency of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's interpretation of the law and regulations, because time after time we heard that you could get different answers from different officers in CASA. You could get visited by a variety of different people in CASA and they could tell you a range of different things. In the words of aircraft operators and owners, `Some of them could make your life easy, and some of them could make your life difficult.' I do not believe there is ever any need for people in any part of the Public Service to make someone's life difficult if there is not a good reason for it. There was lack of consistency amongst staff training in CASA.
We also recommended that CASA regularly assess and record in their annual report the levels of knowledge and competency of their staff in interpreting law and regulations. I would like to add to that. I think, quite frankly, that people in CASA need to spend more time in the air and less time on the ground. I know for a fact that if they travel out to western parts of my electorate to carry out inspections or audits they often drive—they get in a car in Canberra and they drive for several hours. My question is: why on earth aren't they flying? Why aren't they experiencing the effect of their own regulations and their own systems on light aircraft? Again we heard that CASA are not understanding how it is at the small end of the market and that they are tailoring everything towards the larger end of the market.
When it comes to safety you immediately say that there can be no compromise. You look at aircraft accidents and loss of life and you feel that there can be no compromise. I know that Dick Smith had a concept called `affordable safety'. That was criticised by many but, when you think about it, that is what we all practise day to day in our lives as we travel on whatever form of transport we might use. I would say that the safety of travel in an aircraft is directly related to one thing only, and that is the weight of the aircraft. If you are in a hang-glider or an ultralight, you are far less safe than if you are in the new Emirates Airbus A340-500, which has just flown out from Dubai to Australia and is on some demonstration flights at the moment. That is a fact of physics.  
Consumers may want to exercise their choice and fly in a smaller aircraft—a 10-seater piston aircraft or a four-seater single-engine Cessna 182. Because of their remoteness and their locality in the country, some people may feel that that is the appropriate way for them to get around. If larger airlines are not going to visit a person's area and that person wants to avail themselves of the convenience of travelling in a lighter aircraft, they certainly should be able to do that. We cannot take choices away from consumers. We need to be able to give them the option of saying: `We choose to fly in a small airline. We know it is less safe.' This emphasis by CASA to try and make even the small airlines conform to a standard of operating safety that you would normally impose only on a larger airline is simply unrealistic. It is going to drive smaller airlines out of business and it is going to result in loss of access and opportunity to travel for the smaller regional communities, like the communities that I represent. 
But I do congratulate CASA on coming before the committee, on being open and honest with their assessments of themselves and in admitting that they can do better—as we all can. I look forward to a new era under Bruce Byron, who has taken over the reins at CASA. I look forward to a positive ongoing relationship between the new CASA CEO and this committee. I would like to finish by thanking my colleagues on the committee for the hard work that they did. We felt that we worked hard, we were productive and we produced a useful report. We trust that the minister will make good use of it.
Debate (on motion by Mr Brendan O'Connor) adjourned.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Transport and Regional Services Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am very pleased to speak on this motion about the excellent report brought down by the Transport and Regional Services Committee, which is chaired by the member for Hinkler, and I know that the member for Corangamite, who is in the chamber today, was a member of that committee as well. Various aspects of this report certainly have absolute relevance to my electorate of Eden-Monaro, which is why I want to say a few words on it today.
I guess the three airports within my electorate which are most relevant to aspects of this report are Moruya, Merimbula and Cooma airports. Obviously the other major airport that is relevant to Eden-Monaro is Canberra, which services the Queanbeyan region. Quite specifically, the matters taken up in this report are more directed towards those three airports—Moruya, Merimbula and Cooma. Each of those airports is owned by the local council. In the case of Moruya, it is the Eurobodalla Shire; in the case of Cooma, it is the Snowy River Shire; and in the case of Merimbula, it is the Bega Valley Shire. The Moruya and Cooma airports are run by those councils as well. 
In the case of Merimbula, a number of years ago the Bega Valley Shire Council put the operation of the airport out to tender, and it is now privately operated on a lease basis. The people that were involved in taking over that lease a few years ago were Ian and Cathy Baker, along with Ron and Lisa Finneran. They got off to a great start when they took over the airport. They put a lot of money into it and upgraded it substantially. There has been a real change from what was there before. They have been quite innovative as well and were starting to attract various other flights in and out of the region. Merimbula is a great holiday area, obviously, and the airport operations were going very well until the Ansett collapse. Hazelton had been flying in and out of Merimbula and that all got tied up in the collapse of Ansett. Through no fault of their own, all of a sudden they were a business absolutely fighting for their life. We saw flights taken off, flights put on and schedules changed. When you do that, people who regularly use the airport certainly lose confidence in it, and that made it even more difficult. But they managed to hang in there and see those difficult times through. They put forward some proposals to possibly buy some of the aircraft out of the Ansett sale to operate their own service from Merimbula to Sydney and Melbourne. That did not happen, but gradually—and ultimately with the arrival of Rex—we have seen better and better services back into that region. It is just getting back to a stage where it is not running too badly, but it has certainly been difficult.
I want to pay tribute to Ian and Cathy Baker. Ron and Lisa Finneran are still there at times but do not have the same involvement now as they did originally, but certainly Ian and Cathy have been terrific in the way in which they have provided that great service into and out of Merimbula. They will be welcoming this report and a number of aspects of it, as will the Eurobodalla and the Snowy River shires with their airports. In particular they will welcome recommendation 5, which in part says:
The committee recommends a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance as follows:
	...	...	...
	For communities with a population under 30,000, supporting a regional or hub airport with RPT services, to receive a 50 per cent subsidy and;
	Still smaller communities supporting an airport with low RPT, charter and air ambulance to receive a 33 per cent subsidy.
Each of the councils did make submissions to the inquiry. The Snowy River Shire made the comment about the difficulty of maintaining the airport and the cost of it—they subsidise it fairly heavily. They conducted an independent inquiry into the airport and future options and they said:
Should Council continue to incur losses on behalf of the community owned asset, it will consider implementing whatever options are feasible to lessen the financial risk ... and maintenance burden.
Similarly, the Eurobodalla Shire Council said:
This Council currently subsidises the operation and maintenance of the Moruya Airport by approximately $125,000 per year. This does not take account of the need to carry out extensive rehabilitation of the main runway in 20 years time. 
Similarly, with respect to the Bega Valley Shire and Merimbula, the report states:
The major cost of maintenance and upgrade of airport infrastructure is a significant problem for some local councils. Bega Valley Shire, the owner of the Merimbula Airport, claimed that significant capital investment will be needed in the next five to ten years even just to maintain the current airport standards. A move to possible larger aircraft in the medium term will likely necessitate several million dollars of additional capital works for runway improvements, associated apron trafficking areas and increase in the capacity of the airport terminal. The council stated that it can reasonably address the ongoing maintenance issues of its airport asset, yet its funds for major new capital works to support growth in air services are extremely limited.
So the Bega Valley Shire will certainly welcome the committee's recommendations in relation to that assistance in those circumstances.
The other matter that I want to raise is recommendations 20 and 21, as they are quite relevant to my electorate as well. They relate to Commonwealth employees buying airline tickets consistent with `best fare of the day' and `value for money'. This is relevant because Rex planes travel between Sydney and Canberra, as many would know, and this is one of their major routes in terms of volume, but they also operate flights down to Moruya and Merimbula. It is in the interests of regional aviation that an airline like Rex is profitable on those bigger routes, like the Sydney-Canberra one. 
A number of months ago, their share of the ticket sales was absolutely minuscule. Out of the many thousands of seats going in and out of Canberra each week, Rex were only managing to pick up a couple of hundred. Fortunately, after representations to government and instructions from ministers and secretaries to departments, a lot more travel is now occurring on that route—and rightly so, because they offer a very good fare and the quality of service et cetera is equal to or better than the other options. This provides much better competition as a result, with Rex getting a bit more business from the Commonwealth. That will then make those other routes down to Merimbula and Moruya much more viable. 
I understand that Rex finally got over the line and made a profit in October—they had their first month where they actually made a profit—and I think a lot of that was to do with the increase in usage on the route between Sydney and Canberra. I welcome the support the government has been showing, and I am pleased that I have been able to give some assistance to Rex in their pursuit of a better deal. Recommendations 20 and 21 call for some auditing of these aspects to ensure that the Commonwealth gets the best deal and also shares the business. I know Rex will welcome those recommendations.
I have not mentioned Cooma as much because Rex has not been flying into Cooma. Horizon Airlines were flying into there from Sydney, but they have had some difficulties as well. Unfortunately, they went into administration just recently, but ultimately they have been picked up by a Queensland regional airline. We are still maintaining that service, but it is a difficult area because a lot of the volume happens during the winter period obviously when people go down to Cooma and on to the snowfields, but it is good we are maintaining that RPT service through that new airline. Hopefully, with that area growing and the tourism season getting longer and longer—as the summer season becomes much more relevant as well—those planes which fly into and out of Cooma will have better patronage and therefore it will be more viable. So a number of these recommendations will certainly assist the local council which owns and operates the airport.  
I congratulate the committee on a very comprehensive inquiry. It has taken place over a long period of time, but it is very comprehensive when you look at the issues the committee have raised through the report. It is certainly a great step forward. I am sure that the government will consider the recommendations very closely, because the government is a strong supporter of rural and regional Australia. Many of our towns do not have the other public transport connections—I have no rail down the coast in my electorate and there is no rail going into Cooma—and therefore we rely very heavily on roads and RPT flights into those major centres. We want to ensure that they not only remain viable for the future but also grow and provide an even better service for the people in my electorate of Eden-Monaro.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,32,2
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am delighted to participate in this debate, having been a conscientious contributor towards the Report on regional aviation and island transport services: making ends meet. I compliment the secretariat on the comprehensive way in which the report has been put together and I compliment the committee on its recommendations. There are a number of issues, as my colleague the member for Eden-Monaro has mentioned, including local airports and the cost of regional aircraft. It is very difficult for governments to address some of these issues and look after regional communities. I want to make some comments on a few of the issues raised in the report.
I noticed from the overview—and this came out from a number of the witnesses—that government taxes and levies now account for between 25 and 40 per cent of many average airfares. So the government, local councils and state governments are making their contribution to the cost of regional aviation. Members of the committee became aware when they talked to witnesses that one of the fundamental difficulties is the sheer economics of regional aviation, and I would be happy to quote the committee findings because they precisely set out the problems that the committee encountered. The committee found that the key issues affecting regional aviation were costs, returns, service levels, interconnectivity, maintenance of country airports, regulation and coordination. The cost of operating regional airports is high and rising—and a number of witnesses supported that view, so I will talk about that further. Returns to regional operators are often low, and they are declining, because their passenger numbers can be small and variable. Because of the high cost and low returns, the level of service is often poor in terms of the size of the operating aircraft and the frequency and scheduling of services.
There we have, I think, the fundamental problems facing the regional airlines and the sustainability of these regional routes. I was deeply interested in a couple of the witnesses who put the costs in a very graphic manner. Island Airlines Tasmania said that the cost of operating a turboprop aircraft is double that of a piston-engined aircraft and that the economies of scale of a turboprop aircraft are not realised until a seating capacity of 18 is reached. That really demonstrates the problem where regional passengers are keen to have better aircraft—somewhat bigger aircraft—but the cost of those aircraft is considerable and the economies of scale are a problem, no matter what governments do and no matter what subsidies are provided.
Qantas provided some interesting comparisons between a 36-seat aircraft operating on a regional route and a 260-seat aircraft operating on a trunk route. The average passenger in regional Australia draws the obvious comparison when they get to the metropolitan areas and enjoy the bigger aircraft, and I think they are somewhat critical of the smaller aircraft without a full understanding of the costs involved. Qantas said that the crew costs per seat for a 36-seat aircraft are four times greater than for a 260-seat aircraft. So we have that fundamental problem. The maintenance costs per seat for a 36-seat aircraft are more than twice those for a 260-seat aircraft. The aircraft ownership costs for a 36-seat aircraft are more than 50 per cent higher than for a 260-seat aircraft. Landing and en route charges for a 36-seat aircraft are more than 40 per cent higher than for a 260-seat aircraft. We heard a lot of evidence about these landing charges and the difficulties that smaller aircraft encounter at remote airports. 
The costs of running smaller aircraft in regional Australia are quite prohibitive in many cases. Research by the BTRE supports these findings. What they say is interesting: the cost per seat generally declines as the aircraft size increases because the fixed costs are spread among more passengers. I guess that is self-evident and those of us who have been around this industry for some time would know that to be a fact of life, yet a number of the witnesses and people associated with regional aviation really do not comprehend that difficulty. They want to get the service and they want to have it early in the morning and late in the afternoon, but they do not have an understanding of the costs involved. The cost per kilometre flown declines as the stage length increases, and propeller aircraft are cheaper to operate over shorter distances than jets. Again, that is self-evident: the bigger jets, once they are airborne, can cover the comparatively short hauls—in international terms—between Melbourne and Sydney. 
So, obviously, the regional aircraft have a problem in making a return on capital. All aircraft are relatively expensive to operate over distances of up to 200 kilometres, but the cost per passenger declines as the percentage of seats filled on the aircraft increases. Again, it was made clear in the evidence that a number of the regional operators were not able to fill their aircraft and this encroached upon their costs. That was the fundamental argument that I picked up from hearing witnesses all around Australia. On the one hand, the business operators at Flinders Island, for instance, were concerned that they lacked an air service; on the other hand, the airline operators we spoke to were unable to make a dollar out of the operation. I think there had been a number of participants on that particular route who had gone broke over the years.
I would like to refer to the ALOP scheme—the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan, which was instituted by the Hawke government in 1989. I have been around these arguments for some years, and in the broad sense I would say of this plan what Mr Ken Keech, the Chief Executive Officer of the AAA, said:
I have been on record saying for quite some time that my personal view is that the ALOP scheme was the greatest con job of all time.
Basically, he was saying that the government of the day decided to relinquish their responsibility for running local airports. They made capital moneys available and I do not think local councils around Australia fully understood the impact of this offer or that over time they would have difficulty in maintaining their airport, putting down new strips and getting sufficient income from the airports. As a result, the returns for local councils, especially from the smaller airports, were not commensurate with the actual running costs, let alone the replacement of their capital assets. It is interesting that the AAA represents over 255 airports across Australia and, of these 255 airports, approximately 220 are located in regional and rural Australia and are owned and operated by the local community through their local government shire or council. 
We had a number of comments about some of them being effective. Glenelg Shire, near Mount Gambier, is able to operate its airport effectively, although it requires a capital injection to upgrade the airport for modern aircraft. I note that in terms of firefighting, visits by VIPs and natural disasters these airports could play a crucial role, and it would be my judgment that the Commonwealth should support some of the smaller airports as a community service obligation, particularly in times of emergency. I strongly support the recommendation of the committee that the Commonwealth look carefully at the contribution of capital moneys to the smaller airports to keep them upgraded and operational and ensure they are servicing Australia. In my view, aviation is a Commonwealth responsibility. It is portrayed in that way in every other aspect and the Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure that regional Australia is well served by the smaller airports that really have difficulty in paying their way.
If we look at the other policy issue of taxes, I said in my opening remarks that it is interesting that if you add up the taxes involved, especially in terms of some of these smaller airports, the Commonwealth imposed costs are as follows: Airservices' costs are about 4.3 per cent; airport landing and terminal charges are about 6.2 per cent; GST is nine per cent; the noise levy is about $3.60 as it applies to Sydney and Adelaide airports; and the terrorism insurance levy ranges from $2.50 to $10. These costs are add-ons to the cost of regional air tickets with the additional problems of economies of scale that the airlines face. In addition to these significant issues, the committee found that costs imposed at a local level that added to the cost of a ticket included passenger head taxes, landing charges and ground support charges.
We have an interesting situation where, on one hand, the government are not contributing to the operation of these regional airports while, on the other hand, they are very happy to take a number of charges as their due right. We have a real policy dilemma: if the Commonwealth government have responsibility for aviation, they should be making a contribution back to its operation.
Finally, I want to comment on the safety authority. That issue was a matter of considerable debate within the committee and was raised by a number of the witnesses, who complained quite fiercely on occasions about the operation of CASA. I participated in the Plane Safe inquiry and I have heard the arguments from both sides of the table. I have heard the defending argument from CASA, which has the responsibility to maintain a safe air system. I have also heard from some of the smaller operators, who complained that CASA was unduly officious in handling the air safety regulations. I well recall two years of discussions with CASA personnel and a number of witnesses on the Plane Safe inquiry and I saw a bit of a replay of those debates in this particular inquiry.
Suffice it to say that the bigger airline operators such as Qantas and formerly Ansett conduct their operations safely, in my view, although Ansett obviously had some difficulties with CASA because of its financial problems. Qantas is quoted as saying that it has a good relationship with CASA. However, as I have indicated to parliament, it is the smaller operators who are under financial pressure who have problems in maintaining their safety regimes. I suggest that we need to ensure that CASA provides a lead in the development of a safety culture in the smaller regional transport operators. Ensuring that the culture is one of safety is not one of the policeman's roles. We should encourage both sides of the debate to move along that path instead of pursuing the argument that CASA will implement a system of very tight regulation—and I noticed the demerit points approach outlined by the minister in the new set of CASA regulations, which is a step in the right direction. 
I want to quote the Regional Aviation Association of Australia on this issue. The association has stated:
I believe there are better opportunities for CASA to become more interactive with the operators at the lower level, rather than being the policeman. I think they should be looking to move in with a lot of these operators—almost have their local man on the ground and take them by the hand and lead them through the safe culture that they need and that this country will need at the end of the day.
That interesting quotation summarises my view that a culture of safety is the way to go to encourage people, especially at the smaller regional level, to make sure that their planes are safe, that they operate safely and that their spare parts are up to standard. People in this parliament and members at the local level suffer considerably when there are aircraft accidents such as the Seaview accident in South Australia. In such circumstances, CASA comes under considerable political pressure for not executing their task.
I commend the report and the recommendations. I commend the depth of the submissions on a very difficult issue in respect of which people have very strong emotional reactions to a lack of services. If you look at the number of services that have been taken from regional Australia by the sheer pressure of the economics, one must be concerned about the future of regional aviation. I do not think that there is an easy answer because of the economics of regional aviation. Hopefully, over time we will develop a safer, economic system that will serve country people. Roads are improving. We noticed that some witnesses were prepared to drive longer distances to travel on bigger aircraft than smaller commuter type aircraft.
I commend the report and I commend the chairman on his conscientious work. The committee met a great number of witnesses in all parts of Australia—Kangaroo Island, Flinders Island and remote Australia—in an endeavour at least to get the problem aired before the parliament so that the issues are on the table. The solution to these difficulties is not easy but I am confident that the government will at least look at a number of recommendations. The injection of a relatively small amount of capital would be a great help to regional Australian operators. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,32,2
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services report entitled Report on regional aviation and island transport services: making ends meet. As a committee we made a total of 28 recommendations. I congratulate the chair, the member for Hinkler, on his strong leadership of the committee and on his view, which was shared by the rest of us, that having gone to the trouble of collecting so much evidence from so many parts of Australia without fear or favour we needed to make some bold and brave recommendations. So we have not equivocated and we have not tip-toed around the issues, and that is probably a good thing.
I would like to concentrate on a few key recommendations that I believe are of particular relevance to my electorate of Farrer. The committee, as we have heard, recommended a new airport ownership subsidy scheme covering capital works and essential maintenance. There is no doubt that, since airports were transferred from federal government to local government ownership, maintaining airports to a safe and adequate standard has been a difficult task for local government, which already is facing a lot of cost pressures and is constantly being asked to do more with fewer resources. It has been a challenge for local government, as the committee heard, particularly in rural and remote communities. 
Many councils gave evidence about how they faced great difficulty in maintaining their local airports. We recommended that assistance be provided for communities with a population of about 30,000 if there is demonstrable evidence of an inability to fund major runway upgrades or terminal extensions. But if the community has a population of fewer than 30,000 and is supporting a regional or hub airport with RPT services, it should receive a 50 per cent subsidy. Still smaller communities supporting an airport with low regular public transport, charter and air ambulance operations should receive a 33 per cent subsidy. Those are broad recommendations; the details can be worked out with departmental committees et cetera later on down the track. But the committee saw that, if we are not careful, equity of access for rural communities will be lacking in future. It is true that state governments regulate airline routes, so it is not possible in every case for competitors to cannibalise an aircraft route and put the existing carrier out of business and possibly go out of business itself. State governments play an important role in licensing aircraft routes, but we saw more federal government responsibility in providing funds to allow airports and the important infrastructure to continue operating. If you have airlines, that is great, but you have to have decent airports for them to fly into.
Another recommendation that we made concerned the taxation arrangements relating to the replacement of small ageing aircraft by the end of 2004. We recommended that the Treasury publicly report the findings of this review by the end of 2004 and introduce provisions, perhaps in the taxation legislation, that assist the owners of small ageing aircraft to replace those aircraft. Currently there is a disincentive, which is highlighted in the A New Tax System: upon selling or disposing of an older aircraft there is no ability to roll over the written-down value into the cost of the new aircraft. Therefore, it makes it a more expensive proposition. Coupled with the fact that many in the travelling public are not willing to fly in 10-seater piston aircraft such as Navajo Chieftains—they will just not get into such an aircraft—and are looking for a turboprop or something a little better, the cost for an airline of purchasing or leasing such an aircraft is prohibitive. We felt that it was a measure that we could address simply and directly through the taxation system.
A series of recommendations that the committee raised concerned the regulator: the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Among pilots and flying interests in Australia, this is a body that people do love to hate. The committee certainly recognised—and I recognise—that it has a difficult role to fulfil because it is a regulator and its primary concern must be safety. But I would like to remind CASA that it also does have a role to educate, to encourage and also perhaps to understand how small businesses operate in today's difficult aviation environment. Another controversial character is Dick Smith, who is somebody that pilots and people in aviation in Australia also may love to hate. But I know that Dick Smith summed up many people's feelings when he told the committee:
When you talk to the people at CASA, they are very well meaning but they are destroying an industry. It is the dream job. They can sit there and, without this pressure of cost, they can dream up safer ways of doing things. 
We heard a lot of evidence. The committee had a very productive roundtable in Adelaide where representatives of flying organisations and small charter pilots met and thrashed out a lot of these issues face to face with representatives from CASA and really put their point in a no holds barred fashion, which was good. I personally would have liked to see that roundtable extended and perhaps to have conducted two or three, but time is always of the essence in these things.
We certainly felt that, even though CASA could sometimes back up their case and demonstrate that they had done the right thing, the perception in the industry was so much the other way that they really do need to address that customer relations issue and the very poor perception that pilots and aviators do have of them, so we made a series of recommendations concerning CASA. One of the things we felt lacking was their timeliness in their responses to people, given that, for example, if you wish to have a particular aircraft added to your aircraft operator certificate, CASA may take several weeks or, in some cases we heard, more like months to actually add the aircraft to your AOC. It does impact very heavily on your ability to run your business. If you are waiting for that aircraft to come online so you can carry passengers so you can pay the bank at the end of the day, you need that to happen sooner rather than later. So CASA need to understand the business imperatives under which small airlines operate.
One of our recommendations was that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority review their training processes to ensure consistency of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's interpretation of the law and regulations and introduce an ongoing program of staff training in regulation interpretation to ensure improved consistency of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's interpretation of the law and regulations, because time after time we heard that you could get different answers from different officers in CASA. You could get visited by a variety of different people in CASA and they could tell you a range of different things. In the words of aircraft operators and owners, `Some of them could make your life easy, and some of them could make your life difficult.' I do not believe there is ever any need for people in any part of the Public Service to make someone's life difficult if there is not a good reason for it. There was lack of consistency amongst staff training in CASA.
We also recommended that CASA regularly assess and record in their annual report the levels of knowledge and competency of their staff in interpreting law and regulations. I would like to add to that. I think, quite frankly, that people in CASA need to spend more time in the air and less time on the ground. I know for a fact that if they travel out to western parts of my electorate to carry out inspections or audits they often drive—they get in a car in Canberra and they drive for several hours. My question is: why on earth aren't they flying? Why aren't they experiencing the effect of their own regulations and their own systems on light aircraft? Again we heard that CASA are not understanding how it is at the small end of the market and that they are tailoring everything towards the larger end of the market.
When it comes to safety you immediately say that there can be no compromise. You look at aircraft accidents and loss of life and you feel that there can be no compromise. I know that Dick Smith had a concept called `affordable safety'. That was criticised by many but, when you think about it, that is what we all practise day to day in our lives as we travel on whatever form of transport we might use. I would say that the safety of travel in an aircraft is directly related to one thing only, and that is the weight of the aircraft. If you are in a hang-glider or an ultralight, you are far less safe than if you are in the new Emirates Airbus A340-500, which has just flown out from Dubai to Australia and is on some demonstration flights at the moment. That is a fact of physics.  
Consumers may want to exercise their choice and fly in a smaller aircraft—a 10-seater piston aircraft or a four-seater single-engine Cessna 182. Because of their remoteness and their locality in the country, some people may feel that that is the appropriate way for them to get around. If larger airlines are not going to visit a person's area and that person wants to avail themselves of the convenience of travelling in a lighter aircraft, they certainly should be able to do that. We cannot take choices away from consumers. We need to be able to give them the option of saying: `We choose to fly in a small airline. We know it is less safe.' This emphasis by CASA to try and make even the small airlines conform to a standard of operating safety that you would normally impose only on a larger airline is simply unrealistic. It is going to drive smaller airlines out of business and it is going to result in loss of access and opportunity to travel for the smaller regional communities, like the communities that I represent. 
But I do congratulate CASA on coming before the committee, on being open and honest with their assessments of themselves and in admitting that they can do better—as we all can. I look forward to a new era under Bruce Byron, who has taken over the reins at CASA. I look forward to a positive ongoing relationship between the new CASA CEO and this committee. I would like to finish by thanking my colleagues on the committee for the hard work that they did. We felt that we worked hard, we were productive and we produced a useful report. We trust that the minister will make good use of it.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—When the debate was adjourned on Monday, I had been speaking about the housing market and housing stress. Yesterday the Reserve Bank board had a meeting, and this morning at 9.30 there was another shift in monetary policy—this time an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points. So I think it is timely to take this opportunity to consider the few points that the governor raised in his statement on monetary policy this morning and his reasons for that change in policy.
The first point that he cited was economic conditions around the world. As I said on Monday, in the middle of the year there was a substantial risk that the world economy would turn down. Events since then have given some cause for optimism—in fact enough cause for optimism last month for the governor to raise rates by a quarter of a per cent. This morning he said:
Stronger conditions have been evident in Japan, China and other parts of east Asia, and also, to a lesser extent, in Europe.
He also said: 
... there is increasing evidence that the US recovery is becoming more broadly based. 
So our major trading partners' economic performance is stronger and that is going to have a significant bearing on us. The governor says:
As a result of these trends the international climate, though still not without risks, is more favourable than has been the case for some time. 
That is indeed reassuring. The governor is also optimistic about the state of the domestic economy, which he believes has strengthened considerably since mid-year. He notes:
The pace of consumer spending has accelerated sharply, business confidence is high, and the labour market has firmed over recent months.
The difficult point has been the appreciation of the exchange rate, but he notes:
... the stronger international climate, rising commodity prices and more favourable conditions in the farm sector indicate improving export prospects. Hence, notwithstanding some early signs of a change in sentiment in the housing market, the overall prospects are for strong growth of the Australian economy.
So we are seeing a continuation and probably a strengthening of sentiment, at least at the bank, that the signals are less ambiguous than they were at the beginning of the year.
The governor obviously now feels that it is time to move on with the process that he began last month of raising rates to bring monetary policy back to more normal and more neutral settings. He notes that the inflation rate is close to the target midpoint of between two and three per cent underlying inflation. Domestic sourced inflationary pressures have risen. The overall inflation rate, however, is being held down by the higher exchange rate. He says that in the short term the exchange rate effects are likely to reduce inflation further, but, as with all Reserve Bank governors, he is a little equitable and says:
... inflation is expected to be on a rising trajectory given the strength of domestic demand, firming labour market conditions and continuing strong price pressures in the non-tradeables sector of the economy.
So he is also moving pre-emptively against further inflationary pressures. I suppose the bad point for home buyers and the farm sector is that he notes:
Monetary policy is continuing to have a stimulatory effect on the economy through domestic credit expansion. The growth of credit remains rapid and indeed has picked up further in the past few months. The prevailing level of the cash rate after the November increase was still below neutral, and interest rates of financial intermediaries remained low by the standards of recent years.
Mr Macfarlane is saying that the settings are still below neutral, which implies that there may be further movement in the not too distant future to get them back to what he describes as more neutral settings. The final sentence of the governor's media release confirms that. It says:
In these circumstances the Board took the view that a further increase in the cash rate was warranted in order to reduce the degree of stimulus to the economy from monetary policy.
It seems evident from all of this that the bank still believes that the stance on monetary policy is expansionary. The outlook, particularly internationally, has strengthened over the course of the last six months and there seems every indication that the interest rate increase that we have seen today will not in fact be the last. We are now at 5.25 per cent. When the governor began talking about the stance of monetary policy being expansionary, he gave general indications that were interpreted to mean that a more neutral position was 5½ per cent. We are certainly not there yet, but there is every hint in this press release that there will be further movement and further tightening of policy in the not too distant future.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I would like to continue my remarks on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Review of the Reserve Bank Annual Report 2002. Following on the comments by the member for Kingston, I also would like to start by talking about the fact that the Reserve Bank has increased interest rates by another quarter of a per cent today. One aspect of that does concern me considerably. As is pointed out in the statement by the governor:
While the exchange rate has appreciated, the stronger international climate, rising commodity prices and more favourable conditions in the farm sector indicate improving export prospects.
What concerns me is that the impact of this is also pushing the Australian dollar up. In fact, if you look at page 22 of the report you will see that there is a chart on the exchange rate that shows that for most of 2002 the exchange rate with the US dollar was around the 50c mark or in the low 50s. That was at a time when the farming sector was going through one of the worst droughts on record. There has been no suggestion that the farming sector has really recovered from that drought; it will take years. We now see the Australian dollar well over the 70c mark—it is probably 72c or 73c now—which, if you look at it, is a dramatic movement over a relatively short period of time. From the end of 2002 until the end of this year, we have seen the dollar go up by over 40 per cent.
By any measure that is going to have a major impact on exports. I fear that the recovery that the farm sector has been looking for is going to be very much blunted by this push up of the Australian dollar. Notwithstanding the points made by the member for Kingston, the fact is that our interest rates are still considerably higher than those of some of our trading partners, including the United States. The impact of the dollar going up is going to make it very difficult for a lot of exporters, particularly farmers, to recover, given the very tough times they have had in the previous year with the drought.
I quickly want to move on to a couple of other points. In our report—which I commend to all honourable members: it has some very good information not just on monetary policy but also on some of the other areas that the Reserve Bank has direct or indirect responsibility for—we talk about bank fees. This is an area on which the bank is going to have to do quite a considerable amount of work. In chapter 3, we talked about the growth in fees. We summarised the findings of a Reserve Bank survey. The last finding said:
	the increase in banks' fee income has offset only a small part of the reduction in banks' interest rate margins over the past decade.
Notwithstanding that point, our report found:
... fees charged to households have increased from $1.2 billion in 1997 to $2.7 billion in 2002.
In other words, in five years they have more than doubled.
Householders are being hit with a fairly large amount of extra fees from the banks, though, as is pointed out, the usage of these services from the banks has increased quite a lot too. But one would think that, as the usage increases, the banks should be able to reduce those fees, because they are increasing their income anyway. As the committee pointed out in the report, analysis by BIS Shrapnel suggests that fee rises together with increases in loyalty points needed to redeem rewards have led to increases in the cost of holding a credit card of between 35 and 75 per cent. While the banks have offset what they see as their declining revenue from interest rate margins, the consumer who is using the credit card is filling that gap for the banks. I do believe that the Reserve and others are going to have to continue to look at that, and we will be raising that too. 
It is timely that we tabled this report this week, because on Monday next week the committee has its next hearing with the Reserve Bank in Brisbane. Today's interest rate rise will cause considerable interest in that hearing, but to expand a little on the question of fees we also look at the whole question of interchange fees for BPay. We are concerned by the apparent high level of BPay interchange fees, and we are of the view that the Reserve should undertake an immediate review, with the objective of ensuring that BPay interchange fees are reduced to a reasonable level. We also look at the whole question of automatic teller machine interchange fees, and we will certainly be waiting to see what work the bank has done on that, because they were still working on that.
On the question of credit card reform, notwithstanding the reduction in interchange fees for some credit cards it is clear that others that are now being promoted because they can offer more generous loyalty rewards are in many cases doing so at the expense of merchants. What in fact is happening is that somebody using these credit cards may get additional loyalty points, but the merchant finds that the fee charged to the retailer—or whoever the merchant is—is higher. That is how these particular companies can offer higher loyalty rewards. The end result is that, if the merchant is going to be charged a higher fee for using that card, it is almost inevitable that the consumer is going to pick up the tab somehow. The questions we have been raising with the Reserve Bank on these issues over several hearings now I think have not been fully answered. If those loyalty rewards are going to one set of customers, someone else must be paying. The whole question is: are consumers generally paying for these rewards? So we do think that a proper inquiry into the whole payment system is probably overdue.
I conclude my remarks there and again just reinforce the point that I want to thank all members of the committee for the work that they have put into this. A considerable amount of time and effort goes into these hearings and reports. I believe we produce reports containing a lot of very good information. I would particularly like to thank the deputy chair, the member for Chisholm, and the secretariat, particularly Russell Chafer, the committee secretary, who has put a tremendous amount of work into it.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I too welcome the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2002. The actual report that has been tabled is a culmination of two hearings: one in sunny Warrnambool, where we got to enjoy the delights of the member for Hawker's electorate, and one in Melbourne. An enormous amount of effort actually goes into these hearings—by the members of the committee, by the people who support us and by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and his staff. They take these hearings very seriously. It is a phenomenally open process. Over the five years now that I have been involved, we have seen the Governor of the Reserve Bank becoming more and more open in his statements and comments and more willing to engage in conversation and debate. Sometimes we feel a little frustrated that we are not getting all the answers we would like, but I think over time we have certainly seen a greater level of engagement in and acceptance of this process of exploration. 
At the outset, I want to say a particular thanks to David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library, who does a huge amount of work in preparing us for these inquiries and giving us background information and questions. We will be honest: as busy parliamentarians, sometimes our preparation work for these things is not as good as we would like. We try hard, but the library offers us a phenomenal service. Due to David's support in particular, we will again quiz the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Brisbane on Monday, and I know David is busy preparing information for us at this time.
This will be a phenomenally interesting hearing, given that between June and now we have seen two interest rate rises, as reported by both the speakers before me in this debate. Thesecond edition of the Age today states:
The rise, the second in two months, will take the official cash rate to 5.25 per cent, its highest level in more than two-and-a-half years.
If passed on in full by lenders, standard mortgage rates will rise to just over seven per cent, adding $30 to monthly repayments on the average $189,100 home loan.
So we have seen a phenomenal turnaround in the last two months from where we were in June, when we were quizzing the governor extensively about where rates would go, about his concern regarding the boom in the housing market, particularly in the investment market, and about whether the Reserve Bank needed greater powers to curb investment in the property market, particularly where individuals are borrowing against their existing home to purchase an investment property. We asked what sort of pressure this will put on, particularly if interest rates rise. Now we have seen interest rate rises, so it will be interesting to see how people who have geared themselves beyond their capacity will be able to make their loan repayments.
A lot of the inquiries in the last two reports were about whether home owners have over-borrowed; whether they could actually meet the rate rises that would inevitably come, and now we have seen them come. It will be interesting in the next couple of months to see if families are able to meet their mortgage repayments. I certainly do not want to predict something bad, but we have seen this sort of cycle before—in the late eighties, where there had been low interest rates and then they went up when there had been an expansion in the market. So we could be in for some interesting times.
The governor was fairly open in Warrnambool about wanting to return to what he deemed as the normal rate, which was an interesting and very open remark from the Governor of the Reserve Bank. When we talk to him on Monday, it will be interesting to hear whether he has got to where he believes a more neutral setting is. The report covers many interesting areas of our inquiry before the governor—not just about monetary policy and interest rates, but the impact upon the whole economy.
I would also like to thank Russell Chafer, who conveniently is in the House at the moment, for all his work in putting this report together. Being secretary to two committees is a fair effort, so I would like to thank him for all his work to get this report together in such a timely manner, given the committee tabled a rather large report only last week as well.
The committee looked at the housing sector, which I would like to comment on in the last few minutes I have got. One of our concerns was this boom in the housing sector, with the growth in the investment market and the growth in speculation. In recent days, we have seen the property investor Henry Kaye go under. We did quiz the governor back in June about whether there needed to be greater powers through ASIC or APRA to ensure that property speculation could be curtailed and that there could be regulation of it. I think the governor was fairly forthcoming. We have quoted him in the report, and I would like to put that on the record. He stated: 
... where people come along and get told how to get rich quickly by using the equity in their existing home to gear up and buy a couple more apartments. ASIC would love to stop that. The problem is they cannot demonstrate that these people are in fact financial advisers. If they were, they would have control over them. But the people who run the investment seminars say, `No, we're not. We are humble real estate agents and we're not subject to your laws—we're subject to state laws.'
... I think there is a regulatory gap there. It is clearly a problem if there is one group of people who are holding seminars on how to invest your money who are regulated—the financial planners—and there is another group who are doing almost exactly the same thing, although doing it within the one asset class, which is property, who are unregulated. So I think there is a need to extend the capacity for ASIC to do that.
So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is clearly on the record as stating that ASIC should be given extra powers to cover these people, because really they are offering financial advice, not property advice alone. There is a bit of interplay between state and federal jurisdictions, but I think this could be easily worked out and I believe the states would be willing to participate in that discussion. Indeed, the state of Queensland has written to the Treasurer asking for that to take place. So we will again be quizzing the Governor of the Reserve Bank on that on Monday, given that Henry Kaye has just gone under and taken with him a whole lot of small property investors who will now lose not only their investment properties but maybe their own homes, which may be needed to finance the mortgages they have taken out. We do need to see regulation in this area. These are some of the concerns that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has been raising now for many months.
We also asked him in June whether he thought there was a financial tool other than interest rates available to contain the housing sector. Again Macfarlane was fairly open. I would like to quote him: 
We have another financial tool. It is called open-mouth policy, and I have been using it, but it may not be as effective as other tools you could conceive of. I am not putting in a plug for another instrument, although if in the longer run things turned out badly it would not surprise me if people started looking at other arms of policy—for example, tax policy. We have a tax regime in Australia which, compared to a number of other countries, is very favourable to property speculation. I am not saying `Change it', but I would not rule out the possibility that if things do turn out badly there may be a public desire to make some changes.
Again, the Governor of the Reserve Bank is recognising there are problems with this area and that greater regulation is needed. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been using his open-mouth policy for some time. Some people, particularly in the real estate market, have been critical of that, but I think that his efforts have stemmed investment, particularly in the apartment market in Melbourne, and we will hopefully avoid the boom and bust cycle in the investment area.
I would also like to put on the record our concern about fees. If you look at the recent annual reports by all the major banks, it is quite startling to see the massive rise in profits generated by fees. They are actually outstripping interest rates at the moment as the biggest section of profits for banks. We need more regulation in this area. Again, I believe it is incumbent upon the Treasurer to provide to the ACCC a reference so that we can actually regulate the fees and charges and do more than just monitor them. Monitoring fees has not stopped the banks slugging everyone in this room and all our constituents with massive fees and charges. You get to the stage of wondering when their profits are enough. How much more money do these corporations need to generate? 
One of the interesting areas that we have not seen a lot of discussion of—although we will in the future—is credit card fraud. There are areas of credit card fraud that are now coming to light that are very concerning, and I think we will see the sector looking more intently at this in the future. It is a worry. It is a worry when we go into the Christmas period and people are using their credit cards extensively. Credit card interest rates are also worrying. That is another area that is highly unregulated. We have seen massive increases in credit card interest rates that have had no boundaries and have no basis in the actual interest rate set by the Reserve Bank.
I highly recommend the report to the House and recommend that all people read it. It is a very concise document. I think it distils a very complex area of monetary policy and explains the economy really well. It provides people with a very good insight into how the Australian economy is travelling. I would like to thank all the other members of the committee for their time at the inquiries—and for their enthusiasm—and we look forward to Monday's inquiry.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,33,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—On its face the year in question, 2002-03, looked to be an unremarkable year from the Reserve Bank's point of view. Interest rates remained steady; the exchange rate did rise, by something like 20 per cent over the year; shares fell; property rose; APRA got kicked in the backside as a result of the HIH inquiry; and credit card schemes were made more competitive. The Reserve Bank did start some new operations called continuous linked settlement systems, which the chairman of our committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, has already described. But, when one looks a little bit beneath the surface, one sees that in fact in the fiscal year just past there were two factors that were in some senses quite remarkable and the response of the Reserve Bank perhaps needs some closer examination than it has sometimes been given in the past.
The first is the fact that interest rates did remain steady throughout the period. The bank has been criticised to some extent by some, and I do not accept this criticism, for having been asleep at the wheel during the whole period. It may be that some other criticisms are appropriate but, when one looks at the facts relating to interest rates, it is interesting to observe that on 5 June 2002 the rates increased to 4.75 per cent and they remained at that level throughout the period. The first adjustment was not until November 2003, when they went up 0.25 per cent, and today they went up again, by another 0.25 per cent. The unusual aspect of that regime is this: whilst Australia's rates remained steady throughout the period, the world economy was sluggish, to say the least. Interest rates in Europe fell to about 2.25 per cent, and have even gone lower since, and rates in the United States fell to about 1.75 per cent. So there was clearly either a sense of confidence about the direction of the Australian economy or a rejection of policy settings in the European and American context by those in the Reserve Bank taking the decisions. On the other hand, at the same time, the Australian exchange rate rose significantly. I will come to that point in a minute. 
As far as growth is concerned, the prediction as at the meeting of our committee in May 2002—which was the meeting immediately before I became a member of the committee—was for growth of about four per cent; I think it was about 3.75 to four per cent. That was adjusted at the very interesting meeting in Warrnambool in our chairman's electorate, for which I commend him and the arrangements that he made.
—A very good electorate!
—Yes, it is a beautiful part of Western Victoria that I had never been to before, and I learnt a lot about regional Victoria on that visit. The interesting thing was that the Governor of the Reserve Bank suggested that the growth prediction had fallen to 3.75 per cent, and then in the June meeting in Melbourne it was reduced again to three per cent. In fact, growth over the period was 2.75 per cent by way of an average, although in terms of the Australian performance compared with the rest of the world—the other OECD countries—that was surprisingly good.
One of the other factors which have to be considered by the bank in relation to interest rate policy is inflation, which is an important indicator—and indeed the bank has its underlying inflation target set at two to three per cent. The estimate was that the underlying inflation rate was about three per cent throughout the period, so it certainly fell within the parameters that the adjusters were looking for. Unemployment is said to have been another factor, although the Governor of the Reserve Bank did explain, in some of his evidence, that unemployment issues are really caught up in growth issues and that, as long as there is sustained economic growth, it is likely that the maintenance of full employment, which is a target of the bank, will be appropriately addressed.
That brings us to the second extraordinary aspect of events throughout the relevant fiscal year, the exchange rate. In the period from the last quarter of 2001 through to the end of the current quarter, there has been about a 40 per cent increase in exchange rates, and over the relevant period a 20 per cent rise. That is an extraordinary rise. It has had some very negative impacts upon the economy. For example, wool producers in Australia are now finding it particularly difficult to sell their wool into the international market because of the increasing prices of that commodity—a commodity which is fundamentally important to Australia. Similarly, that is the case with other basic commodity prices.
The impact of the exchange rate ought not to be ignored, I would suggest, by those who set interest rate parameters in making their decisions. The impact of the rising exchange rate is obvious: it means that goods are going to be harder to sell overseas but, more importantly, goods in Australia are going to be more costly. It cannot be said that Australians are not going to buy, in a reasonably robust economy, such as we have at the moment, simply because imported goods are less expensive. It seems to me that, in adjusting interest rates, the fact that exchange rates increase adversely for the Australian dollar is a factor that needs to be taken into account in setting those parameters. It is not entirely clear to me that that is the case.
Indeed, it might be thought—and I am saying this with the utmost respect—the recent interest rate increases suggest that the bank has been a little trigger-happy. It is true that there is plenty of evidence that the property market in Australia has been overheating, but it is not absolutely true to suggest that it is getting worse. Indeed, recent indications, anecdotally and otherwise, from the property market are that the construction boom is coming to an end. There is evidence, particularly in relation to apartment building and medium to high density housing, that in fact it may be even worse than that and we may be entering into a period of complete slowdown. That will possibly give rise to panic in some sectors of the market, and that is just what we do not want. I think that there has been an overreaction to the events inside the property market, and I would like to see from those who adjust interest rates a greater confidence in the future of the Australian economy. It will be interesting—to me, at least—to hear those who have their hands on the levers respond to those concerns when the committee meets on Monday with the Reserve Bank. 
One of the other aspects of this issue that I want to deal with very briefly is the impact of the budget. The recent budget, as has been the case throughout the period of this coalition government, is another responsible budget. It has ensured that monetary policy has not suffered any pressure from government fiscal decisions. In fact, if anything it has been of very significant benefit to the proper settings of the economy, for which the bank is responsible. 
The only other matter I want to discuss that arises from this report relates to issues of governance. As I mentioned, as a result of the HIH inquiry there have been a number of recommendations that have been acted upon. APRA has been restructured. Let us hope that that works. There are issues now about the appropriate conduct of auditors in relation to public companies. I think we should monitor that very carefully indeed. CLERP 9 is an important reform, but I think we need to go further on these issues. There needs to be more disclosure legislation in relation to what some people are doing in respect of economy activity. We need to know more about what is happening with these secret Swiss bank accounts. I think we need to look at an amnesty proposal, such as the German and Italian governments have recently considered, to ensure that money that is floating around outside this country illegally is brought back to this country, accounted for and properly taxed. We need to put ourselves on a proper footing in relation to moneys coming in and out of the country. I also think that we need to look seriously at proper disclosure laws in relation to dealings on the share register. We need to ensure that, for public companies in particular, there is complete disclosure of the title and ownership of shares so that we are not left guessing, as has been the case in relation to the recent Offset Alpine Printing imbroglio.
Those issues need examination. Another issue that needs examination is the high cost of fund management fees. Fund management fees in particular funds currently amount to something like 2½ per cent of the capital invested. It is not clear to me why those rates are set by reference to the capital fund. Why is $5,000 an appropriate reward in respect of a $200,000 investment in a superannuation or other managed fund, without any guarantee of a return to the superannuants or to others who have invested in those managed funds? Let us look at more competition in this area of the economy. Let us ensure that those who operate the super funds and the managed funds give the best return they can to those who invest, to ensure continued confidence in the financial side of the economy.
I commend the chairman for his governance of this very important committee. I commend the report and the staff who prepared it. I also commend the Reserve Bank itself and its staff for a good year, but one in which there have been a couple of question marks including those I have raised today I hope in the interests of a continuing prosperous economy.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—When the debate was adjourned on Monday, I had been speaking about the housing market and housing stress. Yesterday the Reserve Bank board had a meeting, and this morning at 9.30 there was another shift in monetary policy—this time an increase in the cash rate of 25 basis points. So I think it is timely to take this opportunity to consider the few points that the governor raised in his statement on monetary policy this morning and his reasons for that change in policy.
The first point that he cited was economic conditions around the world. As I said on Monday, in the middle of the year there was a substantial risk that the world economy would turn down. Events since then have given some cause for optimism—in fact enough cause for optimism last month for the governor to raise rates by a quarter of a per cent. This morning he said:
Stronger conditions have been evident in Japan, China and other parts of east Asia, and also, to a lesser extent, in Europe.
He also said: 
... there is increasing evidence that the US recovery is becoming more broadly based. 
So our major trading partners' economic performance is stronger and that is going to have a significant bearing on us. The governor says:
As a result of these trends the international climate, though still not without risks, is more favourable than has been the case for some time. 
That is indeed reassuring. The governor is also optimistic about the state of the domestic economy, which he believes has strengthened considerably since mid-year. He notes:
The pace of consumer spending has accelerated sharply, business confidence is high, and the labour market has firmed over recent months.
The difficult point has been the appreciation of the exchange rate, but he notes:
... the stronger international climate, rising commodity prices and more favourable conditions in the farm sector indicate improving export prospects. Hence, notwithstanding some early signs of a change in sentiment in the housing market, the overall prospects are for strong growth of the Australian economy.
So we are seeing a continuation and probably a strengthening of sentiment, at least at the bank, that the signals are less ambiguous than they were at the beginning of the year.
The governor obviously now feels that it is time to move on with the process that he began last month of raising rates to bring monetary policy back to more normal and more neutral settings. He notes that the inflation rate is close to the target midpoint of between two and three per cent underlying inflation. Domestic sourced inflationary pressures have risen. The overall inflation rate, however, is being held down by the higher exchange rate. He says that in the short term the exchange rate effects are likely to reduce inflation further, but, as with all Reserve Bank governors, he is a little equitable and says:
... inflation is expected to be on a rising trajectory given the strength of domestic demand, firming labour market conditions and continuing strong price pressures in the non-tradeables sector of the economy.
So he is also moving pre-emptively against further inflationary pressures. I suppose the bad point for home buyers and the farm sector is that he notes:
Monetary policy is continuing to have a stimulatory effect on the economy through domestic credit expansion. The growth of credit remains rapid and indeed has picked up further in the past few months. The prevailing level of the cash rate after the November increase was still below neutral, and interest rates of financial intermediaries remained low by the standards of recent years.
Mr Macfarlane is saying that the settings are still below neutral, which implies that there may be further movement in the not too distant future to get them back to what he describes as more neutral settings. The final sentence of the governor's media release confirms that. It says:
In these circumstances the Board took the view that a further increase in the cash rate was warranted in order to reduce the degree of stimulus to the economy from monetary policy.
It seems evident from all of this that the bank still believes that the stance on monetary policy is expansionary. The outlook, particularly internationally, has strengthened over the course of the last six months and there seems every indication that the interest rate increase that we have seen today will not in fact be the last. We are now at 5.25 per cent. When the governor began talking about the stance of monetary policy being expansionary, he gave general indications that were interpreted to mean that a more neutral position was 5½ per cent. We are certainly not there yet, but there is every hint in this press release that there will be further movement and further tightening of policy in the not too distant future.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—I would like to continue my remarks on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Review of the Reserve Bank Annual Report 2002. Following on the comments by the member for Kingston, I also would like to start by talking about the fact that the Reserve Bank has increased interest rates by another quarter of a per cent today. One aspect of that does concern me considerably. As is pointed out in the statement by the governor:
While the exchange rate has appreciated, the stronger international climate, rising commodity prices and more favourable conditions in the farm sector indicate improving export prospects.
What concerns me is that the impact of this is also pushing the Australian dollar up. In fact, if you look at page 22 of the report you will see that there is a chart on the exchange rate that shows that for most of 2002 the exchange rate with the US dollar was around the 50c mark or in the low 50s. That was at a time when the farming sector was going through one of the worst droughts on record. There has been no suggestion that the farming sector has really recovered from that drought; it will take years. We now see the Australian dollar well over the 70c mark—it is probably 72c or 73c now—which, if you look at it, is a dramatic movement over a relatively short period of time. From the end of 2002 until the end of this year, we have seen the dollar go up by over 40 per cent.
By any measure that is going to have a major impact on exports. I fear that the recovery that the farm sector has been looking for is going to be very much blunted by this push up of the Australian dollar. Notwithstanding the points made by the member for Kingston, the fact is that our interest rates are still considerably higher than those of some of our trading partners, including the United States. The impact of the dollar going up is going to make it very difficult for a lot of exporters, particularly farmers, to recover, given the very tough times they have had in the previous year with the drought.
I quickly want to move on to a couple of other points. In our report—which I commend to all honourable members: it has some very good information not just on monetary policy but also on some of the other areas that the Reserve Bank has direct or indirect responsibility for—we talk about bank fees. This is an area on which the bank is going to have to do quite a considerable amount of work. In chapter 3, we talked about the growth in fees. We summarised the findings of a Reserve Bank survey. The last finding said:
	the increase in banks' fee income has offset only a small part of the reduction in banks' interest rate margins over the past decade.
Notwithstanding that point, our report found:
... fees charged to households have increased from $1.2 billion in 1997 to $2.7 billion in 2002.
In other words, in five years they have more than doubled.
Householders are being hit with a fairly large amount of extra fees from the banks, though, as is pointed out, the usage of these services from the banks has increased quite a lot too. But one would think that, as the usage increases, the banks should be able to reduce those fees, because they are increasing their income anyway. As the committee pointed out in the report, analysis by BIS Shrapnel suggests that fee rises together with increases in loyalty points needed to redeem rewards have led to increases in the cost of holding a credit card of between 35 and 75 per cent. While the banks have offset what they see as their declining revenue from interest rate margins, the consumer who is using the credit card is filling that gap for the banks. I do believe that the Reserve and others are going to have to continue to look at that, and we will be raising that too. 
It is timely that we tabled this report this week, because on Monday next week the committee has its next hearing with the Reserve Bank in Brisbane. Today's interest rate rise will cause considerable interest in that hearing, but to expand a little on the question of fees we also look at the whole question of interchange fees for BPay. We are concerned by the apparent high level of BPay interchange fees, and we are of the view that the Reserve should undertake an immediate review, with the objective of ensuring that BPay interchange fees are reduced to a reasonable level. We also look at the whole question of automatic teller machine interchange fees, and we will certainly be waiting to see what work the bank has done on that, because they were still working on that.
On the question of credit card reform, notwithstanding the reduction in interchange fees for some credit cards it is clear that others that are now being promoted because they can offer more generous loyalty rewards are in many cases doing so at the expense of merchants. What in fact is happening is that somebody using these credit cards may get additional loyalty points, but the merchant finds that the fee charged to the retailer—or whoever the merchant is—is higher. That is how these particular companies can offer higher loyalty rewards. The end result is that, if the merchant is going to be charged a higher fee for using that card, it is almost inevitable that the consumer is going to pick up the tab somehow. The questions we have been raising with the Reserve Bank on these issues over several hearings now I think have not been fully answered. If those loyalty rewards are going to one set of customers, someone else must be paying. The whole question is: are consumers generally paying for these rewards? So we do think that a proper inquiry into the whole payment system is probably overdue.
I conclude my remarks there and again just reinforce the point that I want to thank all members of the committee for the work that they have put into this. A considerable amount of time and effort goes into these hearings and reports. I believe we produce reports containing a lot of very good information. I would particularly like to thank the deputy chair, the member for Chisholm, and the secretariat, particularly Russell Chafer, the committee secretary, who has put a tremendous amount of work into it.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I too welcome the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2002. The actual report that has been tabled is a culmination of two hearings: one in sunny Warrnambool, where we got to enjoy the delights of the member for Hawker's electorate, and one in Melbourne. An enormous amount of effort actually goes into these hearings—by the members of the committee, by the people who support us and by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and his staff. They take these hearings very seriously. It is a phenomenally open process. Over the five years now that I have been involved, we have seen the Governor of the Reserve Bank becoming more and more open in his statements and comments and more willing to engage in conversation and debate. Sometimes we feel a little frustrated that we are not getting all the answers we would like, but I think over time we have certainly seen a greater level of engagement in and acceptance of this process of exploration. 
At the outset, I want to say a particular thanks to David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library, who does a huge amount of work in preparing us for these inquiries and giving us background information and questions. We will be honest: as busy parliamentarians, sometimes our preparation work for these things is not as good as we would like. We try hard, but the library offers us a phenomenal service. Due to David's support in particular, we will again quiz the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Brisbane on Monday, and I know David is busy preparing information for us at this time.
This will be a phenomenally interesting hearing, given that between June and now we have seen two interest rate rises, as reported by both the speakers before me in this debate. Thesecond edition of the Age today states:
The rise, the second in two months, will take the official cash rate to 5.25 per cent, its highest level in more than two-and-a-half years.
If passed on in full by lenders, standard mortgage rates will rise to just over seven per cent, adding $30 to monthly repayments on the average $189,100 home loan.
So we have seen a phenomenal turnaround in the last two months from where we were in June, when we were quizzing the governor extensively about where rates would go, about his concern regarding the boom in the housing market, particularly in the investment market, and about whether the Reserve Bank needed greater powers to curb investment in the property market, particularly where individuals are borrowing against their existing home to purchase an investment property. We asked what sort of pressure this will put on, particularly if interest rates rise. Now we have seen interest rate rises, so it will be interesting to see how people who have geared themselves beyond their capacity will be able to make their loan repayments.
A lot of the inquiries in the last two reports were about whether home owners have over-borrowed; whether they could actually meet the rate rises that would inevitably come, and now we have seen them come. It will be interesting in the next couple of months to see if families are able to meet their mortgage repayments. I certainly do not want to predict something bad, but we have seen this sort of cycle before—in the late eighties, where there had been low interest rates and then they went up when there had been an expansion in the market. So we could be in for some interesting times.
The governor was fairly open in Warrnambool about wanting to return to what he deemed as the normal rate, which was an interesting and very open remark from the Governor of the Reserve Bank. When we talk to him on Monday, it will be interesting to hear whether he has got to where he believes a more neutral setting is. The report covers many interesting areas of our inquiry before the governor—not just about monetary policy and interest rates, but the impact upon the whole economy.
I would also like to thank Russell Chafer, who conveniently is in the House at the moment, for all his work in putting this report together. Being secretary to two committees is a fair effort, so I would like to thank him for all his work to get this report together in such a timely manner, given the committee tabled a rather large report only last week as well.
The committee looked at the housing sector, which I would like to comment on in the last few minutes I have got. One of our concerns was this boom in the housing sector, with the growth in the investment market and the growth in speculation. In recent days, we have seen the property investor Henry Kaye go under. We did quiz the governor back in June about whether there needed to be greater powers through ASIC or APRA to ensure that property speculation could be curtailed and that there could be regulation of it. I think the governor was fairly forthcoming. We have quoted him in the report, and I would like to put that on the record. He stated: 
... where people come along and get told how to get rich quickly by using the equity in their existing home to gear up and buy a couple more apartments. ASIC would love to stop that. The problem is they cannot demonstrate that these people are in fact financial advisers. If they were, they would have control over them. But the people who run the investment seminars say, `No, we're not. We are humble real estate agents and we're not subject to your laws—we're subject to state laws.'
... I think there is a regulatory gap there. It is clearly a problem if there is one group of people who are holding seminars on how to invest your money who are regulated—the financial planners—and there is another group who are doing almost exactly the same thing, although doing it within the one asset class, which is property, who are unregulated. So I think there is a need to extend the capacity for ASIC to do that.
So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is clearly on the record as stating that ASIC should be given extra powers to cover these people, because really they are offering financial advice, not property advice alone. There is a bit of interplay between state and federal jurisdictions, but I think this could be easily worked out and I believe the states would be willing to participate in that discussion. Indeed, the state of Queensland has written to the Treasurer asking for that to take place. So we will again be quizzing the Governor of the Reserve Bank on that on Monday, given that Henry Kaye has just gone under and taken with him a whole lot of small property investors who will now lose not only their investment properties but maybe their own homes, which may be needed to finance the mortgages they have taken out. We do need to see regulation in this area. These are some of the concerns that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has been raising now for many months.
We also asked him in June whether he thought there was a financial tool other than interest rates available to contain the housing sector. Again Macfarlane was fairly open. I would like to quote him: 
We have another financial tool. It is called open-mouth policy, and I have been using it, but it may not be as effective as other tools you could conceive of. I am not putting in a plug for another instrument, although if in the longer run things turned out badly it would not surprise me if people started looking at other arms of policy—for example, tax policy. We have a tax regime in Australia which, compared to a number of other countries, is very favourable to property speculation. I am not saying `Change it', but I would not rule out the possibility that if things do turn out badly there may be a public desire to make some changes.
Again, the Governor of the Reserve Bank is recognising there are problems with this area and that greater regulation is needed. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been using his open-mouth policy for some time. Some people, particularly in the real estate market, have been critical of that, but I think that his efforts have stemmed investment, particularly in the apartment market in Melbourne, and we will hopefully avoid the boom and bust cycle in the investment area.
I would also like to put on the record our concern about fees. If you look at the recent annual reports by all the major banks, it is quite startling to see the massive rise in profits generated by fees. They are actually outstripping interest rates at the moment as the biggest section of profits for banks. We need more regulation in this area. Again, I believe it is incumbent upon the Treasurer to provide to the ACCC a reference so that we can actually regulate the fees and charges and do more than just monitor them. Monitoring fees has not stopped the banks slugging everyone in this room and all our constituents with massive fees and charges. You get to the stage of wondering when their profits are enough. How much more money do these corporations need to generate? 
One of the interesting areas that we have not seen a lot of discussion of—although we will in the future—is credit card fraud. There are areas of credit card fraud that are now coming to light that are very concerning, and I think we will see the sector looking more intently at this in the future. It is a worry. It is a worry when we go into the Christmas period and people are using their credit cards extensively. Credit card interest rates are also worrying. That is another area that is highly unregulated. We have seen massive increases in credit card interest rates that have had no boundaries and have no basis in the actual interest rate set by the Reserve Bank.
I highly recommend the report to the House and recommend that all people read it. It is a very concise document. I think it distils a very complex area of monetary policy and explains the economy really well. It provides people with a very good insight into how the Australian economy is travelling. I would like to thank all the other members of the committee for their time at the inquiries—and for their enthusiasm—and we look forward to Monday's inquiry.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,33,2
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-12-03,"—On its face the year in question, 2002-03, looked to be an unremarkable year from the Reserve Bank's point of view. Interest rates remained steady; the exchange rate did rise, by something like 20 per cent over the year; shares fell; property rose; APRA got kicked in the backside as a result of the HIH inquiry; and credit card schemes were made more competitive. The Reserve Bank did start some new operations called continuous linked settlement systems, which the chairman of our committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, has already described. But, when one looks a little bit beneath the surface, one sees that in fact in the fiscal year just past there were two factors that were in some senses quite remarkable and the response of the Reserve Bank perhaps needs some closer examination than it has sometimes been given in the past.
The first is the fact that interest rates did remain steady throughout the period. The bank has been criticised to some extent by some, and I do not accept this criticism, for having been asleep at the wheel during the whole period. It may be that some other criticisms are appropriate but, when one looks at the facts relating to interest rates, it is interesting to observe that on 5 June 2002 the rates increased to 4.75 per cent and they remained at that level throughout the period. The first adjustment was not until November 2003, when they went up 0.25 per cent, and today they went up again, by another 0.25 per cent. The unusual aspect of that regime is this: whilst Australia's rates remained steady throughout the period, the world economy was sluggish, to say the least. Interest rates in Europe fell to about 2.25 per cent, and have even gone lower since, and rates in the United States fell to about 1.75 per cent. So there was clearly either a sense of confidence about the direction of the Australian economy or a rejection of policy settings in the European and American context by those in the Reserve Bank taking the decisions. On the other hand, at the same time, the Australian exchange rate rose significantly. I will come to that point in a minute. 
As far as growth is concerned, the prediction as at the meeting of our committee in May 2002—which was the meeting immediately before I became a member of the committee—was for growth of about four per cent; I think it was about 3.75 to four per cent. That was adjusted at the very interesting meeting in Warrnambool in our chairman's electorate, for which I commend him and the arrangements that he made.
—A very good electorate!
—Yes, it is a beautiful part of Western Victoria that I had never been to before, and I learnt a lot about regional Victoria on that visit. The interesting thing was that the Governor of the Reserve Bank suggested that the growth prediction had fallen to 3.75 per cent, and then in the June meeting in Melbourne it was reduced again to three per cent. In fact, growth over the period was 2.75 per cent by way of an average, although in terms of the Australian performance compared with the rest of the world—the other OECD countries—that was surprisingly good.
One of the other factors which have to be considered by the bank in relation to interest rate policy is inflation, which is an important indicator—and indeed the bank has its underlying inflation target set at two to three per cent. The estimate was that the underlying inflation rate was about three per cent throughout the period, so it certainly fell within the parameters that the adjusters were looking for. Unemployment is said to have been another factor, although the Governor of the Reserve Bank did explain, in some of his evidence, that unemployment issues are really caught up in growth issues and that, as long as there is sustained economic growth, it is likely that the maintenance of full employment, which is a target of the bank, will be appropriately addressed.
That brings us to the second extraordinary aspect of events throughout the relevant fiscal year, the exchange rate. In the period from the last quarter of 2001 through to the end of the current quarter, there has been about a 40 per cent increase in exchange rates, and over the relevant period a 20 per cent rise. That is an extraordinary rise. It has had some very negative impacts upon the economy. For example, wool producers in Australia are now finding it particularly difficult to sell their wool into the international market because of the increasing prices of that commodity—a commodity which is fundamentally important to Australia. Similarly, that is the case with other basic commodity prices.
The impact of the exchange rate ought not to be ignored, I would suggest, by those who set interest rate parameters in making their decisions. The impact of the rising exchange rate is obvious: it means that goods are going to be harder to sell overseas but, more importantly, goods in Australia are going to be more costly. It cannot be said that Australians are not going to buy, in a reasonably robust economy, such as we have at the moment, simply because imported goods are less expensive. It seems to me that, in adjusting interest rates, the fact that exchange rates increase adversely for the Australian dollar is a factor that needs to be taken into account in setting those parameters. It is not entirely clear to me that that is the case.
Indeed, it might be thought—and I am saying this with the utmost respect—the recent interest rate increases suggest that the bank has been a little trigger-happy. It is true that there is plenty of evidence that the property market in Australia has been overheating, but it is not absolutely true to suggest that it is getting worse. Indeed, recent indications, anecdotally and otherwise, from the property market are that the construction boom is coming to an end. There is evidence, particularly in relation to apartment building and medium to high density housing, that in fact it may be even worse than that and we may be entering into a period of complete slowdown. That will possibly give rise to panic in some sectors of the market, and that is just what we do not want. I think that there has been an overreaction to the events inside the property market, and I would like to see from those who adjust interest rates a greater confidence in the future of the Australian economy. It will be interesting—to me, at least—to hear those who have their hands on the levers respond to those concerns when the committee meets on Monday with the Reserve Bank. 
One of the other aspects of this issue that I want to deal with very briefly is the impact of the budget. The recent budget, as has been the case throughout the period of this coalition government, is another responsible budget. It has ensured that monetary policy has not suffered any pressure from government fiscal decisions. In fact, if anything it has been of very significant benefit to the proper settings of the economy, for which the bank is responsible. 
The only other matter I want to discuss that arises from this report relates to issues of governance. As I mentioned, as a result of the HIH inquiry there have been a number of recommendations that have been acted upon. APRA has been restructured. Let us hope that that works. There are issues now about the appropriate conduct of auditors in relation to public companies. I think we should monitor that very carefully indeed. CLERP 9 is an important reform, but I think we need to go further on these issues. There needs to be more disclosure legislation in relation to what some people are doing in respect of economy activity. We need to know more about what is happening with these secret Swiss bank accounts. I think we need to look at an amnesty proposal, such as the German and Italian governments have recently considered, to ensure that money that is floating around outside this country illegally is brought back to this country, accounted for and properly taxed. We need to put ourselves on a proper footing in relation to moneys coming in and out of the country. I also think that we need to look seriously at proper disclosure laws in relation to dealings on the share register. We need to ensure that, for public companies in particular, there is complete disclosure of the title and ownership of shares so that we are not left guessing, as has been the case in relation to the recent Offset Alpine Printing imbroglio.
Those issues need examination. Another issue that needs examination is the high cost of fund management fees. Fund management fees in particular funds currently amount to something like 2½ per cent of the capital invested. It is not clear to me why those rates are set by reference to the capital fund. Why is $5,000 an appropriate reward in respect of a $200,000 investment in a superannuation or other managed fund, without any guarantee of a return to the superannuants or to others who have invested in those managed funds? Let us look at more competition in this area of the economy. Let us ensure that those who operate the super funds and the managed funds give the best return they can to those who invest, to ensure continued confidence in the financial side of the economy.
I commend the chairman for his governance of this very important committee. I commend the report and the staff who prepared it. I also commend the Reserve Bank itself and its staff for a good year, but one in which there have been a couple of question marks including those I have raised today I hope in the interests of a continuing prosperous economy.
