Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:02):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the listing of Jabhat al-Nusra and the re-listing of six terrorist organisations; and Review of the re-listing of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. 


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr TEHAN:
  by leave—The report reviews the initial listing of the terrorist organisation known as Jabhat al-Nusra and the re-listing of seven previously listed terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code.


Regulations listing these organisations were tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 12 November and 2 December 2013. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the committee's review of the regulations tabled on 12 November requires the committee to report to the parliament by today, 11 February 2014.


I will now take this opportunity to outline the committee's findings in relation to each organisation. As mentioned, this is the first listing of Jabhat al-Nusra.


Jabhat al-Nusra plans and conducts attacks in Syria against individuals and groups perceived to be supporting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Its attacks include security and military targets using improvised explosive devices (IEDs), sniper and small-arms attacks, as well as kidnapping and torture. Jabhat al-Nusra targets urban areas, resulting in indiscriminate civilian attacks. The group has been responsible for numerous attacks since it announced its existence via a video statement on 6 January 2012.


Of particular concern to the committee were reports of Jabhat al-Nusra's recruitment of Australians to fight in Syria, as well as the suggestion that it is deliberately recruiting and training foreigners to go back to conduct terrorist attacks in their own countries. The committee therefore supports the listing of Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation.


With regard to the organisations being re-listed, this is the fifth re-listing of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah, al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jamiat ul-Ansar and the Abu Sayyaf Group; and the first re-listing of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In each case, the committee was satisfied that the groups continue to engage in terrorist activities which could be a threat to Australians or Australian interests either here in Australia or overseas. The committee therefore supports their ongoing listing as terrorist organisations and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation for each of these groups.


I would also like to particularly mention the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. This group has been listed since 2005 under different names including, most recently, Al-Qaeda in Iraq.


In December 2013 the government took the decision to re-list the organisation under the name Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The committee was informed that this was to reflect the expansion of the group's activities into Syria, with the change of name not reflecting a change in leadership, membership or methods of operation. Described to the committee as 'one of the world's deadliest and most active terrorist organisations', the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant conducts daily, often indiscriminate attacks. It targets crowds and public gatherings to maximise casualties and publicity. Of additional concern to the committee were reports that the group actively recruits Australians who have travelled to Syria to fight.


The committee notes that the regulation reflecting the change of name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is to be tabled in the House this Thursday. The committee supports the re-listing of this organisation and does not recommend disallowance of the regulation.


I would like to take the opportunity to thank my fellow committee members for making themselves available to complete this review in the short period between the establishment of the committee and the end of the disallowance period today. I also acknowledge the support of the secretariat in ensuring this work was done in a timely manner. I commend the reports to the House.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:14):  I am delighted to be speaking on the first substantive bill before this House for the year on the very important issue of consumer protection in the telecommunications framework in Australia. It is one in which I have an abiding interest from practical experience working as a telecommunications regulatory specialist both within a firm and as an in-house counsel. These amendments reflect some critical changes that were proposed by the Labor government and reflect a very precise and a very diligent process of consultation with a wide variety of stakeholders within industry.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013 covers a number of very important matters, including the do-not-call requirements, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the codes process. I think it is important to return to first principles and this bill is about reflecting what was meant to be achieved in legislation by what is called a co-regulatory scheme, which governs the Telecommunications Act, its related acts and also its instruments. 


The co-regulatory scheme is quite unique in Australia. It is an ideal model in many ways for an area which is dynamic and one in which there is sectoral governance by a number of interest groups. Often network industries employ this approach. In order to work, in order to have compliance, it really needs multiparty buy-in, it must be capable of implementation and it must be capable of being updated. I think that this bill really reflects all of those attributes.


These are sensible amendments proposed in this bill. In many ways, they reflect standard practice in the telecommunications space. It has been a consultative process that has led to this point. The Senate reported in June last year on the various items in this bill and recommended that the bill proceed essentially the same but with a minor but important commitment on the co-development process. That has been incorporated in this bill as a recommendation from the Senate report.


It is very useful to go part 6 of the Telecommunications Act to remind ourselves about the importance of self-regulation and the self-regulatory environment under the industry codes and standards. It is very useful to reflect on section 112 of the Telecommunications Act, which contains a statement of regulatory policy. This has been a longstanding provision within the legislation. It states:


The Parliament intends that bodies or associations that the ACMA—


the regulator—


is satisfied represent sections of the telemarketing industry should develop codes … that are to apply to participants in the respective sections of the industry …


Again, that reflects the co-regulatory structure. I will skip to subsection (2) because it is important to reflect on the regulator exercising its powers. It states that the regulator will:


.. act in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACMA, enables public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not impose undue financial and administrative burdens on participants in sections of the telecommunications industry …


It goes to other industries within the sector as well. These are not novel principles when we hear a lot of talk about removing red tape; these are the principles that have long stood within the sector and have long stood as best practice not only in theory but also in reality. 


Subsection (3) in this statement of regulatory policy sets out a very useful test for determining whether public interest considerations are being addressed in a way that does not impose undue financial and administrative burdens. Some of the things that the regulator needs to have regard to include:


(a) the number of customers who would be likely to benefit from the code or standard—


that is developed under these provisions and—


(b) the extent to which those customers are residential or small business customers; and 


(c) the legitimate business interests of participants in sections of the … industry; and 


(d) the public interest, including the public interest in the efficient, equitable and ecologically sustainable supply of: 


(i) carriage services; and 


(ii) goods for use in connection with carriage services; and 


(iii) services for use in connection with carriage services …


Having taken all that into account, I think it is wise to have a look at the code scheme and what these precise arrangements mean in practice. The way that the self-regulatory rules operate within these provisions is that compliance with an industry code is voluntary unless directed. That is summarising it, but it is an area which is criticised—and I will go to some of the criticisms that have been made in one particular document. It is certainly consistent with the statement of the regulatory policy.


It has been very useful to have these codes develop not only as provisions to enable consumers to know their rights when interacting with carriers or carriage service providers; these codes also operate as default mechanisms for many intercarrier arrangements and access agreements, setting the minimum standards that apply to consumers as well as to industry. You will see that in many contracts that occur between participants in the industry, those contracts will often defer to the code and have had the effect in the past of minimising disputes but also enabling the implementation of new aspects of innovation to work well. 


By no means is Australia novel in this respect. We have seen the adoption of innovations such as number portability—be it local number portability, mobile number portability or free phone number portability—and the predictability that arose out of developing an industry code certainly worked well in the implementation of the underlying networks and IT structures that needed to happen so that industry participants could cooperate. But in the end of course it served consumers well. Mobile number portability in Australia across the various forms has been working well for over 10 years now in many aspects of our telecommunications framework.


I now turn to some of the most important aspects of the changes proposed in this bill. One of the most important aspects, and one that I think is very welcomed by the industry, is that where a variation is taking place in the future in a code there is not a need to replace the code in its entirety. The industry can choose to vary that particular component rather than having to completely replace a code. In some cases, this lack of flexibility in the past has led to a number of items being, as you would put it, 'parked' and dealt with at a later date so that the industry did not have to open up what would often be a very cumbersome process. So in a very practical sense, opening up the code process means that not only are you able to deal with issues that are most pertinent but also you are able to do this in a much more efficient manner.


It is important to note that it is proposed under this bill that publication of code variations can be made on the website of the relevant industry group—something which was not there in the past—which certainly contributes to the transparency of this process and enables industry to have a much broader understanding of the issues being faced in particular areas of the sector. Another important one is where a draft variation is minor in nature and the requirements for publication do not apply. Examples of minor things might be updating references, including references to instruments which may already have been amended. Those sorts of things do not need to be subject to the publication rules—again, a much more efficient way of doing things by waiving variations if they are minor in nature. These are all very sensible changes.


In an era when we seem to be talking a lot about red tape reduction, I note that section 120 has not been substantially amended. There were some minor changes in 2000, when the privacy provisions came in and the name changed following the new regulator being established, but otherwise there has been nothing substantive. Nevertheless, I am very pleased that these provisions will be enacted. I know the industry certainly welcomes them and I think that all these will, in the end, contribute to a much more positive user experience, and for that we should welcome them.


I want to highlight some of the criticisms of the self-regulatory scheme because, while I do not agree with them entirely, they are worth mentioning. In particular, I would like to mention a paper commissioned by Choice in 2008. Consumer protection in thecommunications industry: moving to best practice contained a number of recommendations including that the industry and the structure should:


… concentrate resources on a limited number of comprehensive codes rather than numerous fragmented codes.


It was probably shortly after this report was prepared when that occurred in the industry, with the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code replacing several smaller codes—for example, the billing code—and consolidating all these into one consistent document. In section 2.2 of this report there is a critique of some of the provisions going to the code development process. It is interesting to focus on the precise criticism, which reads: 




The legislation is vague on the code development process. There are no provisions that require independent consumer input to code development or prevent ACMA from registering a code which does not have consumer input.



The question arises: how prescriptive do we want to be in the legislation? Also, the reality is that consumer groups have had a long involvement in formulating these codes and the transparency offered by the amendments in this bill will go some way towards addressing some of those concerns.


I would like to turn to the amendments relating to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. As anyone in the industry would know, one of the objectives of operators is to engage as little as possible in the formal complaints process of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The proposed provisions are that there be a dispute resolution standard. Previously this operated in terms of the TIO publishing both its charter and expectations. So I do not necessarily think this was an issue of lack of transparency by the TIO but certainly the minister being able to make a standard under a legislative instrument should be useful in going some way towards addressing these criticisms.


Lastly, I point to an excellent analysis done by one of my former colleagues from Gilbert and Tobin, Sarah Alderson, who compared Australia's alternative dispute resolution scheme for telecommunications against that of the UK. In 2010, she noted when comparing and contrasting the numbers of complaints between the UK and Australia:


As … detailed ... in 2009-10, the TIO registered 215,000 cases. This means that in a country with less than a third of the amount of people—


Australia—


had almost 25 times more complaints than the UK.


As can be seen from that number and from the TIO's website, the focus of Australia's telcos—and they should be commended for it—really has shifted towards consumer satisfaction, particularly in this age of user-generated content where you have people giving succinct views on the operation of their carriage service provider. I think that has driven substantially the improvements we have seen in the TIO resolution levels. It is noteworthy that it is, in fact, in the industry's interests to keep these complaints at a low. As Sarah Alderson points out:


… acquiring new customers can cost 5 to 7 times more than satisfying and retaining—


them. So it certainly is in the interests of consumers for telcos to remain focused on their end users.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (12:29):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. It might be said that the rather detailed measures contained in this bill are of interest to only a small section of the community. But both the member for Greenway and I do form part of that small section of the community. More broadly, these changes will, as I seek to explain, be of benefit to telecommunications consumers.


The measures in this bill are ones that I look at with some interest, having spent a reasonable proportion of my professional life engaged in the area of telecommunications regulation. Indeed, I was working as an advisor to then Howard government communications minister, Senator Richard Alston, at the time that the act which is proposed to be amended by this bill first went through the parliament. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to serve on the board of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, an organisation which is the subject of key provisions of this bill. I also had the opportunity to head up the regulatory affairs function at Optus, the second-largest telecommunications company, where participation in the code development process—another key subject area of this bill—was part of our daily work.


Against that backdrop, I want to comment on the measures contained in this bill, which do several things. Firstly, they amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to strengthen the effectiveness of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) scheme. Secondly, they streamline the industry code process in the Telecommunications Act 1997. They also enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register Act 2006.


I want to make three points. There is a heavy element of self-regulation in the telecommunications sector—to make the regime as flexible and adaptable as possible. But self-regulatory arrangements can develop some rigidities, and this bill seeks to correct some of those. There is more to do on regulatory reform and it is a major priority for this government in the communications sector. 


Let me turn then to the first proposition about the importance of self-regulation in the telecommunications sector in Australia. The broad legislative framework under which the sector presently operates took effect on 1 July 1997. There is a heavy self-regulatory framework under that regime. A key reason is that the sector is so fast moving—detailed legislation prepared by parliamentary counsel can easily get out of date. To give just one example: 16 years ago, the notion of voice over IP as a mainstream technology for voice would have been fanciful. Today there are over four million Australians using VOIP services. 


It is because of this need to be constantly adaptive to the extraordinary rate of technological change in this industry that the regulatory regime applicable to telecommunications makes very extensive use of self-regulatory codes. These codes are developed by groups of industry participants under the auspices of the Communications Alliance—again, a self-regulatory body—and are ultimately registered with the Australian Communications and Media Authority and, once registered, they have the force of law. 


They deal with a wide range of matters, including consumer protections, technical matters, and operational and interoperator arrangements. So code making is a vital and routine part of the way the industry operates and regulates itself in a very fast moving area. But there is a problem in the current process by which codes are made. As the legislative framework currently operates, there is no scope to make minor amendments on a stand-alone basis to the self-regulatory codes in the telecommunications sector. Instead, under the current process, the only way to make a change is for the developers of the code—that is, all of the multiple parties across the industry—to review the code in its entirety. Even if you wish to make minor changes or, indeed, urgent changes, you must go through, as the law presently stands, the full process of remaking the code, which takes two to three years given the number of parties involved and given the consultative process that is involved. So it is no surprise that telecommunications carriers have been frustrated by their inability to make minor changes to industry codes to ensure consumer protection obligations across industry are kept up to date. 


Similarly, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman arrangements also involve a high degree of self-regulation. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is an industry funded complaints scheme. Historically, it has been governed at two levels, a board and a council—both have a mix of industry and consumer sector representation. When a complaint is made by a customer, there is a tiered process of investigating that complaint with the service provider. As the investigation becomes more complex and if the matter is not resolved, the service provider is charged an amount which increases as the complaint proceeds to a higher tier. It is a strong incentive for the carrier or service provider to resolve the matter. So it is a powerful mechanism for using the price signal to communicate to telecommunications carriers when they have a problem, particularly a systemic problem. 


Over the nearly 20 years now that the system has operated, a range of issues have generated particular systemic problems. A good current example, recently cited by the CEO of Optus, Kevin Russell, concerns bill shock in relation to data charges. Mr Russell said:


The notion that a 16 year old can rack up a $3,000 bill in the space of a week, or that travellers can return home with over $22,000 in international roaming charges is unacceptable. It's not an answer to say people have choices if the choices aren't great.


He went on to say:


It's no wonder Australians are unhappy with our industry. Almost one million complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman about bills and customer service can't be wrong.


Optus is tackling these issues head on, by cutting our reliance on data breakage fees and unfair roaming charges.


I should again disclose for the record that I am a former employee of Optus.


Mr Russell's comments are a powerful demonstration that when charges paid to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman by a carrier or a service provider start to spike, it gets the attention of senior management, who ask, 'What do we need to do as a company to fix this and get complaints down?' I am certainly not saying that the system is perfect; no human institution is. But at its core it has worked effectively as a way to put a focus on problematic issues and to do so in a self-regulatory fashion—that is, without necessarily requiring the involvement of government. 


While self-regulation is a central principle, self-regulatory arrangements can develop rigidities over time, and a key objective of this bill is to address some of the rigidities that have emerged. In my maiden speech I discussed the balance between rules being set by government and what the private sector should do. I said:


To me, the sweet spot in public policy is when government identifies the objectives and sets ground rules and incentives to achieve those objectives—and then gets out of the way to let individuals and businesses do the work.


I continue to believe that is a good principle but, as we have seen, there is a flaw in the present self-regulatory arrangements when it comes to codes, because there is presently no capacity to make minor modifications to codes. Similarly there is a need for some finetuning in relation to the arrangements governing the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. In particular, the amendments contained in the bill will allow codes to be varied through a streamlined process. That process will be similar to that for developing industry codes, but it will be more streamlined. One of the other changes is that code developers will be required to publish submissions. That will improve the transparency and accountability of the code development and review process.


In relation to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the amendments in the bill are designed to keep the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme in line with best practice for industry-run external dispute resolution schemes. This will be done by establishing a set of framework principles which will clarify the role of the TIO scheme and its expected standards of operations. The amendments will also introduce periodic, mandatory, independent and public reviews of how the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme is operating. These amendments will help to keep the TIO operating as an effective example of industry through its own efforts to respond to consumer complaints rather than relying on a process of direct government regulation. 


The final point I want to make is that while this bill shows some encouraging progress towards lightening some of the burden of red tape and regulation on the communications sector, there is considerably more to do. When the Howard government introduced the Telecommunications Act, which took effect in 1997, it brought in a new period of competition in telecommunications. But it is timely now to look at the weight of the regulatory burden on this sector, just as the Abbott government is looking at the weight of the regulatory burden across all sectors of business. This government has made a strong commitment to reduce that regulatory burden. Indeed, we have set a very ambitious goal across government that by the end of our first term we will have reduced the cost to Australian business of regulation and red tape by $1 billion. In the communications portfolio, both Minister Turnbull and I are very focused on the importance of regulatory reform. The communications sector is, after all, highly regulated. The current regulatory framework is fundamentally based on a 1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models which placed great emphasis on the predominance of the fixed-line network—which was certainly a valid assumption at the time. Since that time, of course, there has been a steady accretion of layer upon layer of rules and regulations. Some of these rules and regulations are important for facilitating competition but others are not of such evident value in 2014. It is timely to ask whether the policy objectives underpinning particular regulatory measures in the communications sector remain valid; if they do not, the case for those regulations being retained is very difficult to see. 


We have commenced quite an extensive consultation process with the communications sector. A letter has been sent to participants right across the industry and some very good ideas have already been received from industry participants in relation to the reduction of red tape. This is a high priority. The coalition's first 'regulation repeal day' is coming up in March, and we expect at that time there will be measures in relation to communications included in the legislation which is before the House.


The coalition is determined to reduce the regulatory burden across the economy, and there is scope for the communications sector to share in that. The measures contained in this bill are improvements which will go some way towards making the self-regulatory arrangements which presently exist more flexible. But there is certainly more to do and the Abbott government is determined that the communications sector as well as other sectors of the economy will benefit from unnecessary regulation being removed, allowing greater efficiencies and less red tape so that business can get on with doing what it does best: serving its customers and serving Australians.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (12:44):  I support the passage of this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. For any of those members of the public who have received a telemarketing call while they are making dinner at home or trying to put the kids to bed, these reforms are a welcome improvement to our consumer protection provisions relating to telecommunications in Australia. 


Of course, the reforms contained in this bill were introduced by the former Labor government, and we support them in opposition. The amendments will enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register, simplify the process for updating industry codes of practice, increase the transparency of processes to develop those industry codes and also provide greater clarity around the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, its standards of operation and processes for regular review. Basically, these reforms strengthen the consumer protections available in the telecommunications industry, but they are not over the top. They do not go too far. They strike the right balance in ensuring that the privacy of Australian citizens is respected and protected whilst they are at home.


The objective of the Telecommunications Act is to promote an industry that is efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of the Australian community. The act also aims to provide appropriate community safeguards and to regulate participants in this important industry. The amendments to the Do Not Call Register were prepared in response to feedback received by the department from the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These amendments enhance the operational efficiency of the register by clarifying the meaning of 'cause' in relation to the party responsible for making telemarketing calls and sending marketing faxes where third parties are carrying out the marketing activities. Under the current act, a person or a company cannot make a telemarketing call to an Australian phone number of a person who is registered on the Do Not Call Register. These provisions extend that.


There have been incidences reported of individuals contracting out that responsibility to companies who do not have a contractual obligation to abide by the provisions that restrain the person contracting out from calling people on the Do Not Call Register. Section 12 of this bill will prohibit persons or companies from entering into a contract with another party to make telemarketing calls where there is no provision in that contract for a party not to abide by the Do Not Call Register. Consumer protection in the telecommunications industry is of the utmost importance. With that in mind, the amendments contained in this bill are designed to enhance the capabilities of the ACMA to ensure that the Do Not Call Register is operating as intended.


This government has made it pretty clear that they have an agenda of pursuing a reduction in red tape, and on this particular industry they have often spoken of pursuing the Victorian model. The problem with this approach, however, is that it focuses solely on the cost while ignoring the social impacts of regulations. I and members on this side are hopeful that reasonable consumer protections that protect the privacy of Australian citizens, particularly in relation to telemarketing activities, are not whittled away by this reform and this process of reducing red tape.


The other two amendments in this bill relate to consumer protection. Telecommunications service providers have deficiencies. We have all heard of bill shock, roaming fees and poor consumer service and assistance. These are issues that the industry is aware of and, thankfully, the industry is committed to rectifying. The amendments in relation to consumer codes followed an extensive review of the processes of making those consumer codes. The amendments in this bill enable codes to be varied rather than needing to be remade holus-bolus, and that is supported by all the stakeholders. The revised amendment requiring submissions received to public consultation on code development are also supported by all the stakeholders. These changes will allow new issues and problems to be addressed quickly and efficiently through code management and amendment.


The role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is of course essential in providing an avenue for adequate recourse to consumers experiencing issues with their provider. However, the scheme has been sluggish in adapting to new issues and governance concerns. Many MPs receive complaints about the time it takes for the telecommunications ombudsman to deal with complaints and get responses to complaints to consumers. The greater clarity instilled by this bill around the role of the ombudsman will ensure that this organisation continues to operate effectively into the future and, importantly, provides more efficiency around responses to consumers.


The removal of red tape is a goal that we share, but it is important that this objective is not pursued at the expense of consumer protection. We implore those opposite to ensure that the balance that is struck with this bill and with these reforms introduced by Labor is not whittled away in any process being undertaken looking at red tape in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (12:51):  Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, I believe this is the first time I have spoken since you have been appointed a Deputy Speaker. I am sure you will make a fine Deputy Speaker and I look forward to speaking while you are in the chair. I rise to support the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, a bill which amends the Do Not Call Register Act, the Telecommunications Act and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Services Standards) Act 1999. It is important to note that this bill was first introduced, as the previous speaker so eloquently stated, into the House under the Gillard government in March last year. It was legislation that was developed in response to problems experienced by consumers and by the industry generally. I believe it is really important for governments to react to problems such as those identified in this area and to rectify them.


The first amendment is to the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 to enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register, which I will go into a little bit later, and to clarify which party is responsible for making telemarketing calls and sending marketing faxes where third parties are carrying out the marketing activities. The second amendment is to streamline the process of developing and amending industry codes under part 6 of the Telecommunications Act to extend the application of the reimbursement scheme for developing consumer related industry codes, to vary these codes and to require code developers to publish draft codes, draft variations and related public submissions on their websites. That is a very important change.


The third amendment amends the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Services Standards) Act 1999 to improve the operation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, TIO, scheme. Each and every member of this House would value the TIO and its role. This amendment will provide greater clarity about the role of the TIO and expected standards of operation by requiring the TIO scheme to comply with standards determined by the minister. I assume those standards determined by the minister will reflect the standards that we as members of parliament and those we represent in the community expect. It will also require periodic public reviews of the TIO scheme conducted by a body independent of the TIO and the telecommunications industry—once again, independence and transparency are all very important. This legislation, I believe, is good legislation. It makes really positive changes and is legislation that provides protection to those people we in this parliament represent.


The Do Not Call Register was, I think, one of the most innovative changes within the industry. I would like to pay credit to the former Speaker, the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, for the role that she played. She championed the Do Not Call Register when those opposite were in opposition and was able to get that through the parliament. The Do Not Call Register reflected the demands and expectations that people in the community were making to members of parliament. They were saying that it was not good enough that they were getting unwanted phone calls—usually at tea time, as most people know. People were getting unsolicited, unwanted phone calls and something needed to be done to stop this. The interesting thing is that there are now nine million landlines that are registered with the Do Not Call Register. It is important that we ensure the register is actually achieving what it is supposed to. These changes to the legislation will make sure that the Do Not Call Register is vibrant and delivers what it should. That, coupled with the Do Not Knock signs that people are putting on their doors, has really made a change in the way people receive unsolicited door-to-door advertising and sales. It is interesting to note that at the end of last year a verdict was handed down and significant fines were placed on ATL and another organisation because they knocked on a person's door who had a Do Not Knock sign on the door. These are really important forms of consumer protection. The Do Not Call Register relates to unsolicited phone calls, people selling things that people we represent have not asked for. The Do Not Call Register and the Do Not Knock stickers that people are now placing on the door are really important changes in consumer protection.


The amendments to the code, which I detailed, require organisations to place details of those codes and responses to submissions on their websites. We need to have a strong code that is agreed to by all parties. It is important to note that the things to be looked at include the telemarketing and fax marketing industries. They have got to put all the details up there about bodies or associations that have been developed in relation to the industry, the industry code and how the code provides appropriate community safeguards where relevant. I think that is the thing that we as members of parliament are particularly interested in, because this is all about community safeguards and ensuring that the community has the type of protection that it needs.


The Do Not Call Register, as I previously pointed out, was an innovative register that was set up to stop unsolicited calls. The Do Not Knock stickers are to prevent unsolicited people knocking on your door. Now this legislation will ensure that there is a proper code of conduct in relation to the telecommunications industry. In the past it was really hard to compare different mobile phone plans. It was like comparing apples and oranges. There has been an evolution within the telecommunications industry that has made it easier to do this. This code of conduct will make it even more transparent and even easier to look at and compare the different telecommunications deals, offers and companies that are out there in the community. It is all about providing consumers with greater protection and more information and allowing them to make informed decisions.


In the past I have had numerous complaints in my electorate office about people receiving unsolicited phone calls offering to provide them with assistance with their computers online. These calls have created some damage for people who have actually followed the instructions that they have been given. There are also unsolicited calls and faxes offering people deals and sums of money. This legislation will tighten up the requirements to establish the link between the person making the phone call and the company that they are representing.


In addition to that, this legislation will make the TIO operate a lot more efficiently and effectively. There have been problems in the past with the TIO and the speed with which it can react to and deal with issues. Hopefully the changes that are included in this legislation will deal with that and lead to faster, fairer and more efficient operation by the TIO, consistent with current alternative dispute resolutions and best practice. They should also lead to the TIO having the ability to promote and encourage industry efforts to deliver quality complaint resolutions before any sort of outside intervention is introduced. This legislation was referred to and examined by a Senate committee. There were, I believe, six submissions to the inquiry, and those six submissions basically did not have any major problems with this legislation.


I will conclude by making the statement that any legislation that provides better protection to the people that we represent in this parliament is good legislation. The simple fact that both sides of this House are supporting this legislation shows that it meets the test of being able to provide protection to the people that we represent. This legislation will ensure that we have a fair, efficient and effective telecommunication industry. It will ensure that we have a Do Not Call Register that operates in the way that it is intended to. It will also ensure that the industry develops a code of conduct that is actually accessible to people, through web pages. It will allow the industry to change regulations but to do so in a transparent way and a way that benefits consumers.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (13:05):  I am very pleased to be able to support the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, a bill which is very much focused on improving consumer protection in relation to telecommunications services. The delivery of telecommunications services now so deeply and profoundly affects our lives that the focus on consumer protection in this area and the ability of people to properly access telecommunications services is every day becoming more important. So much of our lives now we conduct through telecommunications services. The very way in which our businesses, work and homes are structured makes us increasingly dependent on the provision of reliable telecommunications services, so the need for us to have a robust protective regime is very important.


I want to pick up on the comment that was made by the member for Kingsford Smith. I think that within all of the discussion that we have about the importance for there to be a self-regulatory regime and for us not to impose unnecessary burden on the industry, it is always very important for us to countervail that with the need for enhanced protection for the consumer, given the centrality of these services to the conduct of their daily lives and the difficulties that emerge when those services are simply not available in a reliable and timely fashion. I will talk about a few instances in my electorate where people found that, unfortunately, the sort of assistance that they would have expected from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman was simply not there by virtue of the limitations on the role of the telecommunications ombudsman.


I think that the provision of the Do Not Call Register was a great development, given the amount of intrusion by these phone calls into people's already time-poor lives. Some nights, one would get three or four of these unsolicited telephone calls. The Do Not Call Register was a very welcome development for the Australian community. But, like many people, I have to say it seemed to be failing and calls seemed to resume. So it is pleasing now to see that one of the possible loopholes or enforcement barriers is being addressed in this legislation and that those people who were seeking to circumvent any consequences of breaching the Do Not Call Register by engaging third parties to do the work for them will now be forced to accept the responsibility. I guess you could call it a chain of responsibility measure that has been put in place here. I think there is a lot more scope for chain of responsibility legislation in a number of different areas, but I am very pleased to see that we are accepting some of the commercial realities and are now taking action to ensure that the Do Not Call Register is not easily suborned.


As has been said, I think everyone is very pleased that we are now going to have the capacity to amend the provisions whereby codes can be varied in part. As has been pointed out by the member for Greenway, the requirement that an entire code be amended in order for it to be changed and be up for review has in fact been a negative provision that has stopped progress in the proper development of these codes. So the idea that we can now make targeted and nuanced changes without having to submit the entire code for review is of course very welcome.


Perhaps the final point I want to make goes back to the idea that, whilst it is always important that we are very efficient in the way we regulate industry and do not create needless and duplicated burdens on industry, in this area the need for consumer protection is ever increasing, and that it is not just focusing on cost comparisons and the ability for people to make wise and cost-effective choices—although that is extremely important—but on the very ability for people to have access to a reliable, dependable service and to have a measure of recourse where that reliable, dependable service is not available.


In the last couple of months we have been dealing with a number of issues with our constituents that centre around this and around their disappointment. Two very different sets of residents, with very different issues, came to us because they were surprised that they were unable to get any relief from the telecommunications ombudsman. In the first instance this involved an area of a number of streets in the suburb of Bedford in my electorate. There are a variety of different service providers that people use to get their internet services, but their internet services have always been of a low quality and speed. The services were increasingly falling out, the length of time to access those services was expanding and services would routinely drop out, so you would be lucky if you could get half an hour of continuous service. 


This was making it extremely difficult for people seeking to study at home, who would come home at night wanting to use their internet service for research for the education programs that they were engaged in. It was very difficult for people that were trying to run small businesses. They would contact their service provider, and their service provider would say, 'Look, there's nothing we can do about it, it's just that we've got a poorly maintained network here and that's the best that we can do.' So they would contact the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman would tell them that, as they were not Telstra customers, there was nothing that they could do. They would contact iiNet, and iiNet would contact Telstra, and nothing ever changed, so the roundabout simply continued. Quite clearly we have a problem here. It is simply not possible, it would appear, for the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to deal with fundamental infrastructure problems.


There was a whole street, a new subdivision in a very old, established area. A small subdivision was created. Quite simply, these people could not get any telecommunications services at all. As part of their development they had private structured cable laid to their housing. The contractor they employed installed the conduit cable to the house, to the street verge, ready to be connected to the Telstra pit. However, it turned out that there was no pit in the street. There were attempts to engage with Telstra. Telstra for quite some time refused to accept that this issue was even relevant to them. Finally, after some intervention on our part, there was a recognition that, yes, this was something that the internet provider could not themselves deal with and that it was indeed a Telstra issue.


There were numerous occasions when people were then told that Telstra would come out to the site and deal with this issue. Technicians would come out. They would poke around for a while and then say they had to go back to the exchange. They would go back and they would never return. This went on for many, many weeks. Complaints were made to the telecommunications ombudsman, and again they replied that they were unable to pursue Telstra as Telstra were not the people's service provider.


Quite clearly, in these settings we have problems with the provision of infrastructure that it would appear that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is not able to deal with. Many of these constituents, who presume that this is the appropriate person to go to, find that it is not and find themselves in this endless loop between their service provider and Telstra, going round and round in circles. This can have an impact on people's lives, their ability to operate their small business and their ability to engage in education programs as well as all the more day-to-day things that they may wish to do as consumers and as friends and family over the internet.


I think we need to do better. We need to absolutely and profoundly understand just how, as a society, we have become so dependent on the provision of reliable telecommunications services. We have to be very cognisant of the need to have a system that provides a very strong measure of protection for people and a very clear conduit for people to take action when these services fail. There needs to be some ability to cut through the 'it's not my fault; it's their fault' regime that certainly many of my constituents are finding themselves wound into.


Of course, that also leads into the very strong arguments for upgrading our very basic infrastructure to try to deal with some of these problems, at least some of which come from a poorly maintained copper network. I note that the Minister for Communications is here. I am pleased to perhaps now have the opportunity to ask the minister if he is aware of the new cable-laying technology or techniques that have been developed in Perth that provide an enormous opportunity to radically reduce the cost of laying fibre-optic cable in brownfield sites. They dramatically reduce the cost of doing so. This, in my view, will enable us to do a lot more fibre to the premises in a very cost-effective way. It is a logical consequence of engaging in a rollout that these new techniques develop. I would be very hopeful that the minister is open to exploring these new opportunities for laying down stronger infrastructure. (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Minister for Communications) (13:20):  I wish to thank the members who have contributed to this debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. An efficient and responsive consumer protection regime is a vital element of our telecommunications landscape, particularly—as many honourable members, including the speaker preceding me, have observed—as Australians increasingly rely on telecommunications technology to support all of their work and everyday activities. There used to be a time when we spoke—and we still do, in fact—of the digital economy. The reality is that the economy is a digital economy. That is the economy. All of our transactions and all of our commerce are being conducted, in one way or another, in the digital sphere.


The various measures outlined in the bill, which I gather has the support of the House, seek to improve consumer safeguards while reducing the regulatory burden imposed on the telecommunications industry when developing or altering its governing codes. The self- and co-regulatory frameworks which form the foundation of the Telecommunications Act 1997 have served consumers and the industry well. But as new devices and technologies enter this dynamic market and consumer preferences change, traditional regulatory frameworks are at increasing risk of being left behind by technology. So, importantly, amendments in this bill will give the companies and organisations that develop these industry codes additional flexibility to respond more quickly and efficiently to the evolving telecommunications sector.


As honourable members have discussed in this debate, the particular amendments to the Telecommunications Act in this bill will permit industry codes to be varied or revised without the rest of the code becoming obsolete. The telecommunications industry is a fast-changing and exponentially growing sector. Its co-regulatory framework in which industry, government and consumer groups work in partnership has to be equally dynamic. It cannot be always playing catch-up; it has to be able to move with the times. The bill improves the transparency and accountability of the industry code development process by requiring code developers to publish their draft codes and variations on the web as well as submissions received from industry and the public. In addition, the bill incorporates changes to the code developers' reimbursement scheme allowing them to be reimbursed for those costs associated with varying consumer related industry codes.


A core element of the telecommunications industry self-governance regime is the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme. The TIO provides an independent alternative dispute resolution service for residential and small business consumers of fixed line, mobile and internet services in Australia. This bill will implement a number of measures to improve the TIO scheme's effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, the bill establishes a performance framework that will ensure that the TIO scheme complies with fundamental standards of fairness, equity and efficiency. Importantly, the proposed amendments will also enable these standards and the entire TIO scheme to be periodically reviewed and adjusted as community expectations evolve. Finally, the bill makes amendments to the Do Not Call Register Act 2006. The proposed amendment will empower the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to pursue more effectively those telemarketers and fax marketers which may be using third parties overseas and other intermediaries to reach local consumers, in breach of the Do Not Call Register provisions.


Sixteen years ago the Howard government introduced the Telecommunications Act 1997, as the honourable member for Bradfield and my parliamentary secretary reminded the House just a few moments ago. This enabled a new era of competition in Australia's telecommunications sector while establishing a comprehensive co-regulatory framework to protect the interests of consumers. The guiding principle was progressively to remove regulatory barriers and constraints on genuinely competitive conduct and actively engage with the telecommunications sector to transfer much of the responsibility for regulation to the industry itself. The coalition government, the Abbott government, has vowed to continue this work of removing red tape and by so doing to continue to lift Australia's productivity. So this bill is part of a broader package of reforms of the telecommunications industry. 


At the heart of those reforms is the consumer. Everyone in this chamber recognises that Australia needs a world-class telecommunications network. We may disagree about some engineering issues about the design and construction of such a network but a critical issue is to make an honest and adequate appraisal of what consumers face in the network today. A number of honourable members have spoken about the NBN project. I want to remind the House of the way in which the government have approached the NBN since the election. We undertook that we would tell the Australian people the truth about the state of the project and what the options were for completing it, and to do so independently. 



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The NBN Co itself conducted a strategic review with the assistance of some external experts, including KordaMentha and the Boston Consulting Group. It was published just before Christmas. What that showed is that, under Labor's plan for the NBN, consumers would have faced internet price rises of up to 80 per cent and a total funding cost of $73 billion.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  It also showed that the project would take an extra four years to complete and demonstrated that there were alternative approaches using a range of technologies which would enable the project to be completed for $31 billion less in terms of total funding, and years earlier. That is a great outcome for the consumer because it means they will get better broadband sooner and it will be more affordable. The honourable member for Perth in her speech, and she has been interjecting while I have been speaking, asked about technologies for better, more efficient trenching of cables, fibre-optic cables or any cables, that are available. I imagine she was talking about micro trenching technologies. I can assure the honourable member that both I as the minister and the NBN Co even more so are very aware of that. But one of the things that the honourable member should bear in mind is that her colleague Senator Conroy, while the minister, arranged for the NBN Co to enter into a comprehensive agreement with Telstra of a take or pay kind whereby the NBN Co is obliged to use Telstra's ducts and pits and, if it does not use the nominated vast quantity of them, to pay them for it nonetheless. So yes, there are in some areas more cost-effective ways of putting fibre underground than horizontal drilling and installing new ducts and they can be taken into account. But the honourable members opposite have to remember that the government is not dealing with a blank sheet of paper here. We can only play the hand of cards that we have been dealt and what we have been left with by the previous government, and that has been a shocking mess.


Let me go on in the time available to me to continue as to what we have done. Among the things we have done, we have ensured that the board now has members who have spent lifetimes in the telecommunications sector, including Ziggy Switkowski, chairman and former CEO of Telstra, and in the case of Patrick Flannigan in the business of constructing distributed linear infrastructure. We now have a very qualified board. We have identified and engaged a new chief executive, Mr Bill Morrow, who is a very distinguished international telecom executive, highly regarded around the world as a turnaround specialist in the telecom sector. So now we have a highly qualified board and, joining us very shortly, a highly qualified CEO.


There is another review going on at the moment, which will be completed in March, of the satellite and fixed wireless part of the project, which faces, as many honourable members know, very, very serious problems—a mixture of misleading information being provided by the previous government coupled with what can only be described as bungling or incompetence in terms of the management of it. That report will be completed in March. This is a very considerable and expensive mess and, as I have said many times to honourable members, there are tens of billions of dollars that at the end of the day will have been wasted because of commitments made and decisions taken by the Labor government without proper homework.


One of the other things we are doing is conducting a thoroughgoing cost-benefit analysis. Of course, that should have been done by the previous government before they embarked on this in the first place, but it is better late than never. But it would have been better if it had been done at the outset.


The bottom line is that as far as the NBN project is concerned, the government's commitment is to be completely transparent and treat the people of Australia as you would treat the shareholders in a public listed company, to provide them with timely information about the state of the project and in effect to open the books of the NBN Co, and we are doing that. Instead of having to have rollout figures dragged out of the minister with great difficulty and pain, every week the NBN Co now publishes its latest rollout figures on its website. Every week they are published there. There will be a quarterly report done by the NBN Co management on the financial performance and of course the construction performance of the project. That will be done by the NBN Co management in exactly the same way as if it were a public listed company. Maximum transparency is going to be given to this project.


Honourable members should recognise that the failure of the NBN project under Labor has resulted in so many Australians who had no broadband in 2007 still not having it today. The truth is that some Australians have very good broadband—excellent broadband, world-class broadband. Many Australians have little or no broadband. You would think that, if the government were going to spend money on a broadband project, it would prioritise those who were in greatest need. But not only did the Labor government not do that, it did not even ask the question of where those underserved areas were. So shortly, we will be releasing a set of maps which show those parts of Australia—those districts, those neighbourhoods, if you like—where broadband services are good, okay, average and very, very poor. That information will inform the construction of the NBN so that, as far as practicable, the worst served areas are prioritised. Our commitment is to prioritise the worst served areas.


Ziggy Switkowski and I went out to Blacktown recently to see some work that had been committed to and planned under the previous government, which showed the NBN fibre being rolled out in streets where there was not one but two hybrid fibre co-ax networks. Under the ground there was Telstra's HFC; up on the poles was Optus's. From either of those networks residents in the street could order a 100-megabit-per-second service, yet that area was being prioritised when areas in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Craig Kelly, and indeed in outer suburban electorates in the big cities were being completely left behind. The former government did not even bother to ask the question in a systematic way as to where those underserved areas were.


There has been a massive cultural change in the management of the NBN Co. It is going to be run as a transparent business, being straight with the Australian people instead of treating it as a political exercise where any information it releases has to conform with the minister's political agenda and not otherwise.


Returning to this bill, the amendments in the bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, will ensure the sustainability of the proven co-regulatory telecommunications framework while continuing to safeguard the interests of Australian consumers. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:14):  I am delighted to be speaking on the first substantive bill before this House for the year on the very important issue of consumer protection in the telecommunications framework in Australia. It is one in which I have an abiding interest from practical experience working as a telecommunications regulatory specialist both within a firm and as an in-house counsel. These amendments reflect some critical changes that were proposed by the Labor government and reflect a very precise and a very diligent process of consultation with a wide variety of stakeholders within industry.


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013 covers a number of very important matters, including the do-not-call requirements, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the codes process. I think it is important to return to first principles and this bill is about reflecting what was meant to be achieved in legislation by what is called a co-regulatory scheme, which governs the Telecommunications Act, its related acts and also its instruments. 


The co-regulatory scheme is quite unique in Australia. It is an ideal model in many ways for an area which is dynamic and one in which there is sectoral governance by a number of interest groups. Often network industries employ this approach. In order to work, in order to have compliance, it really needs multiparty buy-in, it must be capable of implementation and it must be capable of being updated. I think that this bill really reflects all of those attributes.


These are sensible amendments proposed in this bill. In many ways, they reflect standard practice in the telecommunications space. It has been a consultative process that has led to this point. The Senate reported in June last year on the various items in this bill and recommended that the bill proceed essentially the same but with a minor but important commitment on the co-development process. That has been incorporated in this bill as a recommendation from the Senate report.


It is very useful to go part 6 of the Telecommunications Act to remind ourselves about the importance of self-regulation and the self-regulatory environment under the industry codes and standards. It is very useful to reflect on section 112 of the Telecommunications Act, which contains a statement of regulatory policy. This has been a longstanding provision within the legislation. It states:


The Parliament intends that bodies or associations that the ACMA—


the regulator—


is satisfied represent sections of the telemarketing industry should develop codes … that are to apply to participants in the respective sections of the industry …


Again, that reflects the co-regulatory structure. I will skip to subsection (2) because it is important to reflect on the regulator exercising its powers. It states that the regulator will:


.. act in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACMA, enables public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not impose undue financial and administrative burdens on participants in sections of the telecommunications industry …


It goes to other industries within the sector as well. These are not novel principles when we hear a lot of talk about removing red tape; these are the principles that have long stood within the sector and have long stood as best practice not only in theory but also in reality. 


Subsection (3) in this statement of regulatory policy sets out a very useful test for determining whether public interest considerations are being addressed in a way that does not impose undue financial and administrative burdens. Some of the things that the regulator needs to have regard to include:


(a) the number of customers who would be likely to benefit from the code or standard—


that is developed under these provisions and—


(b) the extent to which those customers are residential or small business customers; and 


(c) the legitimate business interests of participants in sections of the … industry; and 


(d) the public interest, including the public interest in the efficient, equitable and ecologically sustainable supply of: 


(i) carriage services; and 


(ii) goods for use in connection with carriage services; and 


(iii) services for use in connection with carriage services …


Having taken all that into account, I think it is wise to have a look at the code scheme and what these precise arrangements mean in practice. The way that the self-regulatory rules operate within these provisions is that compliance with an industry code is voluntary unless directed. That is summarising it, but it is an area which is criticised—and I will go to some of the criticisms that have been made in one particular document. It is certainly consistent with the statement of the regulatory policy.


It has been very useful to have these codes develop not only as provisions to enable consumers to know their rights when interacting with carriers or carriage service providers; these codes also operate as default mechanisms for many intercarrier arrangements and access agreements, setting the minimum standards that apply to consumers as well as to industry. You will see that in many contracts that occur between participants in the industry, those contracts will often defer to the code and have had the effect in the past of minimising disputes but also enabling the implementation of new aspects of innovation to work well. 


By no means is Australia novel in this respect. We have seen the adoption of innovations such as number portability—be it local number portability, mobile number portability or free phone number portability—and the predictability that arose out of developing an industry code certainly worked well in the implementation of the underlying networks and IT structures that needed to happen so that industry participants could cooperate. But in the end of course it served consumers well. Mobile number portability in Australia across the various forms has been working well for over 10 years now in many aspects of our telecommunications framework.


I now turn to some of the most important aspects of the changes proposed in this bill. One of the most important aspects, and one that I think is very welcomed by the industry, is that where a variation is taking place in the future in a code there is not a need to replace the code in its entirety. The industry can choose to vary that particular component rather than having to completely replace a code. In some cases, this lack of flexibility in the past has led to a number of items being, as you would put it, 'parked' and dealt with at a later date so that the industry did not have to open up what would often be a very cumbersome process. So in a very practical sense, opening up the code process means that not only are you able to deal with issues that are most pertinent but also you are able to do this in a much more efficient manner.


It is important to note that it is proposed under this bill that publication of code variations can be made on the website of the relevant industry group—something which was not there in the past—which certainly contributes to the transparency of this process and enables industry to have a much broader understanding of the issues being faced in particular areas of the sector. Another important one is where a draft variation is minor in nature and the requirements for publication do not apply. Examples of minor things might be updating references, including references to instruments which may already have been amended. Those sorts of things do not need to be subject to the publication rules—again, a much more efficient way of doing things by waiving variations if they are minor in nature. These are all very sensible changes.


In an era when we seem to be talking a lot about red tape reduction, I note that section 120 has not been substantially amended. There were some minor changes in 2000, when the privacy provisions came in and the name changed following the new regulator being established, but otherwise there has been nothing substantive. Nevertheless, I am very pleased that these provisions will be enacted. I know the industry certainly welcomes them and I think that all these will, in the end, contribute to a much more positive user experience, and for that we should welcome them.


I want to highlight some of the criticisms of the self-regulatory scheme because, while I do not agree with them entirely, they are worth mentioning. In particular, I would like to mention a paper commissioned by Choice in 2008. Consumer protection in thecommunications industry: moving to best practice contained a number of recommendations including that the industry and the structure should:


… concentrate resources on a limited number of comprehensive codes rather than numerous fragmented codes.


It was probably shortly after this report was prepared when that occurred in the industry, with the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code replacing several smaller codes—for example, the billing code—and consolidating all these into one consistent document. In section 2.2 of this report there is a critique of some of the provisions going to the code development process. It is interesting to focus on the precise criticism, which reads: 




The legislation is vague on the code development process. There are no provisions that require independent consumer input to code development or prevent ACMA from registering a code which does not have consumer input.



The question arises: how prescriptive do we want to be in the legislation? Also, the reality is that consumer groups have had a long involvement in formulating these codes and the transparency offered by the amendments in this bill will go some way towards addressing some of those concerns.


I would like to turn to the amendments relating to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. As anyone in the industry would know, one of the objectives of operators is to engage as little as possible in the formal complaints process of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The proposed provisions are that there be a dispute resolution standard. Previously this operated in terms of the TIO publishing both its charter and expectations. So I do not necessarily think this was an issue of lack of transparency by the TIO but certainly the minister being able to make a standard under a legislative instrument should be useful in going some way towards addressing these criticisms.


Lastly, I point to an excellent analysis done by one of my former colleagues from Gilbert and Tobin, Sarah Alderson, who compared Australia's alternative dispute resolution scheme for telecommunications against that of the UK. In 2010, she noted when comparing and contrasting the numbers of complaints between the UK and Australia:


As … detailed ... in 2009-10, the TIO registered 215,000 cases. This means that in a country with less than a third of the amount of people—


Australia—


had almost 25 times more complaints than the UK.


As can be seen from that number and from the TIO's website, the focus of Australia's telcos—and they should be commended for it—really has shifted towards consumer satisfaction, particularly in this age of user-generated content where you have people giving succinct views on the operation of their carriage service provider. I think that has driven substantially the improvements we have seen in the TIO resolution levels. It is noteworthy that it is, in fact, in the industry's interests to keep these complaints at a low. As Sarah Alderson points out:


… acquiring new customers can cost 5 to 7 times more than satisfying and retaining—


them. So it certainly is in the interests of consumers for telcos to remain focused on their end users.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (12:29):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. It might be said that the rather detailed measures contained in this bill are of interest to only a small section of the community. But both the member for Greenway and I do form part of that small section of the community. More broadly, these changes will, as I seek to explain, be of benefit to telecommunications consumers.


The measures in this bill are ones that I look at with some interest, having spent a reasonable proportion of my professional life engaged in the area of telecommunications regulation. Indeed, I was working as an advisor to then Howard government communications minister, Senator Richard Alston, at the time that the act which is proposed to be amended by this bill first went through the parliament. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to serve on the board of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, an organisation which is the subject of key provisions of this bill. I also had the opportunity to head up the regulatory affairs function at Optus, the second-largest telecommunications company, where participation in the code development process—another key subject area of this bill—was part of our daily work.


Against that backdrop, I want to comment on the measures contained in this bill, which do several things. Firstly, they amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to strengthen the effectiveness of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) scheme. Secondly, they streamline the industry code process in the Telecommunications Act 1997. They also enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register Act 2006.


I want to make three points. There is a heavy element of self-regulation in the telecommunications sector—to make the regime as flexible and adaptable as possible. But self-regulatory arrangements can develop some rigidities, and this bill seeks to correct some of those. There is more to do on regulatory reform and it is a major priority for this government in the communications sector. 


Let me turn then to the first proposition about the importance of self-regulation in the telecommunications sector in Australia. The broad legislative framework under which the sector presently operates took effect on 1 July 1997. There is a heavy self-regulatory framework under that regime. A key reason is that the sector is so fast moving—detailed legislation prepared by parliamentary counsel can easily get out of date. To give just one example: 16 years ago, the notion of voice over IP as a mainstream technology for voice would have been fanciful. Today there are over four million Australians using VOIP services. 


It is because of this need to be constantly adaptive to the extraordinary rate of technological change in this industry that the regulatory regime applicable to telecommunications makes very extensive use of self-regulatory codes. These codes are developed by groups of industry participants under the auspices of the Communications Alliance—again, a self-regulatory body—and are ultimately registered with the Australian Communications and Media Authority and, once registered, they have the force of law. 


They deal with a wide range of matters, including consumer protections, technical matters, and operational and interoperator arrangements. So code making is a vital and routine part of the way the industry operates and regulates itself in a very fast moving area. But there is a problem in the current process by which codes are made. As the legislative framework currently operates, there is no scope to make minor amendments on a stand-alone basis to the self-regulatory codes in the telecommunications sector. Instead, under the current process, the only way to make a change is for the developers of the code—that is, all of the multiple parties across the industry—to review the code in its entirety. Even if you wish to make minor changes or, indeed, urgent changes, you must go through, as the law presently stands, the full process of remaking the code, which takes two to three years given the number of parties involved and given the consultative process that is involved. So it is no surprise that telecommunications carriers have been frustrated by their inability to make minor changes to industry codes to ensure consumer protection obligations across industry are kept up to date. 


Similarly, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman arrangements also involve a high degree of self-regulation. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is an industry funded complaints scheme. Historically, it has been governed at two levels, a board and a council—both have a mix of industry and consumer sector representation. When a complaint is made by a customer, there is a tiered process of investigating that complaint with the service provider. As the investigation becomes more complex and if the matter is not resolved, the service provider is charged an amount which increases as the complaint proceeds to a higher tier. It is a strong incentive for the carrier or service provider to resolve the matter. So it is a powerful mechanism for using the price signal to communicate to telecommunications carriers when they have a problem, particularly a systemic problem. 


Over the nearly 20 years now that the system has operated, a range of issues have generated particular systemic problems. A good current example, recently cited by the CEO of Optus, Kevin Russell, concerns bill shock in relation to data charges. Mr Russell said:


The notion that a 16 year old can rack up a $3,000 bill in the space of a week, or that travellers can return home with over $22,000 in international roaming charges is unacceptable. It's not an answer to say people have choices if the choices aren't great.


He went on to say:


It's no wonder Australians are unhappy with our industry. Almost one million complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman about bills and customer service can't be wrong.


Optus is tackling these issues head on, by cutting our reliance on data breakage fees and unfair roaming charges.


I should again disclose for the record that I am a former employee of Optus.


Mr Russell's comments are a powerful demonstration that when charges paid to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman by a carrier or a service provider start to spike, it gets the attention of senior management, who ask, 'What do we need to do as a company to fix this and get complaints down?' I am certainly not saying that the system is perfect; no human institution is. But at its core it has worked effectively as a way to put a focus on problematic issues and to do so in a self-regulatory fashion—that is, without necessarily requiring the involvement of government. 


While self-regulation is a central principle, self-regulatory arrangements can develop rigidities over time, and a key objective of this bill is to address some of the rigidities that have emerged. In my maiden speech I discussed the balance between rules being set by government and what the private sector should do. I said:


To me, the sweet spot in public policy is when government identifies the objectives and sets ground rules and incentives to achieve those objectives—and then gets out of the way to let individuals and businesses do the work.


I continue to believe that is a good principle but, as we have seen, there is a flaw in the present self-regulatory arrangements when it comes to codes, because there is presently no capacity to make minor modifications to codes. Similarly there is a need for some finetuning in relation to the arrangements governing the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. In particular, the amendments contained in the bill will allow codes to be varied through a streamlined process. That process will be similar to that for developing industry codes, but it will be more streamlined. One of the other changes is that code developers will be required to publish submissions. That will improve the transparency and accountability of the code development and review process.


In relation to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the amendments in the bill are designed to keep the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme in line with best practice for industry-run external dispute resolution schemes. This will be done by establishing a set of framework principles which will clarify the role of the TIO scheme and its expected standards of operations. The amendments will also introduce periodic, mandatory, independent and public reviews of how the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme is operating. These amendments will help to keep the TIO operating as an effective example of industry through its own efforts to respond to consumer complaints rather than relying on a process of direct government regulation. 


The final point I want to make is that while this bill shows some encouraging progress towards lightening some of the burden of red tape and regulation on the communications sector, there is considerably more to do. When the Howard government introduced the Telecommunications Act, which took effect in 1997, it brought in a new period of competition in telecommunications. But it is timely now to look at the weight of the regulatory burden on this sector, just as the Abbott government is looking at the weight of the regulatory burden across all sectors of business. This government has made a strong commitment to reduce that regulatory burden. Indeed, we have set a very ambitious goal across government that by the end of our first term we will have reduced the cost to Australian business of regulation and red tape by $1 billion. In the communications portfolio, both Minister Turnbull and I are very focused on the importance of regulatory reform. The communications sector is, after all, highly regulated. The current regulatory framework is fundamentally based on a 1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models which placed great emphasis on the predominance of the fixed-line network—which was certainly a valid assumption at the time. Since that time, of course, there has been a steady accretion of layer upon layer of rules and regulations. Some of these rules and regulations are important for facilitating competition but others are not of such evident value in 2014. It is timely to ask whether the policy objectives underpinning particular regulatory measures in the communications sector remain valid; if they do not, the case for those regulations being retained is very difficult to see. 


We have commenced quite an extensive consultation process with the communications sector. A letter has been sent to participants right across the industry and some very good ideas have already been received from industry participants in relation to the reduction of red tape. This is a high priority. The coalition's first 'regulation repeal day' is coming up in March, and we expect at that time there will be measures in relation to communications included in the legislation which is before the House.


The coalition is determined to reduce the regulatory burden across the economy, and there is scope for the communications sector to share in that. The measures contained in this bill are improvements which will go some way towards making the self-regulatory arrangements which presently exist more flexible. But there is certainly more to do and the Abbott government is determined that the communications sector as well as other sectors of the economy will benefit from unnecessary regulation being removed, allowing greater efficiencies and less red tape so that business can get on with doing what it does best: serving its customers and serving Australians.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (12:44):  I support the passage of this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. For any of those members of the public who have received a telemarketing call while they are making dinner at home or trying to put the kids to bed, these reforms are a welcome improvement to our consumer protection provisions relating to telecommunications in Australia. 


Of course, the reforms contained in this bill were introduced by the former Labor government, and we support them in opposition. The amendments will enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register, simplify the process for updating industry codes of practice, increase the transparency of processes to develop those industry codes and also provide greater clarity around the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, its standards of operation and processes for regular review. Basically, these reforms strengthen the consumer protections available in the telecommunications industry, but they are not over the top. They do not go too far. They strike the right balance in ensuring that the privacy of Australian citizens is respected and protected whilst they are at home.


The objective of the Telecommunications Act is to promote an industry that is efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of the Australian community. The act also aims to provide appropriate community safeguards and to regulate participants in this important industry. The amendments to the Do Not Call Register were prepared in response to feedback received by the department from the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These amendments enhance the operational efficiency of the register by clarifying the meaning of 'cause' in relation to the party responsible for making telemarketing calls and sending marketing faxes where third parties are carrying out the marketing activities. Under the current act, a person or a company cannot make a telemarketing call to an Australian phone number of a person who is registered on the Do Not Call Register. These provisions extend that.


There have been incidences reported of individuals contracting out that responsibility to companies who do not have a contractual obligation to abide by the provisions that restrain the person contracting out from calling people on the Do Not Call Register. Section 12 of this bill will prohibit persons or companies from entering into a contract with another party to make telemarketing calls where there is no provision in that contract for a party not to abide by the Do Not Call Register. Consumer protection in the telecommunications industry is of the utmost importance. With that in mind, the amendments contained in this bill are designed to enhance the capabilities of the ACMA to ensure that the Do Not Call Register is operating as intended.


This government has made it pretty clear that they have an agenda of pursuing a reduction in red tape, and on this particular industry they have often spoken of pursuing the Victorian model. The problem with this approach, however, is that it focuses solely on the cost while ignoring the social impacts of regulations. I and members on this side are hopeful that reasonable consumer protections that protect the privacy of Australian citizens, particularly in relation to telemarketing activities, are not whittled away by this reform and this process of reducing red tape.


The other two amendments in this bill relate to consumer protection. Telecommunications service providers have deficiencies. We have all heard of bill shock, roaming fees and poor consumer service and assistance. These are issues that the industry is aware of and, thankfully, the industry is committed to rectifying. The amendments in relation to consumer codes followed an extensive review of the processes of making those consumer codes. The amendments in this bill enable codes to be varied rather than needing to be remade holus-bolus, and that is supported by all the stakeholders. The revised amendment requiring submissions received to public consultation on code development are also supported by all the stakeholders. These changes will allow new issues and problems to be addressed quickly and efficiently through code management and amendment.


The role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is of course essential in providing an avenue for adequate recourse to consumers experiencing issues with their provider. However, the scheme has been sluggish in adapting to new issues and governance concerns. Many MPs receive complaints about the time it takes for the telecommunications ombudsman to deal with complaints and get responses to complaints to consumers. The greater clarity instilled by this bill around the role of the ombudsman will ensure that this organisation continues to operate effectively into the future and, importantly, provides more efficiency around responses to consumers.


The removal of red tape is a goal that we share, but it is important that this objective is not pursued at the expense of consumer protection. We implore those opposite to ensure that the balance that is struck with this bill and with these reforms introduced by Labor is not whittled away in any process being undertaken looking at red tape in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (12:51):  Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, I believe this is the first time I have spoken since you have been appointed a Deputy Speaker. I am sure you will make a fine Deputy Speaker and I look forward to speaking while you are in the chair. I rise to support the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, a bill which amends the Do Not Call Register Act, the Telecommunications Act and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Services Standards) Act 1999. It is important to note that this bill was first introduced, as the previous speaker so eloquently stated, into the House under the Gillard government in March last year. It was legislation that was developed in response to problems experienced by consumers and by the industry generally. I believe it is really important for governments to react to problems such as those identified in this area and to rectify them.


The first amendment is to the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 to enhance the operational efficiency of the Do Not Call Register, which I will go into a little bit later, and to clarify which party is responsible for making telemarketing calls and sending marketing faxes where third parties are carrying out the marketing activities. The second amendment is to streamline the process of developing and amending industry codes under part 6 of the Telecommunications Act to extend the application of the reimbursement scheme for developing consumer related industry codes, to vary these codes and to require code developers to publish draft codes, draft variations and related public submissions on their websites. That is a very important change.


The third amendment amends the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Services Standards) Act 1999 to improve the operation of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, TIO, scheme. Each and every member of this House would value the TIO and its role. This amendment will provide greater clarity about the role of the TIO and expected standards of operation by requiring the TIO scheme to comply with standards determined by the minister. I assume those standards determined by the minister will reflect the standards that we as members of parliament and those we represent in the community expect. It will also require periodic public reviews of the TIO scheme conducted by a body independent of the TIO and the telecommunications industry—once again, independence and transparency are all very important. This legislation, I believe, is good legislation. It makes really positive changes and is legislation that provides protection to those people we in this parliament represent.


The Do Not Call Register was, I think, one of the most innovative changes within the industry. I would like to pay credit to the former Speaker, the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, for the role that she played. She championed the Do Not Call Register when those opposite were in opposition and was able to get that through the parliament. The Do Not Call Register reflected the demands and expectations that people in the community were making to members of parliament. They were saying that it was not good enough that they were getting unwanted phone calls—usually at tea time, as most people know. People were getting unsolicited, unwanted phone calls and something needed to be done to stop this. The interesting thing is that there are now nine million landlines that are registered with the Do Not Call Register. It is important that we ensure the register is actually achieving what it is supposed to. These changes to the legislation will make sure that the Do Not Call Register is vibrant and delivers what it should. That, coupled with the Do Not Knock signs that people are putting on their doors, has really made a change in the way people receive unsolicited door-to-door advertising and sales. It is interesting to note that at the end of last year a verdict was handed down and significant fines were placed on ATL and another organisation because they knocked on a person's door who had a Do Not Knock sign on the door. These are really important forms of consumer protection. The Do Not Call Register relates to unsolicited phone calls, people selling things that people we represent have not asked for. The Do Not Call Register and the Do Not Knock stickers that people are now placing on the door are really important changes in consumer protection.


The amendments to the code, which I detailed, require organisations to place details of those codes and responses to submissions on their websites. We need to have a strong code that is agreed to by all parties. It is important to note that the things to be looked at include the telemarketing and fax marketing industries. They have got to put all the details up there about bodies or associations that have been developed in relation to the industry, the industry code and how the code provides appropriate community safeguards where relevant. I think that is the thing that we as members of parliament are particularly interested in, because this is all about community safeguards and ensuring that the community has the type of protection that it needs.


The Do Not Call Register, as I previously pointed out, was an innovative register that was set up to stop unsolicited calls. The Do Not Knock stickers are to prevent unsolicited people knocking on your door. Now this legislation will ensure that there is a proper code of conduct in relation to the telecommunications industry. In the past it was really hard to compare different mobile phone plans. It was like comparing apples and oranges. There has been an evolution within the telecommunications industry that has made it easier to do this. This code of conduct will make it even more transparent and even easier to look at and compare the different telecommunications deals, offers and companies that are out there in the community. It is all about providing consumers with greater protection and more information and allowing them to make informed decisions.


In the past I have had numerous complaints in my electorate office about people receiving unsolicited phone calls offering to provide them with assistance with their computers online. These calls have created some damage for people who have actually followed the instructions that they have been given. There are also unsolicited calls and faxes offering people deals and sums of money. This legislation will tighten up the requirements to establish the link between the person making the phone call and the company that they are representing.


In addition to that, this legislation will make the TIO operate a lot more efficiently and effectively. There have been problems in the past with the TIO and the speed with which it can react to and deal with issues. Hopefully the changes that are included in this legislation will deal with that and lead to faster, fairer and more efficient operation by the TIO, consistent with current alternative dispute resolutions and best practice. They should also lead to the TIO having the ability to promote and encourage industry efforts to deliver quality complaint resolutions before any sort of outside intervention is introduced. This legislation was referred to and examined by a Senate committee. There were, I believe, six submissions to the inquiry, and those six submissions basically did not have any major problems with this legislation.


I will conclude by making the statement that any legislation that provides better protection to the people that we represent in this parliament is good legislation. The simple fact that both sides of this House are supporting this legislation shows that it meets the test of being able to provide protection to the people that we represent. This legislation will ensure that we have a fair, efficient and effective telecommunication industry. It will ensure that we have a Do Not Call Register that operates in the way that it is intended to. It will also ensure that the industry develops a code of conduct that is actually accessible to people, through web pages. It will allow the industry to change regulations but to do so in a transparent way and a way that benefits consumers.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (13:05):  I am very pleased to be able to support the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, a bill which is very much focused on improving consumer protection in relation to telecommunications services. The delivery of telecommunications services now so deeply and profoundly affects our lives that the focus on consumer protection in this area and the ability of people to properly access telecommunications services is every day becoming more important. So much of our lives now we conduct through telecommunications services. The very way in which our businesses, work and homes are structured makes us increasingly dependent on the provision of reliable telecommunications services, so the need for us to have a robust protective regime is very important.


I want to pick up on the comment that was made by the member for Kingsford Smith. I think that within all of the discussion that we have about the importance for there to be a self-regulatory regime and for us not to impose unnecessary burden on the industry, it is always very important for us to countervail that with the need for enhanced protection for the consumer, given the centrality of these services to the conduct of their daily lives and the difficulties that emerge when those services are simply not available in a reliable and timely fashion. I will talk about a few instances in my electorate where people found that, unfortunately, the sort of assistance that they would have expected from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman was simply not there by virtue of the limitations on the role of the telecommunications ombudsman.


I think that the provision of the Do Not Call Register was a great development, given the amount of intrusion by these phone calls into people's already time-poor lives. Some nights, one would get three or four of these unsolicited telephone calls. The Do Not Call Register was a very welcome development for the Australian community. But, like many people, I have to say it seemed to be failing and calls seemed to resume. So it is pleasing now to see that one of the possible loopholes or enforcement barriers is being addressed in this legislation and that those people who were seeking to circumvent any consequences of breaching the Do Not Call Register by engaging third parties to do the work for them will now be forced to accept the responsibility. I guess you could call it a chain of responsibility measure that has been put in place here. I think there is a lot more scope for chain of responsibility legislation in a number of different areas, but I am very pleased to see that we are accepting some of the commercial realities and are now taking action to ensure that the Do Not Call Register is not easily suborned.


As has been said, I think everyone is very pleased that we are now going to have the capacity to amend the provisions whereby codes can be varied in part. As has been pointed out by the member for Greenway, the requirement that an entire code be amended in order for it to be changed and be up for review has in fact been a negative provision that has stopped progress in the proper development of these codes. So the idea that we can now make targeted and nuanced changes without having to submit the entire code for review is of course very welcome.


Perhaps the final point I want to make goes back to the idea that, whilst it is always important that we are very efficient in the way we regulate industry and do not create needless and duplicated burdens on industry, in this area the need for consumer protection is ever increasing, and that it is not just focusing on cost comparisons and the ability for people to make wise and cost-effective choices—although that is extremely important—but on the very ability for people to have access to a reliable, dependable service and to have a measure of recourse where that reliable, dependable service is not available.


In the last couple of months we have been dealing with a number of issues with our constituents that centre around this and around their disappointment. Two very different sets of residents, with very different issues, came to us because they were surprised that they were unable to get any relief from the telecommunications ombudsman. In the first instance this involved an area of a number of streets in the suburb of Bedford in my electorate. There are a variety of different service providers that people use to get their internet services, but their internet services have always been of a low quality and speed. The services were increasingly falling out, the length of time to access those services was expanding and services would routinely drop out, so you would be lucky if you could get half an hour of continuous service. 


This was making it extremely difficult for people seeking to study at home, who would come home at night wanting to use their internet service for research for the education programs that they were engaged in. It was very difficult for people that were trying to run small businesses. They would contact their service provider, and their service provider would say, 'Look, there's nothing we can do about it, it's just that we've got a poorly maintained network here and that's the best that we can do.' So they would contact the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman would tell them that, as they were not Telstra customers, there was nothing that they could do. They would contact iiNet, and iiNet would contact Telstra, and nothing ever changed, so the roundabout simply continued. Quite clearly we have a problem here. It is simply not possible, it would appear, for the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to deal with fundamental infrastructure problems.


There was a whole street, a new subdivision in a very old, established area. A small subdivision was created. Quite simply, these people could not get any telecommunications services at all. As part of their development they had private structured cable laid to their housing. The contractor they employed installed the conduit cable to the house, to the street verge, ready to be connected to the Telstra pit. However, it turned out that there was no pit in the street. There were attempts to engage with Telstra. Telstra for quite some time refused to accept that this issue was even relevant to them. Finally, after some intervention on our part, there was a recognition that, yes, this was something that the internet provider could not themselves deal with and that it was indeed a Telstra issue.


There were numerous occasions when people were then told that Telstra would come out to the site and deal with this issue. Technicians would come out. They would poke around for a while and then say they had to go back to the exchange. They would go back and they would never return. This went on for many, many weeks. Complaints were made to the telecommunications ombudsman, and again they replied that they were unable to pursue Telstra as Telstra were not the people's service provider.


Quite clearly, in these settings we have problems with the provision of infrastructure that it would appear that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is not able to deal with. Many of these constituents, who presume that this is the appropriate person to go to, find that it is not and find themselves in this endless loop between their service provider and Telstra, going round and round in circles. This can have an impact on people's lives, their ability to operate their small business and their ability to engage in education programs as well as all the more day-to-day things that they may wish to do as consumers and as friends and family over the internet.


I think we need to do better. We need to absolutely and profoundly understand just how, as a society, we have become so dependent on the provision of reliable telecommunications services. We have to be very cognisant of the need to have a system that provides a very strong measure of protection for people and a very clear conduit for people to take action when these services fail. There needs to be some ability to cut through the 'it's not my fault; it's their fault' regime that certainly many of my constituents are finding themselves wound into.


Of course, that also leads into the very strong arguments for upgrading our very basic infrastructure to try to deal with some of these problems, at least some of which come from a poorly maintained copper network. I note that the Minister for Communications is here. I am pleased to perhaps now have the opportunity to ask the minister if he is aware of the new cable-laying technology or techniques that have been developed in Perth that provide an enormous opportunity to radically reduce the cost of laying fibre-optic cable in brownfield sites. They dramatically reduce the cost of doing so. This, in my view, will enable us to do a lot more fibre to the premises in a very cost-effective way. It is a logical consequence of engaging in a rollout that these new techniques develop. I would be very hopeful that the minister is open to exploring these new opportunities for laying down stronger infrastructure. (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Minister for Communications) (13:20):  I wish to thank the members who have contributed to this debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013. An efficient and responsive consumer protection regime is a vital element of our telecommunications landscape, particularly—as many honourable members, including the speaker preceding me, have observed—as Australians increasingly rely on telecommunications technology to support all of their work and everyday activities. There used to be a time when we spoke—and we still do, in fact—of the digital economy. The reality is that the economy is a digital economy. That is the economy. All of our transactions and all of our commerce are being conducted, in one way or another, in the digital sphere.


The various measures outlined in the bill, which I gather has the support of the House, seek to improve consumer safeguards while reducing the regulatory burden imposed on the telecommunications industry when developing or altering its governing codes. The self- and co-regulatory frameworks which form the foundation of the Telecommunications Act 1997 have served consumers and the industry well. But as new devices and technologies enter this dynamic market and consumer preferences change, traditional regulatory frameworks are at increasing risk of being left behind by technology. So, importantly, amendments in this bill will give the companies and organisations that develop these industry codes additional flexibility to respond more quickly and efficiently to the evolving telecommunications sector.


As honourable members have discussed in this debate, the particular amendments to the Telecommunications Act in this bill will permit industry codes to be varied or revised without the rest of the code becoming obsolete. The telecommunications industry is a fast-changing and exponentially growing sector. Its co-regulatory framework in which industry, government and consumer groups work in partnership has to be equally dynamic. It cannot be always playing catch-up; it has to be able to move with the times. The bill improves the transparency and accountability of the industry code development process by requiring code developers to publish their draft codes and variations on the web as well as submissions received from industry and the public. In addition, the bill incorporates changes to the code developers' reimbursement scheme allowing them to be reimbursed for those costs associated with varying consumer related industry codes.


A core element of the telecommunications industry self-governance regime is the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman scheme. The TIO provides an independent alternative dispute resolution service for residential and small business consumers of fixed line, mobile and internet services in Australia. This bill will implement a number of measures to improve the TIO scheme's effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, the bill establishes a performance framework that will ensure that the TIO scheme complies with fundamental standards of fairness, equity and efficiency. Importantly, the proposed amendments will also enable these standards and the entire TIO scheme to be periodically reviewed and adjusted as community expectations evolve. Finally, the bill makes amendments to the Do Not Call Register Act 2006. The proposed amendment will empower the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to pursue more effectively those telemarketers and fax marketers which may be using third parties overseas and other intermediaries to reach local consumers, in breach of the Do Not Call Register provisions.


Sixteen years ago the Howard government introduced the Telecommunications Act 1997, as the honourable member for Bradfield and my parliamentary secretary reminded the House just a few moments ago. This enabled a new era of competition in Australia's telecommunications sector while establishing a comprehensive co-regulatory framework to protect the interests of consumers. The guiding principle was progressively to remove regulatory barriers and constraints on genuinely competitive conduct and actively engage with the telecommunications sector to transfer much of the responsibility for regulation to the industry itself. The coalition government, the Abbott government, has vowed to continue this work of removing red tape and by so doing to continue to lift Australia's productivity. So this bill is part of a broader package of reforms of the telecommunications industry. 


At the heart of those reforms is the consumer. Everyone in this chamber recognises that Australia needs a world-class telecommunications network. We may disagree about some engineering issues about the design and construction of such a network but a critical issue is to make an honest and adequate appraisal of what consumers face in the network today. A number of honourable members have spoken about the NBN project. I want to remind the House of the way in which the government have approached the NBN since the election. We undertook that we would tell the Australian people the truth about the state of the project and what the options were for completing it, and to do so independently. 



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The NBN Co itself conducted a strategic review with the assistance of some external experts, including KordaMentha and the Boston Consulting Group. It was published just before Christmas. What that showed is that, under Labor's plan for the NBN, consumers would have faced internet price rises of up to 80 per cent and a total funding cost of $73 billion.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  It also showed that the project would take an extra four years to complete and demonstrated that there were alternative approaches using a range of technologies which would enable the project to be completed for $31 billion less in terms of total funding, and years earlier. That is a great outcome for the consumer because it means they will get better broadband sooner and it will be more affordable. The honourable member for Perth in her speech, and she has been interjecting while I have been speaking, asked about technologies for better, more efficient trenching of cables, fibre-optic cables or any cables, that are available. I imagine she was talking about micro trenching technologies. I can assure the honourable member that both I as the minister and the NBN Co even more so are very aware of that. But one of the things that the honourable member should bear in mind is that her colleague Senator Conroy, while the minister, arranged for the NBN Co to enter into a comprehensive agreement with Telstra of a take or pay kind whereby the NBN Co is obliged to use Telstra's ducts and pits and, if it does not use the nominated vast quantity of them, to pay them for it nonetheless. So yes, there are in some areas more cost-effective ways of putting fibre underground than horizontal drilling and installing new ducts and they can be taken into account. But the honourable members opposite have to remember that the government is not dealing with a blank sheet of paper here. We can only play the hand of cards that we have been dealt and what we have been left with by the previous government, and that has been a shocking mess.


Let me go on in the time available to me to continue as to what we have done. Among the things we have done, we have ensured that the board now has members who have spent lifetimes in the telecommunications sector, including Ziggy Switkowski, chairman and former CEO of Telstra, and in the case of Patrick Flannigan in the business of constructing distributed linear infrastructure. We now have a very qualified board. We have identified and engaged a new chief executive, Mr Bill Morrow, who is a very distinguished international telecom executive, highly regarded around the world as a turnaround specialist in the telecom sector. So now we have a highly qualified board and, joining us very shortly, a highly qualified CEO.


There is another review going on at the moment, which will be completed in March, of the satellite and fixed wireless part of the project, which faces, as many honourable members know, very, very serious problems—a mixture of misleading information being provided by the previous government coupled with what can only be described as bungling or incompetence in terms of the management of it. That report will be completed in March. This is a very considerable and expensive mess and, as I have said many times to honourable members, there are tens of billions of dollars that at the end of the day will have been wasted because of commitments made and decisions taken by the Labor government without proper homework.


One of the other things we are doing is conducting a thoroughgoing cost-benefit analysis. Of course, that should have been done by the previous government before they embarked on this in the first place, but it is better late than never. But it would have been better if it had been done at the outset.


The bottom line is that as far as the NBN project is concerned, the government's commitment is to be completely transparent and treat the people of Australia as you would treat the shareholders in a public listed company, to provide them with timely information about the state of the project and in effect to open the books of the NBN Co, and we are doing that. Instead of having to have rollout figures dragged out of the minister with great difficulty and pain, every week the NBN Co now publishes its latest rollout figures on its website. Every week they are published there. There will be a quarterly report done by the NBN Co management on the financial performance and of course the construction performance of the project. That will be done by the NBN Co management in exactly the same way as if it were a public listed company. Maximum transparency is going to be given to this project.


Honourable members should recognise that the failure of the NBN project under Labor has resulted in so many Australians who had no broadband in 2007 still not having it today. The truth is that some Australians have very good broadband—excellent broadband, world-class broadband. Many Australians have little or no broadband. You would think that, if the government were going to spend money on a broadband project, it would prioritise those who were in greatest need. But not only did the Labor government not do that, it did not even ask the question of where those underserved areas were. So shortly, we will be releasing a set of maps which show those parts of Australia—those districts, those neighbourhoods, if you like—where broadband services are good, okay, average and very, very poor. That information will inform the construction of the NBN so that, as far as practicable, the worst served areas are prioritised. Our commitment is to prioritise the worst served areas.


Ziggy Switkowski and I went out to Blacktown recently to see some work that had been committed to and planned under the previous government, which showed the NBN fibre being rolled out in streets where there was not one but two hybrid fibre co-ax networks. Under the ground there was Telstra's HFC; up on the poles was Optus's. From either of those networks residents in the street could order a 100-megabit-per-second service, yet that area was being prioritised when areas in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Craig Kelly, and indeed in outer suburban electorates in the big cities were being completely left behind. The former government did not even bother to ask the question in a systematic way as to where those underserved areas were.


There has been a massive cultural change in the management of the NBN Co. It is going to be run as a transparent business, being straight with the Australian people instead of treating it as a political exercise where any information it releases has to conform with the minister's political agenda and not otherwise.


Returning to this bill, the amendments in the bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, will ensure the sustainability of the proven co-regulatory telecommunications framework while continuing to safeguard the interests of Australian consumers. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:06):  On indulgence, I rise to acknowledge the passing of Ariel Sharon, former Prime Minister of Israel. Ariel Sharon was one of the architects of modern Israel. He was one of the founding fathers of the state of Israel. He was a soldier who fought during Israel's major historic wars before going on to become a political leader. At times a hawk, at times a dove, he reshaped the political landscape of Israel with his decision to pull out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. As a reflection of Australia's close relationship with Israel, Foreign Minister Bishop attended Mr Sharon's funeral to express the sympathies of the Australian government and the Australian people in person.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  On behalf of the federal opposition, I join with the Prime Minister in acknowledging the passing of Ariel Sharon. As a general and as a prime minister, Mr Sharon dedicated his life to fighting for his beliefs and the state of Israel. His deeds on the battlefield won him fame as one of Israel's most brilliant and courageous commanders. The same bravery and tactical acumen served him throughout his rise to the prime ministership. 


Undoubtedly Ariel Sharon was a fearless leader and, at times, a controversial figure. But in his final years as Prime Minister he made strides in the Israel-Palestine peace process, representing a courageous shift in his politics in favour of a two-state solution. All of those involved in the peace process should follow the example of courage that has historically been required to move the process forward. We should all rededicate ourselves to supporting this goal.


Ill health robbed Mr Sharon of a chance to complete his change of position and, indeed, to remake his legacy. We will never know how history would have judged him had he seen this through. Regardless of this, Ariel Sharon will loom large in the memories of his people and his country. He will be remembered as a great friend in the history of Australia. The nation of Israel and the Israeli people will deeply feel his loss. Our sympathies are with his family and with all those who mourn his passing.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:08):  I rise on indulgence to affirm the words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the passing of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. I was honoured to represent the Australian government at a memorial service for Ariel Sharon at the Knesset on 13 January and at his burial service at the Sharon family farm in Negev. I extended our deep condolences to Ariel Sharon's family, to the President and Prime Minister of Israel, and to the Israeli people on the passing of a man who dedicated his life to the nation of Israel. As United States Vice President Biden remarked during the memorial service, Ariel Sharon was a complex man who engendered strong views across the globe about his commitment and passion, his opinions and his work. But, Vice President Biden observed, like all leaders who make their mark on history, Ariel Sharon had a north star that guided him—and that was the survival of the state of Israel and the Jewish people. Throughout decades of service to the Israeli people, Ariel Sharon remained deeply committed to safeguarding Israel's security and prosperity. 


Australia remains firmly committed to Israel's right to exist in peace within secure and internationally recognised borders as much as we are committed to the two-state solution, which recognises a state for the Palestinian people where they too can live in peace and prosperity behind internationally recognised borders. We support resumed final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. We welcome the strong leadership shown by United States Secretary of State Kerry in bringing the Israelis and Palestinians to the table to find a negotiated political solution to the most contentious issues—including the final boundaries and status of settlements, refugees, Israel's security and the city of Jerusalem—in order to reach a just and lasting two-state solution. This is the only path to realising Ariel Sharon's enduring vision for a secure and prosperous Israel for generations to come. Australia joins with our friends in Israel in mourning the death of Ariel Sharon.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:10):  Ariel Sharon was, from any perspective, a significant figure in modern Israeli history. His life, controversial and full of struggle, mirrored much of the development of modern Israel. He was born in 1928, around 20 years before the establishment of the modern Israeli state, in what was then the British mandated territory of Palestine. It was a turbulent time, after a world war which carved national borders—still governing the Middle East—but before a second, which was to create the conditions from which modern Israel was born. In the 1940s, while the Holocaust was taking place in Europe, Sharon joined the military wing of the Zionist movement and was a soldier in the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. He became a decorated member of the Israeli Defense Forces, a brigadier general during the 1967 Six-Day War and a commander of an armoured division in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 


After the Yom Kippur War, Ariel Sharon turned to politics, where for most of his career he was a stalwart of the Israeli right. His time as defence minister ended in controversy after the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. His rise through Israeli politics to the prime ministership in the first decade of this century dominated the later part of Sharon's life. Israeli politics is, to the outsider, a mosaic built on the seemingly eternal effort to guarantee the country's very existence—an effort Ariel Sharon spent his entire adult life dedicated to. 


For someone with Sharon's history, it was perhaps unexpected that his time in office saw a shift towards a two-state solution in the peace process, as well as a large removal of settlers from Gaza. This sparked a ruction in Israeli politics, with Sharon breaking from his traditional Likud bastion to form the centrist Kadima. This took courage, and the fact that it was Ariel Sharon who made such a courageous stand is worthy of praise. 


The history of modern Israel, from its establishment, through numerous wars to the current decade, has been a struggle, and Ariel Sharon's whole life has been bound up with this struggle. What we do know is that a man who left the public stage a number of years ago and was, for much of his adult of life, a very significant figure in Israeli public life, has now departed. We offer our condolences to his family and to the state of Israel.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (14:39):  I note that the member for Petrie is right to be concerned about the impact of the carbon tax on the competitiveness of his warehouses, on his small manufacturing firms and on his construction firms, and there is a reason why. Members of the House will remember that throughout the term of the last government various members of the ALP said that the carbon tax was only ever going to touch 500 firms. The claim was not just made by the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. It was not just made by the former climate change minister, Greg Combet. It was not just made by the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley. It was also made by, amongst others, the now Leader of the Opposition: 500 firms only. So we asked Treasury to do a little bit of analysis for us. Do you know what they found? They found that it was not 500 companies, it was not 5,000 companies, it was not 50,000 companies. It was 75,000 companies that are directly hit by the carbon tax in terms of the fuel tax credit. Seventy-five thousand: just a small, little error! Just a 150-fold error of calculation—nothing compared with the budget difficulties which the Treasurer has to face that he inherited from the other side, but 75,000 firms.


What are these firms that are being hit? Think for a moment. Aviation: Qantas, $106 million in carbon tax; Virgin, $48 million; Rex Airlines, which described the carbon tax as 'disastrous'; Brindabella, which has gone into receivership. Domestic shipping and ferries; rail transport, whichever state you are in; mining; construction; small manufacturing firms; small warehousing businesses; and anybody using off-road diesel generators have been hit. So that is the reality of the carbon tax. Not 500, not 5,000, not 50,000 but, according to Treasury, 75,000 firms directly hit.


It gets worse than this, however, Prime Minister, because the opposition's policy is to extend the carbon tax on fuel to trucks and buses. That is still their policy. It would be great to know whether or not you are going to change that policy. But there is a better way than this, members of this House, and that is that in the coming weeks the carbon tax is before the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition can choose to provide relief not just to 75,000 firms but to 10 million Australian households who are paying higher electricity, gas and grocery prices. Now is the moment to take your senators back to work and get out of the way of lower electricity, gas and fuel prices.

(3) failing to support the workers, small businesses and communities affected by job losses;


(4) misleading the Australian people by blaming employees and their conditions for job losses; and 


(5) having no plan for Australian jobs.


Today we have heard from the Minister for Industry, who I accept would appear to be periodically be on the side of the angels when it comes to standing up for Australian workers. He said that this is not a catastrophe. He said it is a challenge. Indeed, at the end of last year after parliament, the Prime Minister put his verbal arms around and used his rhetorical skills of comfort and empathy to the Holden workers, when he said, 'Good luck, Holden workers, you have been liberated.' Why didn't we think of that? I am sure they would like to liberate you from your job too. But the real issue here is that we see a government—

Can anyone opposite have sufficient empathy to imagine the conversations which happened around the dinner table that night as the kids ask the parents:  'I have just seen Mum or Dad's work on TV. What does this all mean?'? Has anyone got the empathy to understand that not only are there the direct jobs at Toyota but there are tens of thousands of people in small businesses making auto components all around Australia? Has anyone got the empathy to understand the 55-year-old process worker on an assembly line, who has been a productive worker, who can work in a team, who is told that. 'Yes, there will be another job for you.'?


The government in the past has said they can go uranium mining. The government in the past has said, 'You have got three years of a job and we will sort things out in between now and then.' Yet in question time we asked them for a plan, because after all the government says everyone knows the car industry has been going for ever. Well if the car industry has been going forever, where is your plan? There is no plan. 


When we look at the blow beyond the sad news that goes to the individuals who are caught up in this turmoil beyond their control, we look at it and we see that again the government says, 'Oh, well, we've seen a reduction by a quarter in the size of the automotive industry.' Well let me tell you opposite: in your five months you have taken the other three-quarters of the car industry and you have wrecked it. When we talk about who is actually affected, it is not just people working on an assembly line at Fishermans Bend or in Altona. There are 7,000 people in Queensland who make auto components. There are 7,000 in Sydney who make auto components. Let me put this on record: this North Sydney based government does not understand manufacturing in the southern states of Australia. They have never seen a Victorian or South Australian job they would ever fight for other than their own marginal seat MPs. 


Let us look at this marvellous deal which the government has done for the Australian taxpayer, saying, 'Well, we are not going to give any more subsidy here because we are too smart.' We understand that this is not good business. How much in tax revenue will disappear when these people do not have a job and Toyota leaves? What will be the cost of the retraining bill to retrain tens of thousands of people? How much extra in Centrelink payments will there be because those people opposite have never seen an Australian job worth fighting for? What is going to be the implications for people who do not have a job and have the misery of unemployment and who cannot accumulate superannuation? Will it be a further challenge in terms of the age pension? What about the thousands of small businesses who supply products in the automotive sector? They have been abandoned by those opposite. In 66 years in Australia, under Fraser, under Howard, under Menzies—at least we had a car industry, but not under Prime Minister Abbott. Toyota, for every dollar of government assistance they get, they invest $20. But these people opposite are so clever. They are so clever. They are so adult-like in the way they run the government. They have said to Toyota, 'Rather than give you our one dollar rather than give you a dollar from us we will get rid of the $20 you give us.' That is not mathematics. These people are creating a jobs deficit in this country that will take years and years to get out of. 


Then we heard the argument that nothing was going to happen. These people got into office—and they wanted the white cars, the desks and to give lectures to half of Australia as they divide them—but they did not want to work hard to save jobs in Australia.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will come back to the substance of the motion. This is a suspension motion.




Mr SHORTEN:
  They say it is the dollar, 'We can't do anything about the dollar.' When it came to Cadbury they could do something about the dollar.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I hesitate to take a point of order on the Leader of the Opposition's speech, but the Leader of the Opposition has to make some effort to explain why standing orders should be suspended in order to allow this debate. Therefore, he has to indicate why his motion should have a higher priority than the rest of the government's agenda before the House. He does not just have to pay lip-service to your request for him to do so. Perhaps he would like to take some tutelage from other members on that side of the House who have done this before.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House. He is quite correct. I have asked the Leader of the Opposition to refer his remarks to the substance of the motion. If he had done so, we would not have needed to have that point of order.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Standing orders should be suspended because we saw tens of thousands of jobs on the chopping block yesterday and that is an important issue. We know that it has happened on this government's watch. That is why the standing orders should be suspended. We had Holden, which the Treasurer goaded to go. The car components industry needs two large car manufacturers to be able to justify their volume and scale. They are in trouble. They have told that to Toyota. Toyota said yesterday, 'It's getting the scale that is the challenge, including the components suppliers.' This government have never seen an Australian job they want to fight for. Now they shrug their shoulders and say: 'It's just the cycle in things. Some jobs go and some jobs come.' That is not right. This tide of jobs is going overseas.


Before the election you could not get the now government, then opposition, spokespeople away. Between manufacturing workers and cameras were opposition spokespersons saying: 'We're on your side.' I bet a Tatts ticket that the Prime Minister will not be visiting Toyota workers any time in the next three years. There is no fear of being mugged by a Liberal spokesperson at a car company. That will be a government-free zone.


The real problem is that before the election this government said, 'We are for manufacturing.' They said in 2011—and the record speaks for itself—'Without a car industry, you can't be a First World economy.' They said, 'Without a car industry, a steel industry, a cement industry and an aluminium industry you can't be a sophisticated economy.' What great news it is now for Australia. These people are dumbing down the Australian economy. They have no plan for the future of jobs. What is worse, what is most culpable, about the crew opposite is that they will not fight.



This government have a choice. Do they want to race to the bottom or do they want to race to the top? Do they want this country to be a smarter country or a poorer country? They have surrendered the war to keep manufacturing in Australia and the list of battle defeats includes Electrolux, Simplot and the Gove refinery. Two thousand people are going to have to move out of Gove—and that will create a ghost town up there—because this government does not know how to stand up for people. The real shame of this government is that they think they can run Australia by dividing Australia. Let me give one warning to the government. You think you can divide Australia, can give up on manufacturing, can blame employees and can keep hunting down all those who disagree with you and blame them, but the Australian people will mark you down for the death of the car industry because we hold you responsible.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:19):  I am pleased to speak on the suspension of standing orders motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition because it gives me an opportunity to explain to the House why the standing orders should not be suspended. The government should be allowed to get on with its program of trying to fix the Australian economy and repair the damage left to us by a very bad government after six years of mismanagement and malpractice of the budget, industrial relations and the economy of this country. If the opposition were serious about trying to help the workers of Australia and were serious about economic growth, they would not be moving to suspend the standing orders and delay the House from getting on with its business; they would be allowing the House to get on with its program of abolishing the carbon tax, abolishing the minerals resource rent tax, bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission to put a tough cop on the industrial beat, introducing the registered organisations commission to stop dodgy union officials from ripping off the hardworking union members who join their unions, and supporting a Heydon royal commission into union governance and corruption.


If the opposition were serious about repairing the Australian economy and joining with the government, they would not be blocking savings measures in the Senate right now—$5 billion of their own savings measures they announced before the election. Inexplicably they now oppose these measures in the Senate along with other savings resolutions that we announced before the election and reaffirmed in MYEFO. If the opposition were serious about supporting jobs growth in Australia, they would not be wasting the time of the House on suspending the standing orders; they would be getting out of the way of the government in reducing regulation and red tape, and supporting the Minister for the Environment's program of a one-stop shop for environmental approvals across Australia so that development can get moving and so that the investment pipeline can start employing workers across Australia. But we know that the opposition will not do that, because they are not genuinely interested in workers' jobs at all. The most startling aspect of the Leader of the Opposition's motion is his breathtaking hypocrisy. He was the minister for workplace relations from December 2011 to September 2013. In that period unemployment climbed from 624,000 to 697,000. In that period 72,900 Australians lost their jobs, their employment, across many businesses—big, medium and small—around Australia when he was the minister for workplace relations. So 72,900 jobs hang around his neck that were lost on his watch. That is more people than the electors in Lingiari, that is more people than the electors in Solomon, that is more people than the electors in Bass, that is more people than the electors in Braddon, that is more people than the electors in Denison. The Leader of the Opposition is responsible for the loss of more jobs in more people's homes than the number of electors in the six seats of those members of the House.


So it is breathtaking in its extraordinariness that the Leader of the Opposition would come into this place and try to wear the clothes of concern for the workers of Australia, because it was under his watch that the Australian Building and Construction Commission was firstly defanged and then abolished. It was under his watch, in cahoots with Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister and the former member for Lalor, that he ensured the union movement got everything it wanted from the previous government. This was exposed by Martin Ferguson in Peter Hartcher's column in TheSydney Morning Herald about what went wrong for Labor. He pointed out that there was a secret meeting at Kirribilli House—another Kirribilli pact—in which Julia Gillard said to the union movement, 'In exchange for complete support against Kevin Rudd, we will do whatever you want us to do'. And so by the end of the Gillard government it was the union's agenda that was entirely in place.


After six years of a Labor government, we inherited a wreckage of an economy, a wreckage of a budget and an industrial relations system that was sclerotic, paralysed and in crisis. It is those problems that we are attempting to address through our policies. And so we are setting about repairing the budget; we are setting about clearing the hurdles for development approvals; we are setting about reducing red tape and regulation, not least of which is in my own portfolio through international education. I am working with the minister for immigration in streamlining the visa-processing arrangements so that more good Australian businesses can grow their businesses as we employ more Australians in international education. We are deregulating the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to allow more deregulation in higher education to grow the economy. And that is just in my portfolio.


We are reducing waste of taxpayers' dollars by stopping the boats through Operation Sovereign Borders. Over time we will save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. We are getting on with the agenda, and the Labor Party should let us get on with our agenda. And this suspension of standing orders—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.




Mr PYNE:
  delays the House.




Mr Dreyfus:
  Sit down!



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat.




Mr Dreyfus:
  You don't have the call.




Mr PYNE:
  Get back to Toorak!




Mr Burke:
  Notwithstanding that in his last breath the Leader of the House started to refer to the motion before the House again, for some time he has drifted a very long way and should be reminded of the point of order that he actually brought to your attention. It probably applies more to himself than to anyone else.



The SPEAKER:  I will ignore the latter comment, but the substance of the point of order is reasonable. I ask the Leader of the House to return to the subject matter, which is the motion.




Mr PYNE:
  I thank you, Madam Speaker. My point to the House is that the opposition should not be wasting the time of this parliament on suspensions of standing orders in which the Leader of the Opposition does not really believe. The Labor Party does not really believe in it either, because when it was in government it did not put in place the policies that would grow employment in this country. It introduced a carbon tax. Our program is to repeal it and it should allow us to get on and do it. It introduced a minerals resource rent tax, which hurt investment and jobs in the mining sector. It should allow us to get on with our program of repealing it. It abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It should allow us to get on with our program of re-establishing it in order to boost productivity, because the last time there was an ABCC it saved consumers $7.5 billion a year, it increased productivity in the building construction industry by 16.8 per cent and days lost through industrial action declined dramatically when that ABCC was in place. So rather than moving suspensions of standing orders in which the opposition does not really believe, it should instead be allowing the parliament to get on with the job of putting a tough cop on the beat, abolishing the carbon tax, abolishing the minerals resource rent tax and allowing our deregulation agenda and our agenda to grow businesses and reinstall confidence.


If the opposition was serious about jobs, it would get on board with our program of creating jobs in infrastructure, letting us be the infrastructure government that it was not. If it did, if it got out of the way of the government's agenda—and it could do it tomorrow by passing legislation that is stuck in the Senate—we would have: the East West Link being built, 3,200 jobs in construction; the WestConnex, 10,000 jobs during construction; and the Pacific Highway upgrade, 8,000 jobs during construction. These are real jobs that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are standing in the way of by not allowing the government to get on with their parliamentary and legislative agenda. Instead, the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition is to turn up here as a union official continuing to support union officials; being an unreconstructed union leader running a protection racket for a protection racket. 


If he wants to be the prime minister, he needs to learn to rise above his background. He cannot do so because he is entirely beholden to the union movement. When the union movement asks him to dance, he takes out his dancing shoes and shows that he can boogie with the best of them. When they name a tune, he starts making his moves, busting his moves on behalf of the union movement. If he were serious about growing the economy, if he were serious about jobs, he would not waste the House's time with suspensions of standing orders. Instead he would support our program, pass the legislation in the Senate and allow the economy to begin to grow and for Australians to have the jobs that they need and want.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (15:29):  This suspension motion needs to be passed so that we have an opportunity to debate the censure of the Prime Minister of this country. The reason we need to debate the censure of this Prime Minister is that on his watch, yesterday, we saw an iconic company decide to leave our shores for good. Of course, that comes off the back of the decision by Holden in December to do exactly that. The last time we were sitting here, we watched the spectacle of the Treasurer of this country goading Holden to leave this country, and they did. Other than creating terrible circumstances for every Holden worker in Australia, that created a situation where it was believed that this government had no appetite for the car industry. That is what we saw. Unfortunately, it was quite inevitable, given the government's positioning, rhetoric and lack of support for the car industry, that Toyota would decide to leave this country, as they did, tragically, yesterday.


We have seen so many companies decide to leave or to close down as a result of the election of this government. We should not be that surprised. Since September we have seen a net loss of 54,000 full-time jobs in in this country. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised there would be one million jobs in five years. We should be heading towards 100,000 jobs in the first six months of this term. We are not heading towards 100,000 jobs in the first six months of this term; we are already 54,000 full-time jobs down. That is because this government has no regard for companies or for workers in this country. Instead, it has an ideological motive to go after its political opponents.


Yesterday, when the company was making an announcement, the Prime Minister was making an entirely different announcement. He announced a political stunt to effectively go after the people he does not like. If he was fair dinkum about engaging in criminal matters, he would refer those matters to the police and provide the resources to the police and the Australian Crime Commission. Instead, the Prime Minister was out yesterday at a doorstop, announcing what is a political stunt, a political exercise, and a highly expensive use of taxpayers' money. At the same time, Toyota was making the announcement that this company was leaving this country for good.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hesitate to interrupt the member for Gorton, but obviously he has to try and explain to the parliament why the suspension of standing orders should be agreed to, because this item of business takes priority over all others. When I was in opposition I used to routinely attempt to do that; he is making no attempt to do that.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House. I would ask the member for Gorton to address the suspension.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I am very happy to explain, if indeed the member is too obtuse to understand this.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Gorton will resume his seat. I directed him to address his remarks to the substance of the motion, not to be insulting.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
   If the member is insulted, I am afraid that is—



The SPEAKER:  I took the insult to come towards me, not towards the member. So perhaps you could apologise to me, Member for Gorton.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I am sorry, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The reason that we need to move the suspension of standing orders is that we need to debate the censuring of this Prime Minister, because he has been asleep on his watch, while thousands of Australian workers have lost their jobs. There is also the fact that the government cannot even see that this is such an important day, such a tragic day. They cannot explain why we would want to move a censure motion to have a debate in this place. We wanted to censure the Prime Minister. They chose to deny us that, and so, of course, we are debating this.


But let's be very clear. In December, we saw a Treasurer goad an iconic company about them leaving our shores, and they decided to leave. Yesterday, we saw Toyota follow Holden out the door, leaving thousands and thousands of workers without jobs and leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without any certainty for the future.

Mr SHORTEN:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion forthwith:


That the House censures the Prime Minister for:


(1) failing to stand up and fight for Australian jobs at:


(a) Toyota;


(b) Electrolux;


(c) Simplot;


(d) Holden;


(e) Qantas;


(f) Ford;


(g) the Gove alumina refinery;


(h) SPC Ardmona; and


(i) countless other small businesses around Australia;


(2) failing to lead a Government united in supporting and protecting Australian manufacturing jobs;


(3) failing to support the workers, small businesses and communities affected by job losses;


(4) misleading the Australian people by blaming employees and their conditions for job losses; and 


(5) having no plan for Australian jobs.


Today we have heard from the Minister for Industry, who I accept would appear to be periodically be on the side of the angels when it comes to standing up for Australian workers. He said that this is not a catastrophe. He said it is a challenge. Indeed, at the end of last year after parliament, the Prime Minister put his verbal arms around and used his rhetorical skills of comfort and empathy to the Holden workers, when he said, 'Good luck, Holden workers, you have been liberated.' Why didn't we think of that? I am sure they would like to liberate you from your job too. But the real issue here is that we see a government—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will relate it to the suspension motion.

It was under his watch, in cahoots with Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister and the former member for Lalor, that he ensured the union movement got everything it wanted from the previous government. This was exposed by Martin Ferguson in Peter Hartcher's column in TheSydney Morning Herald about what went wrong for Labor. He pointed out that there was a secret meeting at Kirribilli House—another Kirribilli pact—in which Julia Gillard said to the union movement, 'In exchange for complete support against Kevin Rudd, we will do whatever you want us to do'. And so by the end of the Gillard government it was the union's agenda that was entirely in place.


After six years of a Labor government, we inherited a wreckage of an economy, a wreckage of a budget and an industrial relations system that was sclerotic, paralysed and in crisis. It is those problems that we are attempting to address through our policies. And so we are setting about repairing the budget; we are setting about clearing the hurdles for development approvals; we are setting about reducing red tape and regulation, not least of which is in my own portfolio through international education. I am working with the minister for immigration in streamlining the visa-processing arrangements so that more good Australian businesses can grow their businesses as we employ more Australians in international education. We are deregulating the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to allow more deregulation in higher education to grow the economy. And that is just in my portfolio.


We are reducing waste of taxpayers' dollars by stopping the boats through Operation Sovereign Borders. Over time we will save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. We are getting on with the agenda, and the Labor Party should let us get on with our agenda. And this suspension of standing orders—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.




Mr PYNE:
  delays the House.




Mr Dreyfus:
  Sit down!



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat.




Mr Dreyfus:
  You don't have the call.




Mr PYNE:
  Get back to Toorak!




Mr Burke:
  Notwithstanding that in his last breath the Leader of the House started to refer to the motion before the House again, for some time he has drifted a very long way and should be reminded of the point of order that he actually brought to your attention. It probably applies more to himself than to anyone else.



The SPEAKER:  I will ignore the latter comment, but the substance of the point of order is reasonable. I ask the Leader of the House to return to the subject matter, which is the motion.




Mr PYNE:
  I thank you, Madam Speaker. My point to the House is that the opposition should not be wasting the time of this parliament on suspensions of standing orders in which the Leader of the Opposition does not really believe. The Labor Party does not really believe in it either, because when it was in government it did not put in place the policies that would grow employment in this country. It introduced a carbon tax. Our program is to repeal it and it should allow us to get on and do it. It introduced a minerals resource rent tax, which hurt investment and jobs in the mining sector. It should allow us to get on with our program of repealing it. It abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It should allow us to get on with our program of re-establishing it in order to boost productivity, because the last time there was an ABCC it saved consumers $7.5 billion a year, it increased productivity in the building construction industry by 16.8 per cent and days lost through industrial action declined dramatically when that ABCC was in place. So rather than moving suspensions of standing orders in which the opposition does not really believe, it should instead be allowing the parliament to get on with the job of putting a tough cop on the beat, abolishing the carbon tax, abolishing the minerals resource rent tax and allowing our deregulation agenda and our agenda to grow businesses and reinstall confidence.


If the opposition was serious about jobs, it would get on board with our program of creating jobs in infrastructure, letting us be the infrastructure government that it was not. If it did, if it got out of the way of the government's agenda—and it could do it tomorrow by passing legislation that is stuck in the Senate—we would have: the East West Link being built, 3,200 jobs in construction; the WestConnex, 10,000 jobs during construction; and the Pacific Highway upgrade, 8,000 jobs during construction. These are real jobs that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are standing in the way of by not allowing the government to get on with their parliamentary and legislative agenda. Instead, the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition is to turn up here as a union official continuing to support union officials; being an unreconstructed union leader running a protection racket for a protection racket. 


If he wants to be the prime minister, he needs to learn to rise above his background. He cannot do so because he is entirely beholden to the union movement. When the union movement asks him to dance, he takes out his dancing shoes and shows that he can boogie with the best of them. When they name a tune, he starts making his moves, busting his moves on behalf of the union movement. If he were serious about growing the economy, if he were serious about jobs, he would not waste the House's time with suspensions of standing orders. Instead he would support our program, pass the legislation in the Senate and allow the economy to begin to grow and for Australians to have the jobs that they need and want.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (15:29):  This suspension motion needs to be passed so that we have an opportunity to debate the censure of the Prime Minister of this country. The reason we need to debate the censure of this Prime Minister is that on his watch, yesterday, we saw an iconic company decide to leave our shores for good. Of course, that comes off the back of the decision by Holden in December to do exactly that. The last time we were sitting here, we watched the spectacle of the Treasurer of this country goading Holden to leave this country, and they did. Other than creating terrible circumstances for every Holden worker in Australia, that created a situation where it was believed that this government had no appetite for the car industry. That is what we saw. Unfortunately, it was quite inevitable, given the government's positioning, rhetoric and lack of support for the car industry, that Toyota would decide to leave this country, as they did, tragically, yesterday.


We have seen so many companies decide to leave or to close down as a result of the election of this government. We should not be that surprised. Since September we have seen a net loss of 54,000 full-time jobs in in this country. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised there would be one million jobs in five years. We should be heading towards 100,000 jobs in the first six months of this term. We are not heading towards 100,000 jobs in the first six months of this term; we are already 54,000 full-time jobs down. That is because this government has no regard for companies or for workers in this country. Instead, it has an ideological motive to go after its political opponents.


Yesterday, when the company was making an announcement, the Prime Minister was making an entirely different announcement. He announced a political stunt to effectively go after the people he does not like. If he was fair dinkum about engaging in criminal matters, he would refer those matters to the police and provide the resources to the police and the Australian Crime Commission. Instead, the Prime Minister was out yesterday at a doorstop, announcing what is a political stunt, a political exercise, and a highly expensive use of taxpayers' money. At the same time, Toyota was making the announcement that this company was leaving this country for good.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hesitate to interrupt the member for Gorton, but obviously he has to try and explain to the parliament why the suspension of standing orders should be agreed to, because this item of business takes priority over all others. When I was in opposition I used to routinely attempt to do that; he is making no attempt to do that.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Leader of the House. I would ask the member for Gorton to address the suspension.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I am very happy to explain, if indeed the member is too obtuse to understand this.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Gorton will resume his seat. I directed him to address his remarks to the substance of the motion, not to be insulting.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
   If the member is insulted, I am afraid that is—



The SPEAKER:  I took the insult to come towards me, not towards the member. So perhaps you could apologise to me, Member for Gorton.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I am sorry, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The reason that we need to move the suspension of standing orders is that we need to debate the censuring of this Prime Minister, because he has been asleep on his watch, while thousands of Australian workers have lost their jobs. There is also the fact that the government cannot even see that this is such an important day, such a tragic day. They cannot explain why we would want to move a censure motion to have a debate in this place. We wanted to censure the Prime Minister. They chose to deny us that, and so, of course, we are debating this.


But let's be very clear. In December, we saw a Treasurer goad an iconic company about them leaving our shores, and they decided to leave. Yesterday, we saw Toyota follow Holden out the door, leaving thousands and thousands of workers without jobs and leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without any certainty for the future.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:50):  The government has failed to protect Australian jobs at a range of important Australian employers. There can be no more important obligation on a government other than the defence of the nation than to create the economic circumstances where jobs are created and jobs are maintained. We have a major jobs crisis looming in this country. This is not just another day at the office, as the government would have us believe. The rollcall of announced job losses since 7 September 2013 is horrendous: at Toyota, 2,500 direct jobs; at Holden, 2,900 direct jobs; at Qantas, 1,000 direct jobs; at Rio Tinto at the Gove refinery, 1,100 jobs; at Electrolux in Orange, 544 jobs; at Simplot, 110 jobs; at Peabody, more than 200 jobs; at Caterpillar, 200 jobs; and many other indirect jobs and many other small businesses. What we have here is a government who would much rather play political games than fight for jobs. 


We have seen 54,000 jobs lost since this current government has come to power. The challenge of jobs in Australia is a real challenge—we get that. We get that there are challenges in the Australian economy from the dollar and the fluctuating currency as well as the challenge of making sure that we constantly innovate. But the Prime Minister has failed to support Australian manufacturing jobs in particular. He could have done more to keep Holden here. I seriously doubt that he has done anything to try and keep Toyota here, and certainly the car component manufacturers who are here have a very bleak future indeed.


This poor car industry, which the government keeps saying was going to die anyway, did not expect the sort of economic euthanasia where the government is just going to pull the plug and speed up the challenges faced by the car industry. As I said earlier in this House, I have a bit of time for the Minister for Industry. I know a number of government MPs are concerned about jobs, including the courageous member for Murray, but I do not have any time for a view that the loss of jobs is not a catastrophe. Labor in opposition understand that unemployment is a misery. We stand firmly for making sure not only that people can find work but that people can keep work. People do not choose the liberation of unemployment after working for years on a car line at Holden or at Toyota. There is no great life on the unemployment queue. Imagine, if you will, the people who are losing their jobs, many in their 50s and 60s. The labour market is incredibly tough. 


Of course, the government say, 'We're all for the level playing field,' but somehow if Australia has any form of industry policy that is not good economics. First, that is lazy economics from the government who do not understand it is not a simple proposition that if you do not spend some resources to help companies update and innovate somehow you save money and there is no cost. Why is it that the government so wilfully ignore the consequences of companies closing? What do they not understand about weeks and weeks, months and months of people in the unemployment queue and how that saps your morale? How does that help kids whose parents have lost their jobs? How does that help relieve pressure on families?


This government will give you money for marriage counselling but not help to keep your job. Let me tell you, if you do not have a job that puts bigger pressure on your marriage than will be helped by some $200 voucher from the member for Menzies. When you look at what they will not do, not only do they not have a genuine view on helping Australian jobs but the mob opposite are also inconsistent. They fail to grasp the big difference between a can of SPC baked beans and a bar of Cadbury chocolate. The only difference I see in terms of government policy—



Mr Stephen Jones interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  You would want watch out: there is a health issue—I get that. Why is it that the government will bail out Cadbury and not help SPC? If the new definition in Abbottland is that you have to be a tourist attraction, the only tourism attractions being created in the car industry are museums. What are they doing about SPC? They say no-one is interested in visiting it, but a lot of people go to the Goulburn Valley because of its healthy economy and there are things to do there. If the new test for industry policy is tourism, why are they bailing out a fish farm in Tasmania when they will not go to the Gove refinery?


I went to Gove last Friday with Senator Nova Perris and the member for Lingiari and saw the disaster unfolding there. This is a regional centre, a small country town of 4,000 people. Last year, Rio Tinto said, 'If we can get a gas contract from the government of the Northern Territory, we're going to invest for a long time to come.' Rio Tinto held a party and invited everyone to come when the gas contract was signed. Then the CLP Chief Minister, Adam Giles, said, 'We're not doing this contract anymore.' Bang, boom—there goes the future! Then Rio Tinto said it would shut the refinery by August. That is called curtailment, in business-speak; I call it the loss of livelihood, in straight-speak. Where are the government? Have they picked up the phone to call Rio Tinto? It is not as if they are not helping Rio Tinto by giving back hundreds of millions of dollars in mining tax. Why not spend 50c to ring Rio Tinto and say: 'We get that there are a thousand houses there and only 200 people with jobs living in those houses. We get that self-funded retirees bought houses in Gove based on the promise of ongoing work.' Why not offer to help buy back the houses at the value people relied on when the houses were built?


That does not require taxpayer money; that just requires a bit of government heart, a bit of government courage. When talking about Gove, for instance—although this is not limited to Gove—why don't they build some Defence facilities there? Why don't they talk about making it an educational hub for the Indigenous people living in the Arnhem Land area? Of course, they will not do anything, but what really disturbs me about the government is not their lack of action on Gove, appalling as that is, or that they rubbish the food-canning workers at SPC—I agree with Sharman Stone, the government did lie about the conditions of food-preserving workers and have never apologised because they are so arrogant they do not know when to admit they are wrong, even when the whole of Australia knows they are wrong—but that they do not have a plan.


We will fight the jobs issue every day till the next election. It really worries me that we have a government who will not fight for anything except their own jobs. We know this is not just another cycle in manufacturing. Members of the government are on notice that Labor is saying there is a tide dragging our jobs overseas and they are collectively responsible if they do not speak up and do something. I acknowledge the member for Murray who has some courage. I suspect the Minister for Industry has been mugged by his colleagues, but I think he has shown some signs of having a heart. I tell you, hearts are in short supply in those opposite. Was this car industry death a foregone conclusion, other than by the Minister for Employment who is running around blaming the workers? Whatever the question, Senator Abetz will blame workers and unions. He is a pre-programmed automaton on that question.


The real issue is what plan do those opposite have for all these people who are losing their jobs? What plan do you have? They cannot all make chocolate at Cadbury in Tasmania. They cannot all work at the fish farm in Tasmania. They cannot all work at GrainCorp, that you stopped the Americans from buying. So it is not as if you are fair dinkum ideologically. You can be as consistent or inconsistent as the politics demands. What is your plan for real people? What is your plan for the voters and the constituents in your electorates and mine? What do you really think about people who have lost their job? What is your plan to retrain them? Our challenge to those opposite is to start fighting for Aussie jobs. Our challenge to those opposite is: have a plan for the people they are selling out through neglect and negligence. (Time expired)

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom—Minister for Industry) (16:00):  We have just heard 10 minutes of confected rage by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me read this quote: 


Our nation is facing an historic shift the like of which we have not seen in two generations. That does not mean that change will be easy or swift. These are incredibly challenging times.


That was Senator Kim Carr in 2011, then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. The Labor Party in opposition are pretending they knew nothing about this in government, that this has all happened since our government was elected. Nothing could be further from the truth. The seeds of what has happened in the last four months were sown well and truly by the previous government. Why are we taking a considered, careful and long-term approach to the solution? It is because we want a solution that is sustainable. We want to protect jobs in the long term. We do not want bandaids, which were so prevalent from the previous government. They simply get ripped off three, six or nine months down the track. How about a couple of examples.


In 2012, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced $34 million for Ford, saying it would create 300 new jobs. What happened? Three-hundred and thirty jobs were lost at Ford inside eight months. Is that a constructive, long-term solution or is that chequebook diplomacy where you run down the street, throw as much money as you can at the problem knowing that it will not solve anything? The then Prime Minister did it again and announced $215 million for Holden, saying it would secure its future in Australia until 2022. Within months, 670 jobs were gone.


This is a problem that needs to be solved. It does not need to be politicised. The workers who are going to lose their jobs in these factories do not need to be frightened by words like 'catastrophe'. They need a policy, a long-term solution. They need to know that the government will help them transition from an industry which has become a commodity industry, arguably one of the most competitive industries in the world, certainly an industry which is going through enormous restructure wherever you go. We are trying to compete in a world market. Surely no-one on that side will deny that. Surely no-one will deny that the Australian car market is the most diverse car market in the world. No-one will deny that. No-one on the other side will deny that if we are to have a future for an industry in Australia, we need to export. Rather than running around throwing $34 million cheques here and $215 million cheques there, only to see it all unravel, our government have a very careful and considered approach to this issue and we have had it since day one.


From day one, I set out to put in place a policy for the car industry, but they had already made their decision. We know now, because the GM executive said it at the Detroit motor show when he said that no amount of money would keep Holden in Australia—no amount of money. So the Labor Party says, 'Just throw more at them and more at them.' It is taxpayers' money that has to be borrowed, because we are so far in debt and deficit thanks to the economic mismanagement of the previous government. It is taxpayers' money that has to be borrowed. There has to be a solution, not a six- or eight-month fix, not a 24-hour news cycle fix, not a bucket of money thrown in—to find that 330 jobs have evaporated. 


We sat down and talked with industry generally. We looked at where the trends were. I was in South Australia last week talking with industries which are world leaders in their field, industries like Redarc that set out to produce the best battery charger in the world and do it, industries that set out to build the best high-frequency radios in the world and do it, industries that set out to build the best metal detectors in the world or the most advanced air conditioning systems in the world and do it. 


Yet if you listen to those on the other side of the chamber, the world is over for manufacturing in Australia. Can I assure the workers of Australia that that is simply not the case. That is raw, frightening politics from people who have done nothing for industry in six years except put on bandaids, which are now falling off left, right and centre. No amount of money would have kept Electrolux in Australia. I spoke to the global head of Electrolux. He said, 'We want to move that factory to Thailand and we are going to do it. No amount of money will help.' I said, 'Let's sit down and talk about it.' He said, no, and he had made the decision. The seeds of that closure were sown in the previous government. 


The same thing is the case in Gove. Rio Tinto asked for gas and we got them gas. Rio Tinto asked for underwriting of the pipeline and we offered it. Rio Tinto then said, 'We are never going to keep it open.' They had made their decision. Yet those who sit opposite now cry and frighten workers in Australia. Rio Tinto had made that decision when those people opposite were in government.



Mr Champion interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  Order! There's only one speaker who has the call at the moment and that's the minister.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  We must look forward. We are in a time of great adversity—no-one denies that. We are in a situation where industry in Australia will be changed forever, but we have an opportunity to make sure that we do this properly to ensure Australians have jobs in the long term. That is what government is about. We are responding. We are reviewing. This was already rolling because from day one when I became industry minister I could tell that industry in Australia was on its knees. Industry had been battling a carbon tax, battling regulation, battling red tape and battling to remain competitive with the high dollar. It needed a complete study done and that is what we are doing. We have reviews going on in South Australia and Victoria. We are assisted in those reviews by ministers and by local members. I congratulate businesses in Victoria and South Australia for their input last week. We have a task force chaired by the Prime Minister to develop a national industry investment and competitiveness agenda. We have already set aside $1½ billion for infrastructure projects in the next six years in South Australia and $6½ billion for infrastructure projects in Victoria.


We have made it clear that we are more than happy to work with the Victorian and South Australian governments. We want to see industry continued to be a driver in the Australian economy but, unlike Labor, who want to see government at the centre of business, we want to enable business to be competitive, to grow their exports, to put in place long-term jobs. We want to make sure we have an industry base that is sustainable and strong. We will not do that with the policies of the previous government—taxes, regulations, interference, constant attacks on industry itself. This government has a plan and we will make sure that that policy is put in place. If we do not, we will simply have let down not just the workers at Toyota, not just the workers in every industry in Australia but all Australians. We are an innovative, clever country. We have arisen from adversity before. We have taken up the challenges which have presented to us. I am absolutely confident, when I look at the Australian workforce, that we can do that again. This challenge must be met and this government will continue to stand behind the workers not only of Toyota, not only of Ford and not only of Holden, but every worker in Australia so that they know their job is secure and that there is a sustainable industry policy in place. This government will make responsible decisions to make sure that happens. (Time expired)

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (16:10):  I understand the difficulties the minister has in this debate because, clearly, what he has sought to do has not been supported by any of his colleagues. I do not think it is reasonable for the opposition to be lectured to by the government on scaremongering workers. In the last three years the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister, spent his entire time scaring workers with false claims about an industrial Armageddon as a result of policies of the previous government, none of which came true. The other thing I would note is that the Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, spent his entire time using blue-collar workers as a backdrop to media conferences. There he was, with his vest and his hardhat, standing with journos in front of him and workers behind him as he went on about his scare campaign. But he is nowhere to be seen now in the workplaces which are threatened by a number of things, not least of all by government policy or government inaction. So it is completely ludicrous for the minister to assert that somehow we are raising the spectre of concern when we are seeing thousands of jobs leave our shores against what we witnessed when the Prime Minister was opposition leader. 


The other thing to note most importantly in this debate about why we should support the car industry is the comment made by the minister when he said we were providing too much support for the car industry. To make some comparisons: we are one of only 13 countries building cars from beginning to end and that includes developed nations. We spend $17.40 per capita of taxpayers' money in this country, compared with Germany which spends $90 per capita, and the United States which spends $264 per capita. So it is clear that whatever support we have provided, which 250,000 jobs ultimately rely upon, it is far less per capita than many other nations. For the government to pretend otherwise means they want to fly in the face of facts.


What we have seen this week is a tragedy for, firstly, the Toyota workers who face an uncertain future, the 170 component companies which now have a very uncertain future and all their employees, and, secondly, when those companies hit the wall the devastating and rippling effects will go beyond the automotive sector. We need to hear the Prime Minister not blaming the workers or blaming unions but providing a jobs plan for the future. Today we heard the Prime Minister in question time and we heard the minister in this debate but they had no plan about what they will do to provide support for workers who will lose their jobs very shortly. We have heard no plan whatsoever about emerging technologies and the so-called new economy and what they will do to create the environment for workers to be sufficiently capable to transition into that area—no plan whatsoever. 


It is quite concerning that the member for Murray is not on the speakers' list in this debate. The member for Murray deserves to speak in this debate. She should be given the opportunity by the government whip to speak so that she can articulate on behalf of the workers and SPC and, indeed, the community of Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley what they know about the lack of government support for that company. We accept that the government cannot save every job—we understand that. We are not pretending that the government can protect every job but they need to be doing everything they can to do just that. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister, when he suggested that SPC workers were getting certain conditions of employment, was found to be completely and utterly wrong. The cabinet decision was predicated on a lie. The member for Murray deserves to speak in this debate along with many members on this side who have some terrible stories to tell about their constituents who will lose jobs as a result of government inaction which has occurred on their watch.

Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment) (16:15):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is a very important debate in this parliament and let me open by saying: every job loss is a tragedy; every job loss has impacts on communities; and job losses on a large scale are a particular tragedy. That is why the coalition is absolutely focused on creating one million jobs over the next five years and two million jobs over the next 10 years.


We inherited a very difficult budget position. We inherited a financial position which had, as the Treasurer pointed out, $123 billion in projected deficits and a debt that was spiralling towards $667 billion if nothing is done. That was the waste and the profligacy that we inherited from those members opposite as a result of their irresponsible economic management. 


The government is focused on creating new jobs, but it is the private sector that is the generator of jobs in the Australian economy. We need to get the economic settings right so that businesses can prosper and grow. That is why the coalition is committed to axing the job-destroying carbon tax, the tax that is weighing so heavily on businesses large and small, the tax that is weighing on the spending power of households. How can the members opposite feign concern for autoworkers at the same time as insisting that this job-destroying tax be retained? We will also be axing the mining tax, a tax that is destroying confidence in the mining industry. How can members opposite argue that improved employment outcomes could occur through imposing a mining tax? 


We propose to cut a billion dollars worth of red tape from business. Businesses are complaining they are drowning under the burden of red tape. The former government was expert at imposing red tape on business. An additional matter I would wish to bring to the attention of the members opposite—one that they do not wish to countenance—is the reintroduction of the ABCC for the return of the rule of law to construction sites, the return of a more efficient construction sector, the return of more job opportunities and more effective contracting. Why is it that the members opposite are so keen to take steps that actually discriminate against workers' prospects of  getting a job? We are committed to creating new jobs; the members opposite are absolutely committed to standing in the way of every measure the government is proposing to create new jobs. We are very focused on that. 


We have seen the members opposite complaining that this government has somehow caused the problem. I would like to bring to the attention of the House a couple of points that were made. In 2012 the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, announced $34 million for Ford, saying that it would create 300 new jobs, but the result was 330 employees losing their jobs within eight months. Prime Minister Gillard also announced $215 million for Holden, saying it would secure its future in Australia until 2022, but within months 670 jobs were lost and we all know the history of Holden's decision. 


We see manufacturing firms making commercial decisions which unfortunately have had an adverse impact on workers. The coalition believes we need to strengthen the economy. That is the best way to create the sorts of opportunities that people need to move into jobs. Over time, our economy will remain in transition. We will see sectors contract and expand. It is vital that the government does everything it can to put in place the correct economic setting so that those seeking work have the best prospect of getting a job and those in work can move to better jobs. 


The coalition is focused on creating jobs; the opposition is absolutely hell-bent on standing in the way of the government's reforms of eliminating the carbon tax, eliminating the mining tax, reducing red tape and reducing thuggery on buildings sites. They are in the way of that agenda. They are in the way of new jobs. (Time expired)

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (16:20):  I rise today angry and disappointed at the events of the past 24 hours. The Toyota plant in Altona, in my electorate, is a fixture of Melbourne's west. It has called Altona home for the past 36 years and generations of workers in my electorate have honed their craft building the Camrys and Orients that so many Australians drive. But recently, Toyota, like so many of our manufacturing companies, has faced a perfect storm of external challenges. A high Australian dollar, a tough export market and muted demand domestically have created conditions that make it impossible to face alone. The key word here is 'alone'. With the right leadership, Toyota and our auto industry could have received the assistance it needed to continue operating in Australia. With the right captain, a way could have been found through this storm, to sail through these storm clouds, and steer the ship to safer seas. 


Toyota confirmed in its press conference yesterday afternoon that they were 'close to making the decision' to initiate a new production line for the new Camry. This was a company that wanted to stay in Australia. But, since the announcement of the closure of Holden in December 2013, Tony Abbott has done absolutely nothing to fight for the jobs of Australian workers. Instead of trying to find a way to save the Australian car industry, the Abbott government's—




Mr Baldwin:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. I ask you to draw to the member's attention the need to address members by their correct name or title. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am sure you will adhere to that as we go along, Member for Gellibrand.




Mr WATTS:
  The Abbott government spent the Christmas break floating a work-for-the-dole scheme and blaming workers at SPC Ardmona for the situation facing their company. In this perfect storm for Australian manufacturing, Captain Abbott has been more concerned with abandoning ship, blaming the crew and punching holes in the lifeboats than steering the ship to safety. His Treasurer, in the weeks leading up to Toyota's crucial decision, lectured Australian workers on the age of personal responsibility. In this age of personal responsibility, why is it okay to support chocolate jobs at Cadbury but not car jobs at Toyota? It sounds more like an age of hypocrisy to me. 


The loss of Toyota to Melbourne's west is devastating for not only the 2,500 Toyota workers but also the hundreds of manufacturers of component parts who are reliant on Toyota's business. We need a government with a bigger vision for these workers than picking up rubbish at the Hosken Reserve for less than minimum wage on a work-for-the-dole scheme across the road from an empty Toyota Altona plant. As Robert Kennedy once said, 'The answer to the welfare crisis is work, jobs, self-sufficiency and family integrity.' We need decent employment to fully engage society—the kind of employment that lets a man say, 'I helped to build this country.' We have seen overseas the consequences of letting the ship sink. We have seen the consequences of mass unemployment. We only need to look to the United States—where the impact of the global financial crisis has been felt most keenly by blue-collar workers—to understand that reality. In the US, more than 10 per cent of workers in blue-collar industries lost their jobs between August 2007 and August 2009. 


The loss of manufacturing jobs has a significant emotional toll. The stress of unemployment has a physical impact. The life expectancy of laid-off middle-aged workers decreases by one to one and a half years. Mass unemployment affects the whole community—including, most heartbreakingly, the children of laid-off workers. A child whose parent loses their job is 15 per cent more likely to repeat a grade at school and, in time, will have lower home ownership rates and higher divorce rates. This is the future that confronts Melbourne's west under the Abbott government. 


With the jobs of 1,400 workers at the Williamstown shipyards also on the line, almost 4,000 families in Melbourne's west are confronting the fear of sudden unemployment. The alternative to this sudden unemployment is to act to protect these workers and communities who will be hit hardest by this perfect storm.


Labor acted to protect jobs during the global financial crisis, and we acted to protect the auto industry through this period of global turmoil through the ATS. But it was not just Labor who supported manufacturing workers with these assistance schemes. Under John Howard, manufacturing workers were protected with the automotive industry assistance package. In 2002, John Howard's industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, worked with John Brumby, the then Treasurer of Victoria, to put aside politics and ensure that auto workers had the support they needed in trying times. Why was it good enough for John Howard to support Australian auto manufacturing jobs in 2002 but it is not good enough for Tony Abbott to do so today? Why would John Howard let Ian Macfarlane do his job and protect Australian jobs in 2002 but Tony Abbott will not let him do so in 2014? It is because the Liberal Party has been taken over in the past 10 years by economic extremists who are out of touch with what the Australian public want their government to do. Tony Abbott promised a million new jobs for Australians. We have not seen one in my electorate, and it is time for this betrayal to be held to account.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:26):  I know as well as anyone in this House how devastating the recent developments in the auto industry and across manufacturing have been. Thousands of workers across my region are employed in the manufacturing industry and many will be affected by the shutdown of the automotive manufacturing industry right across Australia. A number of companies in the Geelong region supply components to car manufacturers, including Toyota, and this is terrible news for the industry. But let me assure the member for Gellibrand, and let me assure those members opposite that—despite the spin, despite the deception, despite the untruths—we are fighting for jobs. We are fighting for a future. 


We are in very difficult times. This is a very tough time for Australian manufacturing. But, unlike members opposite, we are confident that we have a bright future in manufacturing. I come from a proud manufacturing city, and I am going to hang onto that and do whatever I can to work with my community leaders and my community to ensure that we have a bright future.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  Let me tell you what we are doing. You say we have no plan. That is absolute rubbish. We are focusing on new opportunities, new industries, new markets and new jobs. Consider what we are doing. We are trying to get rid of the carbon tax, which members opposite are blocking. This is a tax on jobs, a tax on Geelong and a tax on the people of my electorate. This is a tax on manufacturing. This is driving up the cost of energy and it is hurting manufacturing. Two million businesses are being hurt by the carbon tax, and what do those opposite do? Not one cent of compensation—absolutely nothing We are working hard to get rid of the mining tax, which is being blocked by members opposite. We are working hard to build a strong economy and to boost investment and confidence. But the more you drag our nation down as a centre of manufacturing, the more damage you do. 


Consider the basket case of the economy we inherited. Unless we get the budget back under control, we are heading towards $123 billion of accumulated deficits—$667 billion of government debt. We are slashing government debt.




Mr Dreyfus:
  You're the government now!




Ms HENDERSON:
  Yes, we are the government—and, boy, have we got a job to do! We have got a very big job to do because of what you have done to wreck our economy. In my electorate we are fighting for important new industries. There is the Geelong Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases. We are investing money in a new intensive agriculture precinct. 



Mr Watts interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  I know it does not resonate in Gellibrand but agriculture is incredibly important right across this nation. There is the $18 billion Defence project, the Land 400. I am very proud of my community, led by the Mayor of Geelong, and what we are doing to fight for that project which would do so much for our city and our state. I understand that members opposite have not been following the news and have not read the papers, obviously, but—led by the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, we are conducting an economic review of the South Australian and Victorian economies. I am on that panel—the Industry and Manufacturing Economic Review Panel—and I can assure you that we are absolutely focused on what we need to do as a government to grow jobs, to grow confidence and to help transition this economy. We are focused on innovation, on advanced manufacturing, on food processing, on IT and on communications. We have a plan.




Mr Watts:
  Not on the NBN, though.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Yes, we are focused on the NBN. We are focused on responsible government. We are focused on responsible economic management. We are very proud of the work that we are doing. We are getting on with the business.


What members opposite do not understand is that governments do not create jobs; people do. People create jobs. We need to put the policy framework in the right place to ensure that we build the confidence, we build the investment and we grow the jobs. I remind those in this House that, in my own electorate, the loss of Ford under Labor's watch has been a terrible blow. Rather than throwing money and promising money, as Labor did, which led to more job losses, we are focusing on what we need to do. In this process, the economic review panel and our $100 million growth fund are vital for jobs and for our future. (Time expired)

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:31):  Earlier this afternoon we heard from the Leader of the Opposition when he talked about the community of Gove. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Nova Peris and I visited Gove last Friday. On 28 or 29 November, Rio Tinto advised the community of Gove that they were going to curtail their refinery at Gove, meaning the loss of something like 1,200 jobs, and that this curtailment would start from the beginning of February and be completed by the end of July. This is not the period we are talking about with Holden or with Toyota—this is not some years; this is some months.


The community at Gove are concerned not only about the loss of jobs but also about the loss of infrastructure, the loss of community support and the loss of social services. We heard this morning from the mouth of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory that the population of Gove dropped from 4,000 people to 1,200 people—4,000 to 1,200. Businesses in Gove made decisions based on advice they had received from Rio Tinto in February and May last year to invest in the Gove community. As a result of this announcement, their investments are no longer worth the paper they are written on. We are seeing property values fall astronomically, we are seeing services being withdrawn from the community and we are seeing the future of education and health services gravely in doubt. 


Yet we have not heard a word—not one single word—from the Prime Minister or any other senior minister from this government. In fact, although those opposite, and particularly Senator Scullion, were all over Nhulunbuy and the region like a rash during the lead-up to the election campaign, Senator Scullion has not been sighted since this announcement was made. These are his constituents. He is a senior cabinet minister in this government and he has abandoned the people of Nhulunbuy and the region. There has been no effort. Not one scintilla of hope has been given to this community by this government.


What the Prime Minister has proven yet again today is that he cares nothing for people who live in the regions of Australia, cares nothing for people whose jobs are going, as they are in Gove, and cares nothing for the Aboriginal communities of north-east Arnhem Land—because they are the ones who, in the long term, will suffer most. I met with people at Yirrkala last Friday, with the Leader of the Opposition, the local member, Lynne Walker, and Senator Peris. We were told by these people from Yirrkala, the Yolngu people from north-east Arnhem Land, that they were concerned about the future of Gove for a number of reasons—not only the loss of jobs for the people they called their brothers and sisters who worked in the Gove refinery but also the future jobs that may have been created had the refinery stayed. They are worried about the future of their kids and are concerned about the loss of opportunities that would have been there had this infrastructure remained.


There are no transition plans being proposed by this government. We know from a task force meeting that Rio Tinto advised the government about this potential closure 18 months ago. Yet we hear recently from a government member on this task force that the government told the Northern Territory government and Rio Tinto that there would effectively be no package. So what the Northern Territory government now know is that the Commonwealth government has abandoned them and abandoned the people of Gove. In addition to being abandoned by the Commonwealth government, we also know, as a result of a statement made by the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Adam Giles, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly this morning, that the Northern Territory government have abandoned the people of Gove as well.


No information has been given to the community about the social, economic, environmental and demographic impacts on them. But we are to believe that, somehow or other, given the contribution we have heard this afternoon from members opposite, this government is concerned about jobs in the community. They are not concerned at all. They have abandoned working people in this country. They do not like talking to working people, particularly those who are members of unions, and of course the workers at Gove are unionised—'So we can't be talking to them; God no!' Of course, they will eventually get the blame. We will hear the Prime Minister get up and say, 'If the Gove workers had done things differently this would not have happened.' Well, of course, we know that that is rot, and Rio Tinto know that as well. They would tell the government that that is rot.


We understand that sometimes these commercial decisions are taken, but it is up to Rio Tinto and this Commonwealth government to slow down this eminent process of closure to allow the adjustments that need to be made in this region to be properly made and to allow for investments to be made in infrastructure that will provide long-term opportunities, jobs and services to the people of Gove and north-east Arnhem Land.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (16:36):  We could all stand up here today and play the blame game. I could say to the member who just spoke: 'Where was that passion for the workers when the carbon tax was introduced and it was detailed what the carbon tax would do to the aluminium industry in this country?' Was there the force of words directed at that policy then? I do not remember there being any at all. We could look to former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's words when she announced packages of money for Ford and how that was going to secure workforces. We could look at when she announced more money that was going to secure Holden until 2022. We could keep detailing those things. We can do the blame game.




Mr Dreyfus:
  You pulled it.




Mr TEHAN:
  We are getting more of it from the learned colleague opposite. The blame game is not going to help in these situations. We have to be looking at what we are going to do in the future to grow the economy, to grow jobs and to make sure that this country has a bright future. That is what this government has been doing since it came to office. We have decided to draw a line in the sand to say the last six years have not worked; that is why we were in this situation and that is why manufacturing is suffering in this country. What we want to do for manufacturing workers—and we do not care whether they are unionised or not—is give them jobs, sustainable jobs which they can have into the future, which are not dependent on the government providing money and more money and more money to ensure that those jobs continue.


There comes a time when government, like business, has to live within its means and that is what this government will do. We took a commitment to the election that we would get the budget mess that we inherited under control, that we would get debt under control. That is what we are going to do and we are going to do it by growing the economy, by growing new jobs.


It was fantastic to see the Prime Minister's response to what happened yesterday. He understands as everyone does on this side the disappointment, the dismay for those workers whose jobs are going to come to an end. But he also knows that he has to work cooperatively with the Victorian and South Australian state governments to ensure that those workers at Holden and Toyota and the rest of the workers in that state have a future. We are providing much needed infrastructure funds to make sure that those economies grow and that jobs will be provided. And it will be successful, especially if it comes along with the Labor Party getting out of the way and allowing us to abolish the carbon tax. It will be successful if they get out of the way and allow us to get rid of the mining tax. It will be successful if they get out of the way and allow us to get the budget back into a decent state. The hypocrisy of those promised cuts that they delivered in government, which they are now opposing, knows no bounds. That is the type of thing which will hold this country back.


We know that we have to grow the economy. We have said that creating jobs will be a first point of call when it comes to this government. The Prime Minister spent a good three years in opposition going around talking to industry, talking to workers, talking to businesses to find out what they need to make sure the economy continued to grow so that we could provide jobs for the families of Australia, and that is what we are hell-bent on doing. We will do it by encouraging industries which have been hit by this manufacturing decline, by this structural decline into those areas. We will ensure that the policies are there so the investment goes into those areas to create and developed new industries. We will work cooperatively both at the federal and state level to ensure that that happens. (Time expired)

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:41):  We woke up today to these dreadful headlines. The one that tells the story is in The Age: 'Road to recession'. These are not headlines that we have seen in Australia despite all of the challenges that we faced during the global financial crisis. We never had headlines like that before because in the past we had a government committed to jobs and committed to growth. But the people of Elizabeth in my electorate, of Shepparton in the electorate of Murray, in Nhulunbuy and in Altona know what the Abbott government is all about. These are communities that are shattered by the actions and the inaction of this government. What do we get from those opposite while these communities are reeling? The member for Gellibrand articulated it and the member for Solomon articulated it.


We do not see the member for Murray. We know she must be the most confused member of parliament because the 'lines in the sand' and the 'end of the age of entitlement' were not supposed to apply to rural communities. They were not supposed to apply to bean farmers in Queensland and Tasmania. They were not supposed to apply to the conservatives' heartland. She must be very confused because the government could not find $25 million for Shepparton. That is what it would have taken to save 500 manufacturing jobs in that electorate. That is what it would have taken to save a whole rural economic ecosystem with blockies and farmers. They could not find $25 million, yet they can find $16 million for Cadburys because apparently that is to promote tourism. They can find $3.5 million for Huon Aquaculture—probably a very good venture but nobody has ever heard of it. I do not know how many people it employs. Those opposite were happy to spend $100 million on a witch-hunt. They were happy to spend $20 million on a pilot scheme for marriage counselling. That was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph—a bit of a thought bubble, but we get used to that. I believe one of the members in the party room raised the arrogance of government ministers floating things in the press.


You can understand why the member for Murray is confused, why she is angry, why she is lashing out at the Prime Minister and calling him a liar. We now have the spectacle of this government, despite telling us that they have ended the age of entitlement, reinserting an FBT tax concession which will now only benefit foreign car manufacturers and foreign car workers. So we have got $1.8 billion in Australian taxpayers' money going to German, Chinese, British and US auto workers. That is the end of the age of entitlement. You can understand the member for Murray being a touch confused. You can understand Australians being a touch confused.


We see factory workers, farmers, small businesses, all these communities, suffering from this government's actions. I can tell you other people who are suffering from the government's actions. There is a company called Carr Components in the Adelaide suburb of Netley, in the seat of Hindmarsh. Bill Sardelis was quoted in the Fin Review today under the headline 'Shocked parts makers out of options':


Mr Sardelis said he was angry at policymakers. ""In the end, they didn't want an industry and they've got what they wanted.""


The worst thing about this government is that there are all these drones on the backbench who claim that they are such tough economic warriors but then they always seek to blame someone else. It is always someone else's fault. It is the unions' fault. It is the workers' fault. It is the multinationals' fault. It is always someone else's fault, because they do not really have the courage of their convictions. They are not willing to don the fluoro just one more time, to go down to Altona or Elizabeth or Shepparton. We do not see them going down there. Then they talk about this $100 million fund, which was supposed to be just about South Australia but apparently is now being stretched right across the country to retrain workers in many, many different communities. We do not see a plan. We do not see any fairness out of this government. We are on the road to recession. (Time expired)

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (16:46):  It is always interesting to sit back and listen to members of the Labor Party and their confected outrage, which is built up for nothing more than media appearances. The problem is that, when you speak in parliament, everything you say is recorded. As a result, everything you do not say in defence of an industry or an argument is not there. So when I say it is confected outrage I mean: where were the comments from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Gorton—I will excuse the member for Gellibrand; he was not here—the member for Lingiari and the member for Wakefield when Mitsubishi pulled the pin in 2008?



A government member:  What did they say?




Mr BALDWIN:
  There was silence, the sounds of silence, not just from the member for Wakefield but from all members. In 2011, the then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, said:


Our nation is facing an historic shift, the like of which we have not seen in two generations. 


…   …   …


That does not mean that change will be easy or swift. These are incredibly challenging times. 


…   …   …


Many manufacturers have found the higher exchange rate extremely difficult to handle.


The face of the industry is changing, as indeed has been happening for many decades now. I feel very sorry for all those people who have lost their jobs to date or are to lose their jobs. I feel very sorry for the one person every 19 minutes in the manufacturing industry who lost their job while Labor were in government.


What can I say of this confected outrage of the Labor Party? I say this. I sat through when BHP shut down in Newcastle, that great big steel town—and BHP had reach across the whole region. It was disappointing. It was devastating. Yes, people lost their jobs. The coalition government, under John Howard, invested $10 million in a Newcastle structural adjustment package. That money was invested wisely, but, most importantly, the government sat down with industry, with the workers, and developed a plan. We now have lower unemployment in the Hunter region than we had when BHP was there. We have seen new industries, new growth, the establishment of the Hunter Medical Research Institute, a whole new sector of industries. We have seen an increase in broader education. We have seen mining support service industries pop up on a broad scale, the likes of which we have never seen. Why? Because we encouraged industry to invest. We sat down; we worked with them. We got rid of a lot of the backlog of red tape that was stopping this investment. People need to see a pathway forward. They need to see that a government cares enough to work with them, not against them. Most importantly, they need to see and understand that they do not have people with confected outrage.


I left out the member for Isaacs earlier, because he did not speak today, but he spoke on Q&A last night, and I have got to tell you, Member for Isaacs, it was not one of your most impressive performances. There you were, complete with the confected outrage, but what did you say about when Mitsubishi pulled the pin or when Ford announced its closure? Indeed, what did you say about when Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012 announced $34 million for Ford, saying it would create 300 new jobs, only for 330 employees to lose their jobs, or when she announced $215 million for Holden, saying it would secure the future for Australia till 2022, yet within months 670 jobs were gone? It was the silence that was deafening from the members of the opposition when they were in government. 


People need a team that will provide leadership, will create opportunities and, in particular, will create an air of confidence that businesses can invest. One of the things that helped kill this motor vehicle industry—and is killing other industries and is killing investment—is the carbon tax: $400 on every motor vehicle. But did I once hear a word from members opposite about the $400 of carbon tax on each and every car and the impact of that on the jobs and the supply? It was not there. So I say to these people: stop the confected outrage and work with people to create jobs.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:51):  I appreciate the opportunity to make some comments on this very important piece of legislation, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. It is a piece of legislation that is going to contribute to the protections that are in place for international students who are studying in Australia. Two specific amendments are on the table before us this afternoon. The first is to ensure that the Tuition Protection Service has the power to force the refund of prepaid fees where a provider fails or a course is cancelled. The second is to ensure that the Tuition Protection Service has the power to force a refund of prepaid fees where a visa is refused for a prospective student. I will speak a little bit about those amendments in detail, but I want to state first off that these are really important steps to ensuring that Australia's higher education sector remains attractive to students overseas and remains competitive, because we are competing with other nations in this extremely important export industry. This is also a bit of an opportunity for me to reflect on Labor's legacy in growing this very important industry, and I will speak about that in due course.


Let us get started by thinking a little bit about the importance of international students in my electorate of Hotham. I am incredibly lucky to represent a very diverse and very interesting population in Hotham. We are within a stone's throw of Monash University. Many of you would know Monash as one of the best universities in the whole of Australia. It is also one of the most international universities in the whole of Australia. I was lucky to be a student there for quite a few years and I can say that, whether it was being in a sporting team or joining students in a sports class or engaging in a few student political activities—which many of us got into in our younger years—or in the course of tutorials or university lectures that we shared, having international students learn with us was one of the most enriching parts of that educational experience. It is enriching for the life of that university and it also enriches life for the people of Hotham. Hotham is a vibrant and diverse place, and our international student community is very much a part of that.


But we have to be up-front and say that, for all the benefits and all the excitement that we have for the international students that are studying in Australia, there is a seedy underbelly to this too, and that is that there are many providers and we have been through a number of regulatory changes that at various times have made it, I think, too easy to provide courses. We have seen some very disturbing stories. Some of these have occurred right in my electorate of Hotham, unfortunately. I am not going to mention names or go into the gory details, but I can say that there have been incidents where teachers in colleges have purported to have qualifications and that later proved not to be true. There have been issues around course structure. One example in my electorate was where a course was being taught to the students back to front. There have been examples where students have been charged exorbitant and, frankly, exploitative fees to study at these institutions. So the legislation that we have before us is about protecting the best of this industry and making sure that that seedy underbelly does not pervade what we put out there as one of our critical exports to the world.


This is an industry that is absolutely worth protecting. I think everyone in Australia knows that this industry is important but many would not realise its critical economic importance. Educational exports is our fourth largest export industry. We export $15 billion worth of education every year to people visiting Australia. It is actually more than our whole tourism industry combined. It supports 100,000 jobs. It has also, for better or worse, come to be a pivotal part of funding our higher education sector, and that is for students who are visiting from overseas but also for Australian students who are accessing tertiary education. About a quarter of our students at the moment are international students. They more than pay their way, and our universities are now very frank and up-front about how important that is for their survival.


These are some of the hard financials, but those of us who have been lucky to participate in this know that we reap a lot of other benefits from having international students studying with us in Australia, that it is not just about the dollars. In October 2012, the Labor government released the Australia in the Asian century white paper, a fantastic document which I think just started to unravel some of the difficult issues that we need to face to really embrace our proximity to Asia and get the most out of the Asian century. A report that considered the white paper pointed out that 80 per cent of the international students studying in Australia were from the Asian region and it said:


International education is a pillar of the people-to-people relationships that drive economic, cultural and social outcomes for Australia in the Asian Century …


I am very committed to this sentiment because I have been lucky to study in America as well and just about all of my classmates were from different countries around the world. I can absolutely say from personal experience that those person-to-person relationships are pivotal to the way that we liaise with other countries. When you look in the economics textbooks they are all about numbers on a page, but people really matter when it comes to building economic links. I think it is also relevant when we think about foreign affairs. A key plank of Australia's soft power and aid strategy is really being pursued through this exposure that we are giving to students all over Asia to Australian culture, to improved fluency in English and to the building of friendships that I have talked about. Perhaps even more relevantly for Australia as a nation, surrounded as we are by mostly Asian countries, it is a fantastic opportunity for us to learn about their culture, their language and the way that they do business.


A final point I would make on this is: just think of the fantastically skilled workforce that we are creating by helping turn out so many skilled graduates from our higher education institutions around Australia. This is hundreds of thousands of mostly young people, mostly from Asian countries, who are learning more about the English language, more about our Australian culture and forming ties to people, companies and institutions.


So there are a lot of benefits that I have talked about, but there have been challenges. When we see the thriving state of the sector today it is important for us to remember that this did not just happen organically. Significant intervention was required at certain times to make sure that things did not fall off the rails. Initially, the Howard government took a very hands-off approach to international education, with near disastrous consequences for the sector. I think we can remember that back in those days just about any old duffer could start up an international college of some sort and start providing some type of higher qualification. There were issues with lax immigration rules, which led to the entry of completely unsustainable levels of international students. Frankly, the institutions were unable to absorb those sorts of numbers. We saw the entry of some dodgy operators, who affected the whole export industry.


I think that, as well, we are all across a lot of the practical issues that were faced by those international students and that the government eventually had to come in and give a hand with. On issues around housing, we have all heard the stories of 17 young people crowding into and sleeping in shifts in bedrooms and all those sorts of things that have been going on. We have heard the endless stories about work exploitation that has taken place where international students were being paid well below the minimum wage and were not being given appropriate awards and conditions in the work that they were doing. We have heard about massive international attention being given to incidents of violence against international students—very disturbing stuff.


One of the things that we are seeing and that we have seen in recent years is that this is a very discerning group of consumers. These students who are coming to study in Australia have options presented to them all over the world. This is an open competition where countries like Australia are competing for these young students to come and study. When you look at the numbers you can see some of the sensitivities here. From 2008 to 2009, we had 70,000 visa applications granted to international students from India. I believe that was the peak of applications from India. It was also the time when some of those controversies started to bubble up a little bit. The following year, that dropped by more than 50 per cent. There were just 30,000 applications that following year. It is a staggering decline and just illustrates the importance of making sure that we have our eye on that industry. It does not need to be overregulated, but at the same time there are consequences for our whole economy and for this huge export industry if we let things run without some proper oversight.


The summary of this particular point is really that policy matters when it comes to this area of our economy. Leadership really matters, and national leadership at a time of global challenge is imperative. We saw the Rudd government come in and show leadership to try to grow the sector and to try to restore integrity so that those many thousands of Indian students who came in 2008-09 and then turned away the following year would feel more confidence in their decision to study in Australia. Just as important to restoring integrity to the sector is ensuring that we are restoring the appearance of integrity to the sector, because, as I said, this is a very discerning group of consumers.


A package of reforms was put forward to try to provide an appropriate level of protection and oversight to the industry. The Tuition Protection Service is an integral part of that. The Tuition Protection Service is a very important reform of the previous Labor government. It is simple. It provides a single contact point for students who are affected by provider default. It illustrates, I think, a deep level of commitment to protect these students who have made Australia their home for a period while they are trying to get higher education. The way that it works is that providers pay a levy, and the levy is used to support students who are trapped by provider default. It helps those students to either be placed in an alternative course or be paid a refund. It is very simple and very much an issue of justice when you think about it. The legislation said that, where students had paid up-front for a course and that course could not be provided to them, they were able to get help. They were able to be diverted into a new course or, at the very least, get their money repaid. It is shocking to think that we would even need legislation of this nature. You would think that this would not be required, but unfortunately there have been so many instances where we have seen students taken for a ride in this sector that the Rudd government had to come in and put this reform in place.


It is important to note also that the Tuition Protection Service has been essential because there have been so many instances, and I think there are predicted to be even more instances, where some of these institutions go into default. I think the Tuition Protection Service reported last year that up to 22 providers, serving 4,400 students, would close in the coming year through either business failure or regulatory action. Let us just absorb that. That is 4,400 students who went through the process and got themselves a visa, many of whom got on a plane and came to Australia to participate in these courses, and were then told, 'I'm sorry; the college has gone into default.' All we are really saying here is something pretty straightforward: these people deserve to get their money back or to be assisted into another type of institution.


In conclusion, we have talked about how important this sector is for our whole economy. Not all sectors are like this, but this one in particular is one where regulation has been very important. National leadership from our federal government has been essential to growing this sector and essential to maintaining the integrity of the sector so that a group of students who are showing themselves to be increasingly discerning about where they study will continue to choose Australia. And students like me, who had the great fortune to study with so many international students when I was a student at Monash, will continue to have that fantastic experience, and we will continue to see built those person-to-person links that will continue to help Australia move into this, the Asian, century.


Labor supports these amendments. We support any measures to help protect these international students, who are so much a part of our community and so much a part of my community in Hotham. I am pleased to speak in support of the amendments.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-02-11,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:05):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. Firstly, I would like to note that this bill makes a few technical amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. However, before I go to the specifics of the bill, I think it is very important to emphasise how important our educational exports are to our nation and how they grew under the previous coalition government.


If we go back to 1996, when the previous coalition government was first elected, our educational exports were a little over $2 billion per annum. By the year 1999-2000, we had been able to double it to $4 billion. In fact, by 2007-08, when the coalition left office, this sector was worth $14 billion of exports. Of course, the trajectory that it was on under those years of the coalition government saw it, by 2009, reach close to $19 billion worth of exports. To put that in context, that makes educational exports our third-largest export industry, only behind coal and iron ore. In fact, we have more people coming to this country and our nation derives more export income from education than it does from tourism. Although we have our natural wonders of Bondi Beach, Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef and we have places like Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House which attract overseas tourism and build wealth and create jobs in this country, our educational sector surpasses that. Our universities, our TAFEs and our schools actually return more to this nation in exports than do our natural resources, our beaches and the other wonderful things we have for overseas tourists to come and see.


The wealth to this country is even beyond that measured dollar value. We see that where we have students from overseas it strengthens our global network of connections. Who knows how many future leaders of Asian countries will be among those many students that come to Australia to study and receive their formative education and experiences here in Australia? This helps them be leaders of Asian countries in the future and means a lot to our nation through the friendships that will develop. However, even though we were able to get close to that $19 billion figure in 2009, unfortunately, and contrary to what the previous speaker was saying, we have seen a decline in those export revenues under the previous Labor government. It depends how you measure it, whether you take the financial year or the calendar year, but we have seen our educational export sector shrink to something like 20 to 25 per cent. It is a common theme that we see. The coalition continually improves things and then when Labor came to office back in 2007 they headed on a downward trend. This government is determined to reverse that downward trend and get our educational exports headed back in the right direction.


One of the main reasons our educational exports declined is because of some of the changes the previous Labor government made. To give them some sympathy, they were not totally to blame, but the changes they made to the visa system, the increases in fees, had a detrimental effect and harmed our exports. In fact, when we say a 20 to 25 per cent decline, this was something like $3 billion to $3.5 billion wiped off our educational export sector. That is more than if our entire wool industry was wiped out for one year. That is what we have lost in our educational exports.


On the specifics of the bill, it ensures that overseas students can receive appropriate refunds for unexpended fees in the case of an education provider or student default. It addresses the unintended consequences of amendments made in the ESOS Act 2012 which meant that some students were not able to receive refunds as originally intended. The problem only became evident after amendments were applied in practice. The bill proposes an amendment to ensure that the refund is for the full amount of tuition paid for or by the student, minus the amount calculated as having been delivered by the provider. The bill also gives the minister power to make a legislative instrument that will set out the method of calculation for refunds and in the case of different circumstances of visa refusal. This will streamline the requirements of the ESOS Act for users.


We have a great potential in this nation to increase our exports in our educational sector. We look across the board and we see where our jobs are going to come from in the future. Our educational sector is one of the keys to our economy. It is one of the areas where we have a competitive advantage. It is one of our nation's strengths. This is where government should be giving its support. UNESCO estimates that over this decade the number of internationally mobile students will almost double from four million to seven million. There is potential for us to increase our exports by multibillion dollars in future if we get the policy settings right, if we get our educational sector right. It is also important for several of our states. In New South Wales our educational exports are our second largest export sector. In Victoria it is actually the largest export sector for the whole state. 


However, there are some risks and some concerns. Some of those concerns that threaten this potential export bonanza we can have are what is in our cross-curriculum priorities, our new national curriculum. We do have those three cross-curriculum embedded priorities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and cultures, Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia, and sustainability. The concept of sustainability under the new national curriculum will be embedded in all areas of the curriculum, including mathematics. I quote from the national curriculum:


In the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics, the priority of sustainability provides rich, engaging and authentic contexts for developing students’ abilities in number and algebra, measurement and geometry, and statistics and probability.


It goes on:


The Australian Curriculum: Mathematics provides opportunities for students to develop the proficiencies of problem solving and reasoning essential for the exploration of sustainability issues and their solutions.


If the definition of sustainability was about economic sustainability, how governments must run a sustainable budget, this would be a welcome change, something that is welcome in our curriculum. We could actually take those concepts and we could use them in mathematics. We could look at basic addition and use the theory of economic sustainability to teach it to our children. For example, we could actually add up the last five budget deficits of this Labor government—$27.1 billion, $54.8 billion, $47.7 billion, $43.7 billion and $19.4 billion—to work out $192 billion of accumulated deficits. This would obviously help our children learn about mathematics and addition. 


We can also project forward. Again, we could teach children about addition in mathematics as a concept and look at the MYEFO over the last four years—for 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. If we add up those projected deficits that the previous government has locked in with our policies, we get over $120 billion of combined deficits. We could also teach our children the principles of simple interest in mathematics, as the current unsustainable debt that was racked up by the previous Labor government now costs the economy $10 billion annually. This is a way we can teach children percentages.


We could also teach them probability. We could quote to children the budget speech of the former Treasurer back in 2012, when he said:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies. This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.


He continued:


The surplus years are here.


We could teach the concept of probability to students, because they could learn that the probability of that occurring would be absolutely zero. 


If that is what our children were being taught about sustainability, we would not have too much objection, but what is the definition of sustainability? I quote directly from our new national education curriculum which defines it as follows:


The Sustainability priority is futures-oriented, focusing on protecting environments and creating a more ecologically and socially just world through informed action. 


This is not a Greenpeace brochure; this is the concept that is embedded in everything Australian students learn under our national curriculum. Gone is the notion that our progress is defined as the exercise of mankind's ability to overcome our natural barriers. Gone is the inspiration and positive vision for the future that was instilled in my public school education back in the seventies. Gone is the need to strive to make our society wealthier and to grow the pie. Instead, we are replacing it with the idea of cutting the pie into smaller pieces in a so-called 'more socially just world'. 


This is not what we want to have in our education system. If we want our education system to be a world best, something we hold up to attract exports and that students from overseas want to come and learn in, we need to be teaching in our education system. We need to place importance on independence and self-confidence. We need to be teaching our kids about fierce determination and willingness so that they are not afraid to make mistakes. We need to teach them critical thinking and to question common dogma. But most of all, we need to teach our kids optimism.


But instead, the definition of sustainability we have embedded in our national curriculum is simply a corrosive, green doctrine. It is at odds with progress. It teaches restraint and low growth, social conformity, a mistrust of society and a pessimistic fear of the future. This is not what we want. Rather than indoctrinate children about sustainability, the limits to growth and the limits to our resources, we should be teaching our kids that the greatest resource they have is human ingenuity and that it is something that has no limits. Instead, our curriculum has been hijacked by green ideology.


For such an important industry for our country, something that we are going to rely upon to drive growth and to create those future jobs, we must address these issues so that we have overseas students who want to come to Australia, who see our education system as a world best and to enable kids to have a positive outlook for the future. The current national curriculum does not do that and it needs to be addressed. I congratulate the Minister for Education on his work and on this bill and also on addressing the issues in the national curriculum. I commend this bill to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (17:20):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. I will reflect quickly on some of the comments that the previous speaker made. I want to say how sad it is that higher education has become the biggest exporting industry in Victoria. To become the biggest exporting industry in Victoria, it means that we have lost others. For higher education to be the biggest exporting industry, it means that as we have seen today, last week and yesterday with Toyota, we are starting to lose other industries that are important to our economy, such as our manufacturing industry. I do not believe that it is something that we can celebrate without acknowledging that other industries we rely on, ones that employ other people and create wealth and jobs, are disappearing. 


The future of this country cannot rely solely upon a strong higher education sector. Higher education is important, as all the previous speakers have suggested, and international students are particularly important. The figures that we are talking about are over $15 billion and there are over 100,000 jobs in the higher education sector. Like every industry, it needs to be regulated to ensure that those purchasing the product get a good quality product and that those receiving the education get the best education they can for the dollars they provide.


I turn to why our universities are so reliant on full-fee-paying international students. It is not right to talk only about the higher education sector as an export industry, like coal, iron ore or manufacturing. We need to grow this sector because funding for our university sector was radically cut during the Howard years, which put us on a path to universities needing to rely on international students to supplement their budgets. 


I support the amendments in the bill before us in relation to the Tuition Protection Service. The amendments aim to ensure that the TPS has the power to force a refund of prepaid fees where the provider fails to deliver the service, a course is cancelled or a visa is not issued. These safeguards ensure the quality of services provided by the education system. It is no secret that we have had some shonky and dodgy colleges taking advantage of international students by suggesting that if they complete their studies they will get permanent residence in Australia. Whilst this bill does not go to those issues, it ensures that if an international student has a visa cancelled or has enrolled in a course that is cancelled, they will receive a full refund. The aim is to build in safeguards that do not already exist so overseas students get the education they seek.


In providing additional financial security, these amendments will ensure there is a policy connection between the federal and state agencies to support the international education sector. In my state of Victoria a lot of work was done by the former Labor government to try and get rid of dodgy providers and rogue operators who popped up in any corner store. In fact, a place across the road from where I live was given as the address of college claiming to teach motor mechanics, but it was just an empty house. When international students turned up on the day their classes were supposed to start there were no classes. This occurs and, without government stepping in to clean up these practices, such practices will continue. These sorts of practices are not good for our reputation as they send a message that Australia is not serious about higher education, but rather is a country where students need to pick and choose so as not to end up across the road from my place wondering why it is not a mechanics institute, as was thought.


I acknowledge the contribution international students make to our society. Many of these students choose to stay in Australia. I have talked to a number of students in my electorate who have chosen to stay and make Australia their home once they have navigated their way through the system and successfully completed their education and asked them about the changes they feel are needed. I asked them what we could have done to support international students and about the challenges they faced. I draw on some comments made by Abi Awasthi, who is today working at La Trobe University's Bendigo campus. His comments include ensuring that, apart from having access to courses of high quality, international students in Australia have access to affordable, safe and adequate accommodation services and that international students also have access to student services. For many international students this is a foreign country and they may not be used to our practices. This may be the first time they have left their home country, so there is a need to support them when they arrive particularly if they believe the college they attend is not delivering the services they paid for.


Another issue raised is the need for good jobs with good pay and working conditions so international students can properly support themselves. Dodgy contractors employing international students are very similar to dodgy colleges in that they take advantage of the students not knowing a lot about Australian legislation, so being easy to rip off. We need to support international students by ensuring they get good quality education, the course they believe they have signed up to and good jobs. I draw to the House's attention a recent report by United Voice, the cleaners union representing international students working in the cleaning industry. This report found that a number of international students are working for fly-by-night subcontractors who often cheat the students out of at least $15,000 a year in pay. These students lack the knowledge of their rights, which makes them extremely vulnerable to exploiters.


This is happening in the cleaning industry in capital cities as well as regions. Why do international students take up these jobs? Often their courses are quite expensive and they need the work to support themselves while they study. Across the whole area, when it comes to international students, whether it be the courses that they take up, the jobs that they have or the accommodation services that are provided, we need to do better to ensure that they are treated fairly and we need to do better as the host country.


As mentioned earlier, Abi is an example of the kind of international student who is coming here. He arrived in Australia in 2008 as a full-fee-paying international student to pursue his masters at La Trobe University. He says that his experience is a good experience, but the experience of some of the other international students he knows is not so good. He talks about people being picked up at the airport and being dropped off with their bags at an office, and that is it. He talks about people who have had accommodation found for them that is an hour and a half, two buses and a train away, from where their courses are. He talks about the courses that they have been offered, the one-on-one tutorial time that they are told they will get and the payment that they will get to do their placements, but when the students take up the placements they are not paid. That is another major problem for international students today. 


In some courses these students are becoming free labour, almost slave labour. As part of their course, they are required to do work experience, but the work experience might be three months working nine till five. You see these schemes being rolled out and rolled out. To complete their course, the international student has to work for free for long periods of time. That is something that Australian students would balk at and say, 'That is simply not fair.' This is why the changes being proposed to the Tuition Protection Service are important. 


Across the sector, we need to make sure that we are doing better by our international students. Why are international students so important to university funding? I flagged this earlier in my speech. I know that some would argue, particularly in my community, that we should train our own first, that the growing number of international students is at the cost of Australian places. The truth is that the higher education sector would have collapsed without the funding of international students. 


This situation was created under the former Howard government's bad Liberal policy of the late 90s and early 2000s. The funding that was cut from the higher education sector and the rate at which it was cut forced our universities to look for alternate funding streams. It was shortly afterwards that we saw the explosion in international student numbers. They have enhanced our universities and are building a strong culture. However, we cannot step away from the fact that cutting university funding has created a market for international students where sometimes our institutions are more interested in the money they are getting than the courses they are delivering. We need to ensure that our students and our guests in this country are receiving the quality education that they are seeking to pursue. 


I want to go to comments made about the reduction in international student numbers in the last year. That is not the result of changes to the visas but purely and simply because of the cost of study in this country. Australia is now ranked as the highest in regard to the cost of study. Our courses are going up and there is the effect of the Australian dollar and the cost of living. That is why I have attempted to highlight the need to do more for international students when it comes to their jobs, their education and their accommodation. Whilst I support these measures to ensure that we have quality within the system, I would like to reiterate my warning that we cannot rely on higher education continuing to be our largest export sector. If we continue down this path of just educating people and not having jobs for them, we will soon run out of people to educate. We need to make sure that we have strong industries—industries such as higher education, health and manufacturing. It is not always the best news to be the largest export sector; it means that other sectors are doing badly. To say that it is wonderful and is the future of jobs in this country, I think, is a bit sad particularly following the announcement by Toyota that they are withdrawing. We need an economy where we are growing jobs across the board, not just in our higher education sector.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:35):  I want to pick up from the very wise comments of my colleague. It is always very important for us to think that education is part of what we need to do to create a place for ourselves in the 21st century economy, but so is investment in research and development and the practical application of that research. Just blindly following the mantra that it is all education, education, education can very much misguide us as to what we need to do to ensure that we have the jobs into the future and the capacity for people to exploit that education. Countries like Ireland and Italy produce very many skilled graduates who simply are unable to find work in their home country 


So we know that is a necessary but certainly not a sufficient condition. If we are going to be a successful country, we have to be prepared to invest and to understand that government investment in research has been critical for the development of industries that we like to think of as 21st century industries. It was not Google, Yahoo or Facebook that developed the internet, nor did they develop Wi-Fi or touchscreens. All these things were developed within government agencies with massive government investment to explore these very new technologies. The private sector then, quite rightfully and properly, leveraged off it. But let us not be confused about this mantra of small government being the thing that is going to drive our economy forward.


In relation to higher education, there are a couple of observations. I do not want to repeat what everyone else has said. It is very important that we keep our standards high. There is some evidence that Australia is perhaps in some higher education areas becoming a less preferred destination. We have to take steps to ensure that the quality of our institutions is considered comparable to the quality in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and even in some of the Asian countries. It is really important for us always to focus not just on the quantity but also on the quality for us to maintain our ability to compete against those institutions in other First World countries. We have to be capable and prepared to invest. I repeat: part of keeping our higher education sector competitive is being prepared to invest in the research component of institutions so that they attract the brightest and best and in turn prove attractive to students overseas who see themselves having the opportunity of working in prestigious organisations, but also working on projects and with individuals who are seen to be at the leading edge of a particular discipline.


Everyone likes to come in here to talk about this fantastic export industry. It is an important industry and it is very beneficial for us. We do occasionally have to take off the rose-coloured glasses and look at where we stand particularly on higher education in relation to other universities around the world and look at ways in which we can support quality, because there is an inherent conundrum for universities and others selling their services. Do we consider the people who are buying these services to be our customers? The customer is always right, so do we ease the customer's passage through our institution, perhaps of the cost of lowering standards, or do we take a longer term gain and keep those standards high, which may create the difficulties of whether or not we pass or fail students? It is a contradiction, one I know academic institutions around the world are grappling with. How do we attract foreign fee-paying students, giving them in the short term perhaps an easier passage through the courses while maybe damaging the longer term reputation of our institutions? It is a hard game to play. We know that people tend to focus more on the short term than on the long term in looking at the performance of their institution.


I was surprised by some of the statements. I thought we had bipartisan support around this thing but as usual we had an attack on the Labor government embedded in the second reading speech—it is almost ritualistic. It is interesting that they were talking about us driving down the student figures. The figures I have, even the driven down figures supposedly of the last financial year, are well and truly in excess of anything achieved under the Howard government. So it does seem to be a rather strange criticism that during the last year of the Howard government when there were 250,000 student visa holders in Australia and in the last year of the Labor government there were 304,000, you could seek some claim that we had driven this industry backwards. There was a very substantial increase over the time of the Labor government. It peaked in 2009. I also make the point that there is absolutely no doubt that we want international students here, that we want this industry, that it creates good jobs for Australians. It has the ability to drive up standards, to make more complex and intellectually rich and robust our higher education institutions. 


But there is also a price to be paid with these high levels because there is certainly no doubt that our housing affordability problems are related to the rapid rise in our population. We saw this happening very dramatically in Perth where house prices doubled within a three- to four-year period from 2003 to 2007. Growth in population does drive housing affordability problems. If we expand our population too rapidly, our ability to supply housing at a sufficient rate is simply not there. That has certainly been the experience in Australia over the last 10 years. So I do think that, whilst we must encourage this as a vibrant industry, it cannot be that numbers go up without any real thought about what that does to the burden of infrastructure and to our ability to accommodate everyone at a price that is not going to undermine affordability of housing for very many Australian people. 


I certainly think we have seen that more dramatically in Perth than anywhere else. This is not blaming migrants, but this is saying that rapid population growth does bring with it some real challenges. So we should not be there with rose-coloured glasses saying that all of these issues and industries are not without their challenges. This is a good industry. I totally support us providing these measures that are going to enhance the student experience and address some of the concerns that were experienced by the industry, while at the same time maintaining quality. But I do want to say, let us not be uncritical about what some of the challenges are that come with bringing large numbers of additional people into the country in a very small space of time. Thank you.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (17:46):  I am pleased to rise today to speak in favour of Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013 and also to follow some great contributions from colleagues from Cunningham, Hotham, Bendigo and Perth.


Attracting overseas students to study in our institutions is one of the most important ways we can build and maintain a broad, smart, Asia-focused economy into the future. For a lot of Asia's young people, studying in Australia can be a leap of faith. Imagine a young person in Mumbai or Guangzhou or any city or town in our region or beyond, thinking about taking that step. They want to know that their investment is secure, that their chosen institution is credible and that their surroundings will be safe and conducive to learning. If you go beyond all the acronyms and the public policy speak, that is what the Tuition Protection Service is all about. It is about safeguarding the investment and the potential that flows from many thousands of the world's young people choosing our education system over all the others.


I am proud to have the opportunity to speak in this place on a bill that seeks to empower the TPS, which is a great reform of the higher education sector achieved by Labor in government under Prime Minister Gillard. This legislation deals with an issue very close to my own heart and is crucial to our country, our economy and my own community in Rankin.


Like a lot of my colleagues in here. I believe Australia has a lot to gain from a strong higher education sector, for our own people and also for our international students. Tertiary education like all forms of learning is about providing people with the tools to create their own success in life. I think the most important thing governments can do is provide these tools and nourish those aspirations. In this way, wide access to higher education is a path to greater economic mobility, which should be one of our most pressing objectives as parliamentarians. It is only through higher education that Australia can become a knowledge economy, which will drive greater productivity and transform the lives of individuals, families and communities from one generation to the next.


I am proud to say that the previous Labor government did a lot to strengthen the higher education sector. This is one of its proudest legacies—something even its harshest critics would have to concede. Labor oversaw a growth in university funding of more than 50 per cent, a staggering amount given the fiscal constraints of the time. We established the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency which has helped maintain our world-class standards in the area of higher education. We were also responsible for introducing the Tuition Protection Service, which is the subject of this bill, and which offers protections for international students studying in Australia and ensures that our reputation as a country with high-quality higher education is maintained—something that is absolutely crucial for our ability to sell education to the world.


The unfortunate fact is that the need to introduce the TPS came about as a result of some poor handling of the higher education sector in the last years of the Howard government. That government oversaw student immigration laws that resulted in unsustainable increases in the volume of international students studying in Australia without the necessary systems and safeguards, which as a result failed to maintain the integrity of the system. The natural consequence of this was the entrance of a large number of new higher education providers specially designed to capture the international student market and not all of them were, shall we say, well-intentioned. Unfortunately, some of these could be better described as immigration scams rather than genuine educational providers. That is the reality of it.


Students from overseas were lured here on the promise of world-class education in Australia's high-quality higher education sector, but arrived on our shores to find something entirely different. In 2009 and 2010 alone, 49 higher education providers closed, leaving over 11,000 students displaced. The result of this was substantial reputational damage to the entire Australian education system, jeopardising our place in the very competitive global market for higher education. International student numbers took a hit as a result. 


The introduction of the TPS was one of several measures introduced by Labor to restore confidence and quality to our education system in Australia. The benefit of the TPS over previous measures is that it was set up to function like insurance cover for international students. In this way, education providers paid levies based on their risk of closure or failure to provide a course  As a result, public universities do not pay a risk component at all, as they present an extremely low likelihood of closure. All education providers pay for the basic costs of administering the program and they all benefit from the enhanced reputational stability that results.


In the 2013-14 financial year, the annual TPS levy placed on registered providers of international education collected $6 million for the Overseas Students Tuition Fund, which gives you an indication of the scope of this program. The benefits of the TPS for students and universities are substantial and so are the benefits for Australia. Overseas students have greater confidence about coming to study in Australia. The TPS means that if a provider fails or a course becomes unavailable, the student has access to resources to help find an alternative placement for them. They can also rest more soundly in the knowledge that if there is no alternative course available they are able to request a refund of their fees out of the $6 million pool that is raised annually.


In the 2012-13 financial year, nine providers around the nation were closed, affecting 907 students. Well over half of those students sought assistance from the TPS and 282 of them were placed in alternative courses or received refunds. For the university sector, the TPS offers assurance that Australia's reputation as a provider of quality education is not diminished by the closure of smaller institutions. I am pleased to see that this bill will give the TPS further powers to achieve these goals.


Firstly, the TPS will be able to force the refund of pre-paid fees from a provider where that provider fails or a course is cancelled. It is a very basic thing but an important piece of assurance. Secondly, the TPS will be able to force the refund of pre-paid fees where a visa is refused for a prospective student. Again, this is a good, common-sense measure. Both of these extra powers will provide greater certainty for prospective international students considering coming to Australia for study.


The reputation of our educators, including universities across Australia—like Griffith University at Logan in my electorate—will benefit from these proposed changes. Across Griffith University international students make up over a quarter of the student population, or nearly 11,000 students. Students attending the TAFEs and private colleges in my electorate will also benefit. The Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE, with campuses in Browns Plains and just over the border of my electorate at Loganlea, offer courses to international students in a range of disciplines including hairdressing, business and youth work. 


There are nearly 350,000 international students in Australia, a quarter of whom are from China and nearly 10 per cent from India. International students provide a huge boost to our universities, allowing them to invest in infrastructure to support all students and increasing the cultural diversity of education in Australia. Since the changes to higher education by the Labor government in 2012, there has been a strong resurgence in international student numbers across Australia. And it is the right kind of high-quality resurgence—not a free-for-all, like last time. 


Data from the Department of Immigration and Border Security shows that over 74,000 foreigners applied to become students in Australia in the quarter to September 2013. That is an increase of seven per cent on the previous year, and that is a very good thing. Really encouraging is the fact that Chinese student applications jumped by over 20 per cent and applications from India more than doubled. That is a great outcome and a fantastic development for our economy.


With the surge in international student numbers in Australia, it is critically important that we support those students once they are here. Assurance of the provision of courses via the TPS is just one aspect of this. It is equally important that we ensure the quality of education for all students in Australia. I had the opportunity and the pleasure last November to deliver a speech at the conference of the Australia and New Zealand Student Services Association. It was a great opportunity to meet with people who devote their careers to achieving great outcomes for university and TAFE students, including our international student population. They are a big part of what we need to succeed in this area and I pay tribute to their work. Some of them expressed concerns to me about the future of student services in the face of cuts confirmed by the government last year, and cuts that are likely to be around the corner under the guise of the Commission of Audit.


Universities and vocational education providers around Australia just cannot afford extreme cuts to their budgets. Of course there are difficult decisions to be made in budgets, and that is where priorities kick in. The fact that the coalition imposed a $2.3 billion cut, after not supporting the needs-based schools funding scheme that the saving was designed to cover, is indicative of their overall approach to education. The coalition sees spending on education as a cost rather than as an investment. They do not understand that investment in education results in increased productivity, increased labour force participation and a boost in funds raised from the export of education—among many other benefits.


Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2012-13 shows that education-related travel was Australia's fourth-largest export, beaten only by iron, coal and gold. Think about that for a moment: the fourth largest export. As such, Australia's economy depends on us having a strongly competitive and stable higher education market for international students, and that is something that this bill will support.


As we witness a resurgence in the international student population in Australia, a strong TPS is more important than ever. The annual report for the TPS indicates that there are up to 4,400 students with 22 providers that could close in the coming financial year, either as a result of business failure or because of regulatory action. Those 4,400 students depend on a strong Tuition Protection Service to ensure that their education is not affected as a result of poor operational decisions by higher education providers. What is more, the reputation of the entire Australian university and vocational training sector depends on a strong TPS. It is for this reason that the Labor opposition are proud to support this measure to strengthen our original Tuition Protection Service, and it is why I encourage all members to vote in support of this bill.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:59):  The Australian government supports a vibrant education system. It is committed to rebuilding Australia's international education industry and ensuring the appropriate quality assurance underpins our education system while taking steps to reduce red tape and the overall regulatory burden. The government will work tirelessly to ensure international students who choose Australia as their study destination receive education and training of the highest quality we can offer. Ensuring certainty for them and respecting their rights as consumers adds to both the credibility of our reputation in international education and the fulfilment of their ambitions in studying here.


By ensuring that the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, or ESOS, and its associated legislative framework work effectively and efficiently, we will enhance the reputation and appeal of Australia's education system. The amendments made to the ESOS Act by this bill will help deliver on our government's commitment to international students to provide a robust and fair system. They will increase certainty and fairness for students and providers of international education by rectifying unintended consequences from amendments to the legislation made in 2012 which may inadvertently restrict the amount of a refund an international student receives in some circumstances. The bill gives the minister the power to make a legislative instrument to specify refund requirements where an international student has had their visa refused. I will be using this opportunity to more clearly articulate those requirements after consultation with stakeholders.


The bill also amends the name of the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007 to remove reference to 'Registration Authorities'. The name of the national code will then reflect its purpose following the 2012 amendments to the ESOS Act. The change to the title of the national code does not affect its contents or operation. This minor amendment will be followed by further work on the national code to ensure it is contemporary and as far as possible addresses the needs of international students and education providers.


These amendments ensure the ESOS Act operates as it should. Timely passage of this bill is important to ensure certainty and clarity for providers and students across the sector as we rebuild the status and potential of international education in Australia.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:51):  I appreciate the opportunity to make some comments on this very important piece of legislation, the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. It is a piece of legislation that is going to contribute to the protections that are in place for international students who are studying in Australia. Two specific amendments are on the table before us this afternoon. The first is to ensure that the Tuition Protection Service has the power to force the refund of prepaid fees where a provider fails or a course is cancelled. The second is to ensure that the Tuition Protection Service has the power to force a refund of prepaid fees where a visa is refused for a prospective student. I will speak a little bit about those amendments in detail, but I want to state first off that these are really important steps to ensuring that Australia's higher education sector remains attractive to students overseas and remains competitive, because we are competing with other nations in this extremely important export industry. This is also a bit of an opportunity for me to reflect on Labor's legacy in growing this very important industry, and I will speak about that in due course.


Let us get started by thinking a little bit about the importance of international students in my electorate of Hotham. I am incredibly lucky to represent a very diverse and very interesting population in Hotham. We are within a stone's throw of Monash University. Many of you would know Monash as one of the best universities in the whole of Australia. It is also one of the most international universities in the whole of Australia. I was lucky to be a student there for quite a few years and I can say that, whether it was being in a sporting team or joining students in a sports class or engaging in a few student political activities—which many of us got into in our younger years—or in the course of tutorials or university lectures that we shared, having international students learn with us was one of the most enriching parts of that educational experience. It is enriching for the life of that university and it also enriches life for the people of Hotham. Hotham is a vibrant and diverse place, and our international student community is very much a part of that.


But we have to be up-front and say that, for all the benefits and all the excitement that we have for the international students that are studying in Australia, there is a seedy underbelly to this too, and that is that there are many providers and we have been through a number of regulatory changes that at various times have made it, I think, too easy to provide courses. We have seen some very disturbing stories. Some of these have occurred right in my electorate of Hotham, unfortunately. I am not going to mention names or go into the gory details, but I can say that there have been incidents where teachers in colleges have purported to have qualifications and that later proved not to be true. There have been issues around course structure. One example in my electorate was where a course was being taught to the students back to front. There have been examples where students have been charged exorbitant and, frankly, exploitative fees to study at these institutions. So the legislation that we have before us is about protecting the best of this industry and making sure that that seedy underbelly does not pervade what we put out there as one of our critical exports to the world.


This is an industry that is absolutely worth protecting. I think everyone in Australia knows that this industry is important but many would not realise its critical economic importance. Educational exports is our fourth largest export industry. We export $15 billion worth of education every year to people visiting Australia. It is actually more than our whole tourism industry combined. It supports 100,000 jobs. It has also, for better or worse, come to be a pivotal part of funding our higher education sector, and that is for students who are visiting from overseas but also for Australian students who are accessing tertiary education. About a quarter of our students at the moment are international students. They more than pay their way, and our universities are now very frank and up-front about how important that is for their survival.


These are some of the hard financials, but those of us who have been lucky to participate in this know that we reap a lot of other benefits from having international students studying with us in Australia, that it is not just about the dollars. In October 2012, the Labor government released the Australia in the Asian century white paper, a fantastic document which I think just started to unravel some of the difficult issues that we need to face to really embrace our proximity to Asia and get the most out of the Asian century. A report that considered the white paper pointed out that 80 per cent of the international students studying in Australia were from the Asian region and it said:


International education is a pillar of the people-to-people relationships that drive economic, cultural and social outcomes for Australia in the Asian Century …


I am very committed to this sentiment because I have been lucky to study in America as well and just about all of my classmates were from different countries around the world. I can absolutely say from personal experience that those person-to-person relationships are pivotal to the way that we liaise with other countries. When you look in the economics textbooks they are all about numbers on a page, but people really matter when it comes to building economic links. I think it is also relevant when we think about foreign affairs. A key plank of Australia's soft power and aid strategy is really being pursued through this exposure that we are giving to students all over Asia to Australian culture, to improved fluency in English and to the building of friendships that I have talked about. Perhaps even more relevantly for Australia as a nation, surrounded as we are by mostly Asian countries, it is a fantastic opportunity for us to learn about their culture, their language and the way that they do business.


A final point I would make on this is: just think of the fantastically skilled workforce that we are creating by helping turn out so many skilled graduates from our higher education institutions around Australia. This is hundreds of thousands of mostly young people, mostly from Asian countries, who are learning more about the English language, more about our Australian culture and forming ties to people, companies and institutions.


So there are a lot of benefits that I have talked about, but there have been challenges. When we see the thriving state of the sector today it is important for us to remember that this did not just happen organically. Significant intervention was required at certain times to make sure that things did not fall off the rails. Initially, the Howard government took a very hands-off approach to international education, with near disastrous consequences for the sector. I think we can remember that back in those days just about any old duffer could start up an international college of some sort and start providing some type of higher qualification. There were issues with lax immigration rules, which led to the entry of completely unsustainable levels of international students. Frankly, the institutions were unable to absorb those sorts of numbers. We saw the entry of some dodgy operators, who affected the whole export industry.


I think that, as well, we are all across a lot of the practical issues that were faced by those international students and that the government eventually had to come in and give a hand with. On issues around housing, we have all heard the stories of 17 young people crowding into and sleeping in shifts in bedrooms and all those sorts of things that have been going on. We have heard the endless stories about work exploitation that has taken place where international students were being paid well below the minimum wage and were not being given appropriate awards and conditions in the work that they were doing. We have heard about massive international attention being given to incidents of violence against international students—very disturbing stuff.


One of the things that we are seeing and that we have seen in recent years is that this is a very discerning group of consumers. These students who are coming to study in Australia have options presented to them all over the world. This is an open competition where countries like Australia are competing for these young students to come and study. When you look at the numbers you can see some of the sensitivities here. From 2008 to 2009, we had 70,000 visa applications granted to international students from India. I believe that was the peak of applications from India. It was also the time when some of those controversies started to bubble up a little bit. The following year, that dropped by more than 50 per cent. There were just 30,000 applications that following year. It is a staggering decline and just illustrates the importance of making sure that we have our eye on that industry. It does not need to be overregulated, but at the same time there are consequences for our whole economy and for this huge export industry if we let things run without some proper oversight.


The summary of this particular point is really that policy matters when it comes to this area of our economy. Leadership really matters, and national leadership at a time of global challenge is imperative. We saw the Rudd government come in and show leadership to try to grow the sector and to try to restore integrity so that those many thousands of Indian students who came in 2008-09 and then turned away the following year would feel more confidence in their decision to study in Australia. Just as important to restoring integrity to the sector is ensuring that we are restoring the appearance of integrity to the sector, because, as I said, this is a very discerning group of consumers.


A package of reforms was put forward to try to provide an appropriate level of protection and oversight to the industry. The Tuition Protection Service is an integral part of that. The Tuition Protection Service is a very important reform of the previous Labor government. It is simple. It provides a single contact point for students who are affected by provider default. It illustrates, I think, a deep level of commitment to protect these students who have made Australia their home for a period while they are trying to get higher education. The way that it works is that providers pay a levy, and the levy is used to support students who are trapped by provider default. It helps those students to either be placed in an alternative course or be paid a refund. It is very simple and very much an issue of justice when you think about it. The legislation said that, where students had paid up-front for a course and that course could not be provided to them, they were able to get help. They were able to be diverted into a new course or, at the very least, get their money repaid. It is shocking to think that we would even need legislation of this nature. You would think that this would not be required, but unfortunately there have been so many instances where we have seen students taken for a ride in this sector that the Rudd government had to come in and put this reform in place.


It is important to note also that the Tuition Protection Service has been essential because there have been so many instances, and I think there are predicted to be even more instances, where some of these institutions go into default. I think the Tuition Protection Service reported last year that up to 22 providers, serving 4,400 students, would close in the coming year through either business failure or regulatory action. Let us just absorb that. That is 4,400 students who went through the process and got themselves a visa, many of whom got on a plane and came to Australia to participate in these courses, and were then told, 'I'm sorry; the college has gone into default.' All we are really saying here is something pretty straightforward: these people deserve to get their money back or to be assisted into another type of institution.


In conclusion, we have talked about how important this sector is for our whole economy. Not all sectors are like this, but this one in particular is one where regulation has been very important. National leadership from our federal government has been essential to growing this sector and essential to maintaining the integrity of the sector so that a group of students who are showing themselves to be increasingly discerning about where they study will continue to choose Australia. And students like me, who had the great fortune to study with so many international students when I was a student at Monash, will continue to have that fantastic experience, and we will continue to see built those person-to-person links that will continue to help Australia move into this, the Asian, century.


Labor supports these amendments. We support any measures to help protect these international students, who are so much a part of our community and so much a part of my community in Hotham. I am pleased to speak in support of the amendments.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:05):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. Firstly, I would like to note that this bill makes a few technical amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. However, before I go to the specifics of the bill, I think it is very important to emphasise how important our educational exports are to our nation and how they grew under the previous coalition government.


If we go back to 1996, when the previous coalition government was first elected, our educational exports were a little over $2 billion per annum. By the year 1999-2000, we had been able to double it to $4 billion. In fact, by 2007-08, when the coalition left office, this sector was worth $14 billion of exports. Of course, the trajectory that it was on under those years of the coalition government saw it, by 2009, reach close to $19 billion worth of exports. To put that in context, that makes educational exports our third-largest export industry, only behind coal and iron ore. In fact, we have more people coming to this country and our nation derives more export income from education than it does from tourism. Although we have our natural wonders of Bondi Beach, Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef and we have places like Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House which attract overseas tourism and build wealth and create jobs in this country, our educational sector surpasses that. Our universities, our TAFEs and our schools actually return more to this nation in exports than do our natural resources, our beaches and the other wonderful things we have for overseas tourists to come and see.


The wealth to this country is even beyond that measured dollar value. We see that where we have students from overseas it strengthens our global network of connections. Who knows how many future leaders of Asian countries will be among those many students that come to Australia to study and receive their formative education and experiences here in Australia? This helps them be leaders of Asian countries in the future and means a lot to our nation through the friendships that will develop. However, even though we were able to get close to that $19 billion figure in 2009, unfortunately, and contrary to what the previous speaker was saying, we have seen a decline in those export revenues under the previous Labor government. It depends how you measure it, whether you take the financial year or the calendar year, but we have seen our educational export sector shrink to something like 20 to 25 per cent. It is a common theme that we see. The coalition continually improves things and then when Labor came to office back in 2007 they headed on a downward trend. This government is determined to reverse that downward trend and get our educational exports headed back in the right direction.


One of the main reasons our educational exports declined is because of some of the changes the previous Labor government made. To give them some sympathy, they were not totally to blame, but the changes they made to the visa system, the increases in fees, had a detrimental effect and harmed our exports. In fact, when we say a 20 to 25 per cent decline, this was something like $3 billion to $3.5 billion wiped off our educational export sector. That is more than if our entire wool industry was wiped out for one year. That is what we have lost in our educational exports.


On the specifics of the bill, it ensures that overseas students can receive appropriate refunds for unexpended fees in the case of an education provider or student default. It addresses the unintended consequences of amendments made in the ESOS Act 2012 which meant that some students were not able to receive refunds as originally intended. The problem only became evident after amendments were applied in practice. The bill proposes an amendment to ensure that the refund is for the full amount of tuition paid for or by the student, minus the amount calculated as having been delivered by the provider. The bill also gives the minister power to make a legislative instrument that will set out the method of calculation for refunds and in the case of different circumstances of visa refusal. This will streamline the requirements of the ESOS Act for users.


We have a great potential in this nation to increase our exports in our educational sector. We look across the board and we see where our jobs are going to come from in the future. Our educational sector is one of the keys to our economy. It is one of the areas where we have a competitive advantage. It is one of our nation's strengths. This is where government should be giving its support. UNESCO estimates that over this decade the number of internationally mobile students will almost double from four million to seven million. There is potential for us to increase our exports by multibillion dollars in future if we get the policy settings right, if we get our educational sector right. It is also important for several of our states. In New South Wales our educational exports are our second largest export sector. In Victoria it is actually the largest export sector for the whole state. 


However, there are some risks and some concerns. Some of those concerns that threaten this potential export bonanza we can have are what is in our cross-curriculum priorities, our new national curriculum. We do have those three cross-curriculum embedded priorities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and cultures, Asia and Australia's engagement with Asia, and sustainability. The concept of sustainability under the new national curriculum will be embedded in all areas of the curriculum, including mathematics. I quote from the national curriculum:


In the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics, the priority of sustainability provides rich, engaging and authentic contexts for developing students’ abilities in number and algebra, measurement and geometry, and statistics and probability.


It goes on:


The Australian Curriculum: Mathematics provides opportunities for students to develop the proficiencies of problem solving and reasoning essential for the exploration of sustainability issues and their solutions.


If the definition of sustainability was about economic sustainability, how governments must run a sustainable budget, this would be a welcome change, something that is welcome in our curriculum. We could actually take those concepts and we could use them in mathematics. We could look at basic addition and use the theory of economic sustainability to teach it to our children. For example, we could actually add up the last five budget deficits of this Labor government—$27.1 billion, $54.8 billion, $47.7 billion, $43.7 billion and $19.4 billion—to work out $192 billion of accumulated deficits. This would obviously help our children learn about mathematics and addition. 


We can also project forward. Again, we could teach children about addition in mathematics as a concept and look at the MYEFO over the last four years—for 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. If we add up those projected deficits that the previous government has locked in with our policies, we get over $120 billion of combined deficits. We could also teach our children the principles of simple interest in mathematics, as the current unsustainable debt that was racked up by the previous Labor government now costs the economy $10 billion annually. This is a way we can teach children percentages.


We could also teach them probability. We could quote to children the budget speech of the former Treasurer back in 2012, when he said:


The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies. This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time.


He continued:


The surplus years are here.


We could teach the concept of probability to students, because they could learn that the probability of that occurring would be absolutely zero. 


If that is what our children were being taught about sustainability, we would not have too much objection, but what is the definition of sustainability? I quote directly from our new national education curriculum which defines it as follows:


The Sustainability priority is futures-oriented, focusing on protecting environments and creating a more ecologically and socially just world through informed action. 


This is not a Greenpeace brochure; this is the concept that is embedded in everything Australian students learn under our national curriculum. Gone is the notion that our progress is defined as the exercise of mankind's ability to overcome our natural barriers. Gone is the inspiration and positive vision for the future that was instilled in my public school education back in the seventies. Gone is the need to strive to make our society wealthier and to grow the pie. Instead, we are replacing it with the idea of cutting the pie into smaller pieces in a so-called 'more socially just world'. 


This is not what we want to have in our education system. If we want our education system to be a world best, something we hold up to attract exports and that students from overseas want to come and learn in, we need to be teaching in our education system. We need to place importance on independence and self-confidence. We need to be teaching our kids about fierce determination and willingness so that they are not afraid to make mistakes. We need to teach them critical thinking and to question common dogma. But most of all, we need to teach our kids optimism.


But instead, the definition of sustainability we have embedded in our national curriculum is simply a corrosive, green doctrine. It is at odds with progress. It teaches restraint and low growth, social conformity, a mistrust of society and a pessimistic fear of the future. This is not what we want. Rather than indoctrinate children about sustainability, the limits to growth and the limits to our resources, we should be teaching our kids that the greatest resource they have is human ingenuity and that it is something that has no limits. Instead, our curriculum has been hijacked by green ideology.


For such an important industry for our country, something that we are going to rely upon to drive growth and to create those future jobs, we must address these issues so that we have overseas students who want to come to Australia, who see our education system as a world best and to enable kids to have a positive outlook for the future. The current national curriculum does not do that and it needs to be addressed.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (17:20):  I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013. I will reflect quickly on some of the comments that the previous speaker made. I want to say how sad it is that higher education has become the biggest exporting industry in Victoria. To become the biggest exporting industry in Victoria, it means that we have lost others. For higher education to be the biggest exporting industry, it means that as we have seen today, last week and yesterday with Toyota, we are starting to lose other industries that are important to our economy, such as our manufacturing industry. I do not believe that it is something that we can celebrate without acknowledging that other industries we rely on, ones that employ other people and create wealth and jobs, are disappearing. 


The future of this country cannot rely solely upon a strong higher education sector. Higher education is important, as all the previous speakers have suggested, and international students are particularly important. The figures that we are talking about are over $15 billion and there are over 100,000 jobs in the higher education sector. Like every industry, it needs to be regulated to ensure that those purchasing the product get a good quality product and that those receiving the education get the best education they can for the dollars they provide.


I turn to why our universities are so reliant on full-fee-paying international students. It is not right to talk only about the higher education sector as an export industry, like coal, iron ore or manufacturing. We need to grow this sector because funding for our university sector was radically cut during the Howard years, which put us on a path to universities needing to rely on international students to supplement their budgets. 


I support the amendments in the bill before us in relation to the Tuition Protection Service. The amendments aim to ensure that the TPS has the power to force a refund of prepaid fees where the provider fails to deliver the service, a course is cancelled or a visa is not issued. These safeguards ensure the quality of services provided by the education system. It is no secret that we have had some shonky and dodgy colleges taking advantage of international students by suggesting that if they complete their studies they will get permanent residence in Australia. Whilst this bill does not go to those issues, it ensures that if an international student has a visa cancelled or has enrolled in a course that is cancelled, they will receive a full refund. The aim is to build in safeguards that do not already exist so overseas students get the education they seek.


In providing additional financial security, these amendments will ensure there is a policy connection between the federal and state agencies to support the international education sector. In my state of Victoria a lot of work was done by the former Labor government to try and get rid of dodgy providers and rogue operators who popped up in any corner store. In fact, a place across the road from where I live was given as the address of college claiming to teach motor mechanics, but it was just an empty house. When international students turned up on the day their classes were supposed to start there were no classes. This occurs and, without government stepping in to clean up these practices, such practices will continue. These sorts of practices are not good for our reputation as they send a message that Australia is not serious about higher education, but rather is a country where students need to pick and choose so as not to end up across the road from my place wondering why it is not a mechanics institute, as was thought.


I acknowledge the contribution international students make to our society. Many of these students choose to stay in Australia. I have talked to a number of students in my electorate who have chosen to stay and make Australia their home once they have navigated their way through the system and successfully completed their education and asked them about the changes they feel are needed. I asked them what we could have done to support international students and about the challenges they faced. I draw on some comments made by Abi Awasthi, who is today working at La Trobe University's Bendigo campus. His comments include ensuring that, apart from having access to courses of high quality, international students in Australia have access to affordable, safe and adequate accommodation services and that international students also have access to student services. For many international students this is a foreign country and they may not be used to our practices. This may be the first time they have left their home country, so there is a need to support them when they arrive particularly if they believe the college they attend is not delivering the services they paid for.


Another issue raised is the need for good jobs with good pay and working conditions so international students can properly support themselves. Dodgy contractors employing international students are very similar to dodgy colleges in that they take advantage of the students not knowing a lot about Australian legislation, so being easy to rip off. We need to support international students by ensuring they get good quality education, the course they believe they have signed up to and good jobs. I draw to the House's attention a recent report by United Voice, the cleaners union representing international students working in the cleaning industry. This report found that a number of international students are working for fly-by-night subcontractors who often cheat the students out of at least $15,000 a year in pay. These students lack the knowledge of their rights, which makes them extremely vulnerable to exploiters.


This is happening in the cleaning industry in capital cities as well as regions. Why do international students take up these jobs? Often their courses are quite expensive and they need the work to support themselves while they study. Across the whole area, when it comes to international students, whether it be the courses that they take up, the jobs that they have or the accommodation services that are provided, we need to do better to ensure that they are treated fairly and we need to do better as the host country.


As mentioned earlier, Abi is an example of the kind of international student who is coming here. He arrived in Australia in 2008 as a full-fee-paying international student to pursue his masters at La Trobe University. He says that his experience is a good experience, but the experience of some of the other international students he knows is not so good. He talks about people being picked up at the airport and being dropped off with their bags at an office, and that is it. He talks about people who have had accommodation found for them that is an hour and a half, two buses and a train away, from where their courses are. He talks about the courses that they have been offered, the one-on-one tutorial time that they are told they will get and the payment that they will get to do their placements, but when the students take up the placements they are not paid. That is another major problem for international students today. 


In some courses these students are becoming free labour, almost slave labour. As part of their course, they are required to do work experience, but the work experience might be three months working nine till five. You see these schemes being rolled out and rolled out. To complete their course, the international student has to work for free for long periods of time. That is something that Australian students would balk at and say, 'That is simply not fair.' This is why the changes being proposed to the Tuition Protection Service are important. 


Across the sector, we need to make sure that we are doing better by our international students. Why are international students so important to university funding? I flagged this earlier in my speech. I know that some would argue, particularly in my community, that we should train our own first, that the growing number of international students is at the cost of Australian places. The truth is that the higher education sector would have collapsed without the funding of international students. 


This situation was created under the former Howard government's bad Liberal policy of the late 90s and early 2000s. The funding that was cut from the higher education sector and the rate at which it was cut forced our universities to look for alternate funding streams. It was shortly afterwards that we saw the explosion in international student numbers. They have enhanced our universities and are building a strong culture. However, we cannot step away from the fact that cutting university funding has created a market for international students where sometimes our institutions are more interested in the money they are getting than the courses they are delivering. We need to ensure that our students and our guests in this country are receiving the quality education that they are seeking to pursue. 


I want to go to comments made about the reduction in international student numbers in the last year. That is not the result of changes to the visas but purely and simply because of the cost of study in this country. Australia is now ranked as the highest in regard to the cost of study. Our courses are going up and there is the effect of the Australian dollar and the cost of living. That is why I have attempted to highlight the need to do more for international students when it comes to their jobs, their education and their accommodation. Whilst I support these measures to ensure that we have quality within the system, I would like to reiterate my warning that we cannot rely on higher education continuing to be our largest export sector. If we continue down this path of just educating people and not having jobs for them, we will soon run out of people to educate. We need to make sure that we have strong industries—industries such as higher education, health and manufacturing. It is not always the best news to be the largest export sector; it means that other sectors are doing badly. To say that it is wonderful and is the future of jobs in this country, I think, is a bit sad particularly following the announcement by Toyota that they are withdrawing. We need an economy where we are growing jobs across the board, not just in our higher education sector.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:35):  I want to pick up from the very wise comments of my colleague. It is always very important for us to think that education is part of what we need to do to create a place for ourselves in the 21st century economy, but so is investment in research and development and the practical application of that research. Just blindly following the mantra that it is all education, education, education can very much misguide us as to what we need to do to ensure that we have the jobs into the future and the capacity for people to exploit that education. Countries like Ireland and Italy produce very many skilled graduates who simply are unable to find work in their home country 


So we know that is a necessary but certainly not a sufficient condition. If we are going to be a successful country, we have to be prepared to invest and to understand that government investment in research has been critical for the development of industries that we like to think of as 21st century industries. It was not Google, Yahoo or Facebook that developed the internet, nor did they develop Wi-Fi or touchscreens. All these things were developed within government agencies with massive government investment to explore these very new technologies. The private sector then, quite rightfully and properly, leveraged off it. But let us not be confused about this mantra of small government being the thing that is going to drive our economy forward.


In relation to higher education, there are a couple of observations. I do not want to repeat what everyone else has said. It is very important that we keep our standards high. There is some evidence that Australia is perhaps in some higher education areas becoming a less preferred destination. We have to take steps to ensure that the quality of our institutions is considered comparable to the quality in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and even in some of the Asian countries. It is really important for us always to focus not just on the quantity but also on the quality for us to maintain our ability to compete against those institutions in other First World countries. We have to be capable and prepared to invest. I repeat: part of keeping our higher education sector competitive is being prepared to invest in the research component of institutions so that they attract the brightest and best and in turn prove attractive to students overseas who see themselves having the opportunity of working in prestigious organisations, but also working on projects and with individuals who are seen to be at the leading edge of a particular discipline.


Everyone likes to come in here to talk about this fantastic export industry. It is an important industry and it is very beneficial for us. We do occasionally have to take off the rose-coloured glasses and look at where we stand particularly on higher education in relation to other universities around the world and look at ways in which we can support quality, because there is an inherent conundrum for universities and others selling their services. Do we consider the people who are buying these services to be our customers? The customer is always right, so do we ease the customer's passage through our institution, perhaps of the cost of lowering standards, or do we take a longer term gain and keep those standards high, which may create the difficulties of whether or not we pass or fail students? It is a contradiction, one I know academic institutions around the world are grappling with. How do we attract foreign fee-paying students, giving them in the short term perhaps an easier passage through the courses while maybe damaging the longer term reputation of our institutions? It is a hard game to play. We know that people tend to focus more on the short term than on the long term in looking at the performance of their institution.


I was surprised by some of the statements. I thought we had bipartisan support around this thing but as usual we had an attack on the Labor government embedded in the second reading speech—it is almost ritualistic. It is interesting that they were talking about us driving down the student figures. The figures I have, even the driven down figures supposedly of the last financial year, are well and truly in excess of anything achieved under the Howard government. So it does seem to be a rather strange criticism that during the last year of the Howard government when there were 250,000 student visa holders in Australia and in the last year of the Labor government there were 304,000, you could seek some claim that we had driven this industry backwards. There was a very substantial increase over the time of the Labor government. It peaked in 2009. I also make the point that there is absolutely no doubt that we want international students here, that we want this industry, that it creates good jobs for Australians. It has the ability to drive up standards, to make more complex and intellectually rich and robust our higher education institutions. 


But there is also a price to be paid with these high levels because there is certainly no doubt that our housing affordability problems are related to the rapid rise in our population. We saw this happening very dramatically in Perth where house prices doubled within a three- to four-year period from 2003 to 2007. Growth in population does drive housing affordability problems. If we expand our population too rapidly, our ability to supply housing at a sufficient rate is simply not there. That has certainly been the experience in Australia over the last 10 years. So I do think that, whilst we must encourage this as a vibrant industry, it cannot be that numbers go up without any real thought about what that does to the burden of infrastructure and to our ability to accommodate everyone at a price that is not going to undermine affordability of housing for very many Australian people. 


I certainly think we have seen that more dramatically in Perth than anywhere else. This is not blaming migrants, but this is saying that rapid population growth does bring with it some real challenges. So we should not be there with rose-coloured glasses saying that all of these issues and industries are not without their challenges. This is a good industry. I totally support us providing these measures that are going to enhance the student experience and address some of the concerns that were experienced by the industry, while at the same time maintaining quality. But I do want to say, let us not be uncritical about what some of the challenges are that come with bringing large numbers of additional people into the country in a very small space of time. Thank you.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-02-11,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (17:46):  I am pleased to rise today to speak in favour of Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2013 and also to follow some great contributions from colleagues from Cunningham, Hotham, Bendigo and Perth.


Attracting overseas students to study in our institutions is one of the most important ways we can build and maintain a broad, smart, Asia-focused economy into the future. For a lot of Asia's young people, studying in Australia can be a leap of faith. Imagine a young person in Mumbai or Guangzhou or any city or town in our region or beyond, thinking about taking that step. They want to know that their investment is secure, that their chosen institution is credible and that their surroundings will be safe and conducive to learning. If you go beyond all the acronyms and the public policy speak, that is what the Tuition Protection Service is all about. It is about safeguarding the investment and the potential that flows from many thousands of the world's young people choosing our education system over all the others.


I am proud to have the opportunity to speak in this place on a bill that seeks to empower the TPS, which is a great reform of the higher education sector achieved by Labor in government under Prime Minister Gillard. This legislation deals with an issue very close to my own heart and is crucial to our country, our economy and my own community in Rankin.


Like a lot of my colleagues in here. I believe Australia has a lot to gain from a strong higher education sector, for our own people and also for our international students. Tertiary education like all forms of learning is about providing people with the tools to create their own success in life. I think the most important thing governments can do is provide these tools and nourish those aspirations. In this way, wide access to higher education is a path to greater economic mobility, which should be one of our most pressing objectives as parliamentarians. It is only through higher education that Australia can become a knowledge economy, which will drive greater productivity and transform the lives of individuals, families and communities from one generation to the next.


I am proud to say that the previous Labor government did a lot to strengthen the higher education sector. This is one of its proudest legacies—something even its harshest critics would have to concede. Labor oversaw a growth in university funding of more than 50 per cent, a staggering amount given the fiscal constraints of the time. We established the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency which has helped maintain our world-class standards in the area of higher education. We were also responsible for introducing the Tuition Protection Service, which is the subject of this bill, and which offers protections for international students studying in Australia and ensures that our reputation as a country with high-quality higher education is maintained—something that is absolutely crucial for our ability to sell education to the world.


The unfortunate fact is that the need to introduce the TPS came about as a result of some poor handling of the higher education sector in the last years of the Howard government. That government oversaw student immigration laws that resulted in unsustainable increases in the volume of international students studying in Australia without the necessary systems and safeguards, which as a result failed to maintain the integrity of the system. The natural consequence of this was the entrance of a large number of new higher education providers specially designed to capture the international student market and not all of them were, shall we say, well-intentioned. Unfortunately, some of these could be better described as immigration scams rather than genuine educational providers. That is the reality of it.


Students from overseas were lured here on the promise of world-class education in Australia's high-quality higher education sector, but arrived on our shores to find something entirely different. In 2009 and 2010 alone, 49 higher education providers closed, leaving over 11,000 students displaced. The result of this was substantial reputational damage to the entire Australian education system, jeopardising our place in the very competitive global market for higher education. International student numbers took a hit as a result. 


The introduction of the TPS was one of several measures introduced by Labor to restore confidence and quality to our education system in Australia. The benefit of the TPS over previous measures is that it was set up to function like insurance cover for international students. In this way, education providers paid levies based on their risk of closure or failure to provide a course  As a result, public universities do not pay a risk component at all, as they present an extremely low likelihood of closure. All education providers pay for the basic costs of administering the program and they all benefit from the enhanced reputational stability that results.


In the 2013-14 financial year, the annual TPS levy placed on registered providers of international education collected $6 million for the Overseas Students Tuition Fund, which gives you an indication of the scope of this program. The benefits of the TPS for students and universities are substantial and so are the benefits for Australia. Overseas students have greater confidence about coming to study in Australia. The TPS means that if a provider fails or a course becomes unavailable, the student has access to resources to help find an alternative placement for them. They can also rest more soundly in the knowledge that if there is no alternative course available they are able to request a refund of their fees out of the $6 million pool that is raised annually.


In the 2012-13 financial year, nine providers around the nation were closed, affecting 907 students. Well over half of those students sought assistance from the TPS and 282 of them were placed in alternative courses or received refunds. For the university sector, the TPS offers assurance that Australia's reputation as a provider of quality education is not diminished by the closure of smaller institutions. I am pleased to see that this bill will give the TPS further powers to achieve these goals.


Firstly, the TPS will be able to force the refund of pre-paid fees from a provider where that provider fails or a course is cancelled. It is a very basic thing but an important piece of assurance. Secondly, the TPS will be able to force the refund of pre-paid fees where a visa is refused for a prospective student. Again, this is a good, common-sense measure. Both of these extra powers will provide greater certainty for prospective international students considering coming to Australia for study.


The reputation of our educators, including universities across Australia—like Griffith University at Logan in my electorate—will benefit from these proposed changes. Across Griffith University international students make up over a quarter of the student population, or nearly 11,000 students. Students attending the TAFEs and private colleges in my electorate will also benefit. The Metropolitan South Institute of TAFE, with campuses in Browns Plains and just over the border of my electorate at Loganlea, offer courses to international students in a range of disciplines including hairdressing, business and youth work. 


There are nearly 350,000 international students in Australia, a quarter of whom are from China and nearly 10 per cent from India. International students provide a huge boost to our universities, allowing them to invest in infrastructure to support all students and increasing the cultural diversity of education in Australia. Since the changes to higher education by the Labor government in 2012, there has been a strong resurgence in international student numbers across Australia. And it is the right kind of high-quality resurgence—not a free-for-all, like last time. 


Data from the Department of Immigration and Border Security shows that over 74,000 foreigners applied to become students in Australia in the quarter to September 2013. That is an increase of seven per cent on the previous year, and that is a very good thing. Really encouraging is the fact that Chinese student applications jumped by over 20 per cent and applications from India more than doubled. That is a great outcome and a fantastic development for our economy.


With the surge in international student numbers in Australia, it is critically important that we support those students once they are here. Assurance of the provision of courses via the TPS is just one aspect of this. It is equally important that we ensure the quality of education for all students in Australia. I had the opportunity and the pleasure last November to deliver a speech at the conference of the Australia and New Zealand Student Services Association. It was a great opportunity to meet with people who devote their careers to achieving great outcomes for university and TAFE students, including our international student population. They are a big part of what we need to succeed in this area and I pay tribute to their work. Some of them expressed concerns to me about the future of student services in the face of cuts confirmed by the government last year, and cuts that are likely to be around the corner under the guise of the Commission of Audit.


Universities and vocational education providers around Australia just cannot afford extreme cuts to their budgets. Of course there are difficult decisions to be made in budgets, and that is where priorities kick in. The fact that the coalition imposed a $2.3 billion cut, after not supporting the needs-based schools funding scheme that the saving was designed to cover, is indicative of their overall approach to education. The coalition sees spending on education as a cost rather than as an investment. They do not understand that investment in education results in increased productivity, increased labour force participation and a boost in funds raised from the export of education—among many other benefits.


Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2012-13 shows that education-related travel was Australia's fourth-largest export, beaten only by iron, coal and gold. Think about that for a moment: the fourth largest export. As such, Australia's economy depends on us having a strongly competitive and stable higher education market for international students, and that is something that this bill will support.


As we witness a resurgence in the international student population in Australia, a strong TPS is more important than ever. The annual report for the TPS indicates that there are up to 4,400 students with 22 providers that could close in the coming financial year, either as a result of business failure or because of regulatory action. Those 4,400 students depend on a strong Tuition Protection Service to ensure that their education is not affected as a result of poor operational decisions by higher education providers. What is more, the reputation of the entire Australian university and vocational training sector depends on a strong TPS. It is for this reason that the Labor opposition are proud to support this measure to strengthen our original Tuition Protection Service, and it is why I encourage all members to vote in support of this bill.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (17:59):  The Australian government supports a vibrant education system. It is committed to rebuilding Australia's international education industry and ensuring the appropriate quality assurance underpins our education system while taking steps to reduce red tape and the overall regulatory burden. The government will work tirelessly to ensure international students who choose Australia as their study destination receive education and training of the highest quality we can offer. Ensuring certainty for them and respecting their rights as consumers adds to both the credibility of our reputation in international education and the fulfilment of their ambitions in studying here.


By ensuring that the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, or ESOS, and its associated legislative framework work effectively and efficiently, we will enhance the reputation and appeal of Australia's education system. The amendments made to the ESOS Act by this bill will help deliver on our government's commitment to international students to provide a robust and fair system. They will increase certainty and fairness for students and providers of international education by rectifying unintended consequences from amendments to the legislation made in 2012 which may inadvertently restrict the amount of a refund an international student receives in some circumstances. The bill gives the minister the power to make a legislative instrument to specify refund requirements where an international student has had their visa refused. I will be using this opportunity to more clearly articulate those requirements after consultation with stakeholders.


The bill also amends the name of the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007 to remove reference to 'Registration Authorities'. The name of the national code will then reflect its purpose following the 2012 amendments to the ESOS Act. The change to the title of the national code does not affect its contents or operation. This minor amendment will be followed by further work on the national code to ensure it is contemporary and as far as possible addresses the needs of international students and education providers.


These amendments ensure the ESOS Act operates as it should. Timely passage of this bill is important to ensure certainty and clarity for providers and students across the sector as we rebuild the status and potential of international education in Australia.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt) (21:00):  I rise tonight to highlight the great work of a local theatre company, the JUTE Theatre Company. JUTE has recently been successful in receiving another triennial grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. JUTE's artistic director and CEO, Suellen Maunder, wrote to me to let me know that they really appreciate the federal support and would continue to punch well above their weight.


JUTE came into being in 1992 when three passionate theatre makers—Kathryn Ash, Suellen Maunder and Susan Prince—met in Cairns and the creative sparks begin to fly. JUTE's first production launched in 1993 in the height of summer in a shed with no air conditioning. Nevertheless, it was an instant success. Over two decades, JUTE's artists and audiences have been part of an extraordinary outpouring of new Australian stories, producing over 65 new works from regional theatre makers. It is the country's largest producer of new Australian plays. Together with KickArts Contemporary Arts, JUTE successfully lobbied for $2.7 million in capital works funding to develop the Centre for Contemporary Arts—an incredible contemporary arts performing space.


This year JUTE will present five very diverse pieces of life-changing storytelling. Propelled, which is the first one, featuring Doug Robins, was a very uplifting story of living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a degenerative terminal disease. The audience rose to their feet for a standing ovation every night of the performances. Although the season in Cairns has finished, JUTE is looking at touring this work to Australian and international festivals. Another exciting work is the comical Proper Solid, by Indigenous playwright Steven Oliver. It is about the first Australian Aboriginal President in 2067 who is suddenly flung back in time to 2014.


Unfortunately, the state government's financial situation means they have had to make cuts to the arts. This has led to some challenges for JUTE in providing their public performance program. Suellen tells me that Propelled was a particularly important show as it gave voice to someone with different abilities. However, to enable this production to go ahead, JUTE had to dig deep into the budget for the remainder of the year. Suellen is very keen to find a champion for this work who might be able to help cover the $30,000 shortfall. There is a fantastic opportunity for corporate sponsorship here and I strongly urge any interested businesses to get in touch with Suellen.


Looking to the bigger picture, my involvement in the development of the white paper for Northern Australia has really highlighted to me the importance of regional arts. When we are looking at how to get people into regional areas, it is not just about incentives like tax breaks. There are other liveability factors, and being able to enjoy the arts, both visual and performing, is certainly a major part of that. It may not be a pull factor for people looking to move to Cairns but it is certainly a retention factor once they get there.


I actively support JUTE and Suellen Maunder. It is an absolute credit that a small regional city like Cairns has produced a theatre company like this. We have to be very proud of them. In fact, in 2012 I featured in the local newspaper in my boxer shorts with a couple of young female performers to promote their Studio Shorts show. I have no doubt that I significantly increased the attendance of that show! Over the years—and you may find this surprising, Madam Speaker—being the culture-vulture that I am, I have attended a diverse range of these productions, from a show about the colourful history of Spanish settler Jose Paronella titled The Impossible Dreamto a fantastic play this year starring Aaron Fa'aoso and Jimmy Bani called Half and Half.


It is important that we recognise the value of our performing arts and provide them with the appropriate funding. At the same time, it is not just about the support from local, state and federal governments; it is also about the community. My wife, Yolonde, and I have just purchased season tickets for this year's five shows to show our encouragement. We need to be publicly supporting our local theatre, otherwise we will face the consequences of losing not just this facility but the ability to create new stories that contribute to our regional identity.

  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) The areas listed in (a) to (g) have not been the subject of an NBN Co build contract. While these areas were listed in NBN Co's one year rollout plan published in April 2013, under previous definitions this simply indicated that construction of the network was scheduled to commence within 12 months.
