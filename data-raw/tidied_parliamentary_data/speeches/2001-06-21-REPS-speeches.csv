"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—The Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 spells out in living colour just what great financial managers the Howard government are. It tells the real story behind that orgy of self-congratulation, all the bravado that we hear from this government about its financial management credentials. It spells out the truth: a $640 million taxpayer funded bailout for the HIH policyholders to deal with the largest corporate collapse in Australian history. Behind the mask of sound financial management, this bill tells the truth. In the budget we saw $663 million allocated to pay all pensioners $300 each. But if we did not have to carry the HIH can, all the pensioners could have been given twice that, $600—much closer to the $1,000 that the government promised them in the first place as GST compensation. Whether you look at the schools, the hospitals or the roads— whatever way you look at it—$640 million would go an awfully long way. Except that now it has gone. It will not be doing anything except paying out policies that HIH policyholders thought they were already insured for.  
Why has it come to this? One of the things we learnt from senior APRA officials last week in the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services was that the Australian Government Actuary stopped producing regular reports on all insurance companies after 1998 because that work was not adding value. The decision to stop producing these reports on insurance companies saved APRA $60,000 but it might have cost Australian taxpayers around $640 million, as we can see with the bailout package in this piece of legislation. Talk about false economies. This latest revelation from APRA underscores what has been massive regulatory failure on the part of this government and its established regulator, APRA. It makes a mockery of the claims of Treasurer Costello. When APRA was first set up, Treasurer Costello boasted that it would give Australia a stronger regulatory regime designed to better respond to developments in the financial sector. Not only did APRA not provide a stronger regulatory regime; it stopped producing reports on insurance companies to save a pittance while HIH collapsed under its very nose. These great financial managers of the Howard government are going to leave behind them a legacy of up to $640 million over 10 years of a taxpayer funded bailout to meet the worst insurance company collapse in Australian history.
The bill establishes a public company, HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd, to administer a scheme of financial assistance for eligible persons who had an outstanding claim against the HIH Insurance group, which went into provisional liquidation in March. That company, which has been set up as a subsidiary of the Insurance Council of Australia, will act as trustee of a Commonwealth trust fund, for which this bill provides a special appropriation of $640 million of Commonwealth funds. I make the point in passing— and, given that we are talking about $140 million, perhaps it should be made more than in passing—that, when we had the budget announced a few short weeks ago, the allocation for the HIH bailout was $500 million. A few weeks later, it has jumped to $640 million. We do not know exactly where this is going to stop. I was listening to the radio this morning and hearing a great deal of concern being expressed about the safe injecting rooms trial in New South Wales now costing $4 million. I am sure that Liberal politicians will fire up about the fact that—oh, dear!— that is costing $4 million. Here we have a $140 million blow-out already, in a few short weeks, but because it relates to an insurance company that made handsome donations to the Liberal Party we should not expect too many Liberal Party politicians to jump up and fire up about a $140 million blow-out.
We will be supporting this bill. We want to ensure that HIH victims do not suffer any more than they have already been forced to over the past months because of this government's meanness. We do have some serious concerns regarding the lack of accountability in this legislation and a number of matters concerning the administration of the scheme. I want to detail some of those in the time available to me. 
Labor understands the resentment caused in the general community by bailouts such as these and the government's predisposition to socialise the losses and privatise the profits of big business, but the bottom line is that we simply could not walk away and just leave the victims to it. Labor has expressed concern all the way through about the situation faced by the victims, the innocent policyholders. We have expressed deep concern at the government's dithering and indecision in dealing with this matter. Not only does the government carry great responsibility for the collapse itself in terms of poor regulation but also its handling of the collapse has been appalling. So we have had dithering and indecision in both acting to help the victims of the debacle and then putting in place an efficient mechanism to deal with it.  
At every point the government has been dragged kicking and screaming. First it said that there would not be any bailout—the policyholders had to sue the directors, and the auditors and so on had to look to their legal rights. Then it said, `We will have a bailout but we cannot give you any details until we hear the provisional liquidator's report.' Then it announced details without getting the provisional liquidator's report. So what had been missing was not so much the information as the political will to act. Then it said, `We will not have a royal commission.' Labor said, `We will hold a royal commission,' and now—hey presto—we are getting a royal commission. But even then there was dithering. It took as long as it possibly could to announce the royal commission. It then took at least another month to announce the terms of reference. We only got the terms of reference at the start of this week. We discovered then that the royal commissioner cannot commence his task until 1 September. So the government in that way has dragged out the royal commission as long as it possibly can and will avoid public scrutiny and accountability for its actions prior to the forthcoming federal election. 
So it took more than two months of government procrastination before a rescue package was finally announced in late May. Meanwhile, thousands of HIH victims were burning, left at the mercy of Centrelink, whose record was no shining example of efficiency. A number of constituents informed me of problems involving excessive bureaucracy, waiting periods of anything up to six weeks and cases that simply were not fixed until there was a great deal of media publicity concerning them. 
Frankly, it has not got any better since the government established its HIH hotline. We have had constituent concerns rolling in about people who could not get through to the 1800 number or who were kept waiting for inordinate lengths of time. When they did get through, they were confronted with staff who had inadequate training or who were unable to answer their questions or offer much assistance at all. It left those victims, after everything they had been through—a lot of anguish and anxiety—up in the air, not knowing from where, or what sort of, assistance would come. 
People have been seeking some form of claims documentation so they could get their claims lodged in writing and have some peace of mind. Quite a few people were under the impression that the claims had to be lodged by 11 June because the government publicity concerning this issue was confusing and failed to make it sufficiently clear that this cut-off date of 11 June really only applied to events from which a possible claim could arise. So they were quite frustrated in trying to get that documentation and being told by the hotline call centre that it had not even been drafted yet, thinking that it had to be lodged within just a few days. 
For example, my office had discussions with Mr Jim Punchard from Brisbane, who called my office on 5 June, having first called and sought out the HIH hotline on 25 May. His conversation with the HIH hotline was very frustrating for him. He eventually got to speak to a young lady who said she could only take a note of his name. A few calls later he spoke to a young man who said he would send the relevant papers by Friday, but it turned out that the papers had not even been printed at that stage. So Mr Punchard eventually received a copy of an old press release. In the meantime he twice had to register his claim as having checked whether his first registration via the hotline was successful. He was informed that there was no such record. So we had delays and concern expressed by him and by other people in their dealings with the hotline.  
But it is not just a question of government incompetence in relation to the process. We need to come back to the most substantial issue which arises here, and that is adequacy of compensation. The government has restricted eligibility to cases that broadly fall within a federal jurisdiction, such as salary continuance policyholders. This leaves people whose insurance obligation arises under various state laws to deal with the various state jurisdictions as they find them. 
One of the things I have been critical about with this government—and in particular Minister Hockey, to whom I wrote prior to Easter urging on him the convening of a national roundtable—has been their failure to convene that national roundtable and failure to show the leadership which might have given us some kind of national solution, instead of the piecemeal one that we have got. Most of those state governments are Labor and they have stepped in, in good conscience, to help the people covered under state arrangements. Many of those people have been in quite desperate circumstances. We should not forget the builders, many of whom could not get insurance at all after the debacle and so they could not start new jobs. Indeed, in some cases legally they could not continue existing jobs. In my home state of Victoria there was a very significant impact on the building industry as a result of that.
Most of the state Labor governments have come to the party in terms of rescue and bailout measures. The only Liberal state government in Australia, the South Australian government, has failed to provide any assistance whatsoever to those victims excluded from the Commonwealth scheme. As I understand it, the best it has been able to come up with is a hotline of its own. That hotline, set up by the South Australian state government, advises on rights under the Commonwealth scheme. I understand it was so mean it is not even a toll-free number.
In South Australia, a state member of parliament, Mr Nick Xenophon, has drawn attention to leaked documents of the Master Builders Association, whose building indemnity policy was underwritten by HIH. Due to the way the law has operated, the HIH policies were still in force, despite being worthless, and builders were not obliged to take out fresh insurance. If the builder goes belly-up, in the words of Mr Xenophon, the risk is that `it leaves hundreds of South Australians potentially exposed with respect to their biggest investment'. But of course the Liberal government has done nothing to compel builders to take out alternative valid insurance, and so the upshot is that potentially a whole new class of victims of the HIH collapse lies in waiting, without any help from any government becoming available in that event. The South Australian government ought to be condemned for the meanness of its response to the situation facing innocent HIH policyholders.
The scheme does not include assistance to small or medium enterprises with 50-plus employees. I note that we have seen submissions from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and comments from the chief executive, Rob Bastian, that it is `increasingly clear that small business is suffering more than policyholders' and that the government has the attitude that `small business is more able to face risk and less deserving of assistance'.
As I indicated earlier, Labor has some concerns about issues of accountability in relation to this legislation and, in relation to the bailout package, the accountability of those funding and those administering the scheme. The company concerned has been set up as a subsidiary of the Insurance Council of Australia. I note again, as I have mentioned in the House on a couple of occasions previously, that the insurance industry has not been asked to make any contribution to the bailout package. Labor thinks that is wrong and that the government ought to have been showing national leadership in getting together a national roundtable with a view to having an insurance industry contribution. With the way in which this package has been set up, the public accountability for this company, this industry vehicle, HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd, is lacking, and we do not see in the legislation any means of understanding how claims are administered or for whose benefit it operates. Labor is quite concerned and wants to hear from the minister a response on what is a pretty fundamental point: where is the real incentive for the administrators to test claims in the way that insurance companies usually do when the claim is against their own funds? We do not see evidence of safeguards in this bill to ensure that the amounts paid out are neither excessive nor insufficient. As it stands, the Commonwealth just foots the bill and that is the end of it. 
Most of us know that insurance companies are pretty tough in their attitude to claims. Some would use more colourful language than that in describing the approach of insurance companies. What you do get out of that toughness, of course, is some reassurance that that money is not wasted and that it is not simply a question of putting in a claim and then having it accepted. In this situation where you do not have the insurance companies' profit motive at work, what we are interested in understanding from the government is the way in which claims will be tested and what mechanisms it has in place to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer.
We are concerned that the taxpayer is already exposed to a $640 million bailout and we cannot find an obligation to report what profits are made by the Insurance Council members in administering the scheme. There are precious few details of these arrangements in the bill, and we think that the contract between the Commonwealth and HCS should be made public to allow scrutiny and enable some public assessment of the extent to which the eligibility criteria and restrictions are defined, including the proposed income test, so that there are no more surprises in store regarding a possible funding blow-out. I have mentioned that we have already moved from $500 million to $640 million in the space of a few weeks. We would not want to see, and taxpayers would not want to see, a further blow-out.
The questions that we have for the government are these. What are the reporting and accounting requirements arising from this bill or from the scheme more generally? Are they secrets within the bill, or do they simply not exist? We demand that the minister table monthly reports detailing all financial assistance paid, the recipients of that assistance, the costs of administration paid to Insurance Council members involved in administration of the scheme, and an assurance that HCS will be subject to all the usual audit requirements. The Australian taxpayer deserves nothing less, particularly in the light of the erosion of public confidence in the insurance industry that has inevitably followed the HIH debacle and the indecision and ineffective conduct of the government and of its Minister for Financial Services and Regulation—which has fallen woefully short of acceptable standards of accountability and transparency.
As a minimum standard, we want to see regular certifications from this minister that payments made from taxpayer funds are in accordance with the announced guidelines of the scheme. Without this kind of certification, I ask: of what value are the so-called negotiated rights of recovery referred to by the minister for the benefit of the Commonwealth, which now becomes the largest unsecured creditor of HIH? We want to see the government vigilant in monitoring efforts to recover any of the funds to which it is legally entitled. I have frequently made the point that any bailout has to be accompanied by an assignment of legal rights against directors and auditors and the other HIH assets, such as the artwork that they put up for sale in Melbourne overnight—it looked as though there were a few bargains there—and that those legal rights must be pursued to the full.
We urge the government to get on with the job of facilitating the claims of the thousands of victims who have suffered enough already. This package comes too late for one Toowoomba couple, for example, whom I spoke to in the middle of May and who had declared themselves bankrupt. They had a claim against them for which they had become personally liable, even though they had HIH insurance, they could not wait for the government's rescue package to arrive and, on legal advice, they declared themselves bankrupt. They felt very bad about doing so. They told me they had always paid their bills and had always paid their debts on time but they did it because they simply could not wait. 
To facilitate the passage of this bill, we have agreed to reduce our speaking time and, as a result, there are other points that I would like to make. I do encourage people who are having difficulties with the HIH hotline or difficulties in getting their eligibility for assistance determined to contact my office. We are happy to follow up with the government and the company any difficulties people might be having. I understand that people are going through a very stressful time. It is my intention to move an amendment in the consideration in detail stage of the debate, to try to ensure that some of the accountability issues in terms of reporting are properly dealt with. It is our intention to move a more detailed amendment at that stage, and I will speak briefly in support of that amendment at that time.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to support the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 today and also to congratulate the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation in his handling of this very difficult area of administration. For most of us initially, until the word spread about the problems of HIH, the extent of the disaster that emerged was not clear. It is all very interesting for the member for Wills to make his comments about why we did not act immediately, but it is clear that, as the whole event emerged, the government took appropriate action. It was not clear at first, but the minister did act. I commend him for his action. Also, I am sure that the matter of the board itself and its responsibility in the collapse of HIH will come out in the review. There are many Australians who would say that it has much to be accountable for. We look forward to the results of the royal commission as the facts unfold.
This bill in particular is about the consolidated revenue fund providing funds up to $640 million in order to account for the government's HIH assistance scheme. This bill is a major part of the government's response to the collapse of the insurer HIH—a collapse that has affected millions of Australians. The collapse of HIH is an extraordinary situation not only because of its sheer size but also because of the extremely intricate network of companies with numerous policies and customers under a large number of varying conditions. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation announced an excellent, comprehensive and above all compassionate response to this administrative nightmare. I commend him for it. I think that is the key aspect of it: we are all concerned about those who have been directly impacted by it, and this bill goes a long way to provide assistance.
The $640 million is for the financial assistance of those Australians affected. It sets aside $5 million to assist an ASIC investigation of the circumstances surrounding HIH's failure. It also provides fast-tracking reforms that will target the general insurance industry in particular, protecting the interests of all Australians. Legislation in this area is going to be introduced in the parliament before the end of the winter sittings. A broad ranging royal commission into the collapse will ensure that all possible avenues of investigation are followed. We note that respected Western Australian Supreme Court judge Neville Owen has been appointed to head this inquiry, and we look forward to his findings. I note that the member for Wills in his comments said that this is too narrowly based, but it looks pretty wide ranging to me. I am sure, given the general view that the legal fraternity have regarding Justice Owen, that we will see a very comprehensive report and one which includes the whole question of the integrity of the process. I re-emphasise the words of the Prime Minister, who said:
We disabuse any perception however wrongly based that there was anything that the government didn't want examined. We're an open book on this issue ... We want to find out what went wrong. We want to find out who did the wrong. And as far as possible we want those people to deliver restitution to the wronged. 
The package announced by the government establishes a not-for-profit company, HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd, which will administer the distribution of government assistance to those who need it. Four Australian insurers will be involved in the process. To qualify for assistance under the government package, people will have to fulfil the following criteria: that they are Australian citizens or permanent residents, that they are small business proprietors, 50 employees or fewer, and that they are Australian based not-for-profit organisations. Also, the event that gave rise to the claim for insurance must have taken place before 11 June 2001. It will not cover insurance that falls under state government jurisdiction—for example, compulsory third-party insurance, builders warranty and workers compensation. It does not cover overseas creditors. It does not cover any business that is not a small business as defined by the act, and it does not cover claims where the insured was a director or an officer of a company under the HIH umbrella three years before its failure. HIH will pay 100 cents in the dollar for the following claims: salary continuance—and I was particularly touched by one of the people in my electorate who wrote to me saying:
I resigned 12 months ago from my position as manager due to continuing ill health after receiving a kidney transplant. I was fortunate at that time to have a disability policy for salary continuance with HIH Insurance. I last received a payment in February 2001 and have been informed that there is no guarantee if or when I will receive a benefit again. I therefore have no choice but to go to Centrelink next week and apply for a benefit, which is something I never thought I would do. This situation is not only detrimental to my financial situation, as I have a mortgage and children to support. It is also affecting my general wellbeing as I feel that I have been to hell and back several times over the past few years.
It is particularly to people such as this gentleman in my electorate that the assistance is going to provide 100 per cent support, and rightly so. It also provides 100 cents in the dollar for personal injury claims, total loss on primary place of residence claims and claims by not-for-profit organisations. This is appropriate and shows the compassion of the government in this area. Ninety cents in the dollar will be paid to other claims where the family's taxable income is less than $77,234, with this amount increased by $3,139 for each additional child. If the family's income is over this figure, a policyholder will get 90 cents in the dollar if the claim is worth more than 10 per cent of their income.
One issue that does arise from this legislation—and it is good to see the member for Parramatta in the chamber—is an issue that he and I have debated, and that is whether the government should be taking direct responsibility. We do have ASIC and APRA, whose job it was to oversight the activities of corporations within Australian economic parameters. So one would question whether it was appropriate. I think one could say it clearly is appropriate in terms of the size of the collapse, the intricate network of the companies involved and the huge number of Australians who have been impacted detrimentally, like the people in my electorate whose very life savings are threatened, whose home mortgages are threatened and whose children's welfare is threatened. So for those reasons there is a need to interfere, I am sure, and I am somebody who believes very much in a free market economy. For the independent regulators assessing what is required, there is a question of market failure and when there is a need for government to interfere. This does represent a clear case of market failure. That is why we should have a royal commission to investigate the reasons for it and what lessons we can learn from it so that appropriate safeguards are incorporated into future legislation to ensure we do not have a repeat of this collapse.
I commend the minister for bringing this legislation to the House and on the fact that we will be looking after those most in need with direct action. I also believe it is appropriate that we have a royal commission. It will be interesting to see what findings they make. We also have to ensure that in the future we absolutely minimise the likelihood of such a collapse and that the watchdogs, ASIC and APRA, are effective in undertaking reportage and review of corporations so that they take action well before any collapse of such an organisation. It is also important that we look at the role of auditors within our community and at the responsibilities of directors and the transfer of funds between directors and their wives to escape responsibility. These are the answers that the Australian community wants. I believe that this bill goes a long way to solving the immediate problems. In the longer term, we must ensure that the particularly important organisations of ASIC and APRA effectively carry out their role in the future as the watchdogs of Australian economic life. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 in support of the assistance measures to the stranded HIH policyholders, but also to add my concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in this bill and, in fact, in the whole process.
There are so many victims of the HIH collapse it is difficult to know where to start. One of the most poignant examples that has come to my office is the example of Nick and Millie. They are a fabulous couple who live in my electorate. Nick runs his own successful business and Millie has just given birth to their fourth child—she told me her youngest was getting lonely. I am not sure when she is going to stop! They have worked hard towards saving for their bigger, better dream home. Millie and Nick suffered from the collapse of the Avonwood building company. That was the first blow. Now the liquidator has advised that the contract will be cancelled altogether because they were insured with HIH. In his last conversation with me Nick said, `Anna, I just don't get it. I had insurance. Why isn't it being recognised? Aren't these companies licensed? We now have a block of land, a rotting frame, a bank loan and no way out.' Thankfully, Nick and Millie live in Victoria, a state that was the first to help the victims of the HIH collapse, and they will now have their builder's warranty recognised. This is a terrific example of why we need an assistance package across both the federal and state arenas.
This bill will create a public not-for-profit company that will assess and administer insurance claims from HIH policyholders that were incurred prior to 11 June 2001. Whilst this side of the House fully supports this measure, we are concerned about the glaring lack of regulation that has been put into place to ensure that this company does not go down the same path as HIH. The laissez-faire approach to self-regulation which got the government into this mess in the first place is actually being applied to HCS. They are not even going to ensure that this scheme will not blow out by ensuring appropriate reporting and accountability to this place, which after all is funding the bailout. The total lack of guidelines in the legislation leaves us asking: who and how? Can we be assured that bogus claims will not be paid out? How can we ensure genuine claims will be meet? How can people such as Mr Ian Howe of Pakenham—whom I mentioned in this place on 24 May 2001 and who is now liable for a massive legal bill incurred through an HIH suggested settlement—seek compensation? Indeed, is he entitled? Is the company subject to the Corporations Law? Will it provide an annual report? There is nothing in the legislation that talks about these requirements; the legislation is silent and does not allow for any real scrutiny of the activities of HCS.
I share the view of Labor's shadow Treasurer that it is time for the insurance industry to put their hands into their pockets and contribute to the bailing out of this failure. An industry that boasts $10.9 billion in asset reserves surely could have afforded a contribution to the HIH bailout instead of allowing the totality of the collapse to fall on the shoulders of innocent policyholders and taxpayers. I will be interested to hear from the next speaker, the man who told his party room that it is unfair that Australian taxpayers have to foot the bill when private enterprises collapse. The member for Parramatta would do well to ask the minister for finance why he has not responded to the request by the member for Wills on 12 April to hold a roundtable discussion of all the interested parties—industry, regulators and state governments—that could have looked at and produced a suitable bailout package and a more robust regulation regime for HCS. 
There has been a lot of commentary about the appropriateness of taxpayers funding a private sector collapse. I, too, share this concern. Already we have learnt that this package has blown out from $500 million to $640 million in just weeks. We have not actually begun the process of assessing claims yet; not to mention the expense of the ongoing ASIC investigation and the recently announced royal commission. What will be the size of the eventual bill taxpayers are being asked to foot? We can only be left to ponder whether the generous political donations to the Liberal Party from the insurance industry, including a gift of $682,000 from HIH itself, had any bearing on the government's reluctance to make the insurance industry cough up. We will never know that now that the terms of reference of the royal commission have been framed so narrowly to avoid scrutiny of the government's vulnerability in dealing with an industry that has so handsomely lined its coffers. Tony McGrath, the provisional liquidator, in his report of 25 May found that losses could be anywhere between $2.7 billion and $4 billion. Probably the most alarming single comment in the report was this:
The very substantial losses—
from HIH—
are not restricted to the last nine months of operation.
The direct implication from this statement is that HIH was potentially insolvent well before it was placed into voluntary liquidation on 15 March of this year. It is becoming increasingly clear that there are a range of bodies and people that must be made accountable for their advice, action and, in some cases, inaction.
Firstly, APRA: I have been quite vocal in this House on my disappointment with APRA. We were promised a world-class prudential system, yet it appears APRA has performed very poorly in delivering on its charter. No-one is saying that APRA had a crystal ball, but it clearly took its eye off the ball when it came to HIH. The most recent example of this was revealed during a Senate inquiry last week when APRA officials admitted that the Australian Government Actuary stopped producing regular reports on all insurance companies after 1998 to save a mere $60,000! The ridiculous cost cutting measure may well form part of the reason why the risk exposure of HIH was not apparent to APRA in the months leading up to its collapse. Surely a comprehensive actuarial audit would have discovered the unsustainable insurance risks being taken on by HIH. I look forward to the royal commission findings on the regulatory failure of APRA and on of course, by direct implication, the failure of the responsible minister and the government to put in place a regulatory framework that would have brought this to their attention much earlier and may have prevented the damage done. The government may have framed a narrow set of terms of reference, but they cannot hide from the fact that they let the policyholders of Australia down by failing to see this coming. Secondly, it is important that we discover the role of the company's directors, auditors, CEO, employees, actuaries and advisers to HIH. At least this aspect of the collapse appears to have been adequately provided for in the terms of reference.
In the minister's second reading speech on this bill, he said he would fast-track legislation reforms to the general insurance industry. This is way overdue. I am not sure of your definition of `fast-track' but mine does not include a two-year wait for a review of outdated and obviously faulty legislation. Why did we have to have the largest corporate collapse in this country for this government to act on what was indeed a matter of urgency? The Governor of the Reserve Bank, in his appearance before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, probably let part of the reason out of the bag:
When we move to general insurance we really have to come down from that level—
he is talking about coming down from the level of standard of supervision of banks. He said: 
We are dealing with a piece of legislation that is pretty old—it dates back from 1973—and an awful lot of changes have occurred since then. Firstly, the ISC and ... APRA have tried extremely hard to update that legislation and body of regulation, and ... have met with considerable opposition from the industry—a degree of opposition that has surprised me, considering my experience with the banking industry. If there is one ... thing that has come out of HIH, it is that that opposition has now finally retreated and we are going to see some action there pretty soon.
But the most interesting aspect of his reply was:
APRA has already worked out what the regulations should be. They have had all the discussion papers and they have got a new model. They are just waiting for the legislation.
So APRA has been sitting there—it has done it, it is waiting for the legislation, it is waiting for this government to act—so we are now going to `fast-track' something, but we have had to see an enormous collapse and we have had to see innocent people in Australia suffer, and they will be suffering for years to come. So what does this say about this government? I think it says that this government is a captive of the insurance industry and has failed to act. This side of the House welcomes and supports the assistance provided by this legislation to victims of the HIH collapse but continues to have grave concerns about the lack of reporting and accountability outlined in this bill. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—Previous speakers on the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 have noted my sense of ambivalence about this measure, which I do not really resile from. I want to thank both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation for giving me the opportunity to put those concerns on the public record. I do so while acknowledging that I am going to support the measure. I am going to support the measure because the Prime Minister has indicated that the collapse is of such a magnitude that it requires a response of this kind by the government and because the minister has indicated that this bill will not form a precedent for bills of a similar character in the future.
In 1996, Peter Bernstein published a book titled Against the Gods: the Remarkable Story of Risk. In that book he advances the thesis that:
The revolutionary idea that defines the boundary between modern times and the past is the mastery of risk: the notion that the future is more than a whim of the gods and that men and women are not passive before nature. Until human beings found a way across that boundary, the future was a mirror of the past or the murky domain of oracles and soothsayers who held a monopoly over knowledge of anticipated events.
The Remarkable Story of Risk is the story of empowering the citizen, and my thesis today is that in the long run there is a direct correlation between the extent of risks that individuals are prepared to bear and the extent of their liberty as citizens. 
The collapse of HIH has been described by some, including my colleague the member for Cook, for whom I have a great respect, as market failure. In fact, I would advance the heretical proposition that it represents market success. I do so because it is essential that we have a mechanism to shake out the inefficient and perhaps the fraudulent from the efficient, the competitive and the productive.
There is a feeling around the chamber of astonishment that HIH was insolvent: `We've had a corporate collapse—throw our hands up in the air at this stunning revelation.' The opportunity to enter a market, to succeed, to attempt, to risk must always be accompanied by the reality that not all ventures will succeed. In The Remarkable Story of Risk, we have a number of great chapters. The first, I would say, is the beginning of the concept of limited liability. Limited liability is an inherently democratic doctrine. It aims to place capital at the disposal of the widest possible group in any community. It means that many people of modest means are able to participate in the economy as business owners. If strict liability were the only option available, then we could engage in trade only up to the value of our personal assets. The result would be that only the rich could begin enterprises that require large amounts of capital. In this sense, limited liability provides a leg-up for the workers and the middle class, a bulwark of economic and social mobility against the entrenched power of inherited wealth. 
But it is understood at the outset that some companies will fail and that creditors, shareholders and employees may suffer hardship as a result. Balanced against that sober understanding are benefits to the community as a whole that far exceed the costs. Those benefits come from a greater willingness of individuals to bear commercial risk. The result is a diverse and vibrant economy capable of producing a vast array of goods and services which together satisfy the aspirations and desires of the community. Every purchase at the corner store is a little triumph of collaboration in the management of risk and reward—a voluntary, mutual exchange of value. But whenever I engage in a transaction with a limited liability company, such as HIH or any other, whether as a purchaser, a supplier, a shareholder or a creditor, I understand that there is a risk involved. In fact, my sharing of the owner's risk is what makes the transaction possible in the first place.
As a policy matter, liberal democratic governments rightly take the view that the overwhelming bulk of commercial risk should remain in the private sphere in which the citizen is master of his own destiny. Caveat emptor is one expression of that policy: let the buyer beware. While it involves obligations on the citizen, it is also a safeguard of his or her freedom. It rewards diligence and does not intervene to protect the negligent. This is essential to building a wider prosperity. It ensures that the industrious, the thrifty and the ambitious will not be unfairly weighed down by the choices of the slothful, the extravagant or the faint-hearted. 
Thoughtful governments recognise that every time they intervene in an immediate, visible way in markets their actions have lasting, less visible consequences. While the immediate benefits of intervention are obvious—the capacity to alleviate hardship—the longer term costs are harder to measure. Former New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner once observed that the one thing worse than a recession is a recession you do not learn from. The same might be said of business failure. As a nation, we need to learn the lessons of HIH, One.Tel and Impulse. There are lessons for directors, proprietors, shareholders, auditors, creditors and customers. Failures of this magnitude should create a greater pressure in the marketplace for disclosure of current financial information. The experience should be valuable to entrepreneurs deciding where to draw the line between cash flow and market share. One.Tel and HIH should create a more acute awareness among directors of their fiduciary obligations. They should fuel a greater appetite for research and due diligence among investors and shareholders.
The risk of government intervention is that the power of failure to teach hard lessons will be diminished. The moral hazard is that bailing out one failure will make future failure more likely. It is hard to communicate that thought and sound compassionate in a press release or even a speech such as this. We also ought to count, in addition to the dollars that we are spending, the unseen opportunity cost of the wealth transfer from the general taxpayer to HIH policyholders. What would our 850,000 small businesses have done with that $660 million? What would Australian inventors, struggling to attract venture capital, have done with that $660 million? What new industries might have been created, what breakthroughs in medical research might have been achieved? Are there viable enterprises on the margins that may be pushed over the edge of solvency by the additional small incremental cost, the last-straw effect, that this $660 million impost represents?
I will be, as I said, supporting this bill. Certainly, like every other Australian, I feel the impact of the hardship suffered by those who contracted for a risk management service, the insolvency of which, in the case of HIH, means they will not receive anything but for this bailout. I simply want the government and the parliament to reflect on not just the immediate but also the long term. I want to conclude with Bernstein's reflection that there is a close relationship between our individual willingness to bear risk and the scope of our freedom as citizens. This is also reflected in a quote from Australia's longest serving Prime Minister:  
We believe, as we always have, that the only freedom is a brave acceptance of unclouded individual responsibility.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—It is with some degree of sadness that I enter the debate on the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 today, sadness because of the difficulties that have been inflicted on the lives of my constituents, like those of so many others in this place, because of the collapse of HIH, sadness because it has meant that the government has had to come to the rescue belatedly—having been dragged there kicking and screaming, when originally Minister Joe Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, seemed to indicate to the public at large, and certainly in this place, that the Commonwealth government had no responsibility— and sadness because there are some people who, whilst talking about risk, caveat emptor and so on, might indeed be suggesting that people in government should not have a responsibility, particularly when you establish what the Treasurer described as `world's best practice supervisors' through APRA and suddenly we find a major corporate collapse like HIH leaving so many of my constituents devastated.
It is indeed sad for those reasons that we are debating the provision of $640 million from the Commonwealth government to match those moneys that have already been pledged and certainly allocated through recent budgets by our state colleagues. It was state premiers like Peter Beattie and Bob Carr that immediately saw the problems that were being caused to their state constituents, our national constituents, because of the collapse of HIH. They came in immediately and made announcements about what they saw as their responsibilities and, as I say, belatedly it was this Commonwealth government that came to the party with the pledge of the money that we are debating today.
It concerns me that the breadth to which this collapse has affected the lives of ordinary Australians is still not fully realised. I do not think people understand the way in which people's lives have been impacted upon because of some of the difficulties occasioned now by the collapse. Let me give you some illustrations from my own electorate as to why this might be the case. A close mate of mine who is a physiotherapist and runs a physiotherapy and sports injuries clinic wrote to me and said a claim had been made against him, the only claim made against him in 24 years of practice. He said that the claim was approaching its final stages and that if the claim went against him in court the maximum amount able to be claimed by the plaintiff was $140,000 plus legal costs of approximately $80,000, which is going to send him bankrupt. He has got a mortgage, he has got a family to raise, but he was covered by HIH. On his behalf we wrote to the government, and we got the standard response back from the Treasury. Under `HIH insurance concern' it runs through `I acknowledge receipt of the Hon. Member's letter' and says:
The letter has been passed to HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd (HCSL), a company established by the Insurance Council of Australia to process the Commonwealth Government's $640 million relief package for policyholders suffering financial hardship as a result of the HIH collapse.
Enclosed is a copy of the Minister's press release of 21 May 2001, outlining the criteria for HIH hardship relief.
That was a blessed relief for my constituent, to get a copy of the minister's press release! It says that HCSL has established a toll-free telephone hotline number and the number is listed, and the web site is there and the address is given for that. It continues:
I expect that HCSL will be in touch with—
my constituent—
... shortly to obtain details of his arrangements with HIH and to assess this claim for assistance.
That is well and good, and that is the standard response that comes to all of the representations I am making, but it does not go to alleviating the problems for organisations like the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre. The Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre has operated in Wollongong for a long time. It has taken on more responsibility simply because this government, the Howard government, chose to shut down the immigration office in Wollongong and, as a consequence, it acts as a de facto immigration office in my constituency—just as, I might say, my electorate office does from time to time. 
The Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre indicated—and as I wrote to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who has just come in, on this issue back on 22 May— that it is funded almost entirely by government, it has no spare funds to cover a possible damages payout and it has been advised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that it cannot seek further financial assistance from the department to cover the costs associated with indemnity insurance. In fact, DIMA actually suggested that the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre put pressure on the new insurance company to cover any possible payout or to approach the Department of Fair Trading for assistance in their action. The Department of Fair Trading advised that neither the centre nor Fair Trading could compel the new insurer to take on this responsibility. The only funds that the centre has set aside are tied to employee entitlements, and legal advice is that these cannot be accessed to cover a possible damages claim.
So in this circular fashion, where we have got something like a migrant resources centre operating in Wollongong affected by the HIH collapse on personal liability insurance, they have been told by their funding organisation—another government department, at the national level—that they should go somewhere else and seek assistance, and they have been told that that is just not available. The Migrant Resource Centre are fortunately getting some pro bono legal advice, which is great, to fight the claim against them, but should they lose that case and be unable to obtain financial assistance from either DIMA or the government through this assistance package then there is going to be certain closure of the Migrant Resource Centre in Wollongong.
—I can't see why—
—Minister, genuinely, this is an organisation that does a sensational job— not for profit—but it is saying that if it does not get that it will have to shut down.
—I am encouraged by the minister saying these things to me—and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the leniency you are giving us in this, because it is an important issue. Joe, these people do a terrific job in Wollongong, as you would know. As most migrant resource centres do, they provide non-English-speaking recently arrived migrants and so on with tremendous opportunities. So I hope that the new organisation, the new insurance arrangement, is going to benefit them.
Others, however, may not be so lucky, particularly those who have been affected by indemnity for builders licensing and so on. I have got two cases there. One of my constituents who lives in Mangerton—I will not use the names of these people, because I do not think it is appropriate now—said that in February 2000 he engaged Leisure Coast Steel homes to construct a new home for him at Cordeaux Heights. It was not long into the construction when concerns were raised about the quality of the workmanship. A building engineer looked at it and found defects. Unfortunately, the builder went into administration in November 2000 and liquidation in January 2001. HIH Insurance, which carried the home owners warranty insurance cover, advised that the cost to rectify the defects and so on would be over $180,000. My constituent did not recover one cent from the liquidation process that was associated with Leisure Coast Steel homes and, as a consequence, he is now faced with this dreadful situation as to whether or not he will receive any recompense out of the new system that has been established for this federal rescue package occasioned by the collapse of HIH. 
What is suggested in a letter to me, which I have forwarded to the ministers concerned, is that my constituent would like to see the federal government provide the completion funds required in the short term and recover what is available from the liquidator at the appropriate time. He would like to see a waiver for the GST on those homes that should have been completed pre-GST, as this has added substantially to their problems. That is a genuine concern. We all accept that there was a time, a start-up date, when the GST would apply to the construction of new homes—that was 1 July last year—and that after then the GST would apply. The construction of this individual's home started before that date and it collapsed because of faulty workmanship subsequent to the company that was building it also going into liquidation and being wound up. He is left with nowhere to go. Finally, he is asking that the government, via its regulator or the appropriate body, contact the liquidator and immediately quantify the insurance arrangements and reinsurance arrangements that are applicable. I think these are important points that a constituent has raised with me.
Two more of my constituents, who live in Figtree, wrote to me about the HIH insurance group and the home owners warranty scheme. They are in a situation where their house is virtually worth nothing because of a problem with another company in Wollongong which went into liquidation and left them with a huge debt. As a consequence, they wrote a letter to me. I think these are valid concerns. Minister, you have heard comments being made certainly by people on this side and by other people about APRA. The following are not my words but those of two constituents that have been affected by this whole fiasco:
The Federal Government watch-dog, A.P.R.A., is a huge organization with a huge responsibility to all policy holders Australia wide. We are the victims of the regulators apparent failing to regulate a failing obligitory Insurance scheme.
The fact that H.I.H. took 5 months to process our claim has put a very suspicious cloud over A.P.R.A.
...			...				...
Why do we the ordinary battlers have to bear the brunt of beaurocratic bunglers who can't run a multi-million dollar industry if their mortgages depended on it!
This is a cry from the heart of two of my constituents, who live in Figtree, that got the same response back from the government when I wrote to the government about their particular concerns. Again, the words that I have just quoted were not mine; these are the words of ordinary Australians living in Wollongong who have seen the dreams associated with the construction of their new home go down the toilet because of the collapse here. They are rightly saying, `This is a government that has said that it has created a world's best practice supervisory regime, and look what happens!'
I am disappointed that there is a time limit on this debate, because there is a lot more I want to say about this on behalf of my constituents—just like we all did. I know that the honourable member opposite, the member for McEwen, is waiting to get her turn, and I am sure that she is going to talk about people in her electorate that have been affected as well. Something like this should not be allowed to happen. Governments take responsibilities for putting in place supervisory regimes that are supposed to protect ordinary Australians from collapses like this, and too much of it is happening. When they pick up a newspaper like today's, those ordinary Australians that have been affected see where the major investors seem to have been given advice over a period of time as to how long things were going crook—
—That's One.Tel.
—As the minister said, they are talking about One.Tel, but I use this example in a more generic sense. Those investors and those people out there see a major corporation—whether it be HIH, One.Tel or whatever—where people have been given advice for a long period of time about things going wrong, but when they say, `If there is this supervisory regime in place, why can't something be done by a government to protect them?' they are left shaking their heads, just as we are. I commend to the House the amendment that will be moved by the opposition. I only hope that those people, like my constituents, are going to get some justice from the way in which the government has responded with this $640 million rescue package. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—The Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 will provide for the federal government to fund a scheme to assist people who have experienced hardship as a result of the HIH collapse. The bill will also provide for the formation of a non-profit company, HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd, to process the claims of those HIH policyholders suffering hardship as a result of HIH being unable to honour its commitments.
In particular, the government has identified HIH salary continuance policyholders as deserving the quickest assistance possible. It will pay to Australian citizens and permanent residents who previously received benefits from HIH under salary continuance policies 100 per cent of the amount that HIH would have been obliged to pay under the policy. People with salary continuance policies have already received cheques, including people in my electorate. They have requested that I express their relief at receiving this payment. In some instances, payments received have been for as far back as three months salary continuance. Understandably, prior to the government taking action, the non-payment of these salary continuance policies by HIH was causing considerable strain and concern among many people whom I represent. The restoration of these benefits means that people can start to get on with their lives without worrying about whether or not they are going to receive their salary and be able to meet mortgage payments and day-to-day living expenses.
Importantly, the government is assisting those people who are most in need—people who were facing ruin by the HIH disaster. The government is fulfilling what I believe to be its humane obligation to ensure that those most in need do not fall through the net and suffer hardship. As the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has said, this is a very generous and very compassionate package. This package is not about setting a precedent for the rescue of corporate financial services collapses; rather it is quite rightly dealing with and responding to exceptional circumstances. Government should not stand idly by when people, through no fault of their own, suffer hardship that adversely impacts on their ability to support themselves.
The upgrading of the government's assistance package to $640 million will help about 30,000 of the hardest hit policyholders. The package will also cover small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, who will be eligible to receive 90 per cent of the value of their claims. The government will also meet the full cost of personal injury policies.
The collapse of HIH Insurance has had a far reaching impact across Australia, causing hardship for many Australians, including HIH policyholders, shareholders and those people who, through no fault of their own, have been inextricably caught up in this corporate disaster. The HIH collapse raises many serious questions about corporate responsibility, in particular the responsibility of company directors and the moral, social and economic obligations that they have to their shareholders and consumers. According to the HIH 2000 annual report, the company had gross premium revenue of $2.8 billion, total assets of $8 billion, total liabilities of $7.1 billion and net assets of $900 million. Yet, despite this balance sheet, HIH was placed into liquidation only months later, with losses of $800 million. The provisional liquidator warned that it could take up to 10 years before some creditors were paid.
The HIH collapse has led to ASIC launching its biggest ever investigation. In the 2001-02 federal budget, ASIC was provided with additional funding of $5 million over two years to assist with its investigation of HIH. Many people are now asking how this happened. How could a company that purported—on paper at least—to have a healthy balance sheet just a few months later be placed into liquidation? Shareholders and policyholders could quite rightly ask, `What were the company directors and APRA doing?' There appears to have been little in the way of corporate responsibility, because HIH was insolvent with a shortfall of up to $4 billion when it collapsed in March. A year before the collapse, HIH's actuarial adviser had warned HIH management that its accounting practices could have `disastrous consequences'. According to the provisional liquidator, the financial position of each of the three main licence holding companies within the HIH group was worse than the stated balance sheet position by a very significant margin in each case. 
ASIC expanded its investigation in early May to include looking at whether HIH was solvent as early as July 1998, which was months before HIH bought the FAI Insurance Group for $300 million. APRA gave the green light to HIH to buy FAI in early 1999, because it believed the takeover did not harm HIH's financial position. Indeed, the Australian Stock Exchange revealed that its concerns about HIH went back to September 1998 when, before its takeover of FAI Insurance, HIH conducted an on-market purchase of the 14 per cent stake in FAI owned by then FAI managing director, Mr Rodney Adler. The Australian Stock Exchange referred the matter to ASIC, which took no action.
Reports in the media have suggested that APRA did not make full use of its regulatory powers prior to the collapse of HIH. APRA's role is to monitor insurance companies under the Insurance Act. In the case of HIH, it is unclear whether APRA made full use of its regulatory powers prior to the collapse of HIH. However, the Insurance Act does not prevent company failure. APRA may appoint an inspector to examine the company's affairs where it is considered to be in the public interest. APRA has no power to ensure that all policyholders have their claims met in the event of insolvency. It may be that APRA's regulatory powers need to be strengthened.
Company directors and management must not be allowed to use public companies as their personal cash cows. In our modern capitalist society, it is certainly important that people be rewarded for their efforts, and I do not believe that anyone in this place would deny that. However, there has to be accountability to the shareholders and consumers. There must be in place at all times sufficient checks and balances to ensure that public companies are run prudently and are at all times solvent. It is becoming increasingly clear in the case of HIH that company directors and management were not diligent or accountable in carrying out their duties. Many Australians, and I am certainly one, find it absolutely abhorrent that executive company directors could and did continue to receive large bonuses even when their company was struggling financially and they were clearly not performing to a level that justified the level of such bonuses.
I am not suggesting that the answer to this is to impose draconian regulations on the operation of public companies and their directors, but I do strongly believe that regulations do need to be tightened and strenuously enforced, that there must be the highest prudential standards of responsibility for company directors and that these company directors must be held accountable for their decisions. These responsibilities must not only take into account the economic consequences of their decision making and actions but also acknowledge both the moral and social consequences of their decisions. At the end of the day, the decisions that these people make can have a profound influence on the livelihoods of innocent third parties. The effects of the HIH collapse have been devastating for individuals, families and small businesses, many from the areas that I represent.
The government's decision to hold a royal commission is a significant step in the right direction. The federal government is committed to getting to the bottom of the HIH collapse and will cooperate fully with the royal commission. I hope the state governments will also give their unequivocal backing to the royal commission. In the case of HIH, I believe that government does have an obligation to act and implement this assistance package to ensure that HIH policyholders are not simply left as victims of such a disgraced company that abrogated its responsibilities to its policyholders. I commend this bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"— There is absolutely no doubt that the news of the collapse of HIH back in March reflected little, if anything, of the absolute reality of what was about to happen to many people. To hear of the collapse of a corporation of this size is pretty significant, but I think it is fair to say that probably nobody in this House would at that point in time have totally understood what was really going to happen to so many people. The enormity of the effect of this collapse on our economy and on our community is still not being felt in full reality, in my view. There are still ramifications occurring and there will be for some time. I think the words of the previous speaker, the member for McEwen, have restated and reinforced very strongly for me the call from this side of the House so early on for a royal commission. There was absolutely no doubt in our minds that, as the picture became clearer and the reality became easier to read, there was going to be a desperate need to have a full and absolutely high-level judicial inquiry in the form of a royal commission. I am particularly pleased to see that that has finally been agreed to by the government.
The human side of this is another aspect that previous speakers have spoken about. I believe it to be true that there is not one member in this place that has not received representations from somebody or some group of people within their constituencies in relation to the effect on their lives of this collapse. In our work as local federal members within our electorates, we always have the experience of people needing help coming through our doors with pretty heart-rending stories of one sort or another. I have to say, however, that one particular case which came to my attention really rocked me because of the effect it was having on this particular family. At this point, I have to acknowledge quite happily that in desperation one day, with no way of knowing how to best advise these people—because there was a certain urgency and expediency facing them—I rang the minister's office. I think it happened to be the morning that the first announcement was about to be made in relation to the rescue package. I rang the minister's office in desperation and said to his staff, `Look, I know that you haven't even announced this yet but I know it's coming, and I really need to know whether these folk are going to fall into the ambit of the rescue package.' Whilst I could not get detailed information, I am not critical of that because it was very early in the piece, and I have to thank the minister's staff for getting back to me as promptly as they did that day. But the reality is still there.
This particular case is about a small business person within my electorate who had a limited liability insurance policy with HIH and there had been a claim made as a result of an accident back in 1996. We could go into the details of why on earth it had taken from 1996 until the 2001 to finally have that case come before the court, but I do not wish to here. The problem facing this gentleman and his wife—and they are literally just independent small business people—was that they were facing a court hearing within something like 10 days of when they came to see me. At the time of the collapse there was a disputed case going on, and HIH held their insurance. They were contesting the case to some point, and within 10 days of seeing me they had to front up to court. Simply because of the collapse, the complainant on the other side of this instance—who equally had a case to be heard as well, I have to say—on legal advice was now pursuing through the courts a civil claim on this family business of in excess of $1 million. The stress and the trauma that that couple was going through I do not think I could describe if I tried. Suffice to say that when I realised that the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 was coming on this morning, I rang that family in the last 24 hours to see where they are up to now. Thank heavens, through their legal representation they have been able to get the case delayed until October. While that helps them, it does not help the person on the other side of this instance, who is equally deserving of a court hearing due to an accident. It is all very uncomfortable. 
The problem that I think I have with this whole situation is the fact that the collapse should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. We have to go back to the beginning of this. We have to ask: how on earth could a company issuing financial statements, as this one was, get to the point where nobody, it seems—the regulators, the government authorities involved—knew about it? Or did they knowingly not act on what information they may have had? I am not saying that they knew or did not know. There has been a lot written about it and a lot has been commentated about it. All I know is that, if they knew, they should have done something and, if they did not know, they should have known. That is what the regulatory authorities are there for and that is what the government is there for in terms of putting those things into place. I find it quite extraordinary and mind numbing to think that a corporation of this size, with its tentacles going out through so many ancillary and connected companies to so many people in our community, can get away with this. It is just abhorrent.
Another family who were building their dream home came into my office, after emails, phone calls and faxes. There are hundred and hundreds—thousands—of such families around the country. To read about them in the paper is one thing but to be confronted with the human side of it is another. This family's home was being built by a builder here in Canberra who unfortunately went broke. Within days, or hours, of getting the next step taken for coverage, HIH collapsed and they had no home. They had nowhere to live, and their financial situation has been affected dramatically. They are now at the point where their house has begun to be constructed again—it is back on track— but they have had to go to their financial institution and make new arrangements. The total life of their mortgage has been put back by another 10 to 12 years at least. Through no fault of their own, their whole financial situation right now is nowhere near what it was just a few short months ago. We could all stand up, as other members have done and as I am doing, and endlessly quote at the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation and the government all these personal cases. We have to do that because we have to bring that human side into the examination of the outcome of a collapse such as this. 
The legislative changes to the general insurance industry to improve capital adequacy and so on, announced by the minister back in November, are welcome. We are now seeing the legislation fast-tracked. But I have to be critical: it should not have to be fast-tracked; it should have been done. This government has been in place in excess of five years. If there was a need to do this, it should have been done. If it had been done, would it in fact have saved all this? I do not know—possibly, possibly not. But it is being fast-tracked, and we have to draw the conclusion that there is some reason to do that in connection with all of this and the emotion and the reality around the collapse.
I support the amendments that we will put forward. I deplore absolutely, in the strongest of terms, the actions of the people running HIH and the associated companies. I have to ask: how good was the auditor? I have to ask: how good was the regulatory authority? It is like saying that in front of you on the horizon are many things, but one, two or three of them are pretty big. So do we ignore them and look only at the small ones? How is it that this can happen to something so large, so prominent, so effective within our community? Everybody is standing back and saying,' Well, it's happened; isn't this terrible?' But, until the royal commission does its job, we are never really going to know how and why. The minister said before to one of the previous speakers that information in the papers today is relative to only One.Tel. That is true, but why are we saying that it applies to only One.Tel. It is happening to other corporations as well. The bonus payments and the salary levels are obscene, particularly when you see this sort of outcome.
So I can only implore the government to continue to act in relation to the royal commission. I welcome that. I welcome the fast-tracking of the legislation—I wish it did not have to be fast-tracked—and I of course welcome this bill. I support our amendments to it and I hope that, at the end of the day, the $640 million is going to be enough. I am not critical of that figure. I hope it will be enough and I hope, very sincerely, that folk out there—small businesses or otherwise— are not allowed to end up falling through some crack or other but that, if it happens, there are mechanisms in place to catch them as quickly as possible, because this hurt and this human impact simply must stop. It is our job in this place to stand up and speak on behalf of those people and make sure that everybody realises that they are in fact the reason we are here.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2001-06-21,"—The Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 goes to the heart of the role of government. The question is: is government merely an economic manager or does government have a national leadership role? There are those who say that no government can make up the losses of every individual or business. That is certainly true— and nor should any government make up the losses. However, in this particular case—and I am sure there will be others—there were overriding considerations. The first was the size of the collapse and the number of affected policyholders—the knock-on effect to the rest of the economy and other businesses. The second question that arose was the question of personal responsibility, and many members of parliament have commented on that. But policyholders in HIH had taken personal responsibility. They had taken out an insurance policy in good faith and they believed it was a prudent move. It turned out not to be, but that was not their fault.
First of all, I commend the Prime Minister. In my electorate, the overwhelming message that I received was that other policyholders did not want to have a levy on all insurance. The Prime Minister's decision was that those who chose to insure with other firms—as it transpired, a wise decision—should not have to pay for the HIH failure. I am pleased to see that the government did not impose a levy but instead chose a package of $640 million to assist policyholders. This, I think, was a test for the government, and I believe that they have passed it very soundly. I am pleased that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation is at the table. I watched the strident criticism that he received when this first occurred— the clamour for action and inquiries—and I think that the minister's calm concern for policyholders is to be commended. He was not at any time distracted from focusing on those who were suffering the most, and I think that was a very commendable approach while under a great deal of duress. I think this has certainly been handled in a compassionate and sound manner by the minister and the Prime Minister.
I would like to talk very briefly, for the record, of the initiatives that have been taken by the government. The not-for-profit company HIH Claims Support Pty Ltd will provide claims management and payment services. The government will, for policyholders, pay 100 cents in the dollar for people with salary continuance policies, personal injury claims where the insured is an Australian citizen, permanent resident or small business, claims for a total loss on a primary place of residence—again, where it is an Australian citizen or permanent resident—and claims where the insured is an Australian not-for-profit organisation.
The government will also support policyholders to the tune of 90 cents in the dollar for other claims where the insured is subject to an income test—where family taxable income is less than $77,234, regardless of the size of the claim; where family taxable income is more than that amount, increased by $3,139 for each additional child if the claim is more than 10 per cent of family taxable income. The government will also ensure that policyholders receive 90 cents in the dollar where the insured is an Australian small business that has 50 or fewer employees. I note as well that the government is going to instigate a royal commission. I will not read out all the terms of reference; I think they are thorough and I have no doubt that, if there has been wrongdoing, this royal commission will ensure that those responsible are brought to book. I believe, as I have said, that the government acted wisely and showed national leadership.  
I would like to talk about two of the cases that give a human face to what could have been a national tragedy and is certainly causing hurt across the nation. One of those was the most famous tourist attraction on the Darling Downs, the Jondaryan Woolshed, which is fighting a wind-up application in the Supreme Court in Brisbane. A visitor to the shed had filed a personal injury claim for $220,000. This is a non-profit organisation. It was insured with HIH. It is very important to the Jondaryan community. I cannot comment on its success or otherwise with the subsequent actions that it has taken. The other case concerns a typical couple, a Toowoomba couple, Peter and Joanne Jackson, with three children, whose story was in the Courier-Mail. They face financial ruin. The tenant of their Gympie house was successful in a $250,000 claim against them when she allegedly fell down the stairs. Mr Jackson said:
We have very little equity in the house. We are a single income family and Joanne is a stay at home mother. We will be bankrupt. That will be the only way for us to go.
Undoubtedly these very sad cases will be addressed to some extent, if not fully, under the government's package of measures. I am delighted to see that Australians such as the Jacksons, non-profit organisations and small businesses right across the country will remain viable and will be able to continue their businesses and family arrangements thanks to a government that showed national leadership.
In the time I have left to me, I would like very briefly to talk a little more about the tale of two governments. Both governments covered HIH costs for policyholders—the federal government, as we said, with a package of some $640 million for policyholders, the Queensland government with $230 million for third-party insurance payouts. The federal coalition was able to achieve this without running the budget into deficit. In fact, as the Treasurer has announced, there is a surplus of some $1.5 billion. Not so for Queensland. There is a deficit of $820 million. Yesterday's Courier-Mail said:
Budget papers reveal the Government—
this is the Beattie Queensland government—
has a Budget deficit of $820 million with the collapse of insurance giant HIH and lower-than-expected investment return ...
What is the outcome for employment for these two governments? Unemployment nationally, as a result of the federal coalition's initiatives, is seven per cent—historically low. It compares with that of the previous government's high of some 11 per cent. Since we have taken government, we have created 820,000 jobs. Unfortunately, Queensland is a sorry tale. There is nine per cent unemployment, the highest in the nation. The Courier-Mail said yesterday:
The Beattie Government's unemployment target of 5 per cent by mid-2003 is dead and buried ...
On the front page yesterday, there was an article headed `Beattie faces awful truth on jobs, jobs, jobs.' It said:
Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Premier Peter Beattie said it, so where are they?
I think every Queenslander would be asking that. Where are they? I quote again from the Courier-Mail:
Yesterday's State Budget highlighted the awful truth facing Beattie—he cannot achieve his target to cut the jobless rate to 5 per cent by 2003.
Yet a sound government federally has been able to achieve a budget surplus and to cut unemployment down to seven per cent. What else have we done? In the last budget we cut taxes by $5 billion—taxes for business, taxes for families—yet in Queensland, as we learn from the papers, taxes per capita are growing. What else has the coalition government been able to do? We have been able to reinvest in the nation across a range of services to benefit rural and regional Australia and those living in our urban centres. In Queensland, as the Courier-Mail tells us, capital works will fall in real terms. 
What is the difference between these two governments, both faced with generally the same challenges and certainly with the same payouts in comparative terms for the HIH collapse? The difference is that one is a sound coalition government and the other is a Labor government. I would like to suggest to my constituents in Queensland that before the next federal election they should think very carefully about how a promise made by the state Labor government of `jobs, jobs, jobs' has turned out to be dust. In fact, Queensland unenviably has the highest unemployment rate in Australia, a deficit and hard times for Queenslanders. There is no doubt that the promises of Labor governments are not kept. We know already from the Conroy confession—the confession by the Labor senator Senator Conroy—that taxes will rise as a result of Beazley and the Labor government taking office and that services will be cut. We have seen what has happened in Queensland. I commend the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation and the Prime Minister on this very sound bill that takes account of policyholders across Australia who have suffered as a result of the HIH collapse. I have great pride in supporting such a sound bill. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—in reply—I appreciate the contributions made to this debate on the Appropriation (HIH Assistance) Bill 2001 by members, and a number of members in particular. I would like to correct a number of issues that the member for Wills raised and answer others. I note that in the budget we provided more than $500 million for the HIH package. At no stage did we say it would be $500 million. Once we had received the information, just a few days after the budget, it confirmed our earlier expectations that the figure would be $640 million. We have received no information from the provisional liquidator that would indicate that the figure would be greater than $640 million. 
In addition, the liquidator is realising assets of the company—albeit not too substantial, I understand. But, if there are any coffee cups left in the company, I am sure the provisional liquidator will sell them. We would expect that there will be payments back to the creditors within two years. As further information is provided, some direct reinsurance may come to fruition. That direct reinsurance and indirect pooled reinsurance may also provide some respite for the government, through payments, in its position as the largest unsecured creditor to the company. Therefore, we have taken what I believe to be a very generous outlook in terms of the figure being as large as we can put our finger on at the moment to cover the cost. We would not be able to do this if we did not run a substantial budget surplus. Australians can be thankful that we did not have to resort to what the Victorian government, the New South Wales government and the Western Australian government are doing—and that is imposing a levy on everyone to pay for their bailout packages. We did not have to do that because we are good financial managers and we are running substantial budget surpluses. Out of that surplus we had the capacity to help Australians who have been most disadvantaged. Let me make it perfectly clear—and I will say a little bit about this later—that that is whom we are focusing on, people who are most disadvantaged. 
The member for Wills and the member for Canberra suggested that somehow the Labor Party was out of the blocks on 15 March, when the company went into provisional liquidation, and that they were there at the cutting edge calling for a royal commission. There are some statements that need to be corrected. I quote the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, who said on 2BL on 14 May, nearly two months after the collapse of HIH: 
Well it may be that we have to have some judicial inquiry. I don't think you can make that call at this stage until we see the full extent of the problem from the provisional liquidator. 
That was 14 May, and the opposition was dampening down expectations of any judicial inquiry. Two days later Kim Beazley came out and said, `Labor promises to hold a royal commission if we get into power'—a political stunt only two days later, and at a time when we had not ruled out a royal commission. In fact, we obviously had all the resources of ASIC involved in investigations into the company, both before the collapse and after the collapse. That is a very important point to note: ASIC is investigating events that occurred before the collapse and after the collapse.  
The rescue package is for people severely affected by the collapse. It has never been done before. We have never had a general insurance company of this scale collapse in Australia. We have never had a company of this scale collapse in Australia. In fact, even at this stage the company is not in liquidation; it is still in provisional liquidation. The fundamental difference between HIH and One.Tel is that One.Tel never made an audited full year profit. HIH never made an audited full year loss. That is why everyone was caught by surprise. Because HIH had never made an audited full year loss people were stunned when the company went into provisional liquidation, only a few months after reporting that it had made an audited profit and that it had nearly $1,000 million of net assets. 
With the benefit of hindsight, everyone says that there was this document saying it was in trouble and there was that document saying it was in trouble. But there were directors attesting that it was solvent, there were auditors attesting that it was solvent, there were market analysts attesting that it was solvent, there were reinsurers attesting that it was solvent, there were state and federal regulators attesting that it was solvent. The stock market was attesting that it was solvent. There were a range of other people involved, including the officers of the company, who were attesting that it was solvent. Yet it has come out with potentially a $4,000 million deficit. That is why we had to have the royal commission. There has been such a gross turnaround in a matter of months, without any explanation, that we need to get to the bottom of it. That is why we are having a royal commission. I am glad to see that the public, the commentators—and the opposition, I think—appreciate that the royal commissioner who has been nominated is a very independent person, a well-respected judge from Western Australia who is obviously going to be very focused on getting to the bottom of the matter. As well, we have ASIC's very extensive investigation. 
In relation to the other matters raised by the member for Wills, who says that 50 is not enough people for a criterion for small business, I understand that it covers 97 per cent of businesses in Australia: 97 per cent have 50 employees or fewer. From that perspective, we had to draw a line somewhere. It is actually meant to be a hardship package and, given that it covers an enormous number of businesses in Australia, I think that the criterion of 50 employees makes for a very generous support package, at 100 cents in the dollar. The member for Wills also says that the industry has not contributed. I say from the outset that the industry is contributing. It is contributing because the New South Wales government is imposing a $69 million per year levy that is to be paid by the industry. But that is going to be paid for by all Australians, not just by New South Wales. If there is any suggestion that Allianz is not going to pass on the New South Wales government levy to its clients in Queensland, you would have to be joking. Every Australian is going to pay for the New South Wales government levy.
—Why didn't we have a national solution, then?
—The member for Wills asks why we do not have a national solution, and it is because Queenslanders already guarantee their builder's warranty. So why should Queenslanders have to pay for the failings of the New South Wales government? Why should Queenslanders have to pay for the failings of the Victorian government? Why should Western Australians have to pay for the failings of the New South Wales government, when New South Wales did not properly supervise and stand behind its own insurance schemes? New South Wales tried to run away and socialise its losses right across Australia. That is why the New South Wales government should have paid for its own insurance failure. The New South Wales government mandates builders warranty insurance in that state. It sold its Builders Services Corporation, took the money out of it and was left with three insurers for building in New South Wales: Dexter, Royal and Sun Alliance, and HIH. I am sure that the royal commission will find out why HIH stayed in that business. It will be very interesting to find out just what the state government said to HIH that they had to stay in that line of business in relation to builders warranty. That is one of the reasons the terms of reference of the royal commission are very broad. 
The member for Wills also raised issues in relation to accountability, and I think we will be dealing with those in a minute and so I will not cover them at the moment. However, I say to the member for Cook that I appreciated his contribution. I also thank the member for Chisholm for her contribution. She mentioned Nick and Millie from her electorate. I would say that again it comes down to the builders warranty scheme that is mandated under state governments. I have a very grave concern that state governments require builders to take out this form of insurance, and yet in some cases there is only one insurer in Australia that is prepared to offer insurance. The only reason it is prepared to offer insurance is that it can make some profit; you cannot expect any insurance company to go into a line of business where it makes a loss. It is a significant risk, in a particular field in industry where there is only one insurer in the whole world—because insurance is a global business—that is prepared to offer insurance. That is a terrible systemic risk for the state governments. It needs to be addressed. Dexter is the only insurer that I am aware of—and it is backed by Allianz and Swiss Re—that is going in and providing insurance for partially completed building work. No-one else is. There are 161 insurers in Australia, and no-one else is prepared to touch this line of insurance, because it is so risky. It raises significant systemic risks, but that is the insurance required by the state governments of their builders. It is very important that we bear that in mind.
I understand the position of the member for Parramatta. I understand and appreciate it. He said that we need a mechanism to shake out the inefficient and perhaps the fraudulent. I agree. That is why, in effect, this is a safety net package. It is a safety net package and it is a welfare package. I say to the member for Parramatta, as I said in my second reading speech, that this is not a precedent. He says that limited liability is a limitation on enterprise and thrift. Well, in a sense he is right; but that is why we have companies. Companies actually limit the liability of individuals. That is why people incorporate and why we provide that mechanism of protection. But, in the process of incorporating, people have certain obligations.
The member for Cunningham mentioned the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre. I say to the member for Cunningham that I would be very surprised if they were not covered by this package, and I say that in good faith. We would need to check out the details, but all non-profit organisations that may be qualified will qualify under this, and for 100 cents in the dollar. Again I say to the member for Cunningham that he should speak to John Watkins, the New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading, about builders warranty. Michael Egan in New South Wales made an extraordinary claim on TV one day that anyone who needs to be covered will be covered, so go out and buy a house in good faith. That was a very courageous statement. I am not aware of any details yet of just how many people have actually received cheques in New South Wales. We made a commitment to get money out in salary continuance. I understand that so far in the last two weeks we have sent out around half a million dollars to people on salary continuance, and we will continue to undertake that. I do not know if New South Wales is living up to the expectations that it has created in relation to builders warranty. And I am very concerned about Victoria. There have been pledges made by state governments, but they are not actually delivering support to builders.
I appreciate the member for Canberra thanking my staff, because my staff have done an excellent job in the process. This is something that has not happened before and it was important to have very highly qualified personal staff in my office. I would particularly like to mention Peter Cullen, who has worked enormous hours on this. Everybody was working on weekends and through the night in some cases to try to put in place the arrangements. I would also like to mention Andrew Lumsden, Matthew Abbott and all my staff who worked very long hours with me on this. I would particularly like to thank Treasury officials Gary Potts, Steve French, Karen Whitham, Simone Abbot, Godwin Grech and a number of others— there are too many to mention—and Amanda Goodban, who is here, who has given excellent advice from the start. 
We were right across this early. Of course no-one had picked up on the size of the problem, as I said, because no-one knew— just look at the press clippings from the days before. Today, more than three months later, the provisional liquidator still cannot tell us what is the bottom line of the company. I am glad that the stark light of a royal commission is going to shine on this, because it is going to see that immediately, when HIH collapsed on the night of 15 March, I was on the phone to APRA asking who was immediately affected, and I was particularly concerned about people with travel insurance. There were nearly three-quarters of a million people travelling both domestically and internationally who did not know that, as of that moment, they were not insured. As I said in my second reading speech, I want to thank QBE for immediately covering these people, after a few phone calls, and that happened immediately after the collapse. Following on from that, there was an enormous reaction from all of us to try, firstly, to find out just how many people were immediately affected, which was unquantifiable because the HIH's records were so terrible, and, secondly, to get in place some support mechanisms which included, in the first place, the need for the insurance industry to step in to help and, if there was going to be support from the Commonwealth, the need for an appropriation bill.
Finally, I also thank the member for McEwen, the member for Dawson and other members who have contributed to the debate. This has not been an easy process; it has been a very difficult and demanding process. The thing that always keeps all of us in this place going is that we are actually trying to help people who have been disadvantaged in our community. I think Alan Jones summed it up totally appropriately one morning on Sydney radio when he said that the community does have an obligation to step in when there is a flood or a hailstorm or an event that occurs that is out of people's control and there is immediate hardship. I know that a number of media commentators were raising these issues. The questions for a government always are: firstly, how can we quantify the size of the problem; secondly, how can we set up a mechanism to address the matter; and, thirdly, how can we make sure that there is a safety net to support people? I appreciate the contribution of people like Alan Jones to the debate and for bringing to the attention of everyone the issues involved. I commend the bill to the House. I remind the House that this is not a precedent; it is in fact an act of a compassionate government to help those people most disadvantaged.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION (HIH ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I move, as an amendment to the motion for second reading:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1) massively increasing the complexity of the tax system for small business;
(2) massively increasing the compliance burden for small business; 
(3) breaching the Prime Minister's 1996 pledge to halve small business red tape; and
(4) wasting many millions of dollars on advertising and promoting the new business tax arrangements to try and cover the problems listed above”.
These bills cover various separate subject areas which Labor has previously agreed to support as part of the business tax package. The bills cover a simplified tax system for small business and a uniform system of capital allowances for various differing types of assets. We hope both of these proposals will deliver some simplicity benefits to the relevant taxpayers. It should also be noted that they represent further change which might well concern many reform-weary taxpayers and advisers. The first item is what is referred to as the simplified tax system, which refers to an optional simplified bookkeeping and income tax compliance package recommended by the Ralph review of business taxation. This is available to small businesses, which are defined as those having a turnover of $1 million or less per year.
There are three components to the system. The first is cash accounting, where businesses can adopt cash accounting so that income is recognised when received, not when an invoice is issued, and deductions are allowed when expenses are paid. This question of cash accounting—rather than people getting caught through accrual accounting with cash flow problems and having to pay GST before they have in fact got that money in hand—is quite an important issue that came up before the inquiry into the business activity statement which Kim Beazley initiated earlier this year and which I chaired. 
The second component is simplified depreciation: assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible, assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for less than 25 years are pooled and written off at 30 per cent per year, and assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for 25 years or more are pooled and written off at five per cent per year.
The third is simplified trading stock: a trading stock regime where taxpayers do not have to account for changes in the value of trading stock or do stocktakes at the end of the financial year where those changes are $5,000 or less. In addition, the bill contains proposals for the rules covering the deductibility of prepayment of expenses to be altered. The precise extent of the change is unclear. However, broadly, taxpayers in the system can get more concessional treatment relative to the transitional rules currently in place restricting prepayments. The costings indicate a relatively minor revenue impact which only applies over the next two years. On this basis we are not proposing to oppose this change. The system has the potential to reduce income tax compliance where taxpayers are eligible to join it. Having said that, there is an awful lot of tax reform fatigue in the small business community. However, the system is optional.
The second area I want to cover is that of capital allowances. Part of the business tax reform package was to try to make capital allowances for differing types of assets more uniform. There are in fact over 37 separate capital allowance regimes that are not consistent. A uniform system of capital allowances based on a common set of principles will offer simplification benefits. The existing separate regimes are complex, inconsistent and involve replication in the tax law. The more comprehensive regime provides a framework under which black hole expenses can be recognised. A more uniform system of capital allowances will provide a more neutral tax treatment for capital expenditures and hence should improve the quality of investment and economic efficiency. Not all capital expenditures are covered by the uniform regime. Those excluded are some depreciating assets used in research and development activities; some depreciating assets used in Australian films; buildings and structural improvements covered by division 43 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; depreciating assets associated with certain indefeasible rights to use assets such as submarine cables; and cars which use a particular substantiation method. 
The uniform capital allowance system in the tax law will have the following broad design features. The entitlement to write off a depreciable asset for taxation purposes will rest with the taxpayer who incurs the loss in value of the asset, not necessarily with the legal owner of the asset. The cost of depreciable assets will be the actual cost of the asset to the person who acquires the asset, including all relevant costs of acquiring and installing the asset except financing costs. Taxpayers will continue to be provided the option of either using the Commissioner of Taxation's effective life schedule or self-assessing the effective life of their assets. Where self-assessing, the taxpayer will be required to indicate this on their income tax return. Taxpayers will be given the option of writing off depreciable assets on the basis of prime cost or diminishing value. Project development costs will be eligible for depreciation through pooling arrangements and written off on a diminishing value basis at a rate determined by the effective life of the project. 
`Black hole' expenses—that is, those not currently recognised in the tax system—will be recognised as follows: capital expenditure that neither creates nor improves an asset from its original condition in the hands of the taxpayer will be able to be written off in the year in which it is incurred; capital expenditure that creates or improves a depreciable asset will be written off on the basis of the asset's effective life; and capital expenditure that creates or improves a non-depreciable asset will be incorporated into the asset's cost base, which would reduce the taxable gain or increase the allowable loss when the asset is disposed of.
The uniform capital allowance system will apply to assets commenced to be constructed or acquired under contracts on or after 1 July this year—coming up quite soon—and will apply to `black hole' expenses incurred on or after 1 July as well. The explanatory memorandum does not disclose the financial impact. It says:
These bills are based on the recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation ... However, because some recommendations have already been adopted, for example the removal of accelerated depreciation, while other recommendations in relation to capital allowances have not been included in these Bills, the financial impact cannot be accurately ascertained.
I have some concerns about this on transparency grounds, and it is really not good enough for the government to come in here and say, `We simply don't know what the cost of these measures is.' Having said that, the measures are part of a package to which we have previously agreed. They should provide some tangible benefits to taxpayers and, accordingly, we will support these measures. I have moved an amendment relating to the complexity of the tax system for small business, the compliance burden for small business, the question of the Prime Minister's 1996 promise to halve small business red tape and the question of government advertising and, in particular, the orgy of government advertising which we have seen in recent times. I have had a couple of speaking opportunities today, and we are trying to cooperate with the government in getting some legislation through. Therefore, I would like to give some of my colleagues the opportunity to speak in more detail on the amendment. I therefore confine my remarks to the principal bill and indicate that we will be supporting this legislation. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment. ",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to support the simplified taxation system measures contained within the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and the cognate bills, the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill 2001 and the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2001. I note a couple of the comments from the member for Wills, who talked about `black hole' expenses. Of course, the people of Australia are well aware of the black hole created by the poor financial management of the then Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, who had created a `black hole' expense for everyday Australians of $96 billion when we came to office. 
Everything that this government has been doing falls into two areas. The first is repairing the social structures that were destroyed—and continue to be destroyed— following the Whitlam years and restoring the incentive for individuals to achieve for themselves, to better their own circumstances and their family's circumstances, to get reward for effort and then to return something to the community as a result of that reward. Of course, the second stream of concern of this government has been to try to restore the nation's books, to do what small businesses, families and individuals around this country have to do—that is, to live within their means and to meet the cost of any bills that they have clocked up along the way. A $96 billion black hole was created by reckless abandonment of decent principles as far as expenditure priorities were concerned, created without realising that, when you keep on borrowing and borrowing and borrowing, at some stage you have to repay—that was the style of the Labor Party—and fixing the consequences is what this government has been doing over the past 5½ years.
I acknowledge and thank the member for Wills for his support on a number of the measures contained here, but I want to juxtapose that with the overall style of the Labor Party through the last four years as taxation reform has been put forward by this government, basically to try to reinstall and re-instil a sense of individual ownership of the way people run their lives. As taxation reform has been put forward, the Labor Party have opposed it root and branch. They have done everything they can to make it more complicated, more complex and more confusing, and they continue to spread as many mischievous messages as they possibly can across the broad community. So, when the member for Wills talks about taxation reform fatigue in the small business sector, he is quite right. And yet why is it that the Labor Party are proposing additional changes to taxation measures in this country—measures which, if they were elected, would be put in place and would create even more problems for small business to come to grips with, following the big changes that this government has put in place?
These bills are all about providing some additional simplicity for people taking up the option to be part of the simplified taxation system. It is an optional package for small businesses with turnovers of less than $1 million. It allows them a number of benefits, reducing the time and money that those very small businesses need to spend on bookkeeping and compliance for tax purposes. It allows for cash accounting so that income is recognised when it is received and deductions are recognised when they are paid. That, of course, is of great assistance to small businesses, as they make their journey, hopefully, to bigger businesses through their own efforts. The simplified depreciation measures mean that assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible, and assets costing $1,000 or more can be pooled and written off at an accelerated rate without the need to keep detailed asset schedules— again, simplifying the paperwork, simplifying the compliance costs. Assets purchased by small businesses with an effective life span of less than 25 years are written off at a 30 per cent rate per year, and those with an effective life of 25 years or more are written off at five per cent per year. Again, it is about allowing small businesses to invest in themselves for the long term and to seek reasonable tax write-off capacities through that. 
There are also ways of simplifying the trading stock provisions and introducing a new 12-month rule for determining deductions for prepaid expenditures by a simplified taxation system for taxpayers and individual taxpayers. This is coupled with other measures this government has introduced, in a comprehensive way, to help small business—not so much just because we want to see individuals return a profit to themselves but also because we want small businesses to grow and to create more jobs. When you add up all of the measures this government has introduced, the new regime operating from 1 July is going to make that sense of reward for effort even more profound for small businesses. Company tax is reducing down to 30 per cent from 34 per cent—and Labor had much higher rates before they left office. We will be pushing the Australian Labor Party to guarantee before this next election what they have failed to guarantee so far— that is, that they are not looking at increasing company tax rates back up to the pre-1 July levels, because Labor have to find the money to meet the cost of the many promises they are making, behind cupped hands, behind closed doors, all around this country, promising everything to everyone but not coming clean on how they are going to pay for it.
The only way the Labor Party can possibly pay for their promises and their roll-back is to increase taxes and charges in certain areas or to cut expenditure. They will not identify where they are going to cut expenditure, and they will not identify whether taxes and charges are going to go up. It is not simply a claim; it is easily demonstrated that the Labor Party in office do exactly that—tax more, spend more, clock up more debt and consign us to higher interest rates. Let us face it: these are not simply my observations alone. There are plenty of people making comments about just these sorts of things. What are other people saying about the Labor Party's proposed roll-back? We have heard $4 billion so far is what they are planning to roll-back to change the GST system, to make it more complicated, to make the changes that are going to increase compliance cost burdens for small businesses. Chris Murphy, the Econtech economic modeller, the modeller of choice of the Australian Labor Party, just last week on 19 June—based on a Labor roll-back package costing $4 billion—said that `GST roll-back', Labor's package:
... would put the budget well into deficit, would add up to 100 basis points—
that is, one per cent—
to interest rates, would send the current account deficit back up.
In other words, we would start heading back down the road Labor left us with before we came to office in 1996. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Mark Paterson said:
Further roll-back would only increase complexity.
Read: further costs for small business. Read: undoing the sorts of measures the government is bringing in in this package of bills today. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia's Rob Bastian—
—He supports roll-back.
—on 23 May of this year said:
Of course we're frightened about that rollback statement ... if we're rolling back the coverage of the GST, then that will increase the complexity and that will cause a lot of pain.
A lot of pain for small business. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia's chief executive, Stephen Harrison, in March of last year said:
If a future government were to introduce even further exemptions—
he is talking about roll-back—
we'll be turning back the clock and destroying many of the benefits that can be accrued from a simplified system through the GST. 
Then the President of the Small Business Council of the ACT, Manuel Xyrakis, in August of last year said:
The last thing they—
that is, small business—
want after all that effort and hard work they have put into it—
that is, getting the new taxation system going—
is to have a rollback and more changes. We don't want any more changes.
We had the member for Wills in here this morning saying, confessing, that there was tax reform fatigue in the small business community, yet the Australian Labor Party, if elected, will add to that fatigue, add to that pain, add to that cost for small business. The consequence of that is the loss of jobs. Small business is the engine room of the economy. Particularly in my own electorate of Moreton, where small business is of paramount importance to local employment prospects, we will simply see greater unemployment— even greater than the level that has already been generated by the failed arrogant Beattie government in Queensland, a government which even the Courier-Mail has said have missed a great opportunity in their budget and have failed the mandate that they achieved at the election earlier this year to come up with the goods to create jobs. We have had Premier Beattie downgrading his five per cent unemployment boast to eight per cent. He is simply saying, `We can't do it.' The Commonwealth is trying to do things, and the Labor Party in this place are doing all they can to retard our efforts. Chartered accountants Duesburys' Mike Bannon in Canberra on 27 February last year said:
More exemptions, as envisaged by Mr Beazley, would result in more pages, more uncertainty and disputes between the ATO and taxpayers. Self-interest groups would be relentless in their claims for more exemptions.
So more uncertainty and disputes and more pages in the tax act. Isn't that typical of the Australian Labor Party—choking small business to death on red tape, as they did before 1996, and proposing to the same thing if they are elected at the next election? On 4 April of this year the spokesman for the National Association of Retail Grocers—
—They support roll-back too!
—said:
So roll back worries us ... all that's going to do to us is add complexity.
We have got the member for Hunter, the would-be minister for small business, saying that all of these people support roll-back. I have got to tell you, my friend, if in fact they support roll-back they have got a funny way of showing it. It is a typical Labor Party scenario: they will re-read the books so that when they are in deficit they appear to be in surplus, and they will re-read the support so that when it is critical it is in fact supporting them. That just goes to show the real damage the legacy of 13 years of Labor has done to literacy and numeracy on the frontbench of the Labor Party alone. They do not understand whether numbers add up, and they do not understand what the words mean when they are put into a phrase, put into a sentence and put into a paragraph. This government is committed to simplifying the taxation system, because it helps create jobs. That is the consequence of supporting small business and that is the consequence of listening to the demands of small business and achieving for them. I commend these measures to the House.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"— The New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and cognate bills cover a simplified tax system for small business and a uniform system of capital allowances for various differing types of assets. The simplified tax system is an option available to small businesses that are defined as `businesses with a turnover of $1 million a year or less'. Within the simplified tax system there are three broad measures: cash accounting, simplified depreciation and simplified trading stock.
Businesses can adopt cash accounting so that income is recognised when received rather than when an invoice is issued and deductions are allowed when expenses are paid. As someone who has operated a small business, moving towards cash accounting for businesses with a turnover of $1 million or less is a very welcome measure. In relation to simplified depreciation, assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible and assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for less than 25 years can be pooled and written off at 30 per cent a year. That is certainly an improvement. Assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for 25 years or more can be pooled and written off at five per cent a year. In relation to simplified trading stock, a trading stock regime has been provided under this legislation where taxpayers do not have to account for changes in the value of trading stock or do stocktakes—which, as we know, can take an enormous amount of time—at the end of the financial year where those changes in the value of trading stock are $5,000 or less. In relation to the second aspect of the legislation—that is, a uniform system of capital allowances—at present there are over 37 separate capital allowances regimes and they are not consistent. This legislation goes some considerable way towards making them consistent. 
We welcome the changes, because to my memory these are the first genuine attempts to simplify a tax system that the government said it would simplify but instead has made massively more complicated. Let us have a look at the government's commitments. Back in 1996, in a press release on 30 January, the current Prime Minister said:
It is time to get government off the back of small business and to unlock their true job creating potential. A coalition government will slash the burden of paperwork and regulations on small businesses, with our aim being a 50% reduction in our first term of office.
So there is the Prime Minister committing the government to trying to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in red tape for small business within the first three years of a Howard government. I am about to demonstrate that the failure of the Prime Minister on this front has been spectacular. In this place on 24 March 1997 the Prime Minister said:
The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business.
He should know, because he has been adding to that tidal wave of tax legislation. In 1998, the Prime Minister was asked by a journalist:
Will the number of pages in the Tax Act be reduced by the introduction of a GST?
The Prime Minister said:
Yes, it will.
That was on the Alan Jones program on 2UE on 14 August. Then in 1999 the point was put to the Treasurer that the tax act was `unreadable and unintelligible', with the interviewer continuing:
... there's a massive GST program that's going to overtake us ...
In responding to that, the Treasurer said:
Well I think that's right. And that's why we've got to get the number pages of the Tax Act down. That's what we're working on right at this moment.
That was on 22 September 1999. Let us ask what has actually happened. For that we can go to the Financial Review of 24 March 2001, which said:
According to the Tax Institute of Australia, the Coalition Government last year passed 90 new tax, superannuation, customs and licence fee bills.
...				...				...
Anna Carrabs, a partner with chartered accountants William Buck, says the Tax Act will soon run to 8,500 pages, compared to 3,000 when the Prime Minister, John Howard, was elected with a promise to cut red tape.
So the Prime Minister promised to cut red tape by 50 per cent in the first term of the coalition government, yet we have got the Income Tax Assessment Act starting at 3,000 pages and heading towards 8,500 pages. As I said earlier, this is the first example I can think of of the government actually trying to simplify the tax system, because it has been hell-bent on complicating it.
Let us look at the GST legislation. The GST, we were told by the Treasurer, would be a streamlined new tax system for a new century. So much for a streamlined new tax system for a new century! The GST legislation and explanatory material now weighs in at 7.1 kilos and it has been amended more than 1,800 times—and just yesterday another 65 amendments were introduced. So here we are heading towards 2,000 amendments to the streamlined new tax system for a new century, and the government says, `We have done really well on this simplification front.' The problem with the complexity of the tax act is that, while it might be good for some accountants and good for lawyers, it is not good for small business. It is very bad for small business. Yet we have the Treasurer, on ABC radio on 18 March last year, saying: 
I don't think anybody will go to the wall as a consequence of the GST.
Every time we come into this parliament we give examples of businesses that have gone to the wall as a consequence of the GST. So there needs to be some genuine effort to simply the tax system, not to talk about a streamlined new tax system for a new century and then increase the Income Tax Assessment Act from 3,000 to 8,500 pages— not to talk about a streamlined new tax system for a new century and then bring in a GST which has already been amended almost 2,000 times, which weighs 7.1 kilograms and is thicker than three telephone books.
The Prime Minister, just yesterday in parliament, made the following statement—and you could see that he thought, `I shouldn't have said that; I wish I could take that back.' When he was asked about the $500 million GST education and promotion campaign, the Prime Minister said:
... the great bulk of that money spent under the auspices of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office was legitimately, with every single dollar, expended on advising the Australian people of the complexities and so forth of the new taxation system.
The Australian people and small business are very well aware of the complexities of the new tax system—the so-called `streamlined new tax system for a new century'. They do not need $500 million worth of advice to be told that this tax system is driving small businesses to the wall. We have got members opposite saying, `It is very important that small business be promoted.' We agree with that, but we actually come up with proposals to make sure that small business can get on with the job of expanding their businesses and that small business people can go home at night and reintroduce themselves to their families instead of struggling with this paperwork burden that the Prime Minister promised to cut by 50 per cent but which has in fact exploded in their faces.
Labor came up with a proposal, which was unveiled by the shadow Treasurer in a National Press Club speech a couple of weeks ago, to radically simplify the operation of the GST by the application of a simple ratio of net GST payable to turnover, based on the historical experience of small businesses. We got very positive responses to that from COSBOA and from various commentators in this area who said, `Here's Labor genuinely trying to simplify this monster of a tax.' But what does the Minister for Small Business do? Instead of saying, `We should have a good look at this,' he says, `Look, I keep telling you, you cannot simplify the GST.' So he commissioned a report from his department which he then went hawking around the press gallery, saying to people, `I've got this leaked document from my department.' Who is the leaker? The leaker was the small business minister, saying, `Look at my leaked document.' I have a copy of it and he has got double underlinings and asterisks all through it where he thinks that it might make his case. But do you know what? He failed to underline, under `Comment', the following:
A ratio by turnover method is a reasonable option for calculating GST, as long as the ratio continues to be an accurate reflection of the net GST position of the business.
What the department is saying, after being asked by the minister to do a hatchet job on Labor's simplification proposal, is that this is a reasonable option. But the small business minister says no. The coalition have no interest whatsoever in simplifying the tax system for small business. He boasts about how they have increased the complexity of the tax system for small business and immediately goes into attack mode, saying, `We can't even possibly contemplate any measure in relation to the GST that might lead to simplification.' He is supposed to be sticking up for small business. The Minister for Small Business is supposed to be defending them, coming up with options to simplify the tax system, to ease the burden on the shoulders of small business, but instead of that he says, `It can't be done,  the GST can't be simplified; we have the most simplified system in the world'—weighing 7.1 kilograms, thicker than three telephone books, and we have only amended it already 1,865 times! The Treasurer, in January 2000, when he was asked, `Does that mean no more changes?' said: 
Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right.  
It is now 1,865 amendments later and still climbing. So the only people barracking for small business in this parliament are the people on this side of the House—the Labor Party—because the government is proud of the complexity of the GST, it is proud of the fact that, instead of cutting red tape by 50 per cent, it has imposed a massive increase in the complexity of the income tax act, and the first and only evidence that I have got whatsoever of the government doing anything towards simplifying the tax system is the legislation before us here today. On that basis, I am happy to support the legislation.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—The prosperity of our nation depends on the prosperity and the confidence of Australia's businesses, especially small businesses, for it is those businesses that generate employment and it is their production that provides both our national income and the taxes that drive the public sector at the federal, state and local level. The New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000, New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill 2001 and New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2001 before the House will help safeguard the interests of those small businesses and, by extension, Australia's economic welfare and our national interest. Small business in Australia will be offered the option of an alternative system of business taxation to that presently in place, an alternative system that offers reduced bookkeeping requirements and taxation compliance costs.
The principal elements of the new simplified tax system are threefold. First, it will allow eligible businesses to adopt cash accounting, the system by which income is recognised when received and deductions recognised when paid. Secondly, it will simplify depreciation. Assets costing less than $1,000 will be immediately deductible, while assets costing $1,000 or more can be grouped together and written off at accelerated rates without the requirement for detailed asset schedules. Those assets that have an effective life of less than 25 years may be written off at 30 per cent annually, while other assets will be depreciable at five per cent per year. Finally, the legislation reforms and simplifies trading stock provisions: where changes in trading stock are worth less than $5,000, eligible businesses will not be required to account for those changes. The Australian Taxation Office will also issue guidelines in relation to stock value estimation. In addition, there will be a new 12-month rule for determining deductions for prepaid expenditures by simplified taxation system taxpayers and individual taxpayers.
These reforms stem from the Ralph Review of Business Taxation that reported in 1999, and, consistent with the recommendations of that review, the simplified tax system will be accessible by most businesses with an average annual turnover of less than $1 million. The reforms have been bolstered by extensive consultation with small business representatives and detailed public comment on the exposure draft of the bill released by the government in October of last year. By their nature, these reforms will involve transitional arrangements for taxpayers and will apply from 1 July 2001. 
The New Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill and the New Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Bill deal with the introduction of a uniform capital allowance system for those Australian taxpayers not included within the simplified tax system. This new system for the tax treatment of depreciating assets consolidates and replaces more than 27 separate capital allowances within the existing tax law. Standardised rules will be introduced for these disparate capital allowances, with specific provisions for the maintenance of the current rules that apply to primary producers and those involved in mining and quarrying exploration. 
These reforms ought to be applauded—we are eliminating the negative and accentuating the positive. These reforms will relieve Australia's small business employers—the job generators and the wealth creators—of the burden of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax, as well as reducing compliance costs, while making the system simpler and fairer for smaller firms. As I anticipated, the reaction of some members opposite, the members who have promoted themselves as new voices of moderation and economic rectitude within the opposition ranks—not wishing to point the finger at the member for Rankin who is obsessing with form and not substance—is a condemnation of tax cuts, for the opposition have set their flag against reducing the tax burden on Australia's taxpayers. That is their so-called moderation—not a moderating voice on expenditure, just a strident opposition to tax cuts. And we now know that the opposition's roll-back policy must lead to an increase in the income tax burden.
On this side of the House, we are heading down the economically logical, socially responsible path of cutting taxes. We have lowered income tax rates, we have cut company tax rates, we have cut capital gains tax and we have taken away a number of taxes from financial transactions and from imports. This is the way to go. It is consistent with numerous international examples where the lowering of the tax burden has led to economic growth and prosperity. In this month's American Spectator magazine there is a most interesting and provocative article on taxation in Europe-, an article that sharply contrasts the economic performance and the taxation policy of the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of France. There are lessons in this comparison for Australia and there is much in the Irish example to emulate, whereas Labor has already demonstrated that it will follow the path of socialist countries in the European Union, and that is going to have very negative consequences for this country.
The present European preoccupation with punitive taxation has been highlighted by the case of Laetitia Casta, who is a French model—the personification of `Marianne' and the symbol of the French republic. She is now a tax exile in the United Kingdom. I think it rather odd that we would be citing the United Kingdom as a tax haven. Laetitia has fled a top marginal tax rate of 54 per cent that kicks in at just $45,000 per annum, plus 16 per cent in social security taxes, plus a wealth tax, plus a punitive capital gains tax—which defines short-term capital gain as less than four years—and now an exit tax of 40 per cent. So as continental Europe continues to struggle under high and increasing tax burdens, the glowing exception is Ireland.
Last year, I had the privilege of addressing the Irish Australian Business Association in Perth. I had the opportunity to pay tribute to Ireland for its extraordinary economic success since the mid-1980s, success personified by the call for the return of expatriates to Ireland to meet an escalating demand for labour. Members will recall the visit to this place of the Irish Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern, who made that call for emigration to Ireland when he was here in Australia. Today, FAS—the Irish labour agency—scours the world not only for homesick expats but also for other potential migrants.
—I think this is valid but I'm not sure.
—Absolutely. It is an example for the Labor Party to follow. This is extraordinary for a country whose principal export for centuries was people. As recently as 10 years ago, an average of 28,000 Irish men and women emigrated every year. Today Ireland is drawing to it 50,000 immigrants annually. What lies at the basis of the Irish renaissance, the birth of this Celtic tiger? The repudiation of the same punitive taxation that is drowning the other nations of the European Union—and that is a line that a Labor government would follow in this country. In 1985 the top marginal income tax rate in Ireland was 65 per cent; this year it will be 42 per cent. The company tax rate has been cut from 50 per cent to 24 per cent, and it is falling. Likewise overall capital gains tax has been halved. The relevance of this is that the results are profound—they fly in the face of those on the other side of the House who would repudiate the lessening of the tax burden on citizens. 
In eight years in Ireland, unemployment has gone from 15.7 per cent to less than five per cent. A perpetual debtor state is now running surplus budgets. Taxation revenues are up due to reduced income tax rates. Interestingly, Ireland's success is giving the European Union a nervous breakdown as it cuts taxes lower than its socialist neighbours. Earlier this year the Keynesians in the European Commission wagged their finger at Ireland for loosening its fiscal policy; inflation had hit an annual rate of seven per cent last December. That is an interesting reaction from the European Commission, given that Ireland is the euro-zone country whose economy has been growing the fastest—at 10 per cent last year—and whose public debts are falling. It has had the largest fiscal surplus as a share of GDP in Europe.
—How much EU money have they had?
—Of course, some people in Brussels would like to point to the EU handouts over the years, at times amounting to four to seven per cent of GDP. But make no mistake, member for Hunter: Ireland's success is of its own making. It has opened markets, improved education, managed the public finances assiduously and— this being my point—lowered taxes. In fact, Ireland has indicated that it will cut all corporate tax rates to 12.5 per cent by 2003. The result of course is a flood of direct foreign investment. Ireland has been the most aggressive tax cutter and the fastest growing economy in Europe. The Irish example, where freeing citizens from punitive taxation has had social, economic and fiscal benefits, follows similar examples of the United States between the wars, under the Reagan presidency and the second term of the Clinton presidency, the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher, and Hong Kong and Korea in the 1980s. Put simply, the lesson is that freeing businesses and individuals from the burden of taxation fosters growth, development and employment, and is the only sure long-term basis for fiscal stability and social prosperity.
In answer to the member for Hunter, I raise these examples because they support the approach of the Howard government to seek to cut taxes and to make the tax system fairer. The member for Rankin, instead of spending his time counting the pages of the tax act to score a passing political point, ought to spend his time explaining to the people of Australia what his party's position is on cutting taxes and lowering income tax rates. I am committed to the notion of lower taxes and lower tax rates. If the percentage of personal income that any government can collect in taxes is low and invariable, the only variable a government can turn to is growth. Growth can fund deficits and growth can fund programs. To increase growth there must be incentives to work and to invest, and that means to reduce taxes, as we have begun to do—reducing income tax rates, reducing company tax rates and reducing capital gains tax.
It is high time that the opposition came clean on its approach to taxation. It is presenting itself as an alternative government. Is it committed to raising taxes? Will it seek to emulate Ireland? Will it continue the work of this government in reducing taxes? Or will it seek to punish our achievers with higher marginal tax rates, working against increased growth, increased incentives, increased investment and jobs that result from tax cuts? The opposition is already on record with its roll-back policy. It is so evidently destructive. It invariably means that if you decrease the amount of tax collected under the GST you will find it elsewhere. As we know from Senator Conroy, `elsewhere' will mean increasing income tax. That will be Labor's position. Like the socialist countries in Europe who are envying the Irish example, taxpayers will face a powerful disincentive under a Labor government to work harder or a powerful incentive to work overseas. This government is committed to ensuring that Australia's workers, its job creators, its wealth creators, are working under a fairer, simpler tax regime with lower tax rates. 
I commend to the House the consideration of further tax reforms which would see the further lifting of the tax burden from the shoulders of Australia's small business. In respect of the reforms in the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000, the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill 2001 and the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2001, I commend them to the House.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—That was not a bad speech by the member for Curtin, but it was a bit long on rhetoric, sometimes bordering on irrelevance to the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000. She might want to do her homework on Ireland. I commend the Irish government, as well, for the wonderful work they have done in economic terms, but the member for Curtin might want to check the amount of EU and IMF assistance that nation had in achieving those goals. I could not agree more that, increasingly in this internationally competitive environment, our taxation system similarly needs to be competitive if we want business and small business to grow in that environment.
I found her speech a little more interesting than the contribution of the member for Moreton, who basically made the same speech he made in this place yesterday on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. It was the same speech and the same rhetoric. Yesterday, I accused him of being in denial with respect to the impact of the GST on small firms. Well, he clearly showed today that he is still in denial, but I was pleased to hear him acknowledge that small business is suffering change fatigue. If members want to check the Hansard, they will find that he clearly acknowledged that.
This bill inserts a new division in the Income Tax Assessment Act—the so-called simplified tax system. I suggest that a better name would have been `simpler but not enough', given the change fatigue the small business community is experiencing as a result of the GST. The changes are based on the recommendations of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. Most businesses with an average annual turnover of less than $1 million will be eligible to join this new system. The opposition will be supporting the bill but has taken the opportunity by way of an amendment moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer to highlight the way in which the government has failed the small business sector.
The so-called simplified tax system has three key elements. The first element is cash accounting. Under this method of calculating taxable income, businesses will in general recognise income when it is received and deductions when expenses are paid. The second element is simplified depreciation. Assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible under the new scheme. Assets costing $1,000 or more and with effective lives of less than 25 years can be pooled and written off at 30 per cent each year. Assets costing $1,000 or more and with effective lives of 25 years or more are pooled and written off at five per cent each year. The use of pools removes the need to keep detailed asset schedules.
The third element is simplified trading stock. Under the trading stock provisions, simplified tax system taxpayers will no longer have to account for changes in trading stock of less than $5,000. I must say that I am concerned that this may expose some small firms. I suggest that the only way you can be certain that that variable has not been any more than $5,000 is to do a stocktake. The alternative is to take a guesstimate, and I feel that this might expose some small business operators to penalties as a result of an audit taken on their decision to use that method. 
The new tax system and prepayments measures included in this bill will apply to assessments for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2001. I note that the bill differs from the original exposure draft in the following ways: the depreciating assets threshold for eligible businesses has been increased from $2 million to $3 million; the requirement to account for the change in value of trading stock on a cash basis has been removed; and the control tests to avoid inadvertent grouping have been relaxed.
The opposition support these changes which flow from, as I said, the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. Indeed, it is well known that we have supported all the changes recommended by that committee and adopted by the government. That is why I find it disappointing that National Party backbenchers, in particular, have been in their electorates making spurious claims about the opposition's position on entity taxation or, indeed, Ralph's recommendations on entity taxation. Let us take an honest look at the history here and what has occurred since those recommendations. As a result of those recommendations, the government produced an exposure draft on entity taxation, which I had been warning for months was full of flaws and was going to have unintended consequences for small business people, including farmers, who use trusts as legitimate investment and business vehicles. Thankfully, in February this year the Treasurer backflipped—again—and finally saw sense and announced that he was withdrawing that legislation. But what he also made quite clear is that the government will be revisiting the issue by way of another exposure draft. Again, the opposition will be happy to have a look at that new legislation and, if we decide it is effective in attacking rorts in the trust environment while at the same time ensuring that there are no unintended consequences, or indeed intended consequences, for the genuine users of those vehicles, we will be happy to support it. Likewise, if the government fails to do so before the next election, in government we would also be looking to ensure that trusts are not being abused as vehicles.
Many small peak bodies have expressed a view to me that the threshold for the new system may be too low. I have some sympathy for that view. We now have too many thresholds, another aspect of change fatigue and another threshold that could act as a barrier to growth. Some small firms—for example, those operating on a turnover of just under $1 million—might be very reluctant to go through all the transitional work to move back to cash accounting. They will fear going through that transitional work once again as they go through that $1 million threshold. This is a big issue for small firms. I doubt if it is something the government has taken into account in considering these changes and I appeal to the government to take another look at it. Certainly Labor in government would be having another look at that threshold measure to ensure that it is sufficient to pick up as many small businesses as the government claims this new system will provide an option for.
I note that the Minister for Small Business is once again absent from this debate, although I do welcome the member for Cook. The member for Cook, the member for Moreton and I seem to be in synchronisation on these bills which are so important to small business. I wonder where the small business minister is in this debate. This is the minister who, as I pointed out to the House yesterday, said this of the GST:
I'm not sure how many small businesses went ... out of business because of it—
because of the BAS—
but I certainly know that marriages were strained and small business people were taken away from ... running their small business ... 
The minister said the government `was sorry for foisting such an “undue burden” on small business'. He said:
It was an unwelcome imposition ...
I understand that the Minister for Small Business has joined the bandwagon and is out there assisting the government in their attempt to spend something like $20 million of taxpayers' money each month selling bipartisan messages to the electorate in a desperate attempt to pull themselves out of the very deep political black hole in which they find themselves. I think that `Opening doors' was the suggestion for the name of the video the Minister for Small Business is out there making. I will be very interested to see that ad. I hope it is a bit better than the `Unchain my Heart' ads, where we saw people from all walks of life, including small business people, breaking free from all of life's constraints as a result of the introduction of the GST.  
This is a very disappointed small business community, a small business community that, contrary to government promise, has had its cash flow reduced, has had its profitability reduced and, as I said earlier, is suffering a great deal of tax change fatigue. This is a small business community that was looking for initiatives in the budget to make up some of that lost ground, but a small business community which remains very disappointed.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—It is always my pleasure to follow the member for Hunter. Once more, he is clearly listening to the wrong group of people. Some of his Labor Party branches might express this view, but even the people that he spends quite a bit of time with—the tourism industry—when they were down here speaking to the Treasurer just two weeks ago were full of praise for many of the things that the government are doing. Of course, the tourism industry is made up of a lot of people who run small businesses. They are very appreciative because of the business tax rate being brought down from 36 per cent when you were in government to 30 per cent under this government. They are very much aware of that. They are also very much aware of the interest rates they are paying now as opposed to the interest rates they paid when your government was in power. They are very much aware that life is much better under this government. While there may have been some individual problems with the nature of the BAS form, that has now been corrected, as we saw in the bill that came into the House yesterday. They were pleased to see those changes. They will simplify things for small business, with a choice of which option they will take.
The New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 continues that process of listening to small business, of listening to business generally and of making some sensible changes. The changes that we see encapsulated in this legislation are all part of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, not as a result of getting the trade unions in to tell the members here. We know that half of the members on the Labor side of this House get their riding instructions from the unions. This is about talking to those people in business about business legislation. It sounds ironic—like a Labor oxymoron— that you would do that, but it is simply what happened. I remember in my previous life being part of the discussions with the tourism industry when the Ralph review was meeting, and listening to what small business and larger business were saying about what changes they would like to see incorporated for the future. These changes are the result. These changes are the result of business saying, `We've got some problems in these areas. Can you fix them?' and the government making decisions as to whether it is appropriate or not. Is it fair; is it equitable; is it likely to stimulate small business and large business in this country? This is why we see the legislation here before us. 
The bill will alter the current legislation with respect to depreciation of assets and will provide a common set of rules for writing off many capital expenses. These adjustments will give a greater certainty and simplicity to the current system, which is partly what this whole exercise is about in terms of the GST—making it simpler for business, for those people involved in the service industry to contribute to the running of the economy, and helping people in the leisure business who bring visitors here from other countries with the expenses involved. Making it simple is one part of it. These adjustments, in giving greater certainty and simplicity, will benefit many businesses in Australia by setting about increasing simplicity, reducing compliance costs and reaching more equitable outcomes.  
The bill will rectify the current confusing situation with at least 27 capital allowance regimes in the income tax law that are not consistent. The UCA system will remedy this by encompassing many depreciating capital expenses under a simplified common set of rules. The bill generally applies to all taxpayers except eligible small businesses that choose to participate in the simplified tax system. The bill outlines a general set of rules to calculate the decline in the value of most depreciating assets, which will improve the current situation. This will give the taxpayer choice over whether to continue to use the Commissioner of Taxation's effective life schedule or to self-assess the effective life of their assets. In addition to this, the system will allow the creation of a low value pool where pooling of certain expenditures will allow the deduction to be calculated for the decline in value of the pool in its entirety. Of course, that is highly appropriate. 
The New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 implements one of the business tax measures recommended in the Ralph review. It will benefit eligible small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $1 million who choose to join the simplified tax system, or STS, which will operate from the beginning of the next financial year. The STS will operate based on three core components: firstly, cash accounting; secondly, simpler depreciation rules for most depreciable assets and depreciation at accelerated rates; and, thirdly, simpler trading stock rules. The legislation goes into detailed aspects of this.
This is predominantly a technical bill, but its aim is very clear. Its aim is to assist small business across this country. Its aim is to stimulate the Australian economy. Its aim is to simplify procedures that are required and have been required in the past. It is part of the important overall structure of providing good economic management in this country. The Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the minister responsible for the tax office, Senator Kemp, are doing an outstanding job in this area, as is Minister Hockey, who has also been involved in this area. I am very pleased to see Ian Macfarlane, the Minister for Small Business, listening to the requirements of small business. It is something that we never saw under Labor, something that we are very proud of and something that we will continue to support. So I want to add my support to this legislation and congratulate the minister for bringing it into the House. I am sure it will be welcomed by small business right across this country.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I rise to address the taxation bills before us: the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000, the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances) Bill 2001, and the New Business Tax System (Capital Allowances—Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2001. These bills are part of the new, simplified taxation system. It is interesting to note, when we comment on this `new, simplified taxation system', that we seem to have more and more amendments to a tax system that, as we were informed by the Treasurer some 12 months ago, was a `new generation' system that did not need any modification. We were looking at something like 1,800 amendments to it up until yesterday, plus 65 amendments today. So that is 1,865 amendments. 
The member for Rankin, in his excellent contribution this morning, was discussing the increasing complexity of this taxation legislation, which goes by the misnomer the `simplified taxation system'. I have noticed that the appearance of the member for Rankin over the past 12 months has somewhat changed. He is obviously a technician of the bill, a great practitioner of reading the legislation and actually carrying it around with him. I have noticed that he is starting to fill out a bit; he is putting on a bit weight. I suspect that is because he is carting around this ever increasing load of legislation—somewhat like the ancient mythical figures in Greece who carried a calf around. The calf got larger and larger, just as the taxation legislation is getting larger and larger. Obviously, with the way this is going, particularly with the increasing complexity of this legislation, the honourable member for Rankin is going to wind up like Hercules within the next 12 months.  
I would like to address the particular components of the legislation before I also make some more generalised comment about it. These bills cover separate subject areas agreed to as part of the business tax package. Labor has obviously previously agreed to support these proposals in total. The bills cover a simplified tax system for small business and a uniform system of capital allowances for varying types of assets. Both of these proposals should deliver some simple benefits to relevant taxpayers. We certainly hope that is the case. However, we should note that they represent further change, which may well concern many reform weary taxpayers and their advisers. What people are looking for is some certainty in this legislation, and in the taxation system generally. They are looking for increasing simplicity and fairness. A number of these measures that are now being brought forward by the government are a consequence of our endeavours in the community to shine a torch into these dark areas of taxation legislation and propose appropriate amendments to it to simplify it and make it fairer. The government uses the term `simpler and fairer'. It does not use the `R' word, though.
The particular issues for debate with respect to the simplified tax system relate to three components. They have been discussed before. The first component is cash accounting. Businesses can adopt cash accounting so that income is recognised when received and deductions are allowed when expenses are paid. The second component is the simplified depreciation rules. Assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible; assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for less than 25 years are pooled and written off at 30 per cent per year, and assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for 25 years or more are pooled and written off at five per cent per year. The third component is the simplified trading stock regime, where taxpayers do not have to account for changes in the value of trading stock or do stocktakes at the end of the financial year where those changes are $5,000 or less. They are obviously welcome reforms. There is also reform of capital allowances. Part of the business tax reform package was to try to make capital allowances for different types of assets more uniform. There are 37 separate capital allowance regimes that are not consistent. I understand that this fairly technical legislation aims to address those particular concerns.
I come back to the point that I made originally. You would think that the last country in the world to introduce a GST would get it right, but 12 months later we see that is not the case—certainly not for this government. A range of promises were made when taxation reform—A New Tax System—was introduced some 12 months ago. I want to talk about a number of these promises because they highlight my concern about the increasing need to amend the new taxation system and the ramifications of that. 
We were told that everyone would be a winner. Opinion polls certainly show that most people do not think they are winners— particularly small business. The Treasurer said in May 2000 that no small business would go to the wall. But certainly in my state and, I understand, in a more general sense, since the GST has been introduced, bankruptcies have increased by 25 per cent. My understanding is that in Victoria it is about 33 per cent. Families experiencing the consequences of the GST, particularly around my electorate, are seeing their electricity bills, according to ABS figures, go up by 12 per cent; gas, 10.4 per cent; insurance, apparently, 35 per cent; sporting fees, 12.2 per cent; and haircuts, 11.7 per cent. It appears as though the promises that were made with respect to this legislation are not coming to fruition. 
We were also told that a coalition government would slash the burden of paperwork and regulation on small business, with the aim being a 50 per cent reduction in the first term of the Howard government. That quite clearly has not occurred. As I understand it, the GST legislation and explanatory memorandum, which the member for Rankin carries around with him, are thicker than three telephone books and already the government's simple new taxation system has been amended 1,865 times.  
We were told that the GST would produce more jobs. Since the introduction of the GST, the rate of jobs growth has almost halved and the unemployment rate has risen. In particular, in my area, from the March 2000 quarter to the March 2001 quarter we have unemployment rising from nine per cent to 10.6 per cent in Dandenong. Tell the people of Dandenong that the GST is good for them. What have they done to be mugged by this government?
We were also told that the black economy would disappear. From the evidence emerging in my electorate and elsewhere, which has been commented upon by the Leader of the Opposition this morning, that is certainly not the case. The evidence that we have, and the comment from professionals in the area, is that they believe that the black economy has substantially increased.
One issue that has caused a fair degree of outrage and that I have been dealing with in my electorate is the $1,000 bonus for all people over the age of 60. They believe they have actually been deceived by the Prime Minister. Certainly, over 50 per cent of the people in my electorate who, as I understand it, believed that they were entitled to it received between nought and $50. They are becoming less and less enamoured of the term `Honest John'.
In respect of education and health, we were told they would be GST free. I attended a rally some time ago, after the introduction of the GST, at the Chisholm TAFE, and the students there certainly believed that education and health were not free. They wanted to know about school uniforms, school shoes, public transport, books and school bags, and they raised a number of other issues, such as skin creams, denture repairs, sanitary products, vitamins and minerals. They were also told, as I have detailed previously, that prices would not increase by the full 10 per cent, but I have just given you examples of where they have.
Today, what we are dealing with is a simplification of the taxation system, something that we are and have been aggressively advocating since the introduction of this tax, and something the Treasurer first said was not possible. Every time he has been asked whether anything should be changed, he has said no. But do not read his lips too closely or look at his smile because, effectively, shortly after he has made those statements, legislation comes into the parliament to amend the particular pieces of legislation in question. This package and a number of other packages that have been brought into the House recently have been the result of an uprising from the small business community over the BAS introduction. What the business community want is roll-back, because they want a fairer and simpler tax system. They want lots of roll-back because they believe that this government has mucked up the tax system. I take you back to a few words of the Treasurer, particularly commenting on the new taxation legislation on the Neil Mitchell program in January 2000:
It means we are not changing the legislation and that we have it right.
We are supporting this bill to make sure that the legislation does become simpler and fairer, something that we have been pushing for. But remember that Labor, this opposition, were the first group of people that suggested the simplification of the BAS statement. We suggested allowing business to choose to remit an instalment based on a simple ratio of the net GST payable over a previous period to the turnover of the firm for the particular quarter. We suggested this last February. Surprise, surprise! First of all the Treasurer says that it cannot be done, but two weeks later he comes back, bringing in legislation that does basically what we have been requesting.
Another of our proposals was to apply the ratio to the actual quarter so that, if economic activity slowed down, business cash flows would not be crucified. We are in a period of economic slowdown, and business cash flows are in fact starting to come down. I could go on further with respect to this matter, but I understand that we have a maximum of 10 minutes, and so I will leave it at that. I am sure that we will be back in this place soon, having another debate about different modifications to this very unfair and inequitable taxation system.

"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,2001-06-21,"—What a great tax system this is, and what a living document it is. Unlike many people on the other side of the House, I have spent 26 years in small business, in all sorts of different places in Australia, but in particular in the last 18 years in my own electorate as a sawmiller and trucking operator. When I see a document and new legislation that bring in a simplification of a system that bridges the divide, shall we say, between big business and small business, it pleases me to be able to stand in this House and discuss it and bring it to the attention of small business not only in the electorate of New England but also throughout Australia.
The New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 introduces measures recommended by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. It comes into effect on 1 July this year, and small business can elect to join the simplified tax system. From talking to very many small businesses throughout my electorate, I know that they are certainly looking forward to being able to have this degree of flexibility. The exposure draft of this legislation was released in October last year to seek public comment, and prior to that exposure draft the government made a number of changes based on earlier consultations with small businesses. These include allowing the depreciable assets, excluding buildings, with lives of more than 25 years to be pooled and written off at five per cent per annum. That is a great advance for small business, because previously these assets were subject to the effective life depreciation set in place. It allows businesses to use the ATO guidelines to estimate stock values. Again, coming out of small business, I know it is certainly a lot easier to use an estimated stock value rather than to do a physical stocktake—not because you do not want to do a physical stocktake but because the time constraints are often very difficult in very busy small businesses.
It simplifies the readmission to the simplified tax system, and provides scope for some high turnover, low margin businesses. I can assure you that in the industry that I have been involved in, the timber industry, we have a lot of traders who are small business people operating all around Australia, both in export and in domestic business. They have, in some cases, very high turnovers but very low profit margins, but they certainly provide an exceptional degree of service. The bill was introduced—and people made submissions and had consultations over a period of time—increasing the assets threshold from $2 million to $3 million, which was very important, and relaxing the control test to avoid inadvertent grouping, which would exclude some small businesses from the measure—again, these are all measures trying to help small business.
In listening to the debate this morning, the things that concern me greatly are, firstly, a lack of understanding of small business and the way small business operates and, secondly, the continual anti-GST, anti-tax reform and anti-small business promotion from those on the other side. A great love of my life and a great success, can I say, in this government's approach to the transport industry has been the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme, which was brought in by this government with tremendous benefit for transport operators, exporters, and small business people all over Australia through a reduction in the excise on diesel of up to—I think this is the figure now—nearly 22c a litre. This was a tax that was put on by the Labor Party. They opposed the introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme as part of the new tax system; so they did not want the transport industry to receive this 22c. But, never mind, we have brought it in and it has been very successful indeed. What concerns me is that there is no commitment by the opposition, by the Australian Labor Party, to continue the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant Scheme—no commitment at all. In fact, the transport people talking to me about growth and about being able to cope with some of the higher overseas dollars going out for oil have said that one of the great things of the new tax system and one of the great incentives for the transport industry is this government's commitment to the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme, bringing about this 22c a litre reduction. 
Yet, when a golden opportunity was presented at the Australian Trucking Association's conference in Canberra no more than about a month ago, the shadow spokesman on transport during his speech gave no commitment to the trucking industry that, should they by some chance operate from this side of the House, they would actually keep the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. As I understand it—because I did attend that particular conference—when asked about it during question time and privately, there was still no commitment by the Australian Labor Party to keep the fuels grant scheme operating. That means that they intend to get rid of it. That means an increase in excise on diesel of 22c a litre. When you consider that there are trucking companies out there that may use in the vicinity of a million litres of fuel a month, you can start to see why there is great concern in the transport industry about it.
I listened to the previous speaker discussing the issue of roll-back. Having sat in this House now since October in 1998 and listened to all sorts of debates, I have come to the conclusion that, without doubt, roll-back really means raising rates. It does not matter whether it is the diesel rate, roll-back will be paid for by increasing diesel excise by 22c a litre. Roll-back will raise rates of personal income taxation. Roll-back will raise rates of company taxation. Roll-back will raise rates in regard to Medicare. Roll-back will raise all these rates. It will raise interest rates because the economy will get out of control again. Roll-back raises rates of unemployment—and we have seen that in the past under this opposition when they had unemployment rates of something like 11.4 per cent.
I notice that the member for Paterson has just walked into this House, and I will give him a little challenge as he is a very hardworking member for Paterson, with a large number of trucking people in his electorate. Will you support the continuation of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and continue to make sure that our trucking industry keeps its 22c a litre? Will he also give a guarantee that the rail industry's reduction of 36c a litre in excise will stay in place? It is very important that we make sure that the Australian Labor Party give a commitment to the Australian people that they will not raise excise on diesel in particular.
I also raise this issue: the Labor Party voted against all these measures that brought in these savings. One small business person in my electorate generates electrical power through two very large generators. I have spoken about this issue in this House before. He does not receive one cent reduction in excise because the Labor Party prevented him from being able to attract excise rebates. He gets the GST off—thank goodness—and that certainly is a great win. He is a small business operator employing about 21 people out of the town of Uralla. Geoff Swilkes operates the G&C Foundry and gets no support whatever from the Australian Labor Party over the question of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. 
I also ask the Labor Party—because roll-back does raise rates—this: what are they going to do with the fuel sales scheme that is operating for rural and remote areas, the 1c, 2c and 3c a litre reduction? Are they going to keep that or are they going to continue to fund roll-back by raising rates? It does not matter whether they are excise rates. Will the other side give a commitment not to bring in indexation of fuel excise again like they brought it in in 1983? Will they give that commitment? I am looking forward to listening to the member for Paterson. I understand that we are restricted in time, but I am sure he will commit to keeping these excise rates at their present levels. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I love to come in here and follow the member for New England, because he always runs true to form. He is always predictable; you know exactly what he is going to say. Before he leaves the chamber, let me say that of course I will give a commitment to get justice for the transport industry, because that is what they need. I know so many of those owner-drivers who are not getting justice under this current system. I know that, and he knows that, and he knows they cannot survive under the current system. 
The legislation we are dealing with is the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and cognate bills. How thoroughly we on this side recall the Treasurer introducing the `simple' tax legislation. We can remember him coming in holding a stack of papers and doing one of his typical charades saying, `That is what the tax system under the Labor Party is. What is it going to be under us?' He then popped out a little booklet and said, `That's what it's going to be, a simplified tax system. It's going to be so simple that small business will love us.' How many changes have we had to it again? Is it 1,300, 1,500, 1,800? We have lost count.
—1,865.
—Thank you very much. There have been 1,865 changes already, and we are not finished yet. The things that I recall happening in the Hunter Valley, the area where I have lived all my life, are the great cons that have been placed on investors. The worst cons invariably go back to a law firm, and we all know solicitors who feel so confident they know all about investment policy and monetary policy that they can convince people to invest money. They say, `Invest with us, you'll be safe,' but they overlook something and down the track something goes wrong with their great plan—I guess we could say their cunning plan—and it comes unstuck and we find ordinary investors losing lots of money. That makes me think of our Treasurer and one of his predecessors, his now leader, and I think: what was their background? I realise they were both lawyers in a former life—both lawyers, both confident in their ability and both knowing all about monetary policy, but together they have succeeded in failing to deliver a simplified tax system.
On this side, we support a simplified tax system. That is what small business was promised, that is what small business expect and that is what we demand small business get. But they are certainly not getting it. Let us have a look at who is complaining. The National Farmers Federation feel that the taxation system is unjust. We have just heard the member for New England saying how the transport industry love it, but that is certainly not the message I am getting. They feel that, because of the intricacies of the tax system and because it is so involved, they are set on. Small retailers and tradespeople, particularly people in the building trade, have had to confront other problems recently—such as problems with HIH—which they also relate back to this government.
I had a doctor phone me the night before last about a letter he had received from the Australian Taxation Office. Together we agreed he is probably reasonably intelligent and he said, `When I look at this letter in conjunction with two previous letters I have received, I have no idea where I stand. I find I'm visiting my accountant more than I am attending hospital.' When a doctor says that he cannot understand letters from the Australian Taxation Office, I start to wonder how other people understand the letters that they are getting from the tax office. This was a person who was trying to conform in every way, but when he had a look at all the letters he had received from the tax office about the things he had to do and he saw how they contradicted each other, he just tossed his hands in the air and said, `I give up.' He is 63. He said, `I may as well retire and get out now.' I said, `Don't do that because you are not 65 and you won't get any benefits from this government.'
I read into Hansard the other night a letter that I had received from a dairy farmer. This dairy farmer is a very progressive farmer and he is investing heavily in his business. At the end of the March quarter, he was due for a $35,000 rebate from his BAS. But what happened? He had been promised that he would get that within 14 days of lodgment, except that the tax office decided they would do an audit on him. That $35,000 was due because, with dairy deregulation, he is investing hundreds of thousands of dollars to rearrange his business. He is restructuring his whole farm. He needed that money. That money was held up for 10 weeks until the audit was completed, and then the money was released because the audit found everything was in place, except they were mildly critical of his bookwork. As he has said in a letter to the Prime Minister, `I am a farmer, not a bookkeeper.' 
That is the sort of demand that this government is putting on ordinary Australian workers, people who have lived and worked all their life in one field, such as that farmer, yet are getting no assistance. In fact, they are getting downright hindrance from this government. These are the stories that we on this side are hearing. If we are hearing them, the government members are hearing them also. I guess Shane Stone was right: this government is mean and tricky and is simply not listening.
I would also talk about some of the furphies related to the tax system in Australia. I am sure that in here we hear from the Treasurer at least four or five times a week—and we generally hear it pretty loudly too—that we are a low taxing country. Isn't it interesting that a report put out on Tuesday by the research arm of the Commonwealth Bank did not find that? It found that in the year to March 2001 each household paid $14,300 in income tax and GST combined, or 17.5 per cent of income. Australia's combined tax take peaked at 17.8 per cent—when? Under a Labor government? No. It peaked at 17.8 per cent in 1998. If we go back a decade to a Labor government, we find that it was then $10,700, or only 16.4 per cent. Would someone on the other side please tell the Treasurer, `Don't come in here and give us the garbage about being a low taxing country, don't come in here and tell us that you've destroyed wholesale sales tax,' because I can tell you that everyone out there who drinks milk is paying a wholesale sales tax on milk of 11c a litre and they will be doing so for the next nine years—and that was brought into place by this government to pay for a program they consider their own. These are some of the furphies that are being put around constantly by this mean, tricky and not listening government.
I also see a report in the paper today where the Democrats, I think, are calling for an inquiry because it has been discovered that goods are being exported from Australia to avoid GST and then being reimported into the country. I also heard one of the previous speakers talk about the black economy. Remember the Treasurer and the Prime Minister saying `This is going to make everyone pay tax'? They want to get out there in the real world and talk to some of the people who are avoiding paying GST on many goods where GST is liable simply because they engage in cash transactions. The cash economy is alive and well, and this government is ignoring it.
Finally, I would like to talk about oyster farmers. In the electorate I represent there are many oyster farmers. About 1,100 people derive their income from that industry. This is an industry where change has been suggested. I do appreciate that the government has listened to these people—I guess because they are mainly in National Party electorates. They are also in my electorate, and the Nationals hope to win that one back. These people are being asked to go out and value their immature stock. That task would be horrendous. It would be very expensive and, apart from that, it would be ridiculous because many of those immature stock will never go to market.
I thank the House for the opportunity to put my views forward. We do support the legislation, and we certainly look forward to a real simplified tax system—not the virtual one that the Treasurer claims we have.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I am pleased to be able to rise in this debate and support the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and cognate bills and also the amendment moved by the opposition. I had cause just last week to review some advertising that I did prior to the 1998 election. As I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the brunt of much of the campaign of individuals like me was based on the premise that the GST would be bad for the economy. In particular, I raised issues in the Northern Territory about its impact on small business. Of course, we were decried as `fear mongering' for making the observations, which have lately turned out to be 100 per cent correct, about what the GST would do in its impact on the economy and certain sections of the economy. In the Northern Territory a significant area to be adversely affected and which I highlighted during this election campaign advertisement was the building industry. Since that time we have seen the introduction of the GST. Now we have proposals to simplify—further simplify—the new tax system, bearing in mind that already in this simplified tax system there are about 1,800 related amendments as a result of modifications which the government has deemed necessary since the introduction on 1 July last year. I would have thought you would have to ask a number of questions about that. 
It is clear that what was being said by me and others, including the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the Labor Party, at the time has been proved to be correct. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the GST has mugged the economy, despite the protestations of the Treasurer. You have only to look at what happened in the Northern Territory. We know that the Northern Territory economy is the poorest performing economy in Australia. We also know that in the year 2000 domestic building approvals in the Northern Territory fell by 39 per cent over the year 1999. We also know that in the period March 2000 to March 2001 state final demand in the Northern Territory fell by 1.9 per cent. Let us be clear about this: there is no question about the impact of the GST on small business in the Northern Territory. Over recent days as I have travelled around the Northern Territory and discussed issues related to the GST with my constituents, particularly in small business, they have confirmed yet again that the economy has slowed substantially, and it does not matter where we are talking about—Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs or Tennant Creek.
I had the experience of being at a meeting in Tennant Creek recently where a retailer said that he could not even go to the bank because he had no bankable takings. He is a small retailer. Another person working in the retail industry in Katherine said that they had had their worst day of Tuesday trading in 20 years. I spoke to small business people around the Coolalinga area in the Darwin rural area, and nothing but dissatisfaction was expressed about the GST and its impact upon small business. This is despite the fact that, in advocating the cause for the GST, not only this government, through the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but also all the advocates—the cheerleaders for the coalition—were out and about saying what a positive thing the GST would be for small business. They included, of course, the Northern Territory Treasurer, who said:
The package has been designed to minimise costs faced by business and reduce the administrative and compliance burden of the current multitax system. With the expected boost to the economy from the package, construction activity is expected to be better off, at least in the medium term. 
We know that, in the short term, the impact has been devastating—absolutely devastating. I knock on the doors of small business. To be fair, I have had one person say that they thought the new tax system helped them manage their business better because of the compliance that was involved, but that is the only one. Almost to a person, small business people to whom I have spoken have indicated their grave dissatisfaction with the GST. The then Northern Territory Chief Minister and now the President of the Liberal Party, Shane Stone, said:
Territorians are better off with this package, including the GST. 
That is simply not correct. We know the importance of small business to the Australian economy. We know the importance of small business to the Northern Territory economy. On ABS data for the year 1999-2000, small business employed a large number of people: indeed, 33,300 in the Northern Territory, which is more than half of Northern Territory employment. You do not have to be Einstein to understand the knock-on effects if those small businesses start to feel the pinch, and there is no question that they have been feeling the pinch. 
We know that nationally there has been an increase in insolvency. We know that, in May 2001, the Financial Review reported the Dun and Bradstreet survey which showed that bankruptcies increased by 22.2 per cent for the first quarter of the year from the previous three months. Comparing that with the data for the first quarter of 2000, the article stated that the figures are much worse, rising to 32.9 per cent. We have had a barrage of newspaper headlines over the last couple of months. The Sydney Morning Herald on 22 May this year had `Businesses' cash flow hit by red tape'; on 22 May the Financial Review had `Small business take GST hard' and on 24 March `It's official: blame the GST'—and, of course, that was none other than the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia who said:
What was not foreseen was, first, the size of this fall [in housing construction] and, second, the degree of confidence-sapping annoyance with the administration of the GST.
When I was visiting these small businesses around the Territory I came across one that had a quaint sign on the front of his door. This particular small business was a gunsmith, and the sign on the door and on the wall was `Gunsmith and tax collector'. You should be concerned to know that people are very frustrated by the obligations that the GST places upon them in terms of collecting tax on behalf of the government for no reward. They see it as doing nothing but penalising their business—penalising their cash flow—and we know that situation has prevailed right throughout small business, right throughout Australia.
I had one small business man tell me a couple of months ago, `The GST will break me this week; I am waiting for my BAS return cheque so I can pay rent.' Another said, `Trying to find out real information is like trying to use the help function on a computer; there is no way of asking the questions you want to ask so you can never get the information you need.' Others have said, `We're living in a dictatorship and its main weapon is the business activity statement.' Another said, `I didn't go into business to become a tax collector for the federal government.' Frustration is being felt by the business community, and the small business community in particular. I want to make this very clear: I understand that the top end of town might think this is terrific—the top end of town may do very well out of this process; and, indeed, even medium sized firms may do well—but small businesses are doing it hard as a result of the GST. As a result of that, ordinary Australian working families are doing it hard as a result of the GST.
To have the Prime Minister and the Treasurer walk into this place, as they do, trying to somehow or other deny the reality of what is happening out there in the community in terms of the GST, beggars belief; it really shows no real understanding or appreciation by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer of what is happening out there in real Australia. I have no idea who they talk to, but they certainly do not talk to people in very small businesses. They certainly do not talk to people involved with businesses in my electorate who are suffering as a result of the compliance costs of the GST and whose cash flows are suffering. Some of them have already gone out of business. As I said earlier, the knock-on effects are felt right throughout the Northern Territory economy. 
It is important that we support simplification of this horrendous new tax system, and it is for that reason I am happy to be on my scrapers today supporting the legislation. Even if the Prime Minister and the Treasurer believe what they are saying—I doubt that they do; I know that most people in the government do not believe it—they ought to understand that no-one out there believes them. If they are of the view that somehow or other the community will endorse their proposals about the GST, they are dead wrong. I know from my own experience, observations and discussions with the small business community in my electorate that I am correct in making those assertions.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I wish to contribute to the debate on the so-called simplified tax system bills before the House this afternoon, the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and two cognate bills. The government tells us that the purpose of these bills is to create an optional, simplified bookkeeping and income tax compliance package for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $1 million. The government claims it does this by giving small businesses access to the simplified tax system, consisting of three principal parts: a cash accounting regime, which recognises income when it is received and expenses when they are paid and now allows for the deductibility of prepaid expenses; a depreciation regime which now allows assets costing less than $1,000 to be written off immediately; and a simplified trading stock regime which frees the business of having to value each item of trading stock where the difference between two consecutive years' inventory is less than $5,000. 
These bills make changes covering various areas of the new tax system that have been a cruel burden to honest, hardworking businesspeople like many in my electorate of Lowe. This budget delivers precious little for small business. Even the input tax credit for cars will be clawed back via the FBT rules. Further, the higher gross-up rate for fringe benefits, where a GST input tax credit has been allowed, means that the cost of this so-called benefit will be borne by the states. There is acceptance by this government that small business will have to continue to gather the GST with no recompense whatsoever.
The amendments contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, which came before the House yesterday, dealt with some of the areas requiring change. They were: GST returns and payments; payments of GST by instalments; substituted accounting periods; correcting GST errors; pay-as-you-go instalments; and the deferral of due dates. Those changes, together with the ones contained in this legislation, have come directly as a result of the tidal wave of complaint and argument from ordinary businesses and from people who have been dismissed by this government and constantly lectured on how it was impossible to make GST compliance any simpler.
The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has argued that the time spent having to complete business activity statements has made its members unpaid tax collectors for the government. There are over 15,000 small businesses in my electorate of Lowe, operating from Drummoyne to Homebush West. They deserve a fair hearing. It has only been through Labor's persistent campaign to force this government to understand their concerns that their GST compliance burden will receive some relief. Businesspeople in my electorate from Abbotsford, Five Dock, Concord, Burwood and Strathfield have asked me for these changes. Labor has advocated for them. And this government's reaction? I can tell you that it spent all of last year like King Canute—defying the waves, arrogantly dismissing the concerns of small business people and rejecting these amendments as impossible to implement. The reason for this is simple. This government treats the small business people of Australia like pests—too small to be worthy of any serious consideration.
The Howard government has only one constituency, which it does consider worthy of its attention, and that is very big business. When it has done its favours for the big end of town—the corporate gurus who brought us the HIH and One.Tel disasters and who gave so generously to the Liberal Party election coffers—this government congratulates and big-notes itself on a job well done. This government has been more and more desperate to promote the fantasy, the self-delusion that this was a simpler new tax system that was perfect in every way at birth and so would not require any changes. The truth is that, taking this legislation into consideration, the number of amendments to the government's new simplified tax system—as enunciated by my friend and colleague the member for Rankin, Dr Craig Emerson, this morning in the House—has now reached 1,865. It weighs 7.1 kilograms and it is the thickness of three telephone directories. That is a bloody disgrace. If this is what the Howard government calls simple, God help us if it ever brings anything complicated into this House to debate. 
This litany of taxation amendments is an example of the government's desperate retreat that will come at a significant cost to the budget. These relatively simple changes should have been included in the first place. They will relieve some of the great administrative pressures bearing down on small business taxpayers, who are still experiencing a steep learning curve with all the requirements of the GST—not to mention the costs of paying their accountants for this service. These amendments are admissions that the pay-as-you-go system has made a previously simple and easily understood process more complicated and disruptive for the taxpayers of Australia. This legislation will help ease the cost burden incurred by small business people, thanks to the Labor Party. The new tax system, which is costing individuals and small business people in my electorate of Lowe, will at least begin to be addressed.
Overwhelmingly, businesspeople and all taxpayers in my electorate of Lowe are desperate to have the confusion inflicted upon them by this government, through the obligation of the business activity statement and the investment activity statement, addressed as a matter of urgency. We all know this tax system urgently needs to be made simpler and fairer for all taxpayers. We all know that this government will have to be dragged kicking and screaming to any consideration of the real concerns of small business people and individual investors. If this government had not been so headstrong and hell-bent on ramming the GST legislation through parliament in 1999, many of the issues and concerns addressed by these amendments before the House this afternoon could have easily been accommodated in the original legislation, with a lot less heartache for small business and a lot less damage to the budget bottom line. The small businesses of Australia know that any real fairness and simplification of the business activity statement will only come at the end of the year with the election of a federal Labor government. The Howard government should be flogged. The flogging will be dished out on Saturday, 17 November when the federal election will be held.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—The Howard government is a high taxing government, one that has made an art out complicating the tax system and the tax act. That is why this New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 is unique. It actually simplifies the tax act, and that is something new, something very, very new for this government, something that this government has been promising to do whilst their actions have in fact complicated the act. I will talk more about that later.
The government portrays itself as the party of small business, the party that looks after its interests. Unfortunately the Howard government has been a real disappointment to small business, and I hear about this every day in my electorate as small business operators come and talk to me about their plight. It is a government that has sent many small businesses to the wall and a government that has many more small businesses struggling to keep their head above water. This legislation seeks to simplify the tax system for small business and provide a uniform system of capital allowances for various types of assets. The simplified tax system refers to an optional simplified bookkeeping and income tax compliance package recommended by the Ralph review of business taxation. The STS is available to small businesses, which are defined as those having a turnover of $1 million or less a year. There are three components of this: cash accounting, simplified depreciation and simplified trading stocks. 
Under the cash accounting section, businesses can adopt cash accounting so that income is recognised when received, not when an invoice is issued, and deductions are allowed when the expenses are paid—all very sensible. Under simplified depreciation, assets costing less than $1,000 are immediately deductible, assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for less than 25 years are pooled and written off at 30 per cent per year, and assets costing $1,000 or more and lasting for 25 years or more are pooled and written off at five per cent per year. Under the simplified trading stock regime, taxpayers do not have to account for changes in the value of trading stocks or do stocktakes at the end of the financial year where those changes are $5,000 or less. These are changes that will actually simplify the system and changes that will be appreciated by small business. It is my understanding that the STS has generally been welcomed by small business and accountants and has the potential to reduce the income tax compliance burden where taxpayers are eligible to join it. It will remove a lot of the complications. That said, there is still room for improvement, I am sure. 
This legislation seeks to combine over 37 separate capital allowance regimes, which will offer simplification of benefits, a more comprehensive regime that provides a framework under which black hole expenses can be recognised. These are good things. These are simplifications and these are things that small business will appreciate. These changes appear to be positive and should benefit small business by actually simplifying the act—and that makes a pleasant change. This has been a government that has increased the workload for small business, and businesses have struggled under the weight of change this government has forced on them. The Howard government has forced change after change on small business and left small businesses reeling. I have heard about it every day in my offices. One operator after another comes to see me. I will talk more about that later.
The member for Rankin most ably detailed the government's achievements in this area—the GST legislation, the legislation that was going to simplify the taxation system for small businesses. It was the advent of a new age. Unfortunately, it has not delivered what it promised. There have been 1,869 amendments to that act. Since the legislation was passed there have been 1,869 amendments that weigh 7.1 kg, with the thickness of three telephone books. That is quite an achievement when you look at the purpose of the act: to simplify our taxation system. If that is simplification, I would hate to see what complication was. The tax act before the Howard government came to power was 3,000 pages, quite a weighty document. Now it is 8,500 pages. Quite an achievement for a government that is working to simplify the tax act! It is a government for accountants and lawyers, not for small business. I talk to accountants I know and they are telling me how they are struggling to keep up with their workload because of the fact that small businesses have been forced to utilise their service at a much higher level. The business activity statements have had enormous implications for small business. They have complicated the way small business operates. Small business implored the government to bring about changes, but unfortunately the government failed to listen to them initially. They did not respond to the concerns that small business were passing on to the government. Instead the government said, `It's a good system. We will leave it the way it is.' 
The government has actually changed its mind and has brought about some changes. When that sort of thing happens, I always ask: what is the reason for that? The answer is that the catalyst was the results in the Western Australian election, the Queensland election and the Ryan by-election. If the government had not been delivered the walloping at the polls, it would never have moved to help small business cope with the heavy burden of the BAS, a burden that this government that tries to portray itself as a friend of small business had imposed on them.
This is a government that will stop at nothing to win an election. It is a government that has been noted for its massive advertising campaign. This time last year, we were presented with the Unchain My Heart advertising campaign, which cost Australian taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. Now it is unleashing another advertising campaign on the Australian people which is once again costing many millions of dollars—in fact, $20 million per month. This is not good enough. A lot of this advertising is designed to get around the hurt that this government has caused small business and the Australian people by its changes to the tax act—its GST that has inflicted pain on so many small businesses and so many people within Australia. 
The government designed a tax act that is complicated. It is so complicated that businesses have to contact the tax office on a regular basis. Every time they need information on a particular application and the way the new tax system will affect their business, they have to get a private ruling from the tax office. When they ask the tax office to provide them with a more general response in writing so they do not have to contact them on such a regular basis, they are told that cannot be done because they need to contact the tax office and get a private ruling on all matters relating to their business. There is no broad based approach under the GST. It is certainly not a simple system, and it certainly has done nothing to cut red tape.
This is a government that has complicated the tax system and increased red tape. John Howard promised the Australian people and businesses that he would cut red tape by 50 per cent. Instead, he gave us the GST and legislation that has been amended almost 2,000 times. Yesterday in question time the Prime Minister admitted that the GST was a complex tax. He said, `The GST is not a simple tax.' Small business can attest to that. Small business has been reeling under his GST since it came in last year. But I would like to say that I welcome this legislation. It is refreshing to see this government introduce legislation which simplifies the tax system and simplifies our tax laws.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED TAX SYSTEM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I would like to thank all the participants in this debate on the New Business Tax System (Simplified Tax System) Bill 2000 and cognate bills. The measures contained in these bills are based on the recommendation of the Review of Business Taxation. In summary, businesses entering the simplified tax system will use the new cash accounting arrangements, a simplified and more generous capital allowance regime and a simplified treatment of trading stock. Most of the measures are contained in the second reading speech.
I would like to mention one particular issue that was raised by the member for Hunter during the debate. He raised the concern that a small business with a turnover of just below a million dollars might be reluctant to expand their business as it might mean they are no longer eligible for the benefits of the STS. In response, I would note that the STS turnover test is calculated using the sum of the small business turnovers for any three of the previous four years. The turnover test ensures that a small business will not be required to leave the simplified tax system without warning. This will enable the business to plan for the future. On that basis, and given the time constraints, I commend the bill to the House.
Amendment negatived.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for refusing to dismiss Mrs Bronwyn Bishop as Aged Care Minister:
(1)	despite clear evidence of the continuing appalling treatment of our frail older Australians in some nursing homes;
(2)	her failure to ensure to ensure adequate standards of aged care; and
(3)	her ongoing mishandling of her portfolio, now including evidence of direct political interference in the aged care standards supervision process.
To open my remarks in that regard, if he is suggesting that we are evading the debate on knowledge nation, do not worry, we will be moving our MPI.
—The Leader of the Opposition has leave to speak to his motion.
—The Prime Minister got up and defended his minister—his minister who has been in this place for month after month now evading questions, assigning responsibility to others and hiding behind formulae to render herself unaccountable in this chamber. In the community generally he has allowed concern to develop, including the extraordinary decision he took when he reshuffled his cabinet to leave a notoriously failed minister in place, a minister who gives no confidence at all to those who use this sector. He defends the appointment of her campaign director. She was again deliberately misleading in this place in the way she handled that question today. `Oh,' she said, `he was appointed to that accreditation body before I became minister'—conveniently ignoring the fact that he was reappointed by her to that position. The Prime Minister comes into this place and says that it is a terrible thing that a political party would accuse someone of a lack of independence or, indeed, that someone ought not to be appointed to any body in this nation because they are a member of a political party. He then opened up the tear ducts for the Australian people to observe and said to me, `What a terrible thing that you should accuse us of political influence by such an appointment.' All of us on this side of the House recollect that, when we were in office, the appointment of any particular Labor person to any position at any time brought the most ferocious retorts from him when he was in opposition. 
I agree with him on one thing: if the independence of this body were beyond question, if the relationship between the minister and this body were beyond question, if it were definitely at arm's length, then the particular appointment in this case probably would be irrelevant. But what we have had presented here today and earlier this week is repeated evidence that that is not the case, that the independence of this body is in question and that it has been a convenient thing for the minister to assert that that is the body now in control. Only weeks before asserting that, she involved herself most directly in the nursing home problems that emerged at Riverside in Victoria with a totally different approach to her level of ministerial responsibility—an approach to a level of ministerial responsibility, I might say, that was at least appropriate to the extent that it showed that she would at least, when finally pushed to it after one disaster or another, take responsibility for her portfolio. But within weeks of that, disasters emerged elsewhere, they got lost in the archives in her office, were dealt with sporadically and, when finally teased out in the media, her response in this place was, `This body is completely independent. I have nothing to do with it. I have total amnesia about the way in which I handled these things in the past. I will hold it responsible. It has the authority to act and, oh dear, its particular decision was overthrown, but that has nothing to do with me.'
That is not good enough, Prime Minister, because we have other evidence. We have the evidence of those who have gone through the process of looking at the accreditation of Yagoona; the evidence of those who have said it, `Oh well, don't worry too much about this, there is political influence here. There is political influence here, so don't expect anything too much to flow from any accreditation process, because of that political influence.' And then we have the extraordinary comments of Dr Penny Flett, who is a person who is respectable, a person who has been involved in the activities of nursing homes for a very long time and, indeed, who was chairman of that agency. Did she say that her frustration was drawn from the view that she was standing in charge of a totally independent body and that she was disgusted with this independence that had been given to her and that she wanted some capacity to have ministerial influence or departmental influence exercised over her? Not for one minute. The picture of Dr Penny Flett and the operations of this body is 180 degrees different from the picture presented by the minister in this place as the minister evaded her responsibility for the problems at Yagoona that she accepted ultimately for herself for the problems at Riverside. What Dr Penny Flett has had to say about it is these sorts of things:
The public confidence has been shattered on several occasions this last few months and it has grieved me not to be able to stand up and explain what is behind all of this. The second thing I feel very strongly about, and again now as I am perhaps a freer agent, I think we must all make it very clear, if you agree with me, the agency must be independent. It is not in fact independent at the moment.
Later on she says:
It is not independent enough. And I do not know of any other similar body which has to bear the control that this particular agency has to deal with, so I am deadly serious about that. If I offend anybody I am sorry.
Clearly, one person she offended very considerably in this regard was the minister herself. She offended the minister in what she has had to say about her particular defence, because she strips away every element of that facade. Mr Speaker, this could just be part of the normal argy-bargy of politics, to and fro across the table. These debates take place from time to time in the parliament. Nothing in particular hinges on it all that much; it is a nice opportunity for governments to score points off oppositions and for oppositions to score points off governments. But that ain't the situation here. 
What we are dealing with here are the lives of people and the confidence of people that their parents will be cared for properly when they are elderly. We are dealing with people who are nervous and concerned. They are people who want to know that, first, they have the 100 per cent attention of the minister when there is any trouble affecting one of their relatives who is placed in a home under the charge of the minister. Secondly, they want to know that the home is operating under an appropriate accreditation process which will see that, if it fails that particular accreditation process, then the bed on offer is not there but somewhere else. That is the second thing that they want to see. The third thing that they want to see is that when they are in there they are properly looked after.
In the case of Yagoona and in the case of the person whose parent ultimately died and about whom we have been talking here, there is fair evidence that none of those particular considerations applied. And this was the first item of correspondence with the minister's office two weeks after those tragedies at Riverside. You would have thought that a red light would have gone off flashing in the minister's office and that that light would not have been turned off until the correspondence entered into by the frightened child of the parent had been properly addressed and looked into. You would have thought that, two weeks from that other event, that would have occurred. What happened? It apparently went into some office archive to re-emerge for a noncommittal answer several months later. Then today we see in this parliament a defence from the minister, saying, `Well, for most of the time in the preceding 11 days prior to the person dying, the person was in hospital.' That is her defence.
As I understand it, the concern of the child—not a child, of course, but the child of the person who went in—
—The son.
—The son of the person who went in. His concern was this: he had not been advised, when his parent was placed in the hospital, that his parent was suffering bedsores; he had not been advised about the full suite of medical problems affecting her. That had been suppressed. Point 1: he was not advised. But, more to the point, his doctor was not advised that this was what had happened. The duckshoving of this minister! This minister proceeds first to lumber the blame for Riverside onto the department; she finally took hold of it. Then she has sought to lumber the blame for Yagoona onto the accreditation authority. And then she has sought to claim the accreditation authority's independence, which its very structure belies in terms of the persons appointed to it—her campaign director, for heaven's sake, reappointed by her to that position—and which is belied by a less politically interested person, the outgoing chairperson.
Nursing home organisations like the Catholic organisations are sneered at by the government, evidently because they are Catholic. I heard from the other side, `Oh, the Catholics!'—the Catholics who just happen to provide a substantial proportion of the nursing home beds in this country, but are not the charity of choice, apparently, of our political opponents. `Oh, the Catholics would have that to say.' I will tell you what the Catholics said. The Catholics said no more than Penny Flett. The Catholics said no more than the concerns that have been coming forward from consumers of the nursing home product of the minister's administration. The Catholics said, `There is no transparency.'
The minister in this place is trying to claim that this agency is transparent, there for all to see. Well, that particular transparency has evaded just about everybody who has had something to do with this particular operation. But, more to the point, there are things which are apparent in political life and things which are real, and it is not just a question of the formal words that are associated with the authority that operates in any particular body; it is the way in which that authority is permitted to operate and what people in the process understand of it, and I will tell you what the people in the process understand of it from the evidence that has been presented here over the course of the last week. 
The evidence that has been presented here over the course of the last week is that there is an element of influence around the place, an element of influence in a nursing home— massively criticised by the accreditation agency but owned by a contributor to the Liberal Party—presided over by an accreditation authority including the minister's campaign director. It is not surprising that those responsible for going around responding to the questions that are asked of them should feel that there is an influence at work which means that they will not be able to get an outcome that is anything other than what particularly suits the minister.
We are dealing here with the lives of Australians. We are dealing here with the comfort of the Australian people. We are actually dealing, if you want to look at these issues in their political context and their sociology, with a group in the community which has well supported the Liberal Party in the past. But they have been so deeply dishonoured by this government, whether it be in trying to force them to sell their homes to obtain nursing home places, whether it be in the ripping away of their dental schemes, whether it be in what appears to be in this budget a very substantial black hole in residential aged care, whether it be—and the minister cannot get away with this by reference to the past, because this is a figure that is a comparative figure with the past—the doubling of waiting times for a nursing home bed, then a 10,000 aged care bed shortage, and the offer, of course now infamous, of the $1,000 GST compensation for the elderly, which we all know was a particular promise delivered with plenty of fine print around it.
This government is out of touch. This government says one thing and does another, and nowhere is this habit and the people's experience of this government's habit more evident than it is in the area of aged care, in the area of nursing homes. The government tried to blame the situation that existed when Labor was in office and, no doubt at all, you could point to circumstances, the odd headline from time to time. Compare those headlines wafted around with what we have seen over the course of the last year. It has not been the odd page 8, it has not been the odd page 12; it has been glaring headlines, day after day in certain crisis situations, endless attention, as appropriate, from the electronic media, because they know they have a problem on their hands which is worsening.
That is why it gets that attention, but they also know something else: if you actually want to get some movement out of this government, you will get it in one circumstance and one circumstance only. It will not be by appeal to the political convictions of a minister or the Prime Minister; you will not get it from that. It will not be by appeal to some rarefied concept of social justice. It will not be by appeal to some notion of fair go. You will get action if you place your headline or your television story in such a way as to suggest the government may lose votes. Then what you get from this government is instant action and panic, and, generally speaking, they have been prepared to throw bucketloads at the particular problem. That at least was the reaction we got initially on Riverside. But then there is another mechanism.
Find somebody else to blame—that is the other mechanism. As this minister's story of the responsibility and independence of the accreditation authority began to fall apart, and fall apart dramatically, and as the questions as to why her office did not properly investigate the complaints that came to them about a veteran in Yagoona Nursing Home rose—as those complaints rose and those two things juxtaposed—what did we get from the minister? No longer able to rely on the accreditation authority, no longer able to rely on the department and no longer able to rely on her office, she goes for the New South Wales state authorities and then Bankstown Hospital.
I wonder if Bankstown Hospital was told when the patient was admitted. Certainly the doctor and the son of the veteran were not told—we know that. I wonder if Bankstown Hospital was told about what was going on in Yagoona Nursing Home. I tell you one thing: the minister will not know. The minister will not know because the minister asks only one question: can you give me another piece of paper for a bit of a defensive brief when this comes into parliament? She says, `I know they have had the opportunity to shift me sideways,' which would have been to the great relief of the Australian people as they approach the awful trauma that goes with having to put an aged parent into a nursing home. It is an extraordinary thing that you did not give them immediate relief, Prime Minister, by shifting this minister sideways. She has been monumentally incompetent. She has been monumentally uncaring. She has been monumentally out of touch with what has been going on in her portfolio. 
You can see what happened after Riverside now, can't you? And Alchera: you can see what happened. After she was obliged to do that four-letter word taskwork in the case of Riverside, she said, `For God's sake, get me out of this; for God's sake, get this accreditation agency up; for God's sake, provide me with somebody whom I can blame in such an instance. And give me cover for when the next disaster occurs. Until I've got the procedures properly in place, I will shut my ears to the pleas that come to us.' 
What happened at Yagoona is a massive scandal. It is not alone. You have the Tracy home in Darwin, where patients have been abused. You have the Klemzig Nursing Home in Adelaide, which failed critical standards but was accredited nonetheless. Of course, you have Alchera Park in Gladstone, where the deaths of three vets went without investigation. You have the Hillmont Nursing Home in Sydney, where patients were mistreated. You have a litany of these things, Prime Minister. You were prepared to shift one minister, but you are not prepared to shift this one. And don't go around blaming the situation that you inherited—you are so good at that, Prime Minister. You have had the job longer than most people who have been Prime Minister of this country. You have had this job for five years, and in that period of time the problems in and the waiting periods for nursing homes have grown. We have had phantom beds to defend a phantom minister who operates phantom accreditation rules. But the phantom, I am afraid, conceals a reality, and the reality is that it is harder and harder for ordinary Australians to feel confidence in having their parents go into nursing homes. If you will not act, Prime Minister, the parliament must act by censuring you. Deal with your minister; make her accountable.
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.
—Miss Blackguard. 
—Mr Speaker, I ask the minister to withdraw that remark.
—The remark made by the minister would not normally be deemed to be unparliamentary. I concede that it is not a desirable remark, and I ask the minister to withdraw it to allow the debate to continue.
—Mr Speaker, I withdraw the word `blackguard'. 
—The minister is aware of the fact that withdrawals are expected to be unconditional. I ask him to withdraw the remark.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I have been in this parliament a few years, and I have sat through some censure motions. I have launched a few myself and wondered afterwards whether I should have done so. I have to say that that one, mate, falls into that latter category. It was a pretty unenthusiastic effort, but I nonetheless thank the Leader of the Opposition for being goaded into moving a censure motion on this particular issue, though he originally wanted to talk about the knowledge nation.
Let us cut immediately to the heart of this matter. This issue has been raised in the federal parliament because the Australian Labor Party think that they might be able to get a few headlines out of circumstances surrounding the death of a lady. The death of any elderly person in a nursing home or in a hospital if it is avoidable is obviously a cause of sadness and concern for their family. It is a sadness that is shared as much by the members of the government as it is by those who sit opposite. But the reason that they have lighted upon this matter is not so much their concern at the circumstances of the death but that they have discovered that one of the members of the accreditation body is a member of the Liberal Party and, openly and plainly, a supporter of the Minister for Aged Care, somebody who has been involved in her campaigns in the past. The Labor Party think, `We'll be able to make a huge political beat-up out of it.' That is why they have raised this matter. There is no other justification for it. 
I will come in a moment to the ill-wisdom of a putative next Prime Minister of this country creating the circumstance where there is a growing discount on people getting involved with political parties and a growing sanction on people committing themselves to public life, because they have their reputations traduced and smeared under the cover of parliamentary privilege. I will come to that in a moment; it raises a broader, more generic issue. But let me deal with the narrow, directly relevant issue, and that is: was some undue influence exerted by the minister on the process whereby the recommendation of the assessment team to take away the accreditation was not adopted, due to the decision of the state manager of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency? That is the only charge of substance that can be made against the minister and against me on the information available to me in this case. The decision not to take away accreditation, about which the opposition has complained, was not taken by the accreditation agency. It was not taken by Mr Lang. It was in fact taken by somebody else, who is the state manager of the accreditation agency, under the rules under which the agency and the process operate. Mr Lang, as I understand it, was not involved in any way in the decision taken by the state manager. That is the advice that I have: he was not involved in any way. 
I listened for 20 minutes to the Leader of the Opposition for him to say, `Prime Minister, the minister rang the state manager and told him to do it,' or, `The minister got a senior member of her department to ring him to tell him not to follow the assessment team's recommendation,' or, `The minister's chief of staff rang him,' or, `They got somebody else to ring him,' or, `He got a friend of the state manager to hint that it would be a good idea for his future to do so.' Was any evidence produced of any interference with due process? Was any proof provided by the Leader of the Opposition of impropriety by the minister? Was there any suggestion of a scintilla of evidence that incorrect procedures had been followed? No. They do not worry about that. They think, `Claim membership of the Liberal Party—better still, claim that the bloke in question actually is close to the minister—then state the sad circumstances and, ergo, you have a scandal.'
That is the way the opposition has conducted itself in relation to this matter. If the opposition had come in here and established to me that the minister had interfered in some way with the decision of the state manager, I would have a case to answer and so would the minister. But the Leader of the Opposition did not do that. He spent 20 minutes in just a farrago of rhetoric and bombast and it was completely lacking in any substance at all. It was a hastily cobbled together, ill-prepared censure motion which he had not thought of moving until about three minutes before he got up to produce it, and it suffers the fate of censure motions moved in those circumstances.
That is the first refutation I make of this absurd censure motion—not based on any material facts, not based on any allegations of substance, not based on any allegation of impropriety or wrongdoing, not based on any calculated claim and sustained case of ministerial failure; simply based on, may I say, contemptible slur and smear under parliamentary privilege on a minister who is doing, I think, a very good job in a very difficult portfolio. It is easy to run scare stories in the aged care portfolio, but can I say it is particularly contemptible, because you are dealing with a highly emotive issue. All of us worry about the treatment of our frail elderly parents—all of us do—and there is not a man or woman on any side of the parliament who is not moved by stories of distress and insecurity by the elderly in the community. Nobody in this parliament has a mortgage on concern and compassion about the elderly, any more than they have a mortgage on concern or compassion about the vulnerability of innocent children. 
That, therefore, places a special responsibility on anybody who gets up in their place not to play fast and loose with emotions but to stick to a few facts. On this occasion the Leader of the Opposition has dismally failed to discharge his responsibility, his duty, to this parliament as the alternative Prime Minister to construct a decent case. The Leader of the Opposition dismisses out of hand the obligation to provide any evidence that the minister has in any way interfered or behaved improperly. He takes the opportunity—by implication, if not by direct claim and inference—to smear the reputations of people who sit on this accreditation agency.
I have with me a statement made by the current chairman, Mr James Harrowell. I understand Mr Harrowell is a senior partner in a major law firm in Sydney. He was the managing partner of that firm for some time. Apparently, he is a stooge of the minister's too, is he? He is somebody who is just rung up in the dark of the night and told what to do? Is any person of decency safe from the traducing rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition? Apparently not. Apparently, all you have to do is be appointed to a body and be known to a member of this government, then you have your reputation dragged through the sewers of a censure motion from the Leader of the Opposition. This is what Mr Harrowell had to say on 4 June:
The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is the independent body established by the Commonwealth to manage the accreditation of residential aged care services in Australia. Decisions about accreditation and decisions about accredited services, such as whether to revoke accreditation or to vary the period of accreditation, are made by authorised decision makers within the agency only.
He then goes on, relevantly to this debate, to say:
It is repugnant to suggest that decisions are made other than based on the merits of each individual case by anyone other than the authorised decision maker.
That is from somebody who enjoys a high reputation for integrity, ability, honesty and professionalism within the legal profession in Sydney. But, apparently, that is not good enough! That is the end of his reputation! He goes on to say:
In respect of the decision about Yagoona Nursing Home, the decision to reduce the period of accreditation was made by the state manager of the agency's New South Wales and ACT office, taking into account only relevant matters.
That is the statement of the chairman of the agency. It is a statement that is not in any way undermined by what the Leader of the Opposition has said either in the censure motion or in the questions that he has asked. Once again, his whole case is built on rhetoric, it is built on smear, and it is built on the common membership of the Liberal Party of Australia by Mr Lang and the minister. Can I say to the parliament that is not enough for us in the government, it is not enough, in my view, for fair-minded Australians, and it certainly falls short of the standards required of an opposition leader in trying to censure a Prime Minister in relation to the behaviour of one of his ministers. 
So much for the case against the minister in relation to this issue. There is no case. It is a tawdry piece of rhetorical smear. It is no case at all, and it deserves to be, as it will be I hope, dismissed with the contempt it deserves by the majority of this House. 
But let me in the moments available to me say a couple of things about what has happened in the nursing home industry since this government has come to power. I do not pretend for a moment that it is perfect, I do not pretend for a moment that the government has not made mistakes and I do not pretend for a moment there are not more things to be done. But let me just point out for the House that expenditure on aged care in 1995-96 was $2.5 billion. In 2000-01 it had risen to $3.9 billion. In that period of time we have addressed an acknowledged backlog of about 10,000 beds. An independent review of the aged care reforms was carried out by Professor Len Gray. I assume that Professor Len Gray is acceptable to the opposition. But perhaps my assumption is wrong. Perhaps the fact that he is learned in this field is on this occasion not enough; perhaps he is meant to have some other specialty. But, on the assumption that Professor Gray is acceptable, let me read out the conclusion of his report: 
It is my conclusion, on completion of the review, that the reforms have delivered substantial improvements to the aged care system. 
The aged care system that was substantially improved by this government's reforms was the aged care system over which the opposition leader, as a senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, prevailed for 13 years. Professor Gray continues:
The finetuning undertaken to smooth the implementation of the reforms and address unanticipated anomalies has been largely successful. Consistent with this approach of ongoing refinement, I make the following recommendations that should be considered in the context of the discussion within the body of the document.
He then goes on to make a series of recommendations, and I am told by the minister that those recommendations are being acted upon and acted upon with speed.
This is a difficult and challenging area. The Leader of the Opposition saw fit, in the course of his motion, to talk about the perceived connection between the Liberal and National parties and the aged section of the community. I put aside considerations of who votes for who in a particular age group, but what I do not put aside, as the Leader of the Opposition has drawn my attention to it, is the very proud heritage of the Liberal Party in relation to the funding of aged care accommodation in this country. It was in fact under the Menzies government that the foundation stones, the building blocks, of the partnership that exists between the government, the charitable sector and the private sector in nursing homes and hostels were laid. All of us on both sides of the House will be aware of the tremendous partnership that does exist.
It is legitimate to bring matters relating to aged care into this parliament. It is perfectly legitimate for members of the Labor Party to question the minister or me in any way, shape or form about any matter in accordance with the forms of the House. But before you accuse a minister of a dereliction of duty and you link that with the claimed avoidable death of an elderly lady and before you start traducing and destroying the reputations of decent Australians under parliamentary privilege—before you try and exploit that cocktail of circumstances to your political advantage—assemble a few facts, martial an argument and build a case; do not rely on cheap rhetoric and do not imagine that a few cheap headlines are going to impress the Australian people when they know damn well that you are about trying to win cheap political capital out of an unfortunate set of circumstances.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—The Prime Minister in question time called what we have raised today and on many other occasions over the last year—in fact over the last five years—`tawdry allegations'. Tawdry allegations go to the heart of what we are talking about today. What we have in fact, though, are serious allegations made about the standard of aged care in Australia. That is really what this comes down to. These are allegations that have been found to be true by the Minister for Aged Care's own standards agency.
Let us just go back to these facts—not allegations—about why it is that there are major problems at Yagoona. To quote the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency:
For two years the owner of Yagoona failed to improve Yagoona's standards. She ignored staff complaints about broken water heaters. Staff used pillow slips because of an inadequate supply of continence aids, call bells were broken and there were a large number of skin tears on residents.
These are the issues; this is what this is really all about. For five years this government has had the opportunity to improve the standard of aged care, and now we come to this. That is why this censure motion has been moved today, because day after day, week after week, we keep asking questions about how we are going to see an improvement in the standards of aged care in this country. 
This really came to a crescendo last year when we started asking this minister questions about the horrific level of care taking place at Riverside. These are not some tawdry allegations that were just made up yesterday in some tactics meeting. These are serious concerns that parents have—that of course all of us have, as the Prime Minister rightly said—about the standards of care that exist in our nursing homes. The minister will recall the questions being asked in March last year about whether or not she had satisfied herself about the welfare of the people at Riverside who had received kerosene baths. We asked if the minister was aware whether any of the people who had received a kerosene bath had died. All of us remember the saga that flowed from the questioning that began here in this parliament. Of course, it has not stopped there. We have had nursing home after nursing home where we have found that the standards of care have not been adequate and where the standards agency has recommended the closure of a nursing home but that closure has not proceeded.
This brings me to Yagoona, the nursing home where we know that there are political affiliations and that we know the standards agency recommended be closed and that has not in fact been closed. Let us just get down to the basics of what is happening at this nursing home—to what the son of the mother who died as a result of the care at Yagoona is quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald today. He said, `Yagoona let me down, and I let my mother down.' That is what he said—he feels like he let his mother down; he feels like he has to take some responsibility for putting his mother into this nursing home. What he goes on to say is that he wants Yagoona's owner to take some responsibility. He says:
The people running it should be put out of there and someone put in who cares.
That is exactly what we say at the top as well: somebody should be put in who cares; somebody should be made the Minister of Aged Care in this country who is actually going to improve the standard of care for elderly, frail Australians, not somebody who is going to continually palm off the responsibility of this issue onto someone else.
We have got an enormously long list of the people that this minister has tried to blame for the problems in her portfolio. You will all recall, of course, how it was all the department's fault that the problems at Riverside were not dealt with: it had nothing to do with the minister; it was all the department's fault. Then it was her office for misrepresenting the contact that they had had with the daughter of another deceased resident in another nursing home. Then there is the agency. The agency really has had to take responsibility for most of the problems, certainly not the minister. Of course, day after day, week after week, we have had the minister blaming the agency and hiding behind the agency whenever it has suited her. Then it was the nurses. Remember the nurses at Riverside? It was their fault as well. The providers: today the Catholic providers got it most vehemently, but on other occasions it has been other providers of nursing homes. State governments: not just one but the state governments of South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have been blamed at different times. You name it, every organisation has been blamed. The media: the Prime Minister today blamed the media for sensationalising the issue. Francis Sullivan from Catholic Health Australia—everyone but the minister herself. That is why this minister should be moved on. As Mr Thomas—the son of the woman who unfortunately passed away because of the appalling standard of care at Yagoona—said, that's why this minister needs to move on, so we get somebody who cares, we get somebody who's going to make a difference and we get somebody who will give all of us who do worry about the standard of care in our nursing homes some confidence that things will improve. 
We have had the amendments moved to her Aged Care Act imposed on her by the Labor Party, with I am pleased to say the support of the Democrats, that enable people to be sent into nursing homes to make sure that care is of a decent standard. So why is it that this option that is now in the act has not been pursued in the case of Yagoona? Why is it that this nursing home is still being run by the same owner that was responsible for all the low standards of care that we know existed just a few months ago? We do know that there have been serious allegations made about political donations and we are, of course, extremely concerned about why it was that, when the standards assessors went to nursing homes to look at the standard of care and to see whether or not anything was being done, they were told, `Don't worry about thinking that anything will change around here because the owner has connections and that will mean that nothing will happen.'
Opposition member—Very telling.
—It is very telling, because why is it that, under the Aged Care Act which does enable a new administrator or new management to be put in place, we have not seen anybody take over from the current owner? We have a press release that was put out last November by the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association that said:
The aged care sector was originally highly supportive of the concept of an independent body to act as the focal point for quality improvement for the industry. However, the Agency has become more and more a part of the compliance processes of the Department of Health and Aged Care rather than a free and independent quality improvement body. The department now refers matters to the Agency with instructions on how the Agency will then conduct its affairs ... 
At the same time we had Dr Penny Flett, the previous chairperson of this agency, and she went there with the intention of delivering improved standards of care in our nursing homes sector. But as she said:
The agency must be independent.
And she went on to say:
It is not, in effect, independent at the moment.
Of course, the Prime Minister completely ignored Dr Penny Flett's remarks. He conveniently quoted the current chairman's views but totally ignored the fact that the previous chairperson did not have any confidence in the independence of the standards agency, the agency which this minister stands behind all the time. How many times have we heard it in this parliament, day after day, week after week, whenever we raise serious allegations? These are not `tawdry allegations', as the Prime Minister so conveniently says. People are dying. People had kerosene baths, people had falls and broke their arms and were not noticed, people were locked in cupboards and it was not noticed that they were missing, people got bedsores, had to go to hospital, their doctors not informed and, ultimately—very sadly—people died. These are the end results that all of us have to recognise come from poor standards that exist in our nursing homes. These are real and serious matters that each and every one of us has to take some responsibility for, but in the end there is one person who is ultimately responsible. In the end it is the Minister for Aged Care of the day who has to take responsibility and say, `The system is not working and it is up to me to fix it.'
This minister does not want to do that, of course. She does not want to take any responsibility herself. She wants to say, `It's nothing to do with me. I don't have to worry about it. I can just swan around and go to opening nights. I don't have to worry about what's going on in nursing homes. All I have to do is palm off the responsibility onto this agency'—which we now discover is not the independent agency that it was set out to be. Each and every Australian that has to think about putting their mother, father or other frail relative into a nursing home knows what a big worry it is.
To go back to Mr Thomas and his remarks as he was thinking about putting his mother into Yagoona, as he says, he was unenthusiastic about Yagoona from the start. He said the smell of urine wafted into the car park. That is the standard of care that exists at Yagoona. That is what is happening at Yagoona. But what does this minister do? Does she take hold of the issue? Does she stay up all night and deal with the issue, as we heard she finally did when the issues at Riverside finally made it into the parliament and finally made into the media? We know that she says she heard about the issues at Yagoona only when she read about it in the media. She conveniently forgets about the letter that Mrs Thomas's son wrote to her more than a year prior to that. She conveniently ignores the fact that she was notified about the problems at Yagoona and she did nothing.  
That is why it is time that this minister has to go; that is why it is time that we need a new aged care minister; that is why, as Mr Thomas said, we need to get someone in who cares. We need a truly independent agency: an agency that is not going to be intimidated by this minister, an agency that is not going to be told what it can and cannot do. We need a minister that will act, that will call for reports about substandard accommodation, that will see that new management is put in so that the standard of care in our nursing homes is improved, so that all of us can know that when we have to put our relatives into a nursing home it will be a nursing home with the highest standard of care, not one where the smell of urine is wafting into the car park.
—I call on the Minister for Aged Care.
—Just resign.
—I will deal with the member for Prospect at the conclusion of the debate.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I would like to echo and follow on from the remarks made by the Prime Minister in this debate where he expressed his disappointment at the way in which frail older Australians are made political capital for the benefit of scoring political points. As I go around Australia to visit aged care homes, as I do an amazing lot, and I meet the people who are the providers and the staff, particularly when they get their accreditation certificate and they worked so hard for it, the first thing they say to me is: why do they keep downing us? Why do they keep spoiling the work that we have done? Why don't we get any recognition for the hard work that we have put in that enables good care to be given to frail older Australians?' They hear Riverside being talked about. Let me say that Riverside was the inevitable end of 13 years of neglect. It was a home that had a chronic history of bad performance, and of course it culminated in those baths which contained kerosene. It was a home that was closed—that is, funding was taken away, approved providers status was taken away and alternate accommodation was found for the residents who lived there. As a result of their move to St Vincent's hospital, their health improved. There was a need for that to be done. 
When we come to the question of what had to be done in accreditation, first of all we needed to visit every home in Australia, which had never been done before. The whole story of the bad reputation means that if you mention the words `nursing home' you will see people cringe, because it has had such a bad name for so long. What we did with the system was to no longer have nursing homes and hostels but to unify the system and have a system of aged care homes— with the accent on `home'—where people can feel that they have some control over their lives, where they live in a home-like atmosphere and where the care that they receive is care that is kind and is efficient. After all, let us understand that people who work in aged care are people who are working in the homes of the residents and they have to build a relationship with those residents. It is not like acute care nursing, where the aim is to get the person out as quickly as possible, and they are referred to as a leg or a hip or a stomach or something. These are people with names who have made their home and they need that interaction with the people who are giving them their care, who deserve credit for it. I get so many letters from people who write to me and say, `I just want to say a good word for the home where my loved one is, where the care is good.' Those people are being vilified just as much as the people who are mentioned at the home at Yagoona that the Labor Party mentions again and again. They suffer the same vilification for a political end, and it is not right. 
There needs to be an understanding that the old system itself was moribund and it meant that bad care was being given, and it had to stop. In order to do this, it was worked out that we would bring in a policy of accreditation where we would legislate standards, and those standards must be complied with in order that a home could continue to receive subsidy for residents. The subsidy is very substantial. The subsidy is 75 per cent of the cost of keeping an individual according to their needs. We introduced a resident classification scale, with eight scales on it. According to need, the money is paid at a certain rate. For instance, No. 1 is the greatest degree of dependency. The amount of money that comes from the 75 per cent subsidy, the contribution that the individual makes themselves and other supplements that are paid amount to about $66,000 a year.
If you are in low level care, there is a subsidy. Three-quarters of the total amount is around $12,000 to $13,000 a year and then a quarter on top of that from the contribution of the individual. The government has increased this amount of money. You heard the Prime Minister say that in the Labor Party's last budget, in 1995-96, the total amount that they spent on aged care was $2.5 billion. Under this government, after the budget that was brought down only a few weeks ago, the total expenditure on residential aged care residents will be $4.2 billion a year—every year.
We not only brought in a new system but we put the money in place in order to do it. Then we put in Professor Gray to make sure that he could oversight what was happening with the two-year review. He published a very substantial report, and he found that the reforms are working. We then also looked at the various checks and balances. We have put more money into doing spot checks, because consumers feel safer with them. That is their expressed view. They also like the fact that there are people who come on a regular basis to visit the home. ANHECA checks to ensure that the providers are in fact spending the money on the care that is in the care plan against which their subsidy is paid and that we have people who come in on support visits. They are visits that are put in place in a schedule but they can be varied. There are spot checks, which means instant access to premises, and there are the advocacy groups, which I fund. They are very important because people can feel intimidated. We fund one in every state. It is a body of people who come in and speak on behalf of residents who feel intimidated. They are very important.
Then we have the Community Visitors Scheme. Some people do not have anyone to visit them so we actually fund charities, basically, and churches to go and visit and form a relationship with a resident so that they too have quality of life. What this is about is quality of life. It is about having the best quality of life we can have for people who are in need of care in residential care. And that means people who have Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, people who are incontinent, people who are unable to be mobile any more, and people whose skin has become very thin and who need special attention. It also includes people who need to go from their home to hospital from time to time. I think it was the member for Dickson who asked the most fatuous question of the day when she said: why did Mrs Thomas go to hospital? The answer is: she was sick. And when you are sick you are entitled to go to hospital and have care. The question I asked was: why, when Mrs Thomas went to hospital and was sick with a temperature, was she discharged from that hospital with no care given to her? There was no treatment for her pressure sore. She did not begin antibiotics until she was returned to the nursing home. So then she had to be readmitted to the hospital. That is a complaint I hear again and again. I hear so often that hospitals do not want to admit older people, particularly from aged care homes.
I have another example, which I am referring to a new body I have established—our working group of the Aged Care Forum, who are going to investigate the treatment that older Australians receive in hospitals. The problem is this: this is now winter, and you will hear many a cry from state health ministers saying, `There are not enough nursing home beds. We have got bed blockers.' They want to get the old people out. I will tell you why they have a shortage of beds. It is because they have been closing public hospital beds systematically for the last 10 years— from 1987 to 1997-98—right across Australia. They have closed by a staggering 21 per cent. Then we have winter. We have an ageing population—that is, more older people. They have pneumonia, they have respiratory disease and they have things occur to them that need hospital treatment. But there are not the beds because they have been shut, and the people need to be there more than the 3.5 days that the hospitals like them to be there before they shoot them out the door. They write on their reports: `acopia—can't cope at home'. It might be someone such as we heard of in this chamber recently who had cancer and needed morphine to deal with the pain. The morphine dosage had got out of kilter and it needed to be dealt with in a hospital. Again and again I am hearing this. 
I have a case of somebody who came to see me recently whose uncle went from a nursing home in excellent condition—and she knows because she put the socks on her uncle's feet. He went to hospital for pneumonia. They fixed the pneumonia but, when he came out, there were huge ulcers on his heels and they were headed for gangrene. They were shown to the niece as he was leaving the hospital. She was told, `Do you realise what's happened in here?' It has got to stop. This bandying of older people and using them as a political football has also got to stop. They deserve respect. They deserve to be treated with kindness and with care and with respect for the knowledge that they have. That applies whether you are the most disabled person, whether you have got dementia or because you have suffered a stroke. You are still entitled to the respect of being a human being. That communication can still happen and there is still the capacity for joy.
We have heard the tale that is being told of this place. We have heard of the complaints and we have heard the opposition ask that a home be shut down because the hot water system did not work and because the continence pads were not available. Yet I look at the complaint that was made against the Victorian state home run by the Victorian state government. The agency believed the Victorian state government when they said they would remedy this. The report said that three incident forms reported that staff had found three residents covered in ants, one on 5 February 2001 and two on 15 February. In two cases the residents were in bed and the ants were in the beds and the bed linen. The other residents were found to have ants in their underwear, continence pads and over their body. No action was recommended for this home.
As was quite properly said, this world is not perfect. We are dealing with human beings who are dealing with very difficult circumstances. In Victoria the agency listened to the undertakings of the department of the minister concerned, Minister Pike. They listened to the undertakings that they would remedy this situation and they did not downgrade the accreditation. As I said, I do not think there was any political influence by Mr Bracks contributing to the Liberal Party or being a first best friend of mine. Indeed, Mr Bracks has shown a particular lack of understanding of the need to have compassion in the interface between hospitals and residential aged care. 
I will deal very briefly with the question of the reforms I put in place last year dealing with the ability to appoint administrators and advisers. The power was always there, but it needed to go into legislation which I introduced into this place. There were amendments moved in the Senate to compile a list of people who should be kept, which I readily agreed to because that was the practice. The fact of the matter is that I have 11 homes under sanctions now, and in 10 of them there are either nurse advisers or administrators, and they are there for periods of up to six months. The department makes the decision about whether or not an approved provider, being the proprietor, will concur and agree to implementing the plan which the agency has formulated or whether they will not. We have improved aged care, and it was much needed. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"— Thank you for the guidance and I hope that I can rise to your expectations. The matter that I wish to raise tonight is to do with the Australian Sports Medal 2000, which appeared to be a very worthy initiative of the government during the Olympic year. Regrettably, there has been a bit of discussion about the way in which these have been administered, which in part denigrates the great effect that these awards could have had. I placed on the Notice Paper a question seeking to find out who had actually received these awards and if there were to be a list by electorate. Whilst I was given the number of awards that were presented, I was not given the names of those who received them by electorate. In explaining my concern about this, I indicate that this has been the subject of questioning in the Senate, and it has also been subject of articles in the Age where the question has been asked how in fact these awards were achieved.
This award was set up legitimately under the aegis of the Australian award system. It should be an award that has great credibility. I did not wish tonight to denigrate those that received the award. I think very many people that received the award did so quite deservedly. But, regrettably, the way in which this has been administered and carried out denies the award the proper status it should have been given. For instance, the awards were posted out to recipients, the recipients had no idea why they received the awards, and there were no citations, simply a cardboard box with the medal inside and a certificate that accompanied it. It first came to my attention that this was the way in which they were being distributed when I was contacted on behalf of one of the recipients whose certificate had been ripped. The person was asking how they could get a replacement certificate. There is a famous story that a previous parliamentary colleague the former honourable member for Wills, Phil Cleary, who received an award, had seen the box at his doorway for a couple of days and thought it was an empty pizza box that had been left behind. The boxes—if members have not seen them—are about the same shape as a pizza box.
My concern is that these awards, which were instituted legitimately, should have been of sufficient status that there was formal recognition of the way in which they were to be presented. I am told that in other parts of Melbourne, therefore in other electorates, there were more formal presentations of these awards. That gives me the inkling and feeling that in those places local members may have been provided with lists that enabled them to be involved in those presentations. In the case of my electorate, outside of the ones where I was involved, as were other members upon the invitation that we received in the nominations, I was not told of other recipients. I had local groups contact me to try to investigate how members of those groups were actual recipients of the awards; upon investigation and questioning I was able to find that out. To give some sort of recognition to the recipients, these groups asked whether I would participate in a formal public award presentation, and I did. I saw that as an appropriate way of trying to give proper recognition to these awards.
The answer to my question on notice indicated that these awards would be publicised and that there would be a list. It is now some six to eight weeks since that answer was given to me and there has been no such public recognition of the recipients. I have no way of knowing when that will happen. (Time expired)
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave of the House to move the third reading forthwith.

—I was trying to truncate the debate.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Blaxland was on his feet seeking the call on these appropriation bills. He wanted to speak. I do not want to refuse leave but—
—I thank the honourable member; I know he is endeavouring to assist the House. If there is to be a debate on the consideration in detail, the normal procedure is to go from one side to the other. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration rose to get the call. I acknowledged him, thinking he was going to speak in response to the member for Scullin. He then sought leave, which was inappropriate at the time.

—He is not in order to ask for that.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—In view of the lateness of the day and to facilitate the business of the House, I am not going to have much time to make some of the remarks that I wanted to make on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001. I am quite disappointed that this is the case, because we are talking about an issue which at the moment is very high up on the agenda of what concerns the Australian public—so much is being said about detention centres, how they are being run, the riots and all the rest of it. 
The opposition supports the bill, subject to the amendments that I understand the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will move when he closes. That is, we will agree to the parts of the bill that strengthen the criminal offence of escape from immigration detention from two to five years, that introduce a new offence relating to the manufacture and possession of weapons in immigration detention centres, that bring forward the Criminal Code offence of inciting or urging the commission of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth, and that introduce additional security measures for visitors entering immigration detention centres. The opposition does not agree, and will not agree, to the other sections of the bill, and I understand that the minister will move an appropriate amendment which will separate the sections relating to strip searching—permitting the strip searching of minors of the age of 10—from this bill, to be brought in at another stage. On that basis, the opposition will support the bill. 
Over the past 18 months, there have been a number of riots, disturbances, protests and escapes in most immigration detention centres. Several officers and detainees have sustained serious injuries, and countless dollars worth of Commonwealth property has been destroyed. On behalf of the opposition, I make it very clear that the opposition does not in any shape or form condone acts of violence by anybody on our soil and that we will support reasonable measures on the part of the government to ensure that these detainees—
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—The fact is that these people that are in these detention centres have got an obligation to ensure that they abide by the laws of this country. It is for that reason that we support the general thrust, minus the strip search powers, in this bill. But may I say that this whole area of detention has been the subject of a lot of controversy in recent times. The federal opposition has been calling for a judicial review to look at the allegations that have been made and to look at the way these places are being managed, because in the end we believe that violence begets violence and that forcing more and more domestic laws onto the situation really is not going to help.
If you look at what has been happening, I think you will find that somewhere along the line, as difficult as this problem is, the government seems to have lost control of it. The reality is that a number of reports have come out with respect to these detention centres. First of all, we had the Flood report, which was commissioned by the government. Even Mr Flood came back and said that there were problems in these detention centres. In addition, you then had two reports from the Ombudsman that said the same thing. Only as late as last Monday we had a unanimous—at least there were not dissensions—bipartisan full parliamentary report of the Human Rights Subcommittee. Members of both the opposition and the government came out with a number of what were, in the main, worthwhile suggestions in terms of how we could resolve at least some of the problems that are appearing in these centres.
The Labor opposition supports mandatory detention as a necessary way of protecting the integrity of our borders, and we make absolutely no apology for that. However, we can do it in a more humane way. We can do it in such a way that, hopefully, some of these disturbances do not occur. Some of the recommendations that were made by the committee are very good. When I look at them I really cannot find even one that says anything that is out of the ordinary. Even where they say that they should be processed within 14 weeks, that is subject to a number of conditions, including security clearances, and also I understand the idea is that they be sponsored out into the community. All I am saying to the minister is: do not bury your head in the sand. I am saying to you: look at them. These are submissions and recommendations that are supported even by people from your own side. To react the way the minister did the other day at his press conference was quite inappropriate. In fact, I am surprised that the minister took that view.
I want to finish on this, because I know that at least one other person wants to speak on this bill. There is a fantastic article in today's Melbourne Age. I am sure the minister has read it. Probably he would have been seething when he read it. It is headed `Refugees are not political footballs: trading asylum seekers for easy votes is an abuse of Australian values'. This has been written by a member of that committee, a member of the minister's own side, Judi Moylan, the member for Pearce. I congratulate her, because it takes a lot of courage to do this. If you read what is in the article, it is just extraordinary. I will just read a couple of small parts of it.
—There is not enough time; otherwise I would read the lot. She says: 
The report makes some sensible suggestions to continue to explore the policy options here.
...			...				...
Trying to justify the tough stance on illegal immigrants by deprecating the efforts of members of an all-party committee is at odds with constructive debate, which is a feature of democracy.
She goes on to say:
As we celebrate this year of the Centenary of Federation we are a great nation for which we have a lot to be thankful. We have enough goodwill to treat refugees decently and not allow them to become political footballs, traded for easy votes.
She finishes off by saying:
Those intent on distorting the facts and using refugees, who are an easy target, to score political points do us no credit.
Who is she speaking about, Mr Deputy Speaker? It is not about me. It is not about you. It is about the minister. She is nailing her own minister. Minister—I wish we had more time, and we have not—the opposition will support that part of the bill, subject to your amendment, but I must say to you that this is an issue where you need to look at every possible suggestion that is given to you. The suggestions are put up not for anybody to be smart or to try to score points but so that you might consider them and they might actually help you—in other words, some fresh ideas do not hurt. And when they come from your own side one would have thought you would listen to them. There is a lot that I had organised to say in this debate, but I will keep that for another day and leave my remarks at that.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2001-06-21,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001 is part of a range of measures to ensure that immigration detention centres are safe for not only illegal immigrants to Australia but also the staff and visitors. The measures in the bill will amend the Migration Act 1958 to strengthen the new criminal offence of escape, to introduce a new offence relating to the manufacture and possession of weapons, to introduce an additional power to search detainees for weapons or items that can be used to inflict injury or to assist with an escape, to permit searches of detainees held in state or territory prisons and to introduce additional security measures for visitors to detention centres.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has built many safeguards into the bill to ensure that its capacity to search is not abused. Notwithstanding the view in some quarters—and I am aware that the minister is moving an amendment shortly to separate the measures in the bill—that strip searches are somehow an invasion of privacy, the fact remains that the government cannot ignore the violent and threatening activity of some detainees and cannot ignore its duty of care to detainees and staff at detention centres. We would not want to see serious injury or—heaven forbid—a violent death at one of these detention centres. I draw the House's attention to the list of weapons allegedly seized from detainees at Woomera. It is a frightening list, including toothbrushes melded with razors, all produced from gardening implements and supposedly kitchen cutlery. I commend the minister for the introduction of this legislation and the way in which he manages a difficult and sensitive portfolio. He certainly has the support of people in my electorate.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP",IND,2001-06-21,"—It is very sad that we have only got a limited time to deal with this very important issue. Nevertheless, I want to note in the House that I will be moving a second reading amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001 which states:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House expresses its concern:
(1)	at the absence in the bill of important provisions to guarantee the basic human rights and entitlements of detainees;
(2)	that the bill fails to recognise the criticisms of the conditions of detention centres provided in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Human Rights Sub-Committee: A report on visits to immigration detention centres ... 
I will not read all the other clauses in the second reading amendment but simply say that I am extremely concerned that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has proceeded in the way that he has in relation to this bill. Firstly, he was trying to force through the whole central section of the legislation, which he has now been forced to take out, that has to do with strip searching people and other totally inappropriate measures in relation to detention centres.
The minister is facing the following situation. In the last two days there have been editorials all around the country condemning the minister and the government's actions in relation to detention centres. So it is not just the member for Calwell, it is not just the shadow minister for immigration, it is not just the opposition, it is not just the Democrats and it is not just the Greens; it is society that is now saying, `Enough is enough, Minister. Let's have a humane approach to this matter.' `Our intolerable detention centres' is the heading of the Age editorial, and the editorials from the Australian, the Canberra Times and many other newspapers have taken the same approach.
What is the minister saying? The minister is saying, `They're all wrong; they don't know what is going on.' I will tell you who does not know what is going on: it is the minister. The minister receives reports from officers which mislead him, because these people who are involved on the ground in the detention centres have a lot to cover up. There is no doubt about that, even from what the parliamentary committee revealed. The honourable member for Chifley yesterday, in the Main Committee, said that he would be very happy to release the evidence taken in camera so that the minister, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and society could see it. There were hours and hours of evidence taken in camera about these matters. I spoke to people in Port Hedland last week, and the minister attacked me and said, `You made some of the allegations of these people'—meaning the other side of the story—`public.' What did you do, Minister? You released a video which showed only one side of the story.
 (Mr Nehl)— The member for Calwell will address his remarks through the chair.
—The minister released a video which showed only one side of the story. The minister also allowed stories to be released about detainees being forced into food protests which claimed that the detainees were actually forced into the protest. Then I have a letter signed by 100 detainees saying that no such thing ever happened. So who is getting to the truth of the matter?
But let us leave that point aside and consider this: in this legislation we could at least have had a balanced approach. Rather than the punitive approach that this legislation takes, we could have at least said, `Let's try and give the detainees some fundamental human rights; let's try and say that on the one hand we want to be tough on people who are doing wrong things and on the other hand—
—Order! I am very loath to interrupt the honourable member for Calwell, but I just wondered whether he is aware of the arrangement that this debate will finish by 5.45 p.m. to allow three speakers on the adjournment. You have two amendments to move as well.
—I will just finish with this point. The minister had the opportunity to present some positive things in this bill in trying to at least ensure that detainees had certain rights and that when they have complaints they are properly investigated. None of that appears in this bill. This is a one-sided bill. In fact, the minister should not have proceeded so hastily on this and we should have provided, as I am going to move in my amendment—I will talk about it later—certain guarantees to protect refugee claimants and assure the Australian public that we have got a balanced approach to this matter. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House expresses its concern: 
 (1)	at the absence in the bill of important provisions to guarantee the basic human rights and entitlements of detainees;
(2)	that the bill fails to recognise the criticisms of the conditions of detention centres provided in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Human Rights Sub-Committee: A report on visits to immigration detention centres;
(3)	at the failure of the bill to adopt key recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee's report to improve the conditions in the detention centres, and ensure that the basic entitlements of detainees are provided for;
(4)	that the bill fails to take account of the numerous allegations of maltreatment of detainees, and consequently fails to put into place provisions to ensure that their rights to officially complain about such maltreatment are enshrined in legislation; and
(5)	that the bill, and the second reading speech of the Minister, seek to portray asylum-seekers in a completely negative way, and do not give any recognition for the difficult circumstances which they have endured”.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2001-06-21,"—I would like to thank members for their contribution to this debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001. I have only a few short comments to make because of the undertaking that has been given, but at the conclusion of the debate I will be moving government amendments to the bill. The amendments will remove the provisions relating to strip search of detainees from the bill. These provisions will be placed in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill (No. 2) 2001, which I intend to introduce during these sittings.
The remaining measures in this bill will introduce new offences and penalties relating to behaviour of immigration detainees in immigration detention centres and additional security measures for visitors seeking to enter immigration detention centres. The new offence of manufacturing, possessing, using or distributing a weapon will address the increasing problem of detainees fashioning weapons from materials obtained within detention centres. These objects present a serious danger to detainees, staff and other persons in detention centres. The increased penalty for escape from migration detention seeks to provide a more effective deterrent to escape.
Finally, the security measures for visitors entering immigration detention centres will seek to ensure that items that could disrupt the good order and security of detention centres and endanger the safety of persons within them are not brought in. I am pleased to advise the House that a draft protocol regarding the exercise of this power in relation to visitors has been settled in conjunction with the Attorney-General. The draft protocol will be incorporated into written directions pursuant to section 499 of the Migration Act. It will provide operational guidelines for the power and will be binding on all officers. In summary, the bill seeks to ensure that the safety, good order and security of migration detention centres are not compromised through inappropriate behaviour. I commend the bill to the chamber. I table the protocol.
In conclusion, let me just say that I am not oblivious to other suggestions, and I make that very clear, as I did in the committee yesterday. I will look at positive suggestions which are constructive, but I think that there was, to put it politely, some difficulty in understanding precisely what the committee was getting at. I am told by committee members that the document, as read—that is, the dismantling of mandatory detention—was not what was intended, and that I should have read one clause in conjunction with others. None of that was clear. I tabled today at question time a response detailing the government's efforts to ensure that detention is humane, and I would encourage members to read the level of amenity that has been achieved. I have not dismissed, nor did I in my press conference, the other suggestions that were being made and we will respond fully to them. There may well be further initiatives that we can take out of the committee's report and I do not dismiss that. The argument run by the shadow minister was that the way in which we treat people is responsible for the way in which they are behaving. 
—Well, that is what the member said.
—I said that it was one of the reasons.
—Whether it is one of the reasons or otherwise, it is a humane detention environment in which people are operating. Most people in detention cooperate—let me make that very clear—but we are now holding, as I said in question time today, 1,070 or so people for removal. They have come to the end of the road and there is only one option. You listen to what they put to you—and I do—and you listen to the arguments they are advancing, and what they are endeavouring to do is to put us under duress to obtain decisions they are not entitled to under our law. And it does make it very much harder. I suspect that the committee knew that and I suspect that that is the reason that they have argued that there ought to be a more secure detention facility built—in other words, a maximum security jail—
—The member says, `A good idea.' That is what it would be.
—A high security facility.
—A maximum security facility. Let me just make it clear: if the advice that I was getting from the experts was that you would be able to manage people more effectively if you put them all into one centre and upped the security, then I would look at it. I make that very clear. If that was the advice I was getting, I would look at it. But that is not the advice I am getting. The advice is that, if you bring people together in one place, you have a major problem in handling a large group of people. The states have essentially got rid of maximum security jails and have dispersed the troublemakers because it is a much easier way to manage. That is the professional advice and I accept it. I do not wish to take it any further. I commend the bill to the chamber. I have tabled the draft protocol and, at a later stage, I will move the amendments that have been circulated in my name.
Amendment negatived.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—This evening in the adjournment debate I would like to speak about two related issues. One of them is the issue relating to the government action that is going to affect the National Estate. In speaking to that, I would like to comment briefly on one of the 98 properties in the ACT that appear on the listing of that National Estate. The Tuggeranong Homestead is that very property. It began its development back in 1835. Many people new to Canberra would be surprised with that length of history for this area, but that is the case. It covers quite a substantial amount of land in the Tuggeranong Valley, sitting between the suburbs of Richardson and Calwell. It is an extremely important piece of heritage in the ACT. Over recent years it has undergone a great deal of examination by both ACT government officials and by the community particularly. Many members of the community have been intrinsically involved in the discussions surrounding this property. As recently as in the last few months we have seen just over $675,000 from the Federation Fund being spent on bringing a new lease of life to the Tuggeranong Homestead. Everybody in the local community is very thrilled to see this.  
One of the happiest outcomes was to see the Canberra-Lake Tuggeranong Lions Club begin a monthly community market that has been going for two months. They have had two occasions to celebrate this new lease of life, with something between 5,000 and 7,000 people going through this marketplace in a few hours on a Sunday. My congratulations go to the Canberra-Lake Tuggeranong Lions Club for this wonderful community initiative. The funds they raise obviously go back into the community through their charity and community support efforts. It is a very good thing to see.
When I am talking about this, I simply must draw an analogy with the action by this government that appears to be under way to somehow change dramatically the National Estate and the 13,000 places that are currently listed on it. The National Estate has been developed over the last 25 years on a national basis, and within the ACT there are 98 listings, none of which should be taken lightly. I understand that the government's proposed legislation will immediately remove all of those 13,000 places from the register, leaving them to a very uncertain future. Only a few hundred of the 13,000 places will be protected under the proposed national list, and possibly not for many years. Recently, in the Senate estimates hearings, Mr Bruce Leaver of the Australian and World Heritage Division of Environment Australia gave the following evidence when he was asked how many places he anticipated would be on the new list. He said:
In relation to the places of national heritage significance, there will be none. It will start as a blank sheet of paper and go through a public nomination and assessment process, and it will be progressively built up over the years.
The next question to him was:
You have said that there would be none on the new list, but let us look forward five years or so. What would you imagine we might have on a new list—
He answered:
It is purely speculation, but one would expect that one could deal with half a dozen a year.
I find this very alarming. The National Estate has helped to ensure good representation of places of national heritage importance around this country and I find it quite stunning that that could be put at risk. Some of the places in Canberra include the Lambrigg Homestead wheat paddock and Farrer gravesite—which is where William Farrer developed the famous federation seed for wheat growing; it is down that end of the town— the Lanyon canoe tree, the Namadgi Aboriginal area, the Tuggeranong Homestead, the Mugga Mugga Homestead and the Bogong shelters area. The list is long and very impressive. I am extremely alarmed to think that places such as the Tuggeranong Homestead and other areas around my city and other parts of the country are going to have to prove themselves to get back onto some form of heritage protection list for the future. I have to say that my community are going to be hearing about this loud and clear from me, and I hope that we are able to mount some form of campaign to implore the government to reconsider this action. I would say that it is very short-sighted, and it is open for question by all the community of this country if we have any concern at all about ensuring the future protection of our National Estate and all of those things of value listed on it.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Estate</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—Economic management appears to be this government's claim to fame, and yet they are manipulating the fiscal debate, as well as the real costs of the implementation of the GST and the way that debt has been reduced. How soon they have forgotten Shane Stone's warning about appearing to be mean and tricky. As every portfolio under this government has experienced, the economic miracle that the government claims to have created has come at a great cost and, like all miracles, is hard to authenticate. The government has sold the assets of agencies and the public to pay the bills. But the problem with selling family heirlooms and selling the farm is that they can only be sold once. With the cupboard now almost bare and the only asset remaining being Telstra—which is to be flogged off, as promised by Mr Howard and Mr Costello—the lack of skill and imagination of the government is surfacing.
The government solution to all of this is to blame the opposition for talking down the economy. The government had better start to understand that what they call downplaying or talking down the economy is actually one of the fundamental checks and balances of any opposition. It is called `holding the government accountable'. This Orwellian doublespeak from the government is now standard practice. The strategy from the government is to blame all economic woes on Labor, or anyone else, for simply talking the economy down. But merely pointing out what is occurring in the economy does not create the economy—good or bad. Under this logic, if the government makes a mistake, to report it or to hold them accountable means that you have to have created the problem in the first place because, if nothing was said, no-one would notice and, if no-one notices, then it never really happened. Does this sound like a familiar book to anyone?
This is exactly the type of attitude that led to the collapse of two very famous companies recently: HIH Insurance and One.Tel. Would the government have attacked someone for reporting that something was going bad in One.Tel as merely just talking it down? It astounds me that this government will find any excuse to abrogate their responsibilities in relation to the economy and simply blame the opposition for creating the problem because we dare to raise it. This is a sign of a government no longer in control of its own agenda. With the logic of the government applied to other situations, the more things get worse then the more people should remain silent on the facts or risk, if they talk about it, making it worse.
If people were perhaps prepared to actually talk about things more often, to talk things down, to look at them a bit more closely, and to hold the government accountable, then things might actually change for the better. The government must understand that simply raising the issues does not create the issues; simply reporting the economy does not create the economy. If the government goes out there and says that the opposition is talking down the economy then we should ask: what is wrong with the economy? Is the government admitting that there is something wrong with the economy? There must be because, if there is a problem out there then shouldn't we talk about it? Shouldn't this government realise that and talk about the economy, perhaps in a positive way? If there are problems, shouldn't they be brought to light? I remind government members on the other side of the House that simply talking about the economy does not create it—one way or the other; good or bad.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Economy: Government Accountability</title>,Statements by Members,22,1,speech
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2001-06-21,"—I rise today to extol the virtues of multiculturalism in our society and to warn against the danger that One Nation presents to our diverse society. In this year of celebrating Federation we have the unique opportunity to examine our journey to becoming one of the most unique and harmonious nations on earth. 
The drive for Federation displayed many of the trademark Australian principles we cherish today—values such as hard work, cooperation, compromise and a healthy scepticism of all forms of authority. The political system that was created with Federation reflected our heritage and development at the time. While most of this was positive, it was also tinged with concepts we would now consider negative and inappropriate—concepts such as male only suffrage, and restrictions on immigration based on race. Eventually, the White Australia policy was replaced with a non-discriminatory migration policy and, since 1945, we have seen some 5.7 million migrants settle in Australia. Whenever I am asked to list the benefits of multiculturalism it is easy to reel them off—new customs, new religion, new music, dance and cuisine and the obvious advantage of increased commerce and trade opportunities.
On a broader level, multiculturalism has prevented Australia from becoming too inward looking. The different perspectives, experience and ideas that come with mass migration were like a breath of fresh air to a country like Australia that is so geographically removed from the rest of the world by our distant location. Instead we are one of the most tolerant and cosmopolitan developed nations on earth. But this was not always the case. I know there are many of my constituents in Chisholm with Chinese-born ancestors and relatives who experienced great isolation and prejudice when they settled here, particularly during the gold rush years.  
In my seat of Chisholm over 35 per cent of residents were born overseas. One of the great joys of my job is interacting with the various ethnic communities in Chisholm, whether it be the Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants in Box Hill, the dynamic and well organised Italian and Greek senior citizen clubs in Clayton and Oakleigh, or the emerging population of Sri Lankans in Mount Waverley. It is an area thriving from the benefits of mass migration. The Chinese influence on Box Hill has been profound and has turned Box Hill from a sleepy outer suburb to an area thriving with the benefits of migration. The Chinese community has been heavily involved in celebrating Federation in many other ways with projects such as the Chinese Medical Association's launching of a diabetes handbook or the wonderful functions held for elderly Chinese citizens at the Box Hill senior citizens clubs. One of the things I admire most about the Chinese community is its ability to look after each other, whether it be through the building of nursing homes for people of Chinese origins, the programs the Chinese women's association runs to prevent the isolation that often goes hand in hand for Chinese women as they settle in Australia, the heavy involvement of the Buddhist community in volunteering work, or the Chinese social services located in Box Hill which offer a range of services to the Chinese community.
Our great multicultural and democratic country needs protecting from those who seek to undermine it. Therefore, I feel compelled to raise a very disturbing incident that occurred in Melbourne last month. It has been reported to me by numerous sources and has been the subject of many articles in the Chinese press in Melbourne. At a function in Melbourne to launch a book entitled Melbourne Chinese Stories, a special guest was brought along by a prominent member of the Chinese community. This special guest was none other than the one and only One Nation representative in the federal parliament, Senator Len Harris. This function was well attended by the members of the Chinese community who were horrified by the appearance of a One Nation representative at their function. They regard One Nation as a racist organisation that does not believe Asian migration has a place in this country. One could therefore imagine their disgust when someone who holds themselves up as a leader of their community is insensitive enough to bring along a One Nation senator and, worse still, acts as apologist for his party's views.
The leader of the Chinese community, in his speech to this large gathering of the Chinese community, defended One Nation as a party that was not racist and that was in fact a party that supported Chinese culture. I certainly do not remember hearing anything from One Nation or from any One Nation member uttering any words but those of intolerance and hostility towards the members of the Chinese community. It is therefore hard to believe that this person could have behaved so badly and have so badly misrepresented and misread his audience. So today I call upon Senator Tsebin Tchen, our first Asian born parliamentarian, to explain why he decided to insult his own community in such a public and dishonourable manner.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Multiculturalism: One Nation</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
