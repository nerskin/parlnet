Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1999-09-20,"—I have pleasure in tabling the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the seventh annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum. The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, or APPF as it is more commonly known, held its seventh annual meeting in Lima, Peru from 11 to 14 January this year. I had the privilege of leading a delegation from the parliament. The other delegation members were the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. Margaret Reid, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Simon Crean MP, and the Chief National Party Whip, Mr John Forrest MP. I must at the outset compliment all delegation members for their bipartisanship, cohesion and professionalism. There can be no doubt that the team made a positive impact on the conference and on Asia-Australian relations.
The APPF was formally established at its first annual meeting in Tokyo in January 1993, following earlier preparatory meetings in 1991 held in Singapore and Canberra. It comprises 26 member countries from the Asia-Pacific region. The APPF has five objectives, which are concerned with providing national parliamentarians of the Asia-Pacific region with the opportunity, firstly, to identify and discuss matters of common concern and interest; secondly, to deepen their understanding of the policy concerns, interests and experiences of the countries of the region; thirdly, to examine the critical political, social and cultural developments resulting from economic growth and integration; fourthly, to encourage and promote regional cooperation at all levels on matters of common concern to the region; and, finally, to fulfil the duties national parliamentarians have to further in their respective countries a sense of regional cohesion, understanding and cooperation.
 While the APPF is a relatively young interparliamentary body, it provides a valuable means for the sharing of ideas and the resolution of issues of mutual concern in the Asia-Pacific region. It also complements activities in the region conducted under the umbrella of APEC which will, of course, be of particular significance following events in East Timor over recent weeks. Members of the Australian delegation to the seventh annual meeting participated widely and fully in plenary sessions and led discussions on two key subjects: nuclear non-proliferation and international terrorism. Resolutions submitted on these subjects were submitted by the Australian delegation, debated and agreed to by the forum.
The Congress of Peru hosted the seventh annual meeting. Facilities and arrangements were of the highest standard and matched by the hospitality extended to all delegation members and accompanying persons. I place on record our appreciation of the chairman of the seventh annual meeting, Mr Oswaldo Sandoval, for his leadership, hospitality and friendship. I also record our gratitude for the ongoing leadership provided by the President of the APPF, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. In Lima, Mr Nakasone was unanimously re-elected president for a further three-year term.
The seventh annual meeting was of particular relevance to the Australian delegation because, in the second week of January 2000, the Australian parliament will host the eighth annual meeting here in Parliament House. This is the first time that Australia will have hosted the annual meeting, although a preliminary APPF planning meeting was held in Canberra in December 1991 under the chairmanship of the then Speaker, the now Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Watson. Senator Reid and I will host the January meeting in our capacities as joint presidents of the national group of the APPF, and I will chair the plenary sessions.
While January is usually a quiet time of year in Australia, I would encourage members to consider attending the eighth annual meeting. It will provide a unique opportunity to discuss regional concerns with fellow parlia 
 mentarians from 26 APPF member countries. Although the final agenda is still to be confirmed, East Timor will clearly be a major concern, and I would anticipate healthy discussion both in the plenary consideration of regional security concerns and, equally importantly, in a sense, in the informal networking discussions at the margins throughout the conference. The President and I will shortly be writing to whips, seeking nominations for the Australian delegation to the eighth annual meeting. APPF rules permit the host country to be represented by a delegation of up to 10 members, and other members will be welcome as observers.
En route to Peru, I chaired the meeting of the Standing Committee of Commonwealth Speakers and Presiding Officers held in Ottawa, Canada from 6 to 8 January. Speakers from Canada, Ghana, India, Nauru, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom also attended the meeting. The committee undertook consideration of rule changes as delegated to it by the full conference in Trinidad and Tobago. It decided the venue for future meetings of the standing committee in 2001 and the full conference in 2002. The committee also decided agenda items and tentative dates for the 15th full conference to be held in Australia preliminary to the APPF meeting in January next year.
I would like to conclude my remarks by thanking the staff who assisted the Australian delegation to the seventh APPF annual meeting: Rajan Venkataraman, an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade based in Santiago, Chile, who was of great assistance, particularly in the finalisation of amendments submitted by Australia on nuclear non-proliferation and international terrorism; Mr Trevor Rowe, who was delegation secretary and is now leading the secretariat managing the eighth annual meeting; and Mr Peter Gibson, my senior adviser, who assisted me and played a key role in the drafting of the meeting's joint communique. I commend the delegation's report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum  </title>,Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-09-20,"—Mr Speaker, I wholeheartedly endorse your 
 remarks. It was a very humbling experience and a privilege to participate in the forum with you and Mr Crean, the member for Hotham. Over the last few weeks, as we have all wrestled with what is happening to a near neighbour, I have been thinking a lot about the discussions we had with our South-East Asian parliamentary colleagues. I am mindful of a resolution that we considered at the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum on a culture of peace. It was submitted by the Peruvian delegation—which had some very difficult problems with some of their northern neighbours—the Indonesian delegation and the Thai delegation. The resolution stated:
. . . Urge the governments of the Asia Pacific region to take measures aimed to promote the pacific solution of their conflicts, thus rejecting all forms of violence. . . 
The resolution continued:
. . . Call on all the organizations, governmental and non-governmental, public and private associations, and groups interested in promoting a change in social values and attitude towards peace, to support all the efforts intended to prevent the emergence of armed conflicts, or their worsening, by encouraging the fulfillment of the agreements reached at peace talks.
Having established some personal relationships with not only members of the Indonesian delegation but also many other delegation members, I am mindful of the importance of participating in these kinds of forums, specifically in a region which is of vital interest—South-East Asia, although this forum includes all the parliaments in the Pacific rim. Two members of the Mongolian delegation reminded me that the then trade minister, the Hon. Tim Fischer, had even made his presence felt in Mongolia. They referred to `the man who always runs from place to place'. Those two Mongolian delegation members have been conducting email contact with me ever since, and I think that is for the good of both our nations. It is part of the building of goodwill and understanding that we can share with various mutual interests.
Mr Speaker, there is one element of the forum that you did not refer to. What left a very strong impression on me was the enormous effort that Mr Sandoval made in allowing technology to be available to all members 
 of delegations. I remember making use of that technology and not making one single phone call to my office during the week we were there. I approved an advertisement for the placement of a staff member in my office and correspondence without the need for verbal contact which, with the 15-hour time difference, was very difficult. I was so impressed that I wanted to make sure the remarks from the Australian delegation were recorded in the discussion on technology. This is one of the things that we need to use, and not just within Australia, to bridge the gap created by the tyranny of distance. It is certainly a tool by which we can communicate readily with those nations whose daylight hours are the opposite from our own.
I would like to add my appreciation to Rajan Venkataraman from the Australian embassy in Santiago in Chile. He came all the way to Peru to give us support because at that stage there were no embassy facilities in Peru. He was a particularly knowledgeable Australian and a great asset for us to have in a very important region of the world in terms of market access. I was very appreciative of the opportunities he took to assist me in promoting the export effort of commodities and industries in my electorate.
Mr Speaker, I conclude my remarks by thanking you for your company and your leadership of the delegation, which was an inspiration. I am particularly mindful of the responsibility that is now upon you to ensure that, when we host the delegation in January, all delegates return to their respective countries as impressed as we were with the seventh annual meeting.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum  </title>,Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present a video recording explaining the committee's report Unlocking the future: The report on the review of the Reeves report on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 .
It gives me great pleasure to table for the first time a video of the report of the committee inquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. As members will recall, the report of the inquiry, entitled Unlocking the future, was tabled on 30 August. The video outlines the committee's inquiry process and the major recommendations contained in the report. This is the first time that the committee has produced a video to complement one of its reports.
The video is primarily intended for Aboriginal people for whom English is a second language and who may have found the committee's written report difficult to read. However, the video also has a wider audience, as it explains the inquiry processes and committee procedures. As such, it will be a useful educational tool and, I hope, give more Australians an insight into the valuable work of the committees of this parliament. Once again, I wish to thank my colleagues on the committee for their support during the inquiry. I would also like to thank the committee's consultant, Kathryn Wells, the committee secretariat and others who helped with the video production.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I am very pleased to present the Aviation Noise Ombudsman Bill 1999  today calling for the establishment of an Australian Aviation Noise Ombudsman. For the first time in Australian history, the Aviation Noise Ombudsman Bill 1999 provides communities suffering from aircraft noise with an independent umpire to arbitrate their complaints. Any changes to aircraft routes over populated areas will have to be examined by the Aviation Noise Ombudsman. The Aviation Noise Ombudsman will ensure that community complaints regarding excessive aircraft noise, breaches of the cap and the curfew which are in operation at several airports and incidents of fuel dumping and venting are heard without bias and judged fairly on the merits of the case. An arm's length approach is what is needed, rather than the existing situation of complaining to the body which is itself responsible for those breaches.
People's complaints will go to an independent body which can and will investigate breaches on behalf of those residents. The ombudsman would remove the financial and political interests that have been at play when solving the problems of breaches of curfew, changes to flight paths, fuel dumping and other issues associated with the operation of airports.
My bill is modelled on similar legislation which has been in operation in the United States for three years. A former US Aviation Noise Ombudsman, Mr William Albee, will be visiting Australia in November this year in order to address the Australian Mayoral Aviation Conference, and I encourage all my parliamentary colleagues to take advantage of this unique opportunity to seize the moment and take action with regard to aviation noise and its impact on the community.
If the parliament supports the Aviation Noise Ombudsman Bill it will be a victory for the hundreds and thousands of Australians who live under the flight paths of Australia's airports. My electorate of Grayndler is badly affected by Sydney airport. In consultation with the community, we went through a lengthy process of developing a long-term operating plan which would share the noise. Yet what we had last week was the announcement at a meeting of the Sydney Airport Community Forum that the government was prepared to bat on and introduce a precision radar monitoring system which will lead to a `blank page', as the head of Sydney Airport Corporation put it, with regard to flight paths related to Sydney airport, regardless of the fact that the community has rejected such a move and regardless of the fact that the minister has failed to take action on that.
As well, we see the farcical situation being promoted whereby the solution to Sydney airport needs, it is being said, will see regional airlines being moved to Bankstown. If the government takes a lesson from the debacle in Victoria on Saturday, it is that regional areas cannot continue to be ignored and treated with contempt by this contemptuous government which has a National Party minister as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and who has refused to support this bill up till now.
But this is a national issue. That is why I am very pleased that my bill has been seconded by the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, whose electorate is badly affected by aircraft noise from Brisbane airport. This bill has the support of members such as Kim Wilkie, the member for Swan, and Stephen Smith, the member for Perth, who have raised the issues of aircraft noise impacting adversely on the residents around Perth airport. At Adelaide airport as well airport noise is a major issue. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, aircraft noise is adversely affecting the residents around Coffs Harbour airport as well.
—Not much.
—The Deputy Speaker says no.
—Not much.
—Not much. But I can assure him that the residents around Coffs Harbour think it certainly is, as do the residents around Coolangatta airport. I have called upon the member for Richmond to come out and support this bill and convince his National Party colleague, the minister, to take action.
This is a national issue. It is an issue which must be got right for those people living in the firing line, those who live with the noise of planes roaring overhead after the curfew and with the smell of unburnt fuel which is being dumped over their homes, gardens and schools. The increase in population around these airports in Australia means that the government must take action. We do need an independent umpire. We do need a genuine complaints unit which will enable people to get proper justice and have their complaints heard. (Time expired)

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes the failure of the Howard Government's Tough on Drugs Strategy, in particular, that after two years there has been:
	 (a)	 an increase in drug use, with the average age of first users decreasing;
	 (b)	 no significant decline in the amount of illicit drugs entering Australia, even after a number of high profile ""busts"";
	 (c)	 inadequate funding for community-based programs in those areas of greatest need, particularly the south-west of Sydney; and
	 (d)	 a lack of evidence that zero tolerance policies have achieved anything other than making the illicit drug trade the world's fastest growing industry; and
(2)	 calls on the Government to take a more effective and creative approach to stemming the social tragedy being caused by the 
 increasing use of heroin and other dangerous, addictive and illicit drugs.
It is now two years since the Prime Minister vetoed the proposed heroin trial in the ACT—almost two years since he proposed his response to the drug problem, his Tough on Drugs policy. It is time to review the progress of the Prime Minister's policy. It is time to check the scoreboard to see how his policy is working—not to look at how much has been spent or allocated but to look at the outcomes, the results, of his policy. What are the results in real human terms? Well, we are at the end of the second session of play and the Prime Minister still has no runs on the board.
Let us look at some of the main points of his strategy. What about attacking the drug barons? Just how many Mr Bigs of the drug trade have this government put behind bars? Few, if any. While the government crows about the seizure of illicit drugs in several well-publicised busts, drugs appear on the streets in increasing quantities at lower and lower prices. It is now cheaper to get stoned than it is to get drunk. As for the Mr Bigs, seven out of 10 drug arrests involve users. Dealing for many is the only way they can afford to maintain their habit. With such a highly motivated sales force to peddle their wares for them, the Mr Bigs can safely hide well away from their street dealers. They have a great sales incentive scheme: get another young person hooked and you will have a customer for life.
What has the Tough on Drugs policy done to break this vicious circle? Absolutely nothing. In fact the news is getting worse. Marijuana use by 14- to 19-year-olds has increased from 28 per cent in 1995 to 34 per cent in 1998, with the average age of first time users of marijuana and heroin showing an alarming trend to younger ages. Where does this leave the Prime Minister's zero tolerance education campaign? The few school students caught or confessing to using marijuana face expulsion from schools. They can rightly feel victimised when you consider that more than one in three of their friends have done the same thing but have gotten away with it. Where is the moral leadership here? The $14 million education campaign 
 announced in the government's Tough on Drugs policy is clearly not working. The only lesson children are learning from this policy is, `Don't get caught and never confess to using drugs.'
When it comes to rehabilitation, we see a mixed result. The Tough on Drugs policy has provided research funding for trials of drug based detoxification and rehabilitation. But what has happened since? Despite very encouraging results from naltrexone, the government has backed away from including this treatment in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Naltrexone treatment is beyond the reach of many drug users. They are denied this highly effective treatment because of its cost. But the government does not count costs of crime and broken families that go hand in hand with illicit drug use and it does not count the deaths.
When it comes to rehabilitation, you have to wonder what the government's priorities are. Out of $50 million in grants, all we have seen in south-western Sydney—one of the worst areas for illicit drug use—is $76,000. This really shows the Tough on Drugs policy for what it is: window dressing. I and many others in south-western Sydney keenly await the next round of funding. We want to see if this government is prepared to put funding where it is desperately needed. Or will it turn out like the last round when the Minister for Health and Aged Care's own electorate scored over $1 million in funding.
Then there is the government's Australian National Council on Drugs. According to the Prime Minister:
The new Council will ensure that the expert voice of non-government organisations and individuals working in the drug field reaches all levels of government and influences policy.
All we seem to have is a council which tells the Prime Minister what he wants to hear—the same old approach which ignores the fact that up to 20 young Australians die each week from illicit drug use. The Prime Minister and this government have a closed mind on drug policy. They are at pains to find the smallest flaw in creative European approaches to treatment for illicit drug users while ignoring the total failure of the zero 
 tolerance policies they support. In short, zero tolerance means zero results. That is the progress score that this government gets for its Tough on Drugs policy. (Time expired)
—Order! Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drugs: Strategies</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I second the motion. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the government's Tough on Drugs strategy is not succeeding. Almost every day, there are media reports of drug related crimes, including arrests of dealers, pushers and importers and reports of robberies, burglaries, murders and overdoses. The list goes on. Look at Victoria, for instance. There was a record high of heroin related deaths for the first eight months of this year—200 people died, compared with 187 for the first eight months of 1998 and a low 90 for the same period in 1997.
You would think it would be obvious by now that treating the drug addicted as criminals is not the way to alleviate the problem. But there are still those who cannot differentiate between those who profit from the misery of others and those who are in the grip of an addiction. One term that is often bandied about by those discussing the so-called war on drugs and how best to deal with it is `zero tolerance'. The trouble is that everybody who uses that term has a different idea of what it means. It sounds pretty good: `Let's not stand for any nonsense. Let's get stuck into anyone who breaks the rules,' et cetera. But what does it mean in practice? This theory has its philosophical origins in the US. The theory is that, just as a broken window is a sign that nobody cares and leads to more property damage, minor incivilities such as begging, vandalism, public drunkenness and graffiti, if unchecked and uncontrolled, produce an atmosphere in a community in which more serious crime will flourish. Over time, individuals may feel that they can get away with minor offences, and this leads them to commit more serious offences. Thus—taking drugs as an example—if you are not tough on minor offenders they will become more serious offenders.
The most frequently quoted zero tolerance policing is the New York experience, where 
 aggressive order maintenance is, for many, its main characteristic. But the situation is not that simple. Behind the slogan of zero tolerance, there are other policies and strategies in place in New York. Lower incidences of crime in recent years are not just a result of zero tolerance policing but of a diversity of causes including sustained economic growth and the changing nature of the drug market in that period.
You cannot just lift a slogan from the US and expect it to apply in Australia. But in Sydney the slogan is being used by politicians and others as if it is a desirable and workable method of policing in the Australian situation. We have to ask ourselves, `Does it work?' If recent experience is any guide, I do not think it does. Look at the reports of brutal crimes that we continue to hear about, the drug hauls and overdoses. Even in the face of aggressive policing, those involved in criminal activities associated with drugs are prepared to continue their lives of crime. Jailing addicts does not solve the problem; it just removes them from one side of the equation to the other. Instead of being in the community as users, they are locked up for a while. In fact, with heroin use the evidence is that most people, if they survive, tend to come off the drug after 10 to 12 years when their life circumstances change and they actually want to come off the drug. So we need to help them survive. Drug addiction is like legal addictions such as alcohol and tobacco. You only get off the drug if you want to get off the drug. You cannot force the addicted if they do not really want to stop using. Jailing them certainly does not stop them wanting to use or, indeed, using it if they can get supplied while in jail.
Recently there has been a lot of discussion about safe injecting rooms. For the zero tolerance proponents to refuse to allow safe injecting places is a classic case of a head in the sand attitude. Drug addicts exist. We may not like that fact, but it is a fact. The point is that intravenous drug use happens, often unsafely. Surely, if we can provide a safe environment for users it is better than having them die—because that is what will happen: they will die. Sooner or later they will die. At least if addicts come to a safe place we have 
 some chance of monitoring their intake and providing them with assistance. We have a chance of offering help to stop, but if we send them underground there is no chance of helping them.
Of course, that all costs money. But, quite apart from a lack of funding for effective programs, under the current government it is harder to get those programs through. In addressing the issue of drug abuse, we need courage and compassion. As one youth consultant has described it:
Drug use is the anaesthetic to the young addict's poverty of hope.
It is a symptom and not the cause of youth pain. Politicians and policy makers need to be willing to learn and understand. We need to see more of the attitude of the Sisters of Charity, about compassion.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—The drug debate is rarely a sane pursuit and I would not describe the discussion we are having here as really a debate. In fact, it is a facile, superficial and politically charged discussion about one of the most complex issues that faces humankind. Shortly before his death in 1968, Robert Kennedy reminded us of the words of the Greek dramatist, Aeschylus, who said: `In our sleep pain that cannot forget falls, drop by drop, upon the heart and in our despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of god.'
Wisdom was not a word that sprang to mind when I read the motion that is on the Notice Paper. The motion and the way in which it is worded misunderstands the nature of the drug problem and what might reasonably be done about it. How do we measure success or failure? Do we measure it in terms of the number of people that are using drugs and the number of people who die from the use and misuse of drugs? And there are the disease rates. For example, if we look at the contraction of hepatitis C in the state of New South Wales, we might reasonably say we are starting to turn the corner. Do we look at the prevalence of drug use, as the member for Fowler intimated? Do we look at the types of drugs that are being used or at the age and 
 socioeconomic profiles of those who are using them and perhaps are dying from their use?
The motion suggests that in some way the Prime Minister and the government have failed after two years of the Tough on Drugs strategy and policy. That misunderstands two things. The first is that this is a bit like foreign aid. We are going to spend nearly $1.6 billion on foreign aid, but poverty will continue and people will continue to die. We do not say that we have failed and therefore we should abandon the program.
The second point that ought to be made in relation to that is that Tough on Drugs was announced late in 1997 and the first tranche of money started to flow early last year. The second tranche, of course, is embedded in the 1999-2000 budget. The figures which I presume that the member for Fowler was referring to are based on the national household drugs strategy survey which was conducted late in 1998 under the auspices of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. If I wanted to politicise this debate, I would suggest that those figures actually reflect a decade or perhaps even 20 years of the drug policy which preceded the conduct of the survey.
If we really want to have a look at what the government is actually doing, we will see that the government has announced a $500 million package over four years which is titled Tough on Drugs. That might not be everybody's preferred title but, to put that into context, when I was President of the Australian Medical Association I had the most enormously difficult job of trying to convince the then Labor government to put on cigarette packets the health warnings that we now see. By the way, cigarettes are killing 54 Australians a day and illicit drugs are currently killing one every 10 hours, not that that in any way excuses it or diminishes the importance of the issue.
Under Tough on Drugs we have a number of strategies. One is more police, more sniffer dogs and strategic task forces and those things that have police working with international policing agencies. But we also have prevention, education and community based initiatives. For the first time individual communi 
 ties actually have resources that they can access to put together antidrug strategies that they think are appropriate to their area: detoxification and rehabilitation programs and research. Also, of course, under Tough on Drugs we are continuing methadone maintenance and needle exchange programs, not things with which all members of the House feel uncomfortable.
Tough on Drugs can mean lots of things to lots of people, depending on where they are coming from. As the CEO of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, David Crosby, who is no flag waver for the government, remarked after the last round of funding:
I find it quite moving to look through the list of programs that are to receive funding under this initiative, programs for Aboriginal people, young people, people who suffer mental illness and women with children. Many of these people currently don't have access to appropriate drug treatment programs. Now at least they will have a chance to change.
The real debate we ought to be having is: what is it that is breeding a sense of despondent disillusionment amongst young people in the present and a sense of forlorn hopelessness in terms of the future? If we are going to have a debate about drug use, we have to go, despite our economic indices of which we are so proud, to what is driving an unprecedented level of drug use in our community. I say to the member for Fowler: if you are really concerned about drug use, fight that $100 million hotel complex in Liverpool.

"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—There is a great deal that the government is doing and there is a great deal that individuals can do to combat the problem of illicit drugs through the Tough on Drugs program. It is important to appreciate that the community and parents also have to take responsibility for the drug problem and for their children.
Members may be interested to know that in my electorate of Makin the local community has done a great deal of work to involve the police, service clubs, schools, local governments and state and federal community agencies with the government's Tough on Drugs program. Through 1997 and 1998, in 
 cooperation with the local police, I have sponsored information evenings for parents of school age children to discuss the illicit drug problem. Also, in cooperation with Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, I organised a Tough on Drugs competition for students to design a drug education project which could be integrated with existing school initiatives within the health curriculum. In other words, as a federal member of parliament I was interested in the viewpoints of our youth and what strategies they might employ to effectively communicate, to work collaboratively with and to educate people on the dangers of drug abuse and misuse.
The winning entry, from Salisbury East High School, was a board game called `Choices' in which players were rewarded for knowledge about the dangers associated with illicit drug use and were presented with hypothetical situations from which they could select a range of responses. These are some of the ways in which a member of parliament can work to promote a positive and proactive message on combating the drug problem within their local electorate. While these are the strategies that I employed, I am aware that there may be other ideas which could work even better in specific electorates.
I turn to the subject of what the government is able to do about illicit drugs. This is a matter to which the government has given a very high priority. This motion refers to there being no significant decline in the amount of illicit drugs entering Australia, even after a number of what it refers to as `high profile busts'. The members opposite must surely be aware that this is not the way in which this kind of thing works. The success that we have had in recent times will take time to have an effect on the ground. Any single bust will not significantly decrease the amount of drugs available on the streets. However, over time and with more of this kind of success, a message will be sent to the drug dealers and the drug barons that Australia is not as safe a place as it used to be for their dreadful business.
Perhaps even more important than these operations are the rehabilitation and education aspects of our Tough on Drugs program. 
 Arising out of the Council of Australian Governments meeting earlier this year, the federal government is providing resources to support the states in setting up drug courts and similar arrangements whereby people who are brought before the courts on drug related offences will be given the option of entering a rehabilitation program rather than serving time for their offences. This is a very important and constructive way of helping people to break the cycle of drug dependency and crime—two things which we know have gone very closely hand in hand in the past. In our ongoing battles to make inroads into our crime problem and our drug problem, this kind of circuit breaker will prove to be a very powerful tool.
The government is also instituting a National Schools Drug Education Strategy. In May of this year that strategy was released, after being submitted to the government in March. In the interim period we had the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, which I have already referred to, in which $220 million in extra funding for the Tough on Drugs program was added to what had already been allocated, bringing the total federal government resources devoted to the Tough on Drugs program to over half a billion dollars. The goal of the National Schools Drug Education Strategy focuses on the prevention of drug use through enhanced educational programs and strong educational outcomes. This will be complemented by the initiatives announced by the Council of Australian Governments which focus on early intervention and referral. It is the first time we have had a national, coordinated approach to drug education in our schools, and it will form an important part of our Tough on Drugs strategy. In the short time that I have had available, I hope that I have been able to outline some of the positive initiatives that the government has undertaken in response to this very important issue.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drugs: Strategies</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I rise today to support the motion on a drugs strategy from my colleague the member for Fowler and to add a Victorian perspective to the motion, which is focused on a problem which, whilst based in New South Wales, is 
 actually a nationwide problem. The use of illicit drugs, particularly in my electorate in the inner western suburbs of Melbourne, is becoming more and more visible rather than less visible. The sight of people injecting in car parks and quiet areas around my electorate, particularly in the CBD of Footscray, is common and is becoming an increasing problem for businesses and the community. I must add here that, although Gellibrand and Footscray is one of the hot spots, if you like, for heroin use, and certainly for the very public heroin use, it is actually one of a number of areas across Melbourne's suburbs that are suffering a similar problem. We have seen over time that the government's Tough on Drugs strategy has not been delivering results for the people who have found themselves in the unfortunate situation of being attracted to and using addictive drugs.
Gellibrand also has a number of other problems which may be related to this higher drug use. It is one of the areas of highest unemployment in metropolitan Melbourne, it has the most poorly resourced schools and it has some of the lowest educational levels as well as some of the lowest income levels across Melbourne.
We need a creative response to this desperate problem. People are still dying from overdoses and the Tough on Drugs strategy has not been able to stem the tide of overdose deaths. In Victoria, heroin related deaths in 1993 were 59 for the whole year; in 1998 we had 268 deaths. This is something that we cannot just turn a blind eye to. I have stood in this parliament previously and pleaded with both the Kennett and Howard governments to take urgent action on this issue. We need to be looking at harm minimisation policies. We cannot simply say that our preference is for there to be zero drug use. Whilst we all in this House could agree with that, we do not, I think, accept that it is an immediate reality.
A group of local traders in my area of Footscray have begun some action to clean up the Footscray area to get rid of heroin users and activities which they see as having a very negative effect on their business. I do understand their frustration, but unfortunately this group has concentrated its efforts on getting 
 rid of the local needle exchange program, which is one of the few programs which is actually providing health and safety advice, clean needles and some support. For some of the users using that needle exchange, it is the only contact and access point that they have potentially with counsellors and it is an entrance point for them into detox programs. We are finding, particularly with the Kennett government's refusal to address this issue, that those people who approach the needle exchange for assistance, for extra counselling or for access to detox and rehab are being refused that.
What we need is a progressive and creative approach to the drug problem. Labor went to Saturday's state election in Victoria with a policy to consult with the community about the establishment of five safe injecting rooms for heroin users and with a comprehensive policy on how to deal with this issue compassionately. As the member for Bradfield on the other side of this House has said, we need to deal with issues of prevention and education in a compassionate and thoughtful way. Unfortunately, Jeff Kennett's proposals were to ignore the issue and to stick with the Howard government's view of zero tolerance.
—That's right, and look what has happened to Kennett.
—And look what has happened to Kennett, as my colleague says. We have seen the results of trying to turn a blind eye to a problem which is a massive community problem. The community has said to Jeff Kennett in Victoria—and it is something that John Howard, our Prime Minister, should heed as well—that you cannot turn a blind eye to these serious problems. It is not sufficient to say, `Politically it is unattractive and we will not deal with these complex issues, we will not offer some suitable, sensible and compassionate answers to a problem that we are all struggling with.'
Labor's policy in Victoria is to look at five proposed safe injecting rooms, one that would probably be in my electorate in Footscray, the others in Springvale, St Kilda, the city and Collingwood. These would need community consultation and approval before they were introduced, and they obviously need to be in 
 existence in a number of places so that one area does not become a honey pot, as people often put it, for drug users.
Labor's approach to illicit drug use and this motion are a compassionate and sensible approach about trying to deal with an intricate problem. It is not just a problem for young people, although they are often the most visible and the most vulnerable and are often on the streets. We cannot just educate kids in our schools. It is often the people who are out of schools who are the ones who are attracted to drug use, and we need to be providing support through a variety of methods, including safe injecting rooms, if that can help save lives.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—Since coming to power in 1996, the Howard government has been distinguished not just by its good economic housekeeping, which has thus far enabled us to weather the economic meltdown in Asia; it has also shown an old-fashioned concern with moral values. It has shown this in the strong standards taken to limit the ownership and accessibility of high-powered automatic firearms in the community in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. It has shown this in doing what the Prime Minister, John Howard, has called the `right thing' by taking the leadership on East Timor in the international community. For, contrary to what Margaret Thatcher once said, there is indeed a society and we have to work hard to nurture it.
Licit and illicit drug taking undermines society in the most palpable and fundamental of ways. The economic and social costs of drug taking are enormous. It is estimated by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that in 1997 there were over 22,000 drug related deaths and more than a quarter of a million hospital episodes. The licit drugs—tobacco and alcohol—accounted for over 96 per cent of the drug related deaths and hospitalisations. The estimated direct health care costs of drug dependence and harmful use in Australia in 1992 were $1 billion—$833 million for tobacco, $145 million for alcohol and $43 million for illicit drugs. The economic cost associated with the prevention and treatment of drug related illness, loss of 
 productivity in the workplace, property crime, theft, accidents and law enforcement activity has been estimated to be in excess of $18 billion. Almost 67 per cent of this is attributable to tobacco use, 24 per cent to alcohol use and about nine per cent to illicit drug use.
The 1993 national drug strategy replaced the Labor government's national campaign against drug abuse as a result of evaluations suggesting that there was need for improved strategic direction and closer cooperation between agencies responsible for law enforcement and health. The basis of the strategy is to minimise the harmful effects of drugs and drug use in Australian society. In 1997 Professor Eric Single from the University of Toronto and Professor Rohl from the Australian Institute of Police Management evaluated the national drug strategy. Their report, released in July 1997, concluded that Australia's national drug strategy is recognised as one of the most progressive and respected drug strategies in the world.
Contrary to what the mover of this motion would put in here, Mr Deputy Speaker, and contrary to the suggestions made by the member for Gellibrand, who spoke before me in this debate, the Tough on Drugs strategy is not and never has been a zero tolerance policy comparable to the policing strategy used to clean up New York and also evidenced in the `two strikes and you're out' policing policy in the Northern Territory. It is a total misnomer to call it a `zero tolerance' policy. This would suggest that criminal penalties rather than education, treatment and rehabilitation are the guiding force of the policy. The only areas where the drug strategy is asserting that there should be no tolerance is in the encouragement of drug taking in schools and in the dealing in drugs.
I quote the federal health minister, who said in February of this year:
I have talked about zero tolerance in schools, I have talked about zero tolerance to people who are dealing and profiting from drugs, but our approach to people who use drugs has always been one of tolerance. And if you have a look at the practicality of what we have funded, what we have done, what we have done in my portfolio in the last two years, it is a highly tolerant approach, one that is based on 
 treatment, rehabilitation, education and where appropriate, the reduction or minimization of harm.
The Howard government's Tough on Drugs strategy is to quote the Chief Executive of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, who said it was, `the first time any government in Australia has made such a significant financial commitment to reducing the level of drug related harm in Australia.' No-one in this debate, no-one in this place, can pretend that there are quick fixes to this problem. The Howard government has demonstrated on this issue, as on others, that it can assume a leadership role. The national drug strategy has four years to run its course. In the meantime, the government is showing its commitment and resolve to reducing the harm being done to individuals and to society as a whole by drug taking, both licit and illicit. It should be commended for that. The opposition offers no credible fixes, only cheap shots.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—Rather than being tough on drugs, the Prime Minister's strategy seems to have been tough on everything but: tough on addicts, tough on their families and carers and tough on those communities that, with minimal funding, are trying to find solutions to this national crisis. I was recently speaking to a leading drug and alcohol researcher about the current situation, and lost count of the number of state, Commonwealth, state-Commonwealth, private, public, charity, statutory and non-statutory bodies and committees referred to as currently advising the Prime Minister and his Minister for Health and Aged Care. Given the confusion that this variety of advice and numerous agendas must create, it is little wonder that the simplistic strategy of zero tolerance has dominated drug policy.
The opposition has made clear in its illicit drug strategy that the diverse views on tackling drug problems, together with the diverse needs of drug users, their families and their communities, require the establishment of a national coordination unit. Drug policy must be formed as a result of consensus and partnerships amongst all groups, organisations and individuals who are touched by illicit drug use. One of the major challenges facing drug 
 policy makers is the diversity of needs and treatment approaches required to help addicts. Meeting this challenge requires creativity and bravery and is by no means impossible. Just 20 years ago, a person suffering from depression had few treatment choices. Now they have access to a wide range of medical and non-medical treatments, and support can be tailored to meet their variety of symptoms, backgrounds and quality of life requirements. Why, then, are our addicts, who often suffer from mental illness, left with so few choices? Why is this government's policy so one-dimensional?
When a Boeing 747 carrying 300 passengers crashes, it is a tragedy that makes the front pages of the newspapers and requires immediate investigation and action to prevent further tragedies. So far this year, more than 600 Australians have died from heroin overdoses alone—that is equivalent to two full 747s, yet where are the front pages and where are the inquiries?
No-one would argue that preventing the supply of illicit drugs in Australia is crucial to the success of any drug policy, but it is only one piece of a very complex puzzle. Such a strategy must be supported by demand reduction and, most importantly, by harm reduction. The major aim of any policy must be to keep addicts alive long enough for them to choose to detoxify or until a cure to their addiction is found.
People with experience in HIV treatment will tell you that they have had to experiment with many types of medical and non-medical treatments and counselling to get to the point that we are at now. Addicts deserve to have access to as many medical and non-medical treatment options as possible and, as unsavoury as they may be to the conservative elements of our society, those treatments may well include trials of safe injecting rooms and the supply of other pharmaceutical drugs which are also addictive.
My colleagues have already pointed out that the last two years of the government's policy has resulted in an increase    in drug use and in drug related deaths, and there has been no significant decline in the amount of illicit drugs entering Australia. The government's 
 Tough on Drugs stance has been strong on rhetoric but short on delivery. The effort that went in to promoting the announcement of funds for new treatment programs has not been followed up with effort to get those programs working. There is very little information available about the state of play, but I understand that many of these projects are still in the pipeline, waiting for the resources and the people to get the service under way. A particular problem has been the lack of trained staff to run a properly structured program.
There are no guidelines and accreditation standards. Rehabilitation is a difficult task, and there are many lessons to be learned from the successes and failures of the past. It is not good enough for the government to say, `Here's some money; that's the end of our responsibility.' The Prime Minister's promise was that an additional 300,000 drug addicts would be able to access treatment as a result of these grants. There is little evidence that this target is realistic or that the government has taken the right steps towards achieving it. To date, the single achievement of this strategy has been to validate the failure of the zero tolerance policy we adopted from the US. But all is not lost—perhaps other countries will take note and will not repeat this mistake at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our society.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drugs: Strategies</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1,speech
"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,1999-09-20,"—It has been interesting to listen to both sides of the debate on this most important issue. It comes to my mind that, over many years, we have developed a society that rewards failure instead of success. The drug problem in Australia has not turned up overnight; it has been coming for quite some period of time. It was here for the 13 years that the Labor Party was in government.
The Tough on Drugs program is an integrated three-pronged approach which has already allocated $295 million to tackling the drug problem in Australia head on. The first $170 million was set aside to provide law enforcement agencies with the extra resources they need to protect our borders—a huge task when you consider the size of our nation and its water border. These include improved 
 analysis and examination facilities at all airports, and particularly at Sydney airport; greater coastal surveillance of the Torres Strait by increasing our night and marine surveillance and helicopter flying hours; purchase of three new vessels for the Customs Service, which needs proper and appropriate vessels to intercept these drug importers; state-of-the-art mobile X-ray units to search trucks and transporters on our national highways—there is no doubt in my mind that the influence of illicit drugs in the transport industry is well and truly to the fore; and, better communication and use of information technology communication between law enforcement agencies.
Secondly, more funds have been provided to educate young people and the wider community about the extreme dangers of drugs. Drugs have no place in the lives of our young people. We must continue to communicate and to talk to our young people about the dangers of drugs, as I do with my four children, most of whom have grown up. It is a continual topic, one that needs to be reinforced every day in the home. I repeat: drugs have no place in the lives of our young people. Around $44 million has been devoted to school and community drug education strategies.
Educating children and the wider community about drugs is a vital part of the Tough on Drugs strategy. It involves sending a strong message to the community that drugs will not be tolerated on school premises, and we have seen results from that. We have also read some of the policies and attitudes of some schools towards drugs and drug taking. At the same time, we need to ensure that those children who need help and support receive it. The federal government will provide additional resources to increase the capacity of schools and school communities to respond to illicit drug use, and it will develop national protocols to help school communities cope with drug use and possession.
Thirdly, while it is up to all of us to be tough on drugs, we must help the victims of drugs. This government is well on the way towards establishing a national drug treatment network across our cities and rural centres, 
 with the allocation of almost $77 million to bring treatment and support within the reach of those who need it and to fund and to disseminate research into drug addiction. The first part of funding was announced in November 1997. Has this program been working? The motion states that there has been `no significant decline in the amount of illicit drugs'. It is interesting to note that, with the proper resources this government has given to patrolling our borders, federal agencies have seized 565 kg of heroin in seven months, which is five times the average of 113 kg seized in each full year between 1990 and 1996 under the Labor government.

"Gerick, Jane, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—Today I want to pay tribute to the life of John Wright, who lived in Armadale in my electorate. John died just a few weeks before he was to celebrate his 90th birthday. John was a long-time member of the Australian Labor Party and had been a member of the Labour Party in England. He was someone who lived by his philosophy and quietly went about achieving the ideals he held. For those of us who were members of the Armadale branch, he offered us encouragement, advice and assistance. We all miss him very much.
At the last branch meeting he attended three years ago, he was still highlighting the success of miners in his home town in England who had saved their workplace. He never stopped caring about politics and was passionate about the environment. When I saw him just a few weeks before he died, he gave me a list of books I should read so that I would be an effective representative.
John's great pride was his family, and we were told constantly of their achievements. They can feel great pride in the way they cared for him until the end. My sympathy 
 goes to his family, and I am pleased that I had the opportunity to know him over the past eight years. We admire the standards he set for us to follow.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,"<title>Wright, Mr John</title>",Statements by Members,4,1,speech

Are you aware of the assessment by the International Red Cross that East Timor has basically been destroyed, that several hundred thousand East Timorese are internally displaced, and that a further 200,000 have fled or been forcibly removed to West Timor and neighbouring islands? Are these figures consistent with Australia's own assessment?
—Can you repeat the figures?
—Several hundred thousand East Timorese have been internally displaced and a further 200,000 have fled or been forcibly removed to West Timor and neighbouring islands.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—I thank the honourable member for his question. It is difficult to know the number of internally displaced people both in East Timor itself and in West Timor—and remember there are some others who in the very early days straight after the ballot were shipped beyond the island of Timor altogether, some apparently to Irian Jaya; some to, one might say ironically, to Ambon; and some to other parts of Indonesia. It is clearly very difficult to know what the figures are. We were having a discussion in my office not half an hour ago about these numbers and trying to estimate the number of internally displaced people in West Timor. The figures range from as high as 270,000, which is a figure that has been produced by the Indonesia military, by TNI. There are some NGOs, though, who think that TNI has 
 done some double counting and the figure may be nearer to 150,000, but it is very hard to say.
Whilst we are obviously endeavouring to assess the number of internally displaced people in East Timor and from East Timor, it is extremely hard to get an accurate figure. I think that for both East Timor and West Timor 200,000 would probably be too low and 300,000 might be reasonably closer to the mark. Obviously, we will keep monitoring that. We are happy to provide information to the House as it comes forward to us.
We will get more information both on that and on the second part of the honourable member's question—the number of people who have died—more readily once the international force is established. We really have no numbers on the number of people who have died. There are some who say between 10,000 and 20,000. There are others who say that the numbers are in the hundreds. I do not think it would be right for me to speculate. I can only say to the House that I do not know.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—I cannot say off the top of my head precisely what moment of what day the Prime Minister made the point to President Clinton that we wanted support for INTERFET from the United States or precisely the details. But I can say to the House that we made it perfectly clear that we wanted the support of the United States administration and obviously of the United States military. 
 The point, though, to make here about combat troops or logistic support or whatever it might be is that we wanted appropriate support. And what is the definition of `appropriate support'? `Appropriate support' is defined by the military, and after discussions at the military to military level, at the diplomatic level and between President Clinton and the Prime Minister the conclusion is that the type of support that the United States is providing at the moment is appropriate support. It is the sort of support that our military are looking for. We have not been saying to each individual country, `We want this,' or `We want that,' or `We want something else,' but we have been making the point to them that we would like some support.
In concluding my answer, since the President of the Assemblee Nationale is here today, can I make the point that we particularly appreciate the support of France, and it is yet another illustration of the closeness of Franco-Australian relations. I spoke with Ambassador Dominique Girard in my office a couple of weeks ago. There have been good communications with the French government in Paris as well between Ambassador John Spender and French authorities.

That this House:
(1)	 reaffirms the fundamental principles of human rights that must be practised by the entire international community; 

(2)	 condemns the false arrest and imprisonment of thirteen Iranian Jews on spurious espionage charges; and
(3)	 calls upon Iranian authorities to immediately release the falsely imprisoned Iranian Jews.
The events unfolding on Australia's doorstep in East Timor are a tragic demonstration of the complexities of foreign policy—
Mr Tim Fischer interjecting—
—I will be getting to the issue of the Iranian Jews momentarily, Member for Farrer. Australia's leadership in the South-East Asian region is reinforced by the government's decision that Australia will head a multinational peacekeeping force into the troubled territory.
The reasons for sending a peacekeeping force are twofold. Firstly, continued instability in our own region could pose serious long-term consequences for Australia; and, secondly, Australians have been outraged by the atrocities committed against the East Timorese. These crimes violate our innate sense of basic human rights. Human rights in Australia are often discussed in philosophical terms. A clear and accepted definition does not exist, but it is widely accepted that the minimum basic human rights include freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association.
The essence of basic human rights is that people are free to choose their own way of life, subject to the rights of others and protecting people against exploitation. In Australia these rights are embodied in the social contract that exists between each individual and government. Beyond Australia these basic rights are observed to varying degrees. In some countries there appear to be no attempts to protect the basic rights of their citizens or minority groups. It is the responsibility of all free democracies to ensure that basic human rights are observed throughout the international community. At present there are serious concerns about human rights in countries such as Sudan, Cambodia and Iran. Today I wish to talk on Iran.
Approximately two years ago Mohammed Khatami was elected as President of Iran. Khatami's elevation initiated cautious optimism among international observers that this 
 was the beginning of a new era in Iranian foreign policy. To encourage this process, the Clinton administration earlier this year eased some of the economic sanctions on Iran, particularly the sale of food and medical supplies. Whether Khatami is genuinely committed to rapprochement with the West is uncertain, but what is certain is that there is significant resistance to rapprochement from some Iranian officials.
Recent developments in Iran confirm this worrying trend. It includes honouring the assassin who claimed the life of moderate Arab leader, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Another moderate Arab leader and former supporter of Khatami's, the former mayor of Teheran, has been imprisoned for two years on charges of corruption. A former culture ministry official will be put on trial for allowing publication of a banned moderate newspaper. The heads of an Iranian newsagency and a daily newspaper were also recently arrested. More recently, there has been mounting evidence of the persecution of some of Iran's 27,000 Jews.
Officially, the Iranian policy is that all its citizens enjoy equal rights but, according to the Executive Director of the Australia-Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, Dr Colin Rubenstein, Jewish schools and the teaching of Hebrew are frequently banned in Iran. Forms of independent communal expression have been prohibited following the closure of a Jewish newspaper after it criticised the Iranian government for banning and appropriating Jewish schools. Dr Rubenstein also believes that the treatment of other religious minorities in Iran warrants greater attention and protest from the world community.
More recently, international concerns about the treatment of the Jewish minority in Iran have been fuelled by the apparently false arrest around 21 March this year of 13 Iranian Jews on spurious espionage charges. The 13 men lived in Jewish communities in the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan. French Jewish leaders have indicated that one of those arrested is a Chief Rabbi. Reports also suggest that most of the others were either religious students or employed as religious teachers at the local 
 Jewish school. One of those arrested is 16 years old; another is more than 90.
Despite the arrests in March, Iranian officials waited three months before officially confirming the charges against the 13 religious teachers and students. More disturbingly, there has been no official explanation or details of the grounds on which the men have been charged. The detained prisoners have been denied bail, legal representation and family visits. Iran's mission at the United Nations in June ambiguously indicated that the number of alleged spies may exceed 13 and could include Moslems. There is speculation from Israeli sources that a total of 22 Jews have been arrested on espionage charges. Unfortunately, Iranian officials have been very economical with details.
Iran's reluctance to be open and transparent about these arrests only adds to the mounting suspicion in the international community that these espionage charges are baseless. Former Israeli foreign minister Ariel Sharon made it clear that none of the arrested men were involved in espionage activities with Israel. President Bill Clinton's Middle East affairs adviser, Bruce Rydell, has reputedly said that the administration is `very worried' by the events and has indicated that the claims are absolutely baseless.
French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, has also expressed his outrage at the arrest of the 13 religious teachers and students. Iran's actions in charging the 13 religious teachers and students have been condemned by France, Britain, Germany and Japan. To the best of my knowledge, Iranian authorities have not produced any documentation that implicates these 13 religious teachers and students in any crime. The only allusion to evidence has been a statement from Iran's daily newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami, which claims the 13 religious teachers and students were posing as traders but were secretly working for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.
It all sounds suspiciously like the same sort of `justice' that CARE Australia workers Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, and their colleague Branko Jelen, received in Belgrade. Few of us could forget the forced confession by Steve Pratt, which was videotaped and 
 broadcast around the world in an attempt to manipulate national and international opinion.
I have very real concerns that the 13 religious teachers and students are being used by Iranian fundamentalist officials in a similar way. There is enough evidence to suggest that there is a strong push from some Iranian officials to spoil President Khatami's attempts to improve relations between Iran and the West, particularly the United States. The concern is that these same officials have engineered the spurious espionage charges to create an obstacle to the rapprochement process.
This theme is reflected in the Iranian daily newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami, which has been a strong critic of President Khatami's rapprochement overtures. Some say the false arrests have been put up by fundamentalists as a road block to improving relations with the United States. The newspaper's position has been unequivocal. I quote from the newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami:
The support shown by Washington for the spies proves that America is still our number one enemy, and that it seizes the opportunity to strike any blow to this nation. This is a good lesson for those who favour establishing ties with America. The ugly face of America and the Jewish state will be more exposed when our intelligence officials provide the public with more information on the affair.
There is every reason to believe that this is another attempt by fundamentalists to discredit President Khatami's attempts at improving relations with the United States and Israel. If the 13 religious teachers and students are convicted of espionage they face execution. This would not only be a gross violation of human rights and natural justice but it would set the rapprochement process back, possibly by decades, and would continue Iran's diplomatic estrangement from the West. Already there is a push to bring under question Iranian loans on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But Iran can avoid these types of consequences by immediately releasing all the falsely imprisoned men, whether they be Jewish or Muslim or whether they be 13 or 22 in number.
Australia joins the international chorus in encouraging Iran to pursue this outcome. I am delighted that a number of members will be 
 speaking in this debate this afternoon and sharing my concern, as I have expressed it today. I hope they will join me in condemning Iran for the false imprisonment of the 13 Jewish students and teachers and in calling on Iran to free them forthwith or face the continued anger of the world community at their failure to recognise basic human rights. I thank the House.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—For Jews all over the world, today marks the holiest day of their calendar, known as Yom Kippur or the Day of Atonement. Jews here and around the world will be in their synagogues and will abstain from food and drink. This explains the absence of my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports.
There are 13 Jews in Iran who will not be observing this holy day or any other holy day in the Jewish calendar, because they have been imprisoned on ridiculous, trumped-up charges of espionage activities. In March this year, unofficial reports began to surface that a number of prominent members of the Iranian Jewish community had been arrested. Spies in Iran are usually sentenced to death. When details came to light in June, it was confirmed that the 13 arrested included community leaders, a rabbi, a 16-year-old boy, a butcher and a cemetery worker—hardly individuals who would be linked to acts of espionage.
Since the Iranian revolution, Iran has tried and executed 17 Iranian Jews for espionage, including two in 1997. At first, Jewish community leaders in the US and Europe sought the release of the 13 through diplomatic channels. However, this attempt quickly failed and the 13 were charged with spying for the United States and for Israel.
Professor Gerald Steinberg, from the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University, a regular columnist for the Jerusalem Post, said:
The arrests have nothing to do with spying and everything to do with anti-semitism and the use of Jews as scapegoats. After a show trial by a kanga 
 roo court, they were given long sentences, some may not emerge alive.
The Iranian decision to move against the Jewish community is additional evidence that their claims to respect the human rights of all citizens, including Jews, Christians and members of the Baha'i faith, are nothing more than propaganda.
The Iranian Jewish community is more than 2,500 years old and its recorded history dates back to the fifth century BCE. This ancient minority is estimated to number between 25,000 and 30,000. The majority of the community lives in Teheran. Separate Jewish schools were closed and appropriated by the Iranian government in 1991, but Jewish religious studies are provided for Jewish students in the Islamic schools and are taught by rabbis and members of the community. However, Iranian Jews are not permitted to teach the Hebrew language and are required to adhere to Iran's Islamic dress code.
These arrests, with such a fundamental abuse of human rights, have rightly not been accepted by almost every country around the world. Latest reports from the United States suggest that civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson, who has negotiated freedom for captured American servicemen held by foreign governments, is trying to arrange, through Iran's Ambassador to the United Nations, a visit to Iran to help release the 13 Jews. In Paris, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said that the charges of spying against the 13 Jews were fabricated as part of an internal struggle among Iran's leadership. He added that Paris is seeking to mobilise other European nations in the case.
Here in Australia, members of parliament, the Jewish community and the general public were quick to respond to the news of the 13 arrests. The Jewish community's elected representative body, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, immediately registered its abhorrence to the charges, as did other major Jewish community groups. Protests against the Iranian government were held in both Sydney and Melbourne, and members of parliament quickly responded with the signing of a petition calling for the 13 to be immediately released. 
Let us not underestimate how significant an event it was when my parliamentary colleague the member for Melbourne Ports drafted and passed through this House a petition calling for the release of these innocent Jewish individuals. The petition was signed by all Labor members of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for foreign affairs. Most members of the coalition signed too.
In conclusion, the arrest of the 13 Jews may highlight the need for the Australian government to review its relationship with the Iranian regime. We all had high hopes that the new Khatami regime would be a sign of moderation and openness towards the rest of the world. Among other things, our close trade ties suggest Australia may be able to influence Iranian government policy.
People of all backgrounds and faiths regret that these 13 hapless individuals seem to be pawns in some power play between the hardline ayatollahs and President Khatami. I believe we need to encourage Australian exports and business opportunities for our farmers, but, as East Timor reminds us, let us not do this at the expense of innocent human life overseas. The government in Iran should understand that this disgraceful anti-Jewish show trial will damage its reputation far and wide, including its reputation with countries like Australia which have a reputation for coherence and religious diversity. The 13 Iranian Jews should be and must be released now.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights and Iranian Jews</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—I wish to support this motion which raises serious issues for the government of Iran. In March of this year 13 Iranian Jews living in Teheran, Isfahan and Shiraz were arrested by the Iranian government. In June, the Director-General of the Iranian Intelligence Service stated that the individuals were alleged to be spies who had `played a vital role in the espionage network' and had conducted alleged espionage activities on behalf of Israel and the United States. Both the USA and Israel have strenuously denied that these persons are in any way associated with intelligence activities on the part of either country. Indeed, both countries claim that they have 
 absolutely no relationship with the individuals in question. To date, the government of Iran has furnished no evidence to support the allegations levelled at the 13 detainees. Of the detainees, one is only 16 years old and a number are rabbis and religious teachers. The Iranian foreign ministry has announced that the matter will go to trial according to Islamic law and the individuals currently in detention will face the death penalty.
The chief of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Muhammad Yazdi, has also announced that, `This is a case of espionage which has nothing to do with human rights.' The problem for the government of Iran is that this has everything to do with human rights. It is intolerable that religious minorities in any part of the world continue to be singled out in this day and age for persecution and harassment. It is intolerable that the government of Iran, while on the one hand seeking international acceptance, is continuing to perpetuate this persecution of 13 of its Jewish citizens. Iran's actions have met with widespread condemnation from the international community. The French foreign minister has described the charges as fabricated. The United States Senate and House of Representatives have both passed resolutions condemning the arrests. The Australian government has made a number of representations to the Iranian government over our concerns about the fate of the 13 Jewish detainees.
I am aware that, in Australia, the Jewish community has been deeply concerned by these arrests in Iran. For many, it is a vivid recollection of the practice employed by the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union who frequently interned Jews on political grounds without any justification. Since 1979 at least 17 Iranian Jews have been executed on trumped up charges and many more have been imprisoned. During a recent rally in Melbourne, Dr Colin Rubenstein, a leader of the Australian Jewish community, said:
The Iranian government's official `tolerance' of its Jewish minority has in fact amounted to systematic intolerance and discrimination which can only be seen as an attempt to stamp out over the long run Iran's 2,500 year old Jewish community. The lives of Jews in Iran are dominated by the fear of indiscriminate imprisonment and torture. 

There is some suggestion from Teheran that this is an internal matter and is of no concern to the international community. I think that we have all grown tired of hearing the endless excuse from those who trade in tyranny that their human rights abuses are internal matters. The rights of all citizens are matters of global concern. The abrogation of those rights is a matter of global concern. The US Assistant Secretary of State, Martin Indyk, recently said:
. . . statements by President Khatami in support of human rights and the rule of law deserve acknowledgment and support. At the same time, we are concerned at the gap that often remains between words and deeds.
Nations that seek international support for financial, diplomatic and technological gain but ignore international opinion when found to be engaged in human rights abuses are nations that must feel the full condemnation of the international community.
We have seen too often that the appeasement of tyranny brings with it an invitation for greater tyranny. It is time for the government of Iran to meet its responsibilities. It is time for the government of Iran to release the falsely imprisoned Iranian Jews. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights and Iranian Jews</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1,speech
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I join the previous speakers and the mover of the motion in supporting this motion. As many other speakers have indicated, this is probably part of a power play between President Khatami, who was overwhelmingly elected by the Iranian people, and the hardliners amongst the Iranian religious theocracy and those who essentially use religion to protect their vested interests that they have accrued over the last decade or so. It is sad to say that, whilst we are emphasising the obvious use of the Jewish minority of 25,000 to 27,000 for internal political struggle purposes, it is not isolated in this treatment by the Iranian regime. This parliament has dealt with a number of resolutions concerning the very extreme persecution of the Baha'is. The government of Iran has been active in suppressing the oil workers in the country. It has also involved itself in persecuting its Turkman minority. 
In news reports last week, there were indications that, rather than the government prosecuting religious based thugs who assaulted a number of university students who were seeking wider democracy in Iran and who were supporting President Khatami, the actual victims are essentially going to be tried and, in some cases, it appears that the administration will be seeking the death penalty for those students. Those newspaper reports last week indicated that the judicial elements on the conservative side of Iranian politics were possibly using that attempt—a very extreme measure—to prosecute the students as an attempt to further embarrass Khatami and force aside any moves towards reform.
So this is part of a broader agenda by conservative elements in the country. It is not in any manner evidence of some kind of Zionist plot against the Iranian regime. It has even been speculated that the factual basis as to why these people are being tried—if there was in fact a factual basis at all—was more to do with their possible use of email, which is illegal, and their attempt to possibly convert other people to Judaism. That is probably the best defence the regime could have. But in all likelihood it is essentially part of a two-pronged policy of persecution of the Jewish minority—and we heard earlier from speakers that their schools have been closed and they have been forced to adhere to Islamic dress codes—and an attempt to utilise it for political purposes.
It is deplorable that the response of the Iranian regime, indicated by a foreign ministry spokesperson last week, was:
There have been irresponsible statements by certain uninformed and prejudiced circles.
And Ayatollah Yazdi said that the people involved in this—the 13 members of the Jewish faith—`may be sentenced to death not once but several times,' in an obvious prejudgment of the circumstances.
The regime in Iran, under Khatami, has essentially tried to gain a degree of international respectability. The President has made visits to Europe and to a number of Middle Eastern countries as a first sign of an attempt by Iran to rehabilitate itself in the Western world, but it is clear that the efforts of the 
 President are being seriously resisted. There have been continuing human rights violations. I will quickly summarise from the Amnesty International 1999 annual report on Iran:
Hundreds of political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, were held. Some were detained without charge or trial; others continued to serve long prison sentences imposed after unfair trials. Reports of torture and ill-treatment continued to be received and judicial punishments of flogging and stoning continued to be imposed. Reports suggested that possible ""disappearances"" and extrajudicial executions had occurred.
We all know that, in recent months, there has been a revelation that the interior ministry of the country itself has supposedly rogue elements that have eliminated a number of secular opponents of the current regime.
I commend the motion. The persecution and the arrest of these people is a matter that the Western world must drive home with the Iranian authorities.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I wish to speak about a grievance today. My grievance is with the government that went to the people of Australia just one year ago with a promise that under the new tax system no-one would be worse off and, `We'll look after small business.'	 In the past year I have listened to the concerns of many small business people who are terrified of what the changes in the tax laws will do to them. But today I want to talk about a specific industry that is facing major problems, an uncertain future, an industry which is a regional industry and would employ in the order of 1,000 people directly, and many more indirectly, on the North Coast of New South Wales. That industry is the oyster industry, and it is being hounded by an unfair tax system. Anyone who knows anything about this industry knows only too well how oyster farmers are continually battling the elements, the environment, disease in their oysters and the community perception of whether it is safe to eat oysters or not.
I am sure many members can recall the disaster that befell Wallis Lakes in the north 
 of my electorate of Paterson only three years ago that prevented any oysters being harvested or sold from that area for over 12 months. This is an industry that has a history of boom and bust. Those conditions are almost always beyond the control of the grower—be it the cost of purification, inundation by the Pacific or Gigas species or contamination by polluted run-off. Now we can add a new dimension to the problems faced by the oyster growers. And that new problem is the Australian Taxation Office.
The reason is that the oyster farmers are being asked to change their method of valuing their stock. In other words, they are being treated like retailers who buy in stock and retail it for profit, where the stock is a real, tangible asset with a definitive value. The oyster industry is far from that scenario. The Oyster Farmers Association have argued that oysters should be excluded in the same way as vegetables, fruit, timber, et cetera because of the impact on those industries of section 70-10 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
As I have already pointed out, the variables facing the oyster farmer make it a precarious industry. The fact that there are three-year-old oysters on racks ready to harvest in six months time does not mean that a single oyster will necessarily be harvested. A `kill' can wipe out virtually an entire oyster crop in 24 hours. Essentially, my grievance is that theorists in the Australian Taxation Office are treating the oyster industry in a purely economic rationalist way with no account for the realistic problems that this industry faces. They are asking the oyster farmers to place a value on their unrealised asset—the asset of oysters on racks that if harvested will be of value but may be completely lost due to natural phenomena. That value, however it can be counted, will be regarded as income in the opening year.
For the past two years, the Oyster Farmers Association of New South Wales have repeatedly called on the Australian Taxation Office to give them a realistic consideration. So far, their calls have fallen on deaf ears. They have asked that their oyster crop has an opening value rather than a zero value. This would 
 considerably reduce the paper or virtual income in that first year. That means they would pay tax only on the change in value of their stock. Over the first financial year, that would give them some relief. It would not allow the entire value of all stock at the end of the first year to be taxable. That in itself is a horrific thought. A number of oyster farmers have told me that if this form of accounting comes in they will be forced to leave the industry.
I call on the Treasurer and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as a matter of urgency to inject some commonsense into this equation and to assure the oyster farmers that they can go on accounting for their crop in the traditional way. They deserve recognition and respect as a responsible group of people who employ large numbers of people in regional Australia, both directly and indirectly. Of course, they face another tax problem related directly to the way they are treated by the GST.
In conclusion, let me say that the oyster industry is a vibrant industry. It is a responsible industry that historically has faced enormous hurdles to allow it to survive. How ironic it would be, at a time it is at its most technologically advanced stage, using best practice and producing an excellent product, if it was killed off because of the intransigence of a hungry tax office that is all too anxious to classify industries so that the government's return is maximised through the tax system, rather than to allow an industry to be treated in a manner that will allow it to flourish and maximise its purpose in regional Australia as an employer.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Oyster Industry</title>,Grievance Debate,13,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I rise in support of the amendment put forward by the member for Wills. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  is an important one for small business. It is important in terms of business investment strategies and retirement income security. All these super changes, including the GST, the Ralph review on business taxation, changes to fringe benefits tax and the introduction of the pay-as-you-go remittal system, are all combining to create an atmosphere of uncertainty hitherto not experienced by the small business sector. The bill that we are debating now in this place and the government's mismanage 
 ment of the issues it deals with are significantly adding to that uncertainty.
I can predict that some members of the government side will challenge me on my contention that small business at the moment is facing new levels of insecurity. They do not need to take my word for it; they need only turn to the latest Yellow Pages small business survey, which indicated that 74 per cent of the 1,200 small firms surveyed are worried about the complexity and the paperwork burden associated with the government's ANTS package. Forty per cent believe they will be worse off under the GST. These findings are in line with the findings of my own survey, which I recently conducted across nine electorates with a small business sample similar to the size of the Yellow Pages survey.
We are getting a consistent message here that, despite the Howard government's pre-election promise to cut the paperwork burden for small business—indeed, the promise was by 50 per cent—that commitment was a farce. It is an uncontestable fact that the paperwork alone associated with the GST will add three to four hours a week to the time small business people spend moving paper. According to the government's own Bell report, small firms on average already spend 16 hours a week on paperwork compliance and other administrative activities. Of these 16 hours, they found that four are devoted to government paperwork. With respect to the GST alone—not taking into account the bill we are discussing today, the FBT changes and all those others I mentioned earlier—the government wants to now double that to around eight hours a week.
I began by talking about new levels of uncertainty in the small business sector. Apart from the GST, you could not get a better example of government mismanagement contributing to those levels of uncertainty than the one we see with respect to the do-it-yourself superannuation changes that this bill deals with.
It is worth having a look at the chronology of events. The saga began with the 1998 budget, when the government announced its plans to effectively do in excluded funds by 
 restricting to five per cent fund assets which can be invested in associated entities or involving associated parties. This in itself would have brought to an end the time-honoured practice of lease-back arrangements. Retrospective operation and the requirement that all funds comply with the new five per cent rule by June 2001 would have forced divestiture and, in doing so, would have generated serious capital gains liabilities. But, worse than that, that retrospective action would have forced parties to renege on lease contracts, and that would have generated significant financial penalties for breach of contract, some of them very serious indeed.
Just two weeks after the 1998 budget, we saw a backflip from the government—thankfully—in the form of an announcement that the legislation would be grandfathered. Then, in March and April of this year, the government released the exposure drafts for this bill and for  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 .
The country's 180,000 do-it-yourself super funds and the small business people who operate them have been living with this uncertainty now for much more than 12 months, and the uncertainty continues. That uncertainty has caused the operators of small firms worry, concern, time and money. That concern has been voiced by the CPA organisations and highlighted in media reports, a number of which I highlighted when I spoke to the precursor to this bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). That bill established a new category of excluded funds, to be known as self-managed funds. The funds must have fewer than five members, each member must be a trustee and all must be in a family or business relationship.
The opposition does not have any great difficulties with those propositions, but the real sting is in this bill—rather than bill No. 3, which was the precursor—which we will be opposing in the absence of further Senate consideration. This bill seeks to address a very small, isolated problem, some abuse of the system, by taking a hammer to what is effectively only a peanut. By amending the coverage of the in-house assets rules so that 
 they include investments in loans to and lease arrangements with a related party, the government has changed the very nature of small business do-it-yourself schemes.
The five per cent cap on fund assets which are invested in associated parties really is going to change the nature of these operations. In the 1996-97 year the return on investments for these excluded funds on average was about 11 per cent. I know there are a few big funds around the place that would like to be able to boast that sort of success. Their investment strategies are conservative but they are producing results.
What the government wants to do is mainstream do-it-yourself superannuation, to the detriment of those funds and those small business operators who rely upon them both for their investment strategies and for their retirement incomes. This will impact on small business operators in a number of ways. First, it will drag down the return on investments, and there is little doubt about that. Second, it will remove investment flexibility and choice. Third, it will restrict the ability to invest in real property, which in turn is used to accommodate the business concerned. We note the legislation's positive move to allow 100 per cent of the fund's assets to be invested in real property, but this is of no assistance to the firm that does not have sufficient money in the fund to invest in the property concerned.
In other words, if a motor mechanic in the electorate of the minister sitting at the table, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, is interested in using his super as a vehicle to invest in a new workshop, and the workshop is valued at around $200,000 and there is only $70,000 in the fund, he is unable to make the investment he had in mind. That not only has implications for him, his firm and his family or his partners but also has implications for investment in infrastructure, particularly in rural and regional Australia, where this vehicle is very common indeed. This is an undermining of infrastructure investment in rural and regional communities in particular.
Superannuation is a very important area of government policy, not only in terms of retirement incomes but also in terms of how 
 it addresses savings problems in this country and how that flows on to other issues such as the current account. Labor is proud of its tradition in encouraging a greater investment in superannuation. The opposition recognise that there are some problems with small funds—do-it-yourself funds. We recognise there is some exploitation taking place, and some strategies have probably been delivering lower returns than they may have if that sort of exploitation was not going on. But this is a bit like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. These are not large problems—not large enough to put into effect legislation that is going to curtail investment in the sector, as this will certainly do.
As I began, I said that this is just one issue that is combining with many others to impact on the small business sector. Opposition can be very frustrating, and it is fair to say that you have few victories, but they do come along. The government's backflip on the wine equalisation tax recently was a very good example where the government picked up on Labor's amendments for the cellar door exemption. That was a very important amendment for the tourism sector, especially for the small business part of the tourism sector.
Tomorrow we will have the presentation of a very important document—the result of the deliberations of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. The opposition wants to participate in this debate. This debate has very wide implications for both the small business and the tourism sector, two areas for which I speak on behalf of the opposition in this place. Both of those sectors are very diverse. Some parts of both sectors are very small and some parts are very large. Some parts of those sectors are capital intensive and some parts of those sectors are very labour intensive. As an overview, you would have to say that both sectors are increasingly becoming service based sectors. So you would think that any shift in the taxation system towards supporting the services sector would be healthy for both small business and tourism.
Again, both sectors rely very heavily on accelerated depreciation, so there is going to be a very fine balance there. The government has the benefit of the modelling we require to 
 get this balance right. But I say to the government—as I am saying we want to do on this particular bill with respect to sending it to a Senate committee so we can further investigate the ramifications and implications of these changes—we want to be in this debate. We, too, want a tax system in this country which is good for small business. We want a tax system in this country which is internationally competitive and we want a tax system in this country which attracts investment. That investment will also flow into the small business and tourism sectors.
These sectors are very important to this economy. I say again that we have a deep seated interest in these sectors, particularly what I call the `new' small business sector—the growing services based sector in the small business world. We want to participate in that debate. We want to participate in this bill before the House now. We think that the government has not properly thought through the implications of the superannuation amendments it has presented to the House on this occasion. That is why we want to send it off to a Senate committee so we can hear from other industry leaders and other people who are going to be affected and determine whether or not there would be a positive or negative impact overall as a result of its adoption. On that basis, I commend the amendment of the member for Wills to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—The main reason the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  came about stems from the basic philosophy that superannuation funds are generally not permitted to borrow in their own right. This was designed to reduce the risk to retirement income from superannuation funds gearing their assets. If you have a superannuation system where, when people ultimately want to retire and use those funds or recoup those funds for their retirement, there is nothing left because those funds have been able to be invested in a risky situation, then it is not much of a superannuation fund. You then find many people coming back to the government or the public purse to assist them in their retirement. That was the general thrust of superannuation from the beginning.
Over a period of time, accountants and others have looked at innovative ways in which they can operate self-managed small funds, in many respects to help small businesses invest. But at the same time some practices have been allowed to occur which have substantially increased the risk of those superannuation funds. That was the reason for the changes to the regulation of `excluded funds' that were announced in the budget in 1998-99. They mainly related to introducing a category of `self-managed funds' which will replace `excluded funds', with the new name reflecting the investment management of the fund. A self-managed fund would be one, for instance, with fewer than five members as with excluded funds, et cetera.
When those announcements were made in the budget, there were aspects of that of concern to some people, me included. I will come back to that. Some of the background to the changes was that a survey of excluded funds found that 20 per cent were investing in unit trusts controlled by the members and 13 per cent were leasing or renting assets to associated parties. Effectively, companies were setting up unit trusts as a structure and they were being used to circumvent the rule that prevents borrowing by a superannuation fund. An example of how this was being done would be a business, which could be some sort of corporate structure or a trust or a partnership, that put, say, $50,000 into a superannuation fund. That superannuation fund would then use that money to buy units in a unit trust. The unit trust would then buy a property worth, say, $200,000. The business would pay rent to the unit trust. That rent was usually structured such that it would meet the repayments of the $150,000 that the unit trust had borrowed. At the end of the year, if the business found that it had some spare cash, it could then use that money to put into its superannuation fund, buy some more units and pay off part of that capital. That was effectively the way it was set up for a number of small businesses.
In that simplified form, that worked quite well. Unfortunately, as with so many things, things get abused, and I think the real spirit of what was intended went beyond that, hence 
 some of the changes that were announced. The Labor Party complain when they think that you have not consulted with all sorts of different people throughout the community, but in this particular instance a lot of consultation went on—firstly, between the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the government and then with people in the community—about getting this aspect right. That is the reason why there were some changes and why it took some time for this legislation to get in. Our friends opposite complain about that, yet we were having proper consultation to make sure we got it right.
I was proud to be one of the people that went to see the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer about some of these matters and to provide them with examples of existing funds and the potential effects of this legislation on them. That is why we got grandfathering for existing funds. That is a good thing, that is where consultation works, and no-one should complain about that. We are getting the legislation more correct as a result.
Further to the consultation that occurred, I will read the comments of one of my constituents who actually helped me to look at some of these matters. That person is Jan Ryan, who works in Cooma for Michael Boyce and Co., accountants who work very closely with quite a number of small businesses, particularly in the farming sector. When the original stuff came out, she said that they could see some concerns with the sorts of funds that they had assisted in putting together. She said:
In our extensive experience in the superannuation area, the arrangement of a Super Fund owning a related unit trust (holding rural property) was often the only  way to entice farmers into superannuation. There is an inherent suspicion of superannuation by farmers (in particular) and this arrangement allowed them to hold in their Funds a tangible asset which they understood and controlled. Commercial rates of return were paid on the use of the property by the operating entity. In view of the massive problems evolving in Australia in regard to intergenerational transfer of farms, this arrangement provided an excellent opportunity for farmers to make plans for retirement using superannuation—something that had not happened previously. In fact, it is our experience that many farmers would not even consider superannuation prior to this opportunity.  

That was a concern for me and that is why we were able to get some of the changes made, and the grandfathering as well, to assist in those particular circumstances. The grandfathering means that the existing funds will have quite substantial time to continue those arrangements.
Other matters have been introduced which will be of great assistance for small businesses investing in property. I refer in particular to being able to extend the business rural property exemption for excluded funds from 40 per cent to 100 per cent; that is, a superannuation fund with fewer than five members will be able to invest up to 100 per cent of its assets in business premises that are leased to members or the employer sponsor of the fund. I think that is a very positive outcome that has resulted from this.
Throughout the debate that has occurred so far the opposition have made merry of their feelings that aspects of these changes are going against small business, as if that is the most major thing that small business will consider. At least I can speak with some authority in that regard, having kept a small business with 20-odd employees going during the heyday of a Labor government when interest rates went well over 20 per cent. The highest we got to was 21.75 or 21.95—I cannot recall which now—on a very sizeable overdraft and there were similar, if not higher, interest rates on the leasing of vehicles within our company.
I can tell you that those sorts of things mean far more to small business than anything else when it comes down to the bottom line. We can play around, talk and nitpick about the processes of various aspects of superannuation funds until the cows come home, but at the end of the day the thing that affects small business by far and away the most are those sorts of things—the high interest rates which we lived through in the late eighties and early nineties. They were damn hard times, I can tell you. Something that I will never forget in my life is the negotiation I constantly had with the bank to keep that business going and to keep all those people employed. I am proud to say that every single one of them remained. We may 
 not have paid ourselves for many weeks but the employees remained. They were certainly the tough things, so interest is much more important than the various other aspects that are often raised by our friends opposite.
I was not going to speak at great length on this bill because others have covered all the technical aspects and I would be only repeating them. I can stress only that I certainly did have some concerns. I understood the reasons why we were introducing these measures—to overcome some of the abuse of what seemed to be a legitimate use of the law, and I think that is an aspect that parliament has to deal with. It is all about integrity of superannuation and also about limiting the risk of superannuation, which has to be paramount at the end of the day. At the same time I want to make sure that we are continuing to encourage small businesses to be involved in superannuation and to invest in their premises, particularly in rural and regional areas where businesses are doing much more investing than anybody else. We must continue to encourage them to do that.
Lack of capital continues to be a problem in that respect, and if we can structure things in such a way that superannuation can be utilised I think that is very good. Investments via that superannuation can help to overcome that lack of capital. I also will watch very closely how these new measures do work in that respect, because I would not like to see a limitation occurring out of the detail of some of these things. Often they are only worked out after some time, but the early indications since the announcement in the budget last year were that these sorts of structures are continuing to be used and developed. It has not stopped these types of structures overnight, as some people thought it would. As I say, I will continue to watch that and its effect on small businesses and their investment in superannuation, particularly in the rural and regional towns of my electorate.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—This bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , proposes a number of restrictions on investment rules for superannuation funds which will have a 
 particular impact on self-managed or do-it-yourself superannuation funds. The government claimed in the 1998 budget that this measure would not cost any revenue. It also claimed that it would not bring any savings. If this is so, the question is: why is this measure necessary?
We have been led to believe that this bill is based on the findings of a survey conducted in 1997 by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, yet APRA has refused to reveal the methodology for choosing the funds that participated in the survey. This survey involved only 1,000 of the over 180,000 registered do-it-yourself funds in Australia. How can we be expected to believe that the findings of this survey have any validity? If the methodology was valid, APRA should release the details of the methodology.
The government itself has demonstrated enormous uncertainty over these reforms. They were first announced in a different form in the 1998 budget. Then on 28 May 1998 the Treasurer announced that the government had already changed its mind. In April 1999 the government announced even more changes. But even then, one year after the first announcement, the government still was not sure about exactly what to do. On 11 August 1999, when this bill was introduced into the House, it was revealed that the government had changed its proposal yet again. Despite this lengthy process of policy backflips, the bill still lacks the support of many of the people it will most affect. It is still opposed by many small business owners in do-it-yourself funds and by accountants who administer these funds. In summary, this is a lengthy and complicated bill that proposes a number of changes that are simply unnecessary, yet the government continues to ignore issues on which the superannuation industry agrees there is a need for reform.
One of the areas in which there is agreement from the superannuation industry, let alone the contributors to the superannuation industry products, is the issue of the removal of discrimination against people in same sex relationships. My greatest concern about this bill is that it shows just how wrong the government's priorities are. Why prioritise the 
 highly questionable reforms proposed in this bill over reforms which are desperately needed to prevent the hardship and heartache suffered by Australians in same sex relationships who are now denied access to superannuation benefits? As I have reminded the House on many occasions, current superannuation legislation denies the existence of same sex relationships. This prevents partners from accessing death benefits or sharing retirement benefits. The government has consistently supported the continuation of this disincentive to contribute to superannuation. Why would people in same sex relationships make personal contributions when superannuation legislation discriminates against them and treats them as second-class citizens? The government's message to people in same sex relationships is clear: minimise your investment in superannuation and get your money out as soon as you can.
I first raised the issue of equal rights to superannuation for same sex couples in this House during an adjournment speech on 10 December 1996. When the government failed to take action, on 22 June 1998, in the previous parliament, I introduced a private member's bill to give same sex couples the same rights to superannuation benefits as heterosexual couples. Following the October 1998 election, I reintroduced the bill, the Superannuation (Entitlements of Same Sex Couples) Bill, on 7 December 1998 after the proroguing of parliament and that election. Since then I have raised this issue on three further occasions, including in the second reading speech for that bill, which we brought on to ensure that the legislation did not lapse off the Notice Paper. I note from today's Notice Paper that, unless it is debated in the next three sitting Mondays, it will lapse again, so once again it will require action just to keep it on the Notice Paper.
The government has had a number of opportunities to implement reform and to correct this situation. In February this House considered the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, which contained changes which allow superannuation funds to amend their rules to accept binding death benefits nominations from contributors. That 
 bill was all about giving effect to the wishes of superannuation contributors. This was the perfect opportunity to correct discrimination against same sex couples, yet the government failed to act. As I said in my speech in the debate on that bill, some same sex couples may be able to slip through a loophole as a result of that bill, but it did nothing to address the very clear legal discrimination that continues to exist.
The issue of equal rights for same sex couples should not be an issue of party politics; it is a human rights issue. This was made very clear by Human Rights Commissioner Sidoti when examining the effect of Commonwealth superannuation legislation on equality of opportunity in employment. Commissioner Sidoti's inquiry addressed the Superannuation Act 1976, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. He found:
In denying to surviving same sex partners of superannuation fund members an entitlement to benefit, these acts contravene the prohibitions on sexual preference discrimination in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organisation Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (ILO III), both of which are scheduled to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.
I have supported equal rights for same sex couples as an issue of basic fairness. I have always thought that the Australian ethos was to give everybody a fair go. But this issue is no longer just about fairness and equality; it is now clear that it is about our human rights obligations in the international arena. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one of the major international human rights documents. With the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, it forms the International Bill of Rights.
I would remind members of the House that not so long ago Australia was embarrassed on the international stage when Nick Toonen was forced to go to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations to highlight the fact 
 that Tasmanian anti-sodomy laws breached the ICCPR. Do we have to wait for Australia to be embarrassed yet again on the world stage before the government takes the very simple step of giving same sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples?
It is interesting that later on tonight we will be debating the  Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . The government, in this piece of legislation, seeks to dilute the powers and influence of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission—quite an extraordinary situation to be occurring in 1999. The way in which the report by HREOC was tabled in this parliament—on a Thursday, with no statement from the minister, no comment from the government whatsoever—shows the embarrassment that the government has for presiding over what is lawful discrimination in today's society.
I would remind the House also that my moving of the private members bill was not my preferred approach. In April 1998, I wrote to the Prime Minister asking for his support. On 25 May 1998, a response came from the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Chris Miles, the former member for Braddon. He is no longer here, along with a number of his other colleagues from the hardline-Right moralising Lyons Forum of which the member for Warringah is a proud member.
—Few in number.
—They are fewer in number because the world has moved on. I would remind the House that the then member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, wrote back to me stating:
The government is not inclined to amend the superannuation and taxation legislation at this time to recognise same sex partners as dependants and spouses for the purpose of superannuation death benefits.
What a slap in the face for people who are affected by the discriminatory state of the current laws. People in same sex relationships face devastating consequences when a person dies. On top of the death of a loved one, the surviving partner may face severe financial hardship. To be told that the government `is not inclined' to show any sympathy is extra 
 ordinarily insulting to a significant section of the population.
However, the government is not only failing to act on existing legislation but also actually extending the discrimination. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , which has been before the Senate, proposes a number of changes to do-it-yourself superannuation funds. As it stands, that bill will remove from small funds members who are not related. This will have the effect of preventing same sex couples from setting up do-it-yourself funds. It will also mean that same sex couples who currently belong to do-it-yourself funds will be forced out, and they will be forced to pay capital gains tax and possibly stamp duty on the funds which are transferred. The government is not content with preventing people in same sex relationships from accessing benefits; it now also wants to tax them on the basis of their sexual preference.
In maintaining such an intransigent stance on the issue of same sex rights, the federal Liberal and National parties are fast falling behind their party colleagues at a state level. The New South Wales coalition did not oppose comprehensive changes to de facto relationships moved this year by the Carr Labor government. These changes affected numerous areas of the law including inheritance, stamp duty, guardianship, property division, bail, and accident compensation. But, far from opposing these very necessary reforms, a number of coalition members from both the Liberal and the National parties spoke in favour of the government's bill. Coalition governments had previously supported recognition of same sex relationships in relation to inheritance in Victoria and the ACT. Yet this government continues to dig its heels in and fall further and further behind community values and international norms.
In the bill before us this afternoon, the government has yet again proposed a definition of `relative' that excludes people in same sex relationships. There is no clear justification for the changes proposed in this bill. Existing legislation requires superannuation fund trustees to invest funds prudently for the purposes of retirement income. What there is 
 agreement on across the chamber is that superannuation is vitally important not just for individuals but for the nation's savings. When we speak about the importance of superannuation in terms of the savings for the nation—which are remarkably low—the Treasurer and all those interested in the economic future of this country recognise that one of the major problems with Australia is our low level of savings. In spite of this, with this legislation and the failure of the government to act the message is, `Superannuation is important and savings are important, but we can afford to exclude a section of society,' which is a view that can only be regarded as narrow-minded.
The information we have suggests that do-it-yourself funds currently produce higher returns than other superannuation funds, and that discrimination is being entrenched. It has to be put on the record that it is not just across the political spectrum of New South Wales that reform has occurred. The current Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Joe Hockey, agreed publicly to second my private member's bill in order to promote the reform process. A number of other members opposite, including the member for Bradfield, have indicated their support for an enlightened level playing field view.
Reform and equality require people not to agree with someone else's lifestyle but to agree that they have a right to determine their own lifestyle. I would have thought that those people who purport to support the great free market would say that there needs to be a level playing field from those people who contribute to superannuation funds—that there should not be a different outcome depending upon one's sexual preference. Instead of focusing on the very real problem faced by Australians in same sex relationships, the government is devoting its attention to a series of inadequate reforms, which is why the member for Wills, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, has moved amendments to this legislation. I hope that the government wakes up and catches up before we face yet another round of condemnation by the United Nations about discriminatory practices here in Australia.
I put the government and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, on notice that unless the government takes action by either adopting my private member's bill or by choosing to amend its own legislation, as it could do at any time through one of these superannuation legislation amendment bills—we are up to No. 4—then I will be moving an amendment to the next appropriate piece of superannuation legislation, along the lines of my private member's bill, to remove discrimination. There will then have to be a vote by the government, the opposition and the one Independent, the member for Calare, on where they stand on this issue.
The government has the opportunity to fix the discrimination and to get the credit for fixing it. That would be the easy option for the government. The hard option for the government would be to face a vote on where they stand on this issue and to be dragged kicking and screaming to necessary reform—which the overwhelming majority of people in this House with a conscience vote would clearly support—or, due to the personal views of the Prime Minister and one or two others on the opposite side, vote to entrench discrimination again in 1999. I call upon the government to do the right thing—follow what the coalition members in the New South Wales government have done and support the necessary reform.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—At the outset I would like to thank all participants in the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 . It will not come as a surprise that we do not accept or support the opposition's second reading amendment.
The opposition's assertion that this government is continually attacking superannuation is unequivocally wrong. Since this government came into power, superannuation has continued to grow. Superannuation assets are now around $387 billion—around double the level of five years ago—and they exceed the level originally predicted to be reached by June 2000 by the retirement income modelling unit of Treasury. Superannuation contri 
 butions have also continued to grow, with the strongest growth coming from member contributions, including voluntary contributions. The government has initiated numerous reforms to improve and strengthen the superannuation system, including improved preservation arrangements, the introduction of the rebate for spouse contributions, the introduction of retirement savings accounts, better arrangements for splitting superannuation in the case of marital breakdown, and choice of fund.
With respect to the new investment rules, the truth is that excluded funds have continued to grow—that is, funds with fewer than five members. In March 1999 there were 182,000 excluded funds, up from 170,000 in June 1998. During this time, assets in excluded funds have increased from $42 billion to $50 billion. The government welcomes the growth of these funds.
One particular initiative the government has undertaken for small business owners with do-it-yourself funds in this bill is to increase from 40 per cent to 100 per cent the percentage of assets that small superannuation funds can use to acquire business real property from members or employer sponsors. Business real property will be able to be leased to members or to employer sponsors. The government has received widespread support for this initiative; in fact, I wish to  refer to a number of positive comments that have been made. The superannuation spokesman for the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, Mr Murray Wyatt, said that the government has listened to the complaints from the sector. He said:
There are still some technical issues which need to be addressed, but it is very much a step in the right direction.
Mr Ross Stephens, a superannuation director at KPMG, said:
. . . this would help many small businesses by providing them with an additional source of capital.
Ms Sarah Birkensleigh, a partner responsible for superannuation consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said:
. . . the proposed change was a boost for small family owned businesses.
Ms Philipa Smith, CEO of ASFA, said:
The Government is to be congratulated for responding to the concerns of the superannuation industry on the investment rules . . . The new rules announced by Senator Kemp represent significant and welcome changes.
The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business said:
The new arrangements reflect this Government's willingness to listen and respond to the concerns of the small business sector.
I know that all members of this place would adopt the comments made by the honourable minister I quoted.
In 1993, the then Labor government proposed no exception at all for real business property from the acquisition of assets rule, and it was the coalition that helped small business by moving the amendment for the 40 per cent exception. This government has not only supported do-it-yourself funds using 40 per cent of fund assets to purchase real business property but it has extended this to 100 per cent to assist small business owners.
The honourable member for Wills, in his contribution earlier, indicated that the opposition does not support DIY funds using 100 per cent of their assets to acquire small business property, on the basis that it seems fraught with danger. The government's view is that it will be a matter for fund trustees as to whether or not they will use business real property exceptions.
The other requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 will continue to apply, including the requirement that fund trustees formulate an investment strategy which takes into account a range of factors, including the risks and returns of investments. Subject to the general requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, a superannuation fund trustee can already invest 100 per cent of fund assets in a single asset other than in-house assets or assets acquired from a member. The new investment rules ensure that this flexibility also applies to business real property such as a shop or office used for a member's business.
The underlying objectives of the investment rules imposed on superannuation funds are longstanding. It was the former Labor govern 
 ment that restricted borrowing by superannuation funds in the 1987 regulations and then again in 1993 in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Not only is the opposition opposing helping small business, through its approach to the business real property exemption they are opposing preserving the integrity of the very rules they put in place. All that this bill does is to make sure that these rules cannot be avoided.
The honourable member for Wills was wrong in stating that there is no supporting evidence for the new investment rules. In 1997, the then superannuation regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, undertook a survey of excluded funds. The survey provided evidence that a proportion of superannuation funds were investing in related trusts, and it appeared that a significant proportion of these trusts were geared. Submissions received on the new investment rules clearly confirm that a number of superannuation funds were borrowing. Borrowing, by its nature, increases the scope for losses, and that is why these longstanding principles are in place.
In his speech, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro addressed Labor's claims that these changes are unfair on small business. He recalled vividly the disastrous effect that Labor's high interest rates policy had on his own small business. He emphasised the paramount concern of protecting the integrity of superannuation and the purpose for which superannuation exists. He stressed that this legislation will encourage small businesses which operate a superannuation fund.
The member for Hunter claimed that funds should be allowed to invest in geared trusts. I just want to place on the record that superannuation funds are restricted from borrowing in order to limit risk. We must always remember the purpose of superannuation. That has always been an element of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The member for Hunter suggested that the bill will reduce the rate of return for small funds. The facts are quite to the contrary. The member for Hunter should note that small funds will still be able to invest in a wide range of investments, and these will remain a matter for fund trustees. 
 The in-house asset rules will apply only to transactions with related trusts and other related entities. It is appropriate that investment in these assets be limited.
The member for Hunter suggested that the legislation will reduce investment in rural and regional Australia and harm small business. That is a complete and total nonsense. Superannuation funds will still be able to invest in regional Australia and small business, and the bill addresses only transactions in related trusts and other related entities. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are special concessions for small funds investing in business real property.
The member for Groom, in his very capable speech, highlighted Labor's policy failures in the area of superannuation, and he emphasised the extensive consultation which the government has gone through in developing the legislation being presented here today.
The honourable member for Grayndler, who spoke a moment ago, focused very much on the question of superannuation entitlements of same sex couples. It is an issue with which he has been associated for some time and it is an issue which I do not intend to address at length in my summing up. I have been concentrating on the specific provisions of this particular bill. He did, however, suggest that the government was unsure about what to do with superannuation resulting in delays in bringing this particular legislation forward. The honourable member for Grayndler ought to take cognisance of the fact that this government is a consulting government. We have spoken widely with members of the business community and others. We have given careful consideration to issues which were raised following the original announcement of the new investment rules. Following those consultations, we have made a number of changes, particularly to provide more generous transitional arrangements. The consultative period has been very beneficial because the changes which have been made are changes which were in keeping with many of the submissions that were put to us.
There are long-term benefits from ensuring that superannuation savings are invested prudently and preserved for retirement income 
 purposes, including savings to age pension outlays in the longer term. I want to rebut the claim made by the honourable member for Wills that the legislation will lead to uncertainty, confusion and costs on small business which operate superannuation funds, on the basis that the majority of funds will not be affected by these new measures as they are already complying with the spirit of the existing rules. All this bill does is maintain the integrity of those rules. To assist funds which had arrangements in place prior to 12 May 1998 there are generous transitional arrangements. Not only are existing investments grandfathered under the new rules, but special arrangements have been put in place for a range of circumstances, including where interposed entities have outstanding debt.
In conclusion, the investment rules are fair and reasonable and serve to further the objectives of retirement income policy in this nation; that is, to reduce risks to superannuation savings and ensure that superannuation is preserved for retirement income. These rules are needed to preserve the integrity of the superannuation rules. At this point in time, I would like to foreshadow a technical government amendment to be moved in the consideration in detail stage. I commend the bill to the chamber.
	 Question put:
	 That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Kelvin Thomson's  amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I suspect that if I have to speak for 20 minutes on this legislation I will be stretching my renowned capacity for debate. The opposition supports the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Border Interception) Bill 1999 . It is intended to amend the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 and the Trade Marks Act 1995. Those pieces of legislation together demonstrate an intention to protect the Olympics from ambush marketing and, of course, to protect the interests of legitimate sponsors and those who are committing substantial funding towards the success of the Sydney Olympics. It would undercut the effectiveness of that protection if goods were able to be brought into this country and were to go on the market in a way which undermined those entitlements and rights.
Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of the events. The organising committee relies 
 on the legal protections it has to the images, the five rings and the various other designs that are associated with the Olympics, so that it can license the use of those signs and images and raise funds through appropriate fees and sponsorships. The act already prohibits people from taking commercial advantage of unlicensed production of such goods and the Sydney 2000 Games Act and the Trade Marks Act contain border interception customs measures to protect the games and the rights of those trade mark owners.
However, there is a discrepancy between the seizure power of Customs and its obligation to notify the designated owner of the seized goods under the border interception provisions of both acts. Goods will only infringe those acts if the goods are used in the course of trade or for commercial purposes. What this does is close off a small loophole that dealt with goods coming into the country, low-value shipments, which would not have been caught by the provisions as they were first designed. The opposition is quite relaxed about these provisions. The amendments will not apply to goods imported for personal use. They do not apply to goods which are imported by a single individual, but they do prevent somebody sending a series of small packages into Australia under the designated amount, which would otherwise undermine the legitimate interests of the Olympics committee in respect of the rights that are vested in it under the existing legislation.
The opposition is very happy to support this legislation. Its only general comment is that the willingness of the government to enact a comprehensive framework for copyright protection for the Olympics—and, one would hope, to supply, through Customs and the Australian Federal Police, an appropriate regime of policing—might be contrasted more largely with the position that applies to intellectual property at large. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, that you are Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on which I serve, and one of our inquiries presently is about the enforcement regimes for intellectual property. Whilst obviously our recommendations have yet to 
 be discussed, I think it is quite generally the case that there have been some concerns expressed through the evidence about both the adequacy of the legal regime and the adequacy of resources available through the Australian Federal Police and other enforcement agencies to protect intellectual property rights.
We are very happy to endorse this legislation, which really is a belt and braces approach in respect of the Olympics. We have a rolls-royce scheme where every loophole is closed and I imagine every enforcement devised is brought to bear to ensure that the IOC is not offended by unlicensed sales and the availability of unlicensed product in Australia in the course of the Olympics—and the community I think would generally accept that that goes with the territory of holding such an event—but nonetheless when you go to the larger field of protection of intellectual property, not only do we not have a belt and braces regime but many people are inquiring whether we actually have the trousers. I think there is some real sense among those who are engaged in the creation of intellectual property that we are really not adequately able to protect the interests of those who are making their income through the production of ideas, creative processes and the licensing of product.
In the long run that will be very much against the idea that the Australian Labor Party wish to develop in respect of the creative industries where we actually see them as being a driving force not just for Australian cultural identity but also for the economic advantage of the nation at large. I do not suspect that the government would wish it otherwise, but I can only speak for this side of the House. We would say, whatever the intentions of government, that it is plain there have been sound deficiencies allowed to emerge in the regime and protection that is available.
We are particularly concerned with the enforcement regime because over the past four or five years there has been a significant reduction in reports which I have had made to me regarding the capacity of the Australian Federal Police and other investigative agencies to seriously address breaches of intellec 
 tual property law. That is not to say that the law is completely adequate. In fact, the evidence we are hearing shows that there are many areas where we could make recommendations for improvement to the law. Even if the law were to be improved, unless there is a will, a commitment and adequate resources on the enforcement side to match that legislative framework, then it is likely that the outcomes which the parliament would seek to achieve would not be obtained.
I am very concerned because I have had reports that, except in a very limited range of cases, in the vast majority of matters where those who make complaints about breaches of copyright laws, unlicensed products being brought into Australia and the like, the standard response of the Australian Federal Police has been to write a letter indicating that, although they recognise that it may involve an allegation of a breach of a Commonwealth law, they have to make resource and priority decisions and that, regrettably, they are not able to pursue an investigation. I am afraid that has become far too prevalent.
That is very much the standard response now in relation to allegations of quite serious breaches of intellectual property laws, laws which require public enforcement not merely private enforcement. It reflects two things: firstly, a general run-down in the resourcing of the Australian Federal Police; and, secondly, even within the resourcing of the Australian Federal Police, inadequate recognition by the government in its working through of agendas with the agency as to how important it is to provide a framework regime in Australia where those who make their livings from the creative side of the production of intellectual product—and that does not just include artists and music production; it includes a whole range of those who are engaged in design work and work associated with labels on products and a range of other activities where essentially either the copyright law or trademark law provides protection—are not able to have adequate protection through law enforcement.
I know that our committee is struggling with those issues. I look forward to a report which identifies ways in which the legislative 
 framework can be strengthened. Also, one would hope that we are able to canvass the issue of the adequacy of the resources that are given over to investigative agencies to pursue these matters. Perhaps it is a little like the way domestic violence was regarded some 15 or so years ago, when essentially it was seen as a private dispute. We now look back on the assessment and say, `How could it be so that our law enforcement agencies regarded domestic violence as essentially something which never warranted the enforcement side of the law to intervene, except where grave harm was occasioned to one party?' The consequence of that was that many women and some men lived lives of quiet terror. We slowly recognised that there was a requirement for law enforcement to become much more engaged in that area.
It is a very different environment, but the protection of intellectual property is an area where we need to make the same kind of larger mind-set shift of seeing this as not merely a dispute between two commercially interested parties but also a matter in which the nation has a significant interest. If we are going to provide a framework where those who provide services, those who are engaged in creative activity, those who are engaged in the production of software, those who are engaged in the production of film, television and music and those who are engaged in the production of manufactured goods which are associated with trademarks and packaging have confidence that in future their legitimate commercial interests are going to be adequately protected, they have to be aware that criminal infringements of their copyright will be the subject of some investigation.
It is true that there will always be minor infringements and the like, and you cannot expect the Australian Federal Police or any other law enforcement agency to pursue every issue that comes before it. But significant breaches of copyright law which go entirely uninvestigated in the first place and then unpunished by criminal law, notwithstanding what the statutes say, really send a very wrong message. Whilst I do not want in any way to downplay what I think should be the primary responsibility of those who profit 
 from such enterprises, they themselves must at least take some share of the responsibility of ensuring that their interests are not taken advantage of. They can hardly complain to us if they make no effort in that regard. On the other hand, if they turn to us and say, `We are putting forward matters to show that there have been breaches of the criminal law,' and then they find that the consistent response of the government is that there are no resources available to pursue it and that we will not elevate this as an issue of any priority, they are entitled to look at our regime and say, `You're not really taking copyright law seriously. You're not taking the economic interests that we have in relation to this intellectual property seriously. You're going through a process akin to a charade.'
We are very much aware of the intensity of feeling with the organisation of the Olympics. One of the conditions of holding the Olympics is that we provide a very strict regime of protection for these marks and indicia. Of course, the reason for that is that the Olympics makes the money that turns the whole show on around licensing arrangements which allow only the authorised licensee of those marks to associate themselves with the games as an event.
We well understand that these things have a very significant commercial value and that they are not trivial in their consequences. This bill is not addressing the very high end of town, where companies are associated with multimillion dollar sponsorship packages and the like; it is actually addressing quite low order breaches which are potentially available. The only goods that would come in under these small packages of limited value are probably T-shirts or something of that kind. We understand that even that is unacceptable, and we are obviously prepared to pass this legislation through the federal parliament to make the strictest and most comprehensive framework of intellectual property law that Australia has ever had. I am certain that we would then back it up as far as we could with the resources available to us with enforcement measures. That would be expected of us.
I think that we have to show the same willingness in the larger environment, again 
 accepting that not every breach will be the subject of investigation or prosecution. The present circumstance, where it is the most extraordinary event only that is pursued and the vast majority of complaints of breaches of intellectual rights that are made to law enforcement authorities are simply dismissed with a standard form letter, appears to me to be very unsatisfactory. The truth is that, as many of the breaches are undertaken by people who have set up regimes which are really shams in their own right, the exercise of civil remedies does not usually provide an adequate measure of recompense to those who seek its protection. I guess that the committee will be coming to the parliament with a series of recommendations which I hope, together with enforcement enhancement, will go towards an improved outcome.
 I understand that today the government announced what it asserted to be an extra $115 million for the Australian Federal Police. Stripped back, a very significant component of that—I think in the order of $50 million—is going to be obtained essentially through internal cost reduction measures within the Australian Federal Police. So, although an announcement is made of an additional $115 million, essentially there is only $65 million in new money over three years.
That may well be at least some start to enable the Australian Federal Police to overcome some of the difficulties it has had. It has not only faced resourcing issues which have limited its capacity to work in this field but also lost some of its most experienced and capable staff in a whole range of areas relating to computer crime. Of course, you would appreciate that when an organisation like the AFP loses some of its most experienced and capable investigators they are very hard to replace. Even though there has been some recruitment at the bottom, the loss of experienced staff at the top has been associated with considerable uncertainty as to the funding base of the Australian Federal Police. Its morale has been reduced. It has responsibility for the whole area of Commonwealth law enforcement, but the menu of matters that it actually pursues in terms of the priorities that 
 it is funded to be able to address has been reducing all the time. That does of course flow through into areas such as this where there has been a real falling off of willingness to take this issue up, notwithstanding its importance to our national economy as a significant area of AFP enterprise. I indicated at the outset that it would be a struggle to speak for 20 minutes. I managed my 20 minutes, but I think it will be a struggle to make the 30.
Mr Anthony interjecting—
—He's up to it.
—Both the minister and the shadow minister at the table, the Minister for Community Services and the member for Wills respectively, have complimented me by expressing confidence in my powers of persuasion, but I think I have reached the point at which I have indicated our approach in relation to this matter. In association with you, Mr Deputy Chairman Andrews, in the work of our committee, I hope we will be able to say some more flattering things rather than critical things about the government's response to copyright law enforcement in due course.",REPS,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT (BORDER INTERCEPTION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"May, Margaret, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—Next year Australians will share the dreams of our Olympians and Paralympians and invite the rest of the world to `Share the spirit'. The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games will be the largest peacetime event in Australian history. Two weeks after the Olympic flame is extinguished, the sporting prowess will continue at the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. At both events our athletes will test speed, strength and steely determination.
Behind the sporting achievements and smashing of world records is a commercial aspect. The lifeblood of the Olympics is corporate sponsorship, and the ability of the Olympic and Paralympic organising committees to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. The Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 protects official sponsors of the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic games from ambush or parasitic marketing practices by commercial rivals. The legislation also empowers the 
 Australian Customs Service to seize goods suspected of contravening the legislation. According to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, ambush or parasitic marketing can be defined as the unauthorised association by business of their names, brands, products or services with a sports event or competition through any one or more or a wide range of marketing activities—unauthorised in the sense that the controller of the commercial rights in such events, usually the relevant governing body, has neither sanctioned nor licensed the association itself or through its commercial agents.
In other words, corporations using ambush marketing are trying to reap a commercial benefit by associating themselves with a particular event without paying the price. In a submission by the government of New South Wales and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on ambush marketing in 1995, examples were given of how these campaigns have been run in the past. An example raised at this committee investigation was that during the Seoul summer games in 1998 a T-shirt manufacturer designed a logo dubbed `Body and Soul' in honour of the summer games. During the 1994 Lillehammer winter games, Wendy's hamburger chain, a rival sponsor to McDonald's, paid for air time during the telecast to promote itself by using spoofs of winter sports while carefully avoiding mention of the Olympics.
To protect official sponsors from these sorts of incidents, the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996, also known as the Sydney 2000 Games Act, set up a licensing scheme restricting the use for commercial purposes of a range of words, phrases and images. The scheme effectively blocks an unlicensed company from using words, phrases or images to suggest a sponsorship arrangement with the games or other support for them. The list includes `Games City'; `Millennium Games'; `Sydney Games'; `Sydney 2000'; any combination of the word `games' and `2000'; `Olympiad'; `Olympic'; `share the spirit'; `summer games'; `Team Millennium'; any combination of the words 
 `27th' and `Olympic' or `games'; the use of the word `Olympian' or `Olympic' with `gold', `silver' or `bronze'; and the use of any visual or oral representation representing a connection with the Olympic or Paralympic Games.
The Sydney 2000 Games Act contains numerous exceptions, allowing for the continued operation of rights and liabilities under the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the provision of factual information, criticism and review of the games such as in newspapers, magazines and broadcasts. The exemption for factual information is a vital distinction between the Sydney 2000 Games Act and an earlier act, the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980. It tried to limit the use of a wide range of words in the run-up to the 1988 bicentennial year, such as `1788', `1988' and `88' in conjunction with `Sydney' or `Melbourne'. In Davis v. Bicentennial Authority, the High Court ruled that the net had been too wide, pointing out that the use of `Family Law Conference Melbourne 1988' would have infringed the legislative scheme. The court said that the legislation allowed the authority to regulate the use of common expressions and made unauthorised use a criminal offence.
In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, the Hon. Warren Entsch, made a pertinent point that the Sydney 2000 Games Act does not affect the community's fundamental right to freedom of expression. He said:
This is particularly the case in relation to words that have passed into common language. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the use of games indicia and images apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.
The second reading speech of the original bill made it very clear that the Sydney 2000 Games Act is not intended to limit the reasonable needs of sporting bodies to (a) raise money and (b) promote their athletes in the lead-up to the Olympics and Paralympics. Nevertheless, the government still recommends that these bodies negotiate memorandums of understanding with games organisers as a safeguard if they intend to use the protected words, symbols or images.
At the Sydney 2000 Olympics Australia is showcasing our best assets. The Sydney Olympic Games will cost more than $2 billion to stage. Commercial sponsorship is crucial. It is expected to provide a large chunk of that figure—$840 million. According to recent estimates reported in the Australian Financial Review, it was reported in August 1999 that approximately $700 million had been raised in sponsorship. Sponsorship is the largest revenue stream, behind only television rights, which account for approximately $1 billion. Principal international Olympic sponsors pay about $US40 million per category for exclusive rights. Obviously all sponsors will want to make sure they are going to get their money's worth before they sign up.
In addition, New South Wales has agreed to make up any shortfall in SOCOG's funding. This means that if sponsorship targets are not met it is likely that the citizens of New South Wales will pay. It is crucial to have in place the safeguards embedded in this legislation to ensure sponsorship targets are met and Australians do not lose out. The amendments proposed in this bill will empower the CEO of Customs to identify the owner of imported goods that seek to ambush the Sydney 2000 Olympics or Paralympics marketing and those goods which carry infringing trademarks, whether or not the goods are required to be entered under section 68 of the Customs Act 1901. This is a crucial issue we are discussing. As the period before the games is reasonably short, the CEO is likely to see an increasing number of imported goods that seek to ambush the games marketing.
The amendments currently before the House address a discrepancy between the seizure powers of the CEO and the CEO's obligation to notify the designated owner of seized goods under the border interception provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games Act and the Trade Marks Act. In some cases, goods that are entered and are worth less than $1,000 consigned by post or $250 consigned by other means do not have a designated owner. Effectively, the CEO cannot seize the goods as there is no designated owner to identify. This discrepancy undermines the intent of the border interception provisions of the Sydney 
 2000 Games Act and the Trade Marks Act. The bill currently before the House will amend both acts so that the definition of designated owner will be more appropriate. It will seek to restore the original objective of the acts to allow the CEO to seize all imported goods that seek to ambush the games marketing and goods that bear infringing trademarks, whether or not the goods are required to be entered. The effect of the proposed amendment is to empower Customs to determine that a person is the owner of goods, thereby enabling them to seize all imported goods that are subject to a notice of objection and seek to ambush games marketing.
As the parliamentary secretary pointed out in the second reading speech, the amendments set out in this bill are intended to apply only to goods that are used for commercial aspects, not to goods which are imported for personal use. As my colleague the Hon. Warren Entsch stated during his second reading speech:
The Olympic and Paralympic Games next year are events of great national significance.
He continued by saying:
These events provide unique opportunities to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements.
As the host country, we are obliged to provide adequate protection for sponsors under the terms of the contract between the host city, Sydney, the Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG. This bill enhances the protection available to SOCOG and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee against imported goods that seek to ambush their marketing activities and deprive organisers of funds necessary to host the games. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT (BORDER INTERCEPTION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—Almost six years ago to the day, on 23 September 1993, Sydney was elected by the International Olympic Committee to be the host city to stage the games of the 27th Olympiad in the year 2000. Also on that day, almost six years ago, the City of Sydney and the Australian Olympic Committee signed the host city contract with the IOC. The IOC, of course, is the international body established under Swiss law to guard and retain all the 
 rights relating to the Olympic Games throughout the world and is the supreme authority for the Olympic movement. The host city contract sets out in considerable detail the IOC requirements for the staging of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. In addition to the host city contract, the Olympic Charter and the endorsement contracts provide the governing rules and requirements for staging the 2000 Olympics.
The past six years have seen enormous activity within Australia in preparation for the staging of the games. The New South Wales and federal governments are directly providing substantial funds. In fact, the federal government is making a major contribution to the games. It is apparent that the success of the games means much more to Australia than just hosting the Olympics in the city of Sydney. Of course it means ensuring that Australian athletes can compete in the premier international sporting event in front of a home crowd and it means that Australians will have the opportunity to experience once more the Olympic Games in their own country. But it also means an enormous boost to the Australian economy, particularly from tourism. The games will provide unparalleled opportunities to Australian businesses.
The federal government has moved quickly in supporting the games, including providing cash grants and funding for the Sydney Olympic venues as well as federal funding for the preparation of our athletes. In fact, the federal government is assisting with the staging of the Olympic Games in a wide range of areas including drug testing, security, immigration, customs and quarantine, health care, communications, international air transport and promotions and the like. Likewise, the federal government has provided financial assistance for the Paralympic Games and will continue to support both games over the next 12 months and beyond to ensure that all Australians share the benefits and the opportunities that will be created by hosting one of the world's great sporting events.
One area where the Commonwealth government acted quickly, upon the election of Sydney as the host city, was in the area of legislative protection of the Sydney Olympic 
 Games words, symbols and other indicia. The Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act was passed in 1996. It was designed to protect the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games revenue from being undermined by the unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by corporate competitors of the official games sponsors. SOCOG has already raised something in the order of $700 million from official sponsorships to finance the games; so we can see the magnitude of the effort here and why it is so necessary to protect that revenue. The ability of the games organisers to achieve such targets will depend, to a large extent, on the degree of exclusivity of the indicia and images. The protection of this revenue source is of course of paramount importance to the success of the games.
The legislation before the House this evening—the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Border Interception) Bill 1999—seeks to extend the scope of the legislative protection for games organisers which has already been provided in the Sydney 2000 Games act as well as in the corresponding provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995. Before turning to the specific amendments, perhaps I should take this opportunity to reflect on the importance of the games and thus the intention and impact of the Sydney 2000 Games Act and of the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, both of which are to be amended with the passage of this bill.
The Olympic Games have the capacity to make an extraordinary impact upon not only New South Wales and its economy but Australia as a whole. There have been various reports as to the precise financial impact in terms of contribution to the national GDP, including an often quoted study of the economic impact of the Sydney 2000 Olympics Games by KPMG Peat Marwick released in 1993 as part of Sydney's bid for the 2000 Games. Whatever the actual details, there is no doubt that the 2000 Olympics will add billions of dollars over time to the economy. Who can judge what impact the images of Sydney and of Australia, as portrayed to billions of people in the worldwide television audience, will have next year and for many 
 years beyond the games? There is also no doubt that the games will lead to significant job creation with additional employment throughout Australia, although concentrating on New South Wales and Sydney.
There have been estimates as to the number of tourists who will visit Australia before, during and after the games, and we are all speculating on the positive impact on the current account from the increased tourism exports. Admittedly, we have evidence from past Olympic Games upon which to base any modelling. Huge losses were suffered at Montreal in 1976 but by 1984 the Los Angeles Games had turned a profit. We have had the more recent experience of the Atlanta 1996 Games where the windfall that many business operators anticipated did not eventuate, although, making the appropriate adjustments, it seems that a rough estimate of the total impact of the games was about $US4 billion for Georgia, with about $3 billion of that impact occurring in the year of the games in 1996. Obviously the post-Olympic impact is still being assessed and recorded.
So we in Australia must be focused on determining that the economic activity associated with the games is of the highest possible order, given the past debates and the degree of uncertainty that exists as to the size of the direct Olympic impacts and the estimate of the flow-on impacts. It is against this background that we appreciate the importance of a focus on the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the Sydney and Paralympic Games. I acknowledge the gracious acceptance by the member for Denison of the significance of this legislative regime, notwithstanding the minor nature of these particular amendments. He did manage to fill his 10 minutes rather eloquently.
The Sydney 2000 Games Act walks a very fine line between protecting the legitimate private interests of investors in the Sydney 2000 Games, the interests of traders who already use Olympic indicia and images, and the right of free speech. Its purpose was to eliminate what is termed ambush marketing, although that is not a term which is used in the act. Put simply, this means the unauthor 
 ised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for the marketing rights—so free riding.
It seems that the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events engage mostly in these activities. In essence, ambush marketing can be effective in creating the perception that the so-called free rider is in fact the official sponsor or an official sponsor. It can have the effect of dissuading official sponsors from continuing their association with the games and can also undermine the value of marketing rights. There have been a number of well-known ambush marketing examples, including the Nike-Reebok sneakers war in Barcelona. Perhaps an even better known example was during the 1992 Winter Games where Visa had paid millions of dollars to be the official sponsor in the credit card category and had advertised that the Olympics `only take Visa', although I think their ads went so far as to say, `If you are going to the Olympics, the ticket collectors do not take Amex.' Amex hit back. American Express is reported to have counted with corrective advertisements, including one they used in France which said `Remember—to visit Spain you do not need a Visa'. Market research suggested that this sort of advertising was effective. While Visa was recognised as the official sponsor by 55 per cent of respondents, American Express was thought to be the official credit card provider by some 30 per cent.
I should point out that Amex defended its approach and justified its advertising as not a form of ambush marketing but a defence of its brand name. That may well be the case. But there are sufficient concerns with the misuse of Olympic words and symbols to suggest moves to protect authorised and licensed users against ambush marketing and to ensure that official sponsorship revenue for the games not be at risk. The Sydney 2000 Games Act lists the rights, indicia and images specified in the act with the organising committees and enables the organising committees to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the act, but for commercial purposes.
Judging by the Atlanta Games experience, the protection provided by the Sydney 2000 Games Act should not be undervalued. It seems that in preparation for the Atlanta Games the relevant authorities in the United States, including the United States Olympic Committee, wrote to some 40,000 establishments throughout the United States warning them that they were illegally using the Olympic name or trademark. So the focus of the principal act is a financial one. It is to protect the interests of commercial sponsors of the Olympics Games and thereby to ensure the financial viability of the games.
In broad terms, the act provides protection to indicia and images which encompass words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Indicia and images are taken to be applied to goods and services in the very wide circumstances set out in section 10 of that act. An importer of offending goods is deemed to be the person who has applied the indicia or images to the offending goods and it is the use for commercial purposes that is prohibited by the act. The relevant games insignia and images can be used for commercial purposes only by SOCOG, SPOC and a licensed user under section 12.
Most importantly for the purposes of the bill before the House, SOCOG, SPOC—SPOC being not St Peter's Old Collegians but the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee—and licensed users have the right to object to the importation of goods that have applied to them the Sydney 2000 Games indicia or images and that a person is identified as the owner of the goods. So both the Sydney 2000 Games Act and the Trademarks Act have extensive provisions dealing with imported goods which contravene the Sydney Games Act. SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users have the right to object to the importation of goods that have applied to them Sydney 2000 Games images. A person must be identified as the owner of the goods under the Customs Act and be not authorised by or licensed under the act to use the goods for commercial purposes. The Chief Executive Officer of Customs is given the power to seize offending goods, which can then be 
 forfeited or released. These sections interact with the injunctions power under section 43.
The main remedies under the act for SOCOG, SPOC and the licensed users are in fact injunctions, corrective advertisements and damages. There is an interesting position in relation to remedies in that, pursuant to section 37, a person having a sufficient interest may be joined as a respondent in an injunction application in relation to seized goods. This may cover cases where the person designated as owner for the purposes of the act is not the real owner in terms of who was intended to deal with the imported goods on arrival in Australia. Wholesalers, distributors and retailers may be deemed to have a sufficient interest to be joined to any proceedings. The court is given power to order that goods be forfeited to the Crown or released to the owner, and to award a compensation in the event that the court decided that the injunction should not be granted.
It is in this area that the bill before the House seeks to address amendments. Specifically, a discrepancy is seen to exist between the seizure powers of the CEO of Customs and his obligation to notify the designated owner of seized goods under the border interception provisions of the two acts. The protection afforded by the border interception provisions in both acts is not automatic. In both acts, before any action may be taken, the CEO of Customs must have received a notice objecting to the importation of goods which are presumably seeking to ambush the games marketing or goods infringing a registered trademark.
At present, section 29 of the Games Act defines `designated owner' as the person identified as the owner of the goods on the import entry made in relation to the goods under section 68 of the Customs Act. Section 68 of the Customs Act excludes several types of goods from the general requirement to be entered, including goods consigned by post worth less than $1,000 or goods worth less than $250 consigned by other means. Goods which are not entered do not have a designated owner, and as such under the current legislative regime Customs cannot seize them because there is no designated owner to 
 notify. The proposed amendments seek to empower Customs to determine that a person is the owner of goods, thereby enabling Customs to seize all imported goods that are subject to a notice of objection and thus seeking to ambush games marketing.
Specifically, the amendment which allows the CEO or an officer of Customs to determine that a person is the designated owner of goods states that the definition of the owner includes `any person being or holding himself out to be the owner, importer, exporter, consignee, agent, or person possessed of, or beneficially interested in, or having any control of, or power of disposition of the goods'. It is very wide. Therefore, where no-one is identified as the owner of the goods on the import entry, the designated owner can be so determined by Customs in accordance with that amendment.
There is no doubt that Customs has already seized a significant number of consignments under the border interception provisions, and it is likely to encounter an increasing number of these consignments in the next 12 months in the countdown to the games. Although the amendments are directed to goods consigned by post worth less than $1,000 or goods worth less than $250 consigned by other means, that is, goods that do not have to be entered under section 68 of the Customs Act, considerable numbers of such consignments could occur and could, in a slow but insidious way, undermine the intent of the border interception provisions of the act.
While it will be difficult to determine the scale of economic losses which could result from illegal conduct under the Sydney 2000 Games Act or the Trademarks Act, there is no doubt that infringement of intellectual property rights can have enormous economic consequences. We have seen that, both here and overseas. Counterfeiting and piracy alone have been estimated to cost Australian industries around $400 million a year—and this is not related to the Sydney 2000 Games. At a global level, the International Trade Commission estimates that infringement of intellectual property rights is costing at least $US60 billion a year in lost sales, and these figures are on the rise worldwide. It is important, 
 against that background, to ensure that we give the greatest level of protection for the Sydney Games and its all-important sponsorship. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT (BORDER INTERCEPTION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1999-09-20,"—in reply—In summing up the second reading debate on the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Border Interception) Bill 1999 , I thank all members for their contributions. In particular I would like to acknowledge and thank the member for Denison, who spoke in support of the bill and its aim to protect the Sydney Olympics and Paralympics from ambush marketing, as well as the issues of enforcing intellectual property more generally. The member for McPherson highlighted the ability of ambush marketing to undermine commercial sponsorship of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and Paralympics and the importance of the Sydney 2000 Games Act in protecting the games revenue.
The member for Curtin, whose contribution I acknowledge, spoke of the impact of the Sydney 2000 Games on the Australian economy—a very significant impact at that—and the assistance given by the federal government to the games, and the importance of the Sydney 2000 Games Act in protecting games revenue from ambush marketing. The member for Curtin also went into some detail on the various remedial actions that are available to owners of intellectual property and the additional empowerment of the CEO of Customs which is very important as part of this legislation.
The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Border Interception) Bill will improve the protection available to the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee against imported goods that seek to ambush their marketing activities. The bill will also improve the protection available to owners of registered trade marks against imported goods that bear infringing trade marks.
The benefits resulting from passage of this bill will help ensure the integrity of the border interception provisions of both the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) 
 Protection Act 1996 and the Trade Marks Act 1995. Passage of this bill will give trademark owners greater protection from imported counterfeited goods which, in turn, will give consumers increased certainty as to the trade origin of the goods they are buying. In particular, passage of this bill will also aid the games organising committees in their efforts to raise, from sponsorship and licences, the revenue necessary to conduct the games.
This is not an insignificant issue. As I mentioned in the second reading speech, one of the critical factors in making the games an outstanding success is the ability of the games organising committees to raise the funds necessary to host the games. In its 1998 annual report, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games estimated that it needed to raise in the vicinity of $800 million from official sponsorships and licensing fees to meet its budget for the games. The ability of the games organising committees to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. If the parliament had not enacted the Sydney 2000 Games Act to protect the games organising committees against ambush marketing, the official sponsorship revenue for the games may well have been at risk.
Nevertheless, despite our best efforts, counterfeiters and manufacturers of bogus goods are becoming more and more sophisticated in their operations. Most counterfeiters now have the means available to reproduce goods so closely resembling the original articles that it is almost impossible for the average consumer to tell them apart. Furthermore, those who seek to ambush market the games are continually trying to find ways to circumvent the legislation in order to achieve their objective. I am confident that in most cases they will fail. However, if it were not for this bill, it is likely that the more sophisticated ambush marketeer would import large numbers of small consignments of bogus games goods in order to circumvent the border interception provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games Act.
In this regard, I am pleased that there is broad support for this bill, especially in this final year leading up to the games. As with 
 the passage of the Sydney 2000 Games Act, the passage of this bill will send a clear message to those who seek to ambush the Sydney 2000 Games that the Australian people will not accept such unethical behaviour. I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS AMENDMENT (BORDER INTERCEPTION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—We are debating at this late hour a very important bill: the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . I have to say that it is with great sadness that we come into this House to debate this bill because, basically, it represents the emasculation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. We can see this from the very nature of its basic clauses, even as described by the Parliamentary Library. The library talks about the fact that this bill is intended to restructure the new commission by abolishing—I repeat abolishing—the five specific commissioners responsible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, human rights, disability, race and sex discrimination and replacing them with three deputy presidents. Whereas previously we have had those important distinct areas of human rights with a commissioner for each, we now will have only three so-called deputy presidents who will each have a massive workload. Just let me go through what the three areas will be.
One area will comprise human rights and disability discrimination. Disability discrimination is one of the biggest areas of the human rights commission, yet it is to be lumped together with all general human rights 
 issues. This means that one person will be responsible for issues both of human rights and of disability discrimination—a very difficult task to put together.
The second one will be racial discrimination and social justice. I assume that the social justice area is that which previously existed with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission, but racial discrimination is a separate category from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice issues. They are interrelated in a sense, but the racial discrimination category applied to all ethnicities, all races and all peoples, whereas the social justice category was specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In that sense we are again putting under one head discrete responsibilities which were important in identifying and strengthening weaknesses in the area of human rights in our society.
The category of sex discrimination and equal opportunity is closer to the one that existed before, but for many months the government failed to appoint a sex discrimination commissioner—there was a vacuum in the commission for a long time while we waited for the government to do something in this area of human rights. These changes to the commission will be serious changes. They reflect the government's obsession with downgrading the commission and its activities. The game is given away by the fact that a clause in this bill will create a requirement for the Attorney-General to grant approval before the commission can seek leave to intervene in a court proceeding relating to human rights and discrimination. The commission will have to seek the approval of the Attorney-General before it can do this.
This bill is about trying to reduce the powers of the commission when it intervenes in cases concerning human rights issues which have a political nature or which the government has interpreted as having a political nature. Obviously one cannot differentiate the issue of human rights from the general flow of politics in a society.
The backward steps that are being taken in this bill are a reflection of what has been happening in this country in the last few 
 years. In the 1980s and the early 1990s we developed a proud record in terms of Australia's active support and participation in human rights issues. In the last few years we have been moving away from that to the point where we are criticised in international circles for our human rights record—and rightfully so in certain cases—and we are becoming more blase about human rights abuses.
Indeed, it can be argued that we now criticise human rights breaches in other countries but we believe that somehow these things do not happen here—that we do not have those sorts of problems in Australia. Although our record is good compared with many other countries, the claim that we are the best country in the world in terms of human rights is not correct. We could be doing better. In some areas our treatment of human rights is unacceptable.
I want to mention a couple of the areas which I have had something to do with in recent times. The first one is refugee policy and the way we treat refugees who come into this country. The refugee issue has gained a new focus as a result of what has been happening in East Timor, but one of the things that people have not focused on is that, for a very long time, we refused to recognise as refugees the Timorese people who came to Australia following the Timor crisis. We refused to extend to them the hand of friendship even though in geographical terms Timor is in our backyard. It is a major responsibility for us, yet for many years when people came here from East Timor we said, `You can't claim refugee status because the former power was Portugal. You should go off to Portugal rather than to Australia to claim any kind of refugee status.' In relation to East Timorese refugees that was a mistaken policy. It is a policy which has taken us a long time to rethink.
It is only because of the very recent events that we are thinking that we might have made a mistake in relation to this matter. Our hypocrisy on this issue was breathtaking because, on the one hand we said that we did not recognise Portugal as having legitimate rights in East Timor because we recognised the annexation by Indonesia, but on the other 
 hand we said that refugees coming from East Timor were Portugal's responsibility—that we had no responsibility in the matter. That is just one example.
When talking about refugee policy, we can go beyond the Timor issue and mention the following fact: we now have a law in this country which does not even give immigration officials discretion—according to a statement made to me just today by the enforcement section of Immigration—in dealing with people who arrive by boat or by aeroplane without papers. It might be possible to argue that people who are escaping from a terrible regime are more likely not to have papers than to have them. But the current position is that when people arrive without papers, especially when they arrive at an airport, we immediately put them in detention. This detention is a form of imprisonment, because these people remain in detention for a long time—for many months and sometimes for years—while we go through the process of refugee determination. We do not even give our officers discretion to say whether a person could perhaps live with relatives or friends in the community, participate in community affairs or even work while a determination is being made about their future. Many other countries do not do this, at least for the majority of people who arrive. So it is false to think that we have the most progressive policy in these matters. We should at least be giving immigration officers discretion to make a determination as to whether a person would be better off in the community until their refugee status is determined.
The situation is even worse than this, because we also have an insidious regulation in the immigration system—which I have referred to in a motion before the parliament—and that is Migration Series Instruments 244. This regulation permits immigration officers to determine that a person in a detention centre is a threat to others in the centre, and it permits them to take that person to a state prison without charges. Think what this means. A person arriving in Australia claiming refugee status can be put in a detention centre and then, if an immigration officer 
 or an official of a detention centre considers that person to be a nuisance, for whatever reason, they can be moved into a state prison without being charged with a crime. This has actually happened in the case of six or seven persons in the Maribyrnong Detention Centre in Melbourne. I have raised this matter in this parliament, with the Ombudsman and with the human rights commission.
People living in the centre made many complaints to Amnesty International and to other organisations about conditions in the centre. There was a rebellion and six persons who were part of a general disturbance were taken from the centre to the state prison. This event occurred nearly seven weeks ago. It was not played up by the media in Australia because the media do not focus on human rights issues in Australia. They are very good at focusing on human rights issues overseas, but they do not focus on human rights issues in Australia.
These persons are still in the prison. They have not been charged with any offence, and they are treated as if they are criminals. This is a situation which is unacceptable in a civilised society. It is a situation which is contrary to the spirit of the Westminster system under which a person is not put into prison for any long period of time unless they are charged with an offence. As I have said, these persons have not been charged with offences.
This particular regulation has been condemned by a number of bodies, including the Refugee Council of Australia, the human rights commission and others. No person should be transferred from a detention centre, which is bad enough, to a prison, unless they are charged with some crime. I have taken a bit of time to refer to this specific issue because it is an example of why we need a strong human rights commission.
I now want to refer to a slightly more general matter. It concerns the fact that the Race Discrimination Commissioner will now have many other responsibilities. This comes at a time when the number of complaints to the commission based on racial prejudice and ethnic prejudice in this country have dramati 
 cally increased. Of course we know that this is partly due to the development of the Hanson phenomenon and the rise of One Nation—with their very unacceptable philosophy which attacked multiculturalism, attacked people on a racial basis and discriminated based on race. While they were the extreme element, unfortunately, because of the publicity they received and because of the attitude of the mainstream media to these issues, we now have the feeling that people can go around and effectively use forms of racial discrimination and get away with it. Even though we have laws against it, the laws are not being sufficiently enforced. Many people are treating the laws as a joke.
As you know, there was a debate some years ago as to whether there would be criminal sanctions in this area of racial discrimination, and the parliament decided not to proceed on that path. We have only the civil sanctions and, of course, the role of the commission in negotiation. But this is not good enough. It is not good enough because of the fact that discrimination is on the rise. Discrimination against people because of their racial and ethnic background is on the rise, and it needs to be countered.
This is where the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Attorney-General and other ministers have a special responsibility to this parliament and to this society. They have a special responsibility to fight this. They have a special responsibility to speak out on this. One of their responsibilities is to ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has sufficient resources to do its job in this particular area. I have been talking to people at the human rights commission, and they are concerned about the reduction in resources. They are concerned that there has been an increase in complaints but no increase in resources to deal with those complaints. They are concerned about the restructuring which the government has gone in for and the consequences of that restructuring in terms of the capacity of the commission to do its job.
If we are going to be a society which can be proud of its human rights record, rhetoric will not be enough. What will be needed in 
 this matter will be action in certain individual cases and it will also require action at the level of policy determinations. I am concerned that more and more of our policies in the immigration area, in the social justice areas and in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs are allowing a situation in which human rights are insufficiently protected. If we look at, for example, the area of indigenous social justice, we find that little has been done. We even have the phenomenon that, 10 years after the reports and the recommendations, Aboriginal deaths in custody remain a shame on this country and continue. We had the reports and the recommendations and nothing was done about it. This bill needs to be revised.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  is about two things. It is about reducing the resources of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and it is about reducing its powers. This bill makes substantial changes to the structure of the commission. I intend to address a number of those specific changes which I consider to be particularly problematic, but I want to briefly look at the history of this government's action in this area. It is a very grim history.
Cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are par for the course with this government. The record is one of consistently undermining human rights and of attacking those who speak up about human rights. This government has distinguished itself by attracting the attention of the United Nations on numerous issues, including Jabiluka and native title. For a developed, democratic country—the way we like to see ourselves—this is certainly very worrying. Indeed, the United Nations has directly criticised the bill that we are discussing tonight.
To make matters worse, this government has the temerity to dismiss the United Nations criticism as biased rather than face its own failure in key areas of human rights protection. In the face of our support for the UNrun ballot in East Timor, this is, I think, particularly ironic. We are saying to the 
 international community that the United Nations is a body that is to be respected and supported, yet when we are criticised ourselves by the United Nations we turn around and say, `No, we don't really support the United Nations; they've got it wrong on this one.' If the United Nations is to play an international role, countries like Australia must certainly take criticisms made by that body seriously.
It should come as no surprise that the government has attacked the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The most apparent way that the government has attacked the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is through consistent cuts in funding to HREOC. The government has reduced funding for the commission from $21.6 million in 1995-96 to $12.3 million in 1998-99 and to an average of only $10.6 million over each of the three out years. Once completed, these cuts will mean that, in real terms, the budget of the commission has been cut by an average of $13 million per year or 55 per cent. They are massive cuts and obviously have an effect on the commission's ability to do its work. In total, over the six years of Howard government budgets, the government will spend a staggering $57 million less in real terms on the commission than if 1995-96 funding levels had been maintained. That is an awfully large cut.
Despite the fact that the cuts announced by this government were not meant to take full effect until July 1998, the commission were forced for budgetary reasons to implement the cuts earlier than they had expected because there was no ancillary funding granted to meet the inevitable costs of redundancy packages. This means that the commission have been forced to sack approximately one-third of their 180 staff. As a result, they are now spending half a million dollars a year of their dramatically reduced budget paying for empty office space in their Castlereagh Street offices, not through any choice of their own or any mismanagement but because of the dramatic budget costs faced by them.
The government has also substantially eroded the legal aid system which exists, ideally, to allow people access to justice. This 
 has had particular effect on the enforcement of human rights. The Commonwealth-state legal aid agreements, which came into effect on 1 July 1997, contain the following guideline with respect to funding of equal opportunity and discrimination cases. It reads:
The Commission may grant assistance for equal opportunity/discrimination cases where there are strong prospects of substantial benefit being gained not only by the applicant but also by the public or any section of the public.
That means that applicants for legal aid funding need to prove that they have strong prospects of success, that those prospects are directed towards the attainment of substantial benefit and that not only the individual bringing the complaint will benefit, but that the wider community or group will also benefit. So they need to prove their case before they have the opportunity of proving their case. This is unfortunate, since one of the problems of discrimination is that it is usually the poorest and weakest members of the community who are faced with it, and they are the people least likely to be able to argue for this sort of benefit in the first instance.
In light of these dramatic cuts to funding and changes to legal aid, it is perfectly understandable that people are suspicious of these so-called reforms to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The first change, renaming the commission—from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission—is a particularly shallow and useless change. It reflects the adoption of current trendy terminology in this area, and it certainly does not make any difference at all to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's ability to do its work. In fact, the commission itself has suggested a simplification of its name simply to the Human Rights Commission. If there were going to be a name change, surely that would be the much more sensible one.
The inclusion of the term `responsibilities' is not unexpected from a government that is obsessed with winding back rights and entitlements and consistently tells people that they are not entitled to any of the things that we have come to expect from the civilised soci 
 ety that we live in. The Women's Electoral Lobby expressed it well in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when they said that the name change:
. . . could lead to assumptions that claims of human rights violations are made by those who are irresponsible, rather than those who are suffering disadvantage. This could lead to a situation where people feel they are unable or unwelcome to use this legislation.
The first change—the renaming of the commission—seems to me to be a particularly ridiculous move on the part of the government.
The abolition of specialised commissioners is perhaps even more serious than this. The bill proposes to eliminate the specialist commissioners. Until now, the human rights commission has operated with six commissioners—one for each of the following areas: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, human rights, privacy, race discrimination, sex discrimination and disability discrimination. The bill proposes to eliminate these, replacing them with three deputy presidents who will be responsible for social justice and race, sex discrimination and equal opportunity and human rights and disability. The Privacy Commissioner will remain a specialist function.
Given the cuts to funding already implemented, it is difficult to see how a reduction of personnel will improve the delivery of social justice at all. It is also difficult to see how reducing the number of commissioners to three will make any significant cost saving if the presumption is that their workload is not going to decrease; it will just be a matter of who is going to be doing which jobs. There were, in contrast, important reasons that specialist commissioners were instituted in the first place. Discrimination in our community is often the result of ignorance. For this reason, the specialist positions were designed to provide an opportunity to put in place people who, through their life experience, may have significant experience in an area of discrimination and would be able to bring that experience to bear in assisting our society to put prejudice and discrimination behind us.
To deprive these groups which are subject to discrimination of the limited resources that they now have in order to comply with the narrow understanding the government has of equality ignores both the problems particular groups face and the benefits that specialist service can provide. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is currently required to have `significant experience of community life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders'. It makes sense to have someone with such experience actually fulfilling the role designated for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner. It is no longer required of the deputy president responsible for social justice issues to have such experience. In fact, the title of the position makes no reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and I think this is of significant concern in itself because, once again, we are contributing to the disappearance of this group from public life.
I know, as well, that people from disability groups have had very serious concerns about the abolition of a specialist disability commissioner. From my discussions with disability groups, I understand they are particularly concerned that disability issues are frequently swept under the carpet and not treated as serious issues of discrimination; and that there is a high level of acceptance of people living with disabilities facing the sort of inconvenience that people living without disabilities would never tolerate in their everyday lives. These groups have said to me in the strongest terms that they object wholeheartedly on this change.
The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has called upon this government to `address as a matter of utmost urgency' the committee's concerns about the proposed changes to the overall structure of the Australian human rights commission, but most particularly it has expressed concern about the abolition of specialist commissioners. The government's response to this United Nations criticism has been embarrassing in the extreme, particularly now that we are engaged in a process of supporting the role of the United Nations in East Timor. To say that the 
 United Nations has the right to comment about Indonesia but has no ability to judge the domestic situation in Australia with any objectivity is embarrassing in the extreme.
The government has suggested that many of these changes are about refocusing the work of the commission onto education. I support education in this area—I think it is absolutely vital—but I would say that a successfully prosecuted discrimination case is a pretty good way of teaching a lesson not just to the people involved but everyone observing the case. It is a little difficult to expect the human rights commission to not only refocus on education, given the massive budget cuts it has received, but also meet its statutory requirements to conciliate, as it has in the past. The area that is most likely to suffer is the research that the commission does. I am sure that many members read the pregnancy discrimination report that was released recently. This is the sort of work that is vital in this area but, without continued funding, it is impossible for it to continue.
The bill removes much of the power of the commission to redress actual cases of discrimination. In that sense, all the talk about a refocus on education is absolutely useless. If the powers of the commission are reduced, the message that sends is that this government is not interested in discrimination; it is not serious about discrimination. There is no stronger message than that of removing the funding of an organisation or changing it and weakening its structure. In their submission to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights stated:
. . . to the extent that the HREOCA is the only legislation in Australia which contains a direct remedy for a breach of human rights . . . contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . . . it is in our view essential that this function not be watered down any further.
It is well and good to embark on education programs—and the commission should be adequately funded to do this—but education can only go so far when there are people suffering real and terrible discrimination right now. I mentioned earlier the commission's recent report on discrimination faced by pregnant women. This report highlighted the 
 extent of ongoing discrimination against women due to pregnancy or the anticipation of pregnancy. Women reported being denied employment, training and promotion, along with decreased security of employment generally. Yes, it is important to educate employers and employees about the rights of pregnant women, but it is also critical that those individuals facing the immediate effects of that discrimination have some remedy available to them.
The current Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act all provide the commission with the power to seek a court's leave to intervene in court proceedings that involve relevant human rights and discrimination issues—to act as a friend of the court. This bill proposes that intervention by the commission in court hearings must have the leave of the Attorney-General. This leads to serious problems. Unfortunately, I do not think I will have time to address them all today.
I conclude by saying that this legislation—because it reduces the powers and resources of the commission—will have very serious effects on the continued seeking of an end to discrimination in Australia. It is in line with the government's attacks on the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—obviously the government does not like the independent umpires in this area—and it follows continued attacks on legal aid and the ability of people to take action to defend their rights. It is to our discredit, to our national shame, I think, that in an area like this we have attracted the unfavourable attention of the United Nations and we just ignore that and say it is not important, that those rules count for other people but they do not count for us. I would like to see this legislation significantly altered or, even better, defeated.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—Since its inception in 1986, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has been charged with overseeing laws designed to ensure fairness and equity for all Australians. These include overseeing the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the 
 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, the Privacy Act and the Disability Discrimination Act. Aspects of the Native Title Act also fall under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission umbrella. The current government, however, is intent on implementing an agenda which would undermine Australians' access to justice in the face of discrimination.
The Australian Labor Party rejects all three of the changes the government is proposing in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  which we are debating tonight. These changes involve renaming the commission the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission; restructuring the commission, by replacing five specialist commissioners with three deputy presidents charged with mixed roles and—from my point of view this is the most serious change—requiring the commission to seek the approval of the Attorney-General before intervening in court proceedings related to human rights and discrimination. The first of these changes, which other people have spoken about, involves tampering—I have to say unnecessarily—with the name of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by renaming it the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission.
Since European settlement, one of the things Australians have been proud of has been our struggles for fair play, whether it has been over workers' rights, women's rights or, most recently, indigenous rights. And now, not only does the Howard government want to tamper with the legislation that protects these rights, but, by removing the words `equal opportunity' from the commission's name, it plans to sweep from public consciousness the very concept of equal opportunity. On the subject of responsibilities, not long ago a newspaper editorial in the Age said:
To those familiar with the Government's tense relationship with the Commission . . . the new emphasis (on responsibilities) sounds like an attempt to pull the Commission's teeth.
The second issue is where the government plans to abolish the five commissioners for human rights, Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
 Islander social justice, disability, race and sex discrimination, and replace them with three deputy presidents. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have ignored public outcry on this issue—both national objections and international objections and I understand even from within the Liberal Party as well—to maintain the current structure. It should be noted that the sixth current commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner, will be transferred from the auspices of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission following the passage of the Privacy Act.
That this government is watering down its commitment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is demonstrated by the way the commission has been treated. Others have already spoken about the budget cuts and I will not go over those. We need to look at the history since this government came to power. The commission's presidency was vacant for seven months before the current president was installed. The Human Rights Commissioner is currently doubling up as the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, and that position has remained unfilled since December 1997. For 18 months, those Australians with disabilities who are seeking redress for discrimination have been denied access to a commissioner who is a specialist in this field. That is not in any way a criticism of Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner, who had doubled as the Disability Discrimination Commissioner; rather, it is a reflection of the lack of commitment given the commission by this government.
Another example is the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's chair remaining unoccupied for 11 months following the resignation of the previous commissioner in February 1997. It was not filled until March 1998 and the delay in this appointment prompted the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women to publicly express its concern.
Australians depend on the specialist knowledge of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's five commissioners, experts in their field who have been responsible for keeping an eye on employers and 
 governments to ensure fair treatment for everyone. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General would just dismantle the current structure and compromise the commission's effectiveness by blurring the roles of the proposed deputy presidents. Instead of specific commissioners for human rights, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, disability, race and sex discrimination, this government is asking us to accept just three deputy presidents with those roles all rolled in together. It is a bid to meddle with the role of commissioners. The government is also proposing that complaints, currently forwarded to the relevant commissioner, should instead be channelled through the president. This is in accordance with the Attorney-General's aims which would change the new deputy presidents' roles to public education and advocacy, effectively wiping out the current commissioners' ability to pursue claims independently.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, in a report following an inquiry into this bill, recommended that the government not tamper with the structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Despite the fact that three of the six senators on this committee were government representatives, the Attorney-General is pushing ahead with this change. The principal architect of the Sex Discrimination Act, Chris Ronalds, said:
We will end up with a . . . weak and powerless organisation that doesn't have the depth of knowledge to develop specific campaigns. No-one will have any expertise because they will all be broad generalists.
The abolition of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has caused deep concern throughout the community and we also need to concentrate on what will happen with the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. That will be wiped out completely, leaving the nation's indigenous people with a deputy president charged with blanket responsibility for racial discrimination and social justice. In the wake of groundbreaking reports such as those on the stolen generation and deaths in custody, we all know so well that indigenous Australians face discrimination far and beyond 
 that faced by most other Australians. It is unbelievable that the Attorney-General should be so threatened by the concept of a specialist advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice that, in the face of these devastating inquiries, he would abolish this commissioner.
From my point of view, the third and most critical aspect of this bill is the Attorney-General's attempt to install himself as the gatekeeper of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Attorney-General is asking us to accept that the commission should seek his approval before intervening in court proceedings that involve issues of human rights or discrimination. This particular amendment, more than any other, threatens the independence of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and presents a conflict of interest for the Attorney-General. The amendment has prompted concern from a number of highly respected individuals and organisations, including Amnesty International and the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Alastair Nicholson, who said:
The possibility for the opportunity—or perception—of interference with the Commission should be prevented rather than legislated. This is particularly so when no apparent benefit flows from introducing the requirement of approval.
The Director of Research at the Australian National University's Centre for International and Public Law, Professor Hilary Charlesworth, and her colleague stated in their submission:
. . . it cannot be assumed that the Commonwealth government inevitably acts in accordance with human rights principles and because the very nature of human rights arguments often calls governmental actions into question, the grant of a veto to the Attorney-General over the ability of the Commission to intervene in a case effectively undermines the full protection of human rights in Australia.
In recent times, we have witnessed the Hindmarsh Island bridge case, the Teoh case and the B&B Family Law case. In all of these circumstances, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission made submissions that were fundamentally different from submissions made by the government of the day. 
 Herein lies the importance of an independent watchdog for the rights of all Australians.
Last year's New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission pay equity inquiry, an important landmark in the case for redressing the wage gap between men and women, is another case in point. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's input into the inquiry was very important. It argued that pay inequity is a fundamental denial of women's rights to equality, that the role of the antidiscrimination board in relation to the industrial relations system should be fostered and developed, that equality should be considered in mainstream industrial relations resolution processes, that pay equity principles should be developed in accordance with international human rights principles and that current legislative mechanisms which deal with individual complaints are insufficient and inadequate for addressing pay inequities which result from—and this is the important bit—systemic, structural and collective inequality.
Given the controversial nature of this government's industrial relations legislation, it is unlikely that the Attorney-General would give the commission leave to appear before such an inquiry in the future, but it is essential that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be able to maintain its independence and have the freedom to decide without fear or favour the appropriate time and place for intervention on behalf of the people of Australia. That the government would seek to increase the power of the Attorney-General in this manner flies in the face of the Paris principles to which Australia is a signatory. These principles set out an international minimum standard for human rights institutions, and independence from government is at their core.
It will be highly embarrassing for Australia, particularly in the current circumstances we find ourselves in—and I have no doubt the following speaker, the member for the Northern Territory, will talk about human rights in this regard—because Australia, up until now, has led the world in setting an example and working closely with Third World nations in particular in the formulation of world's best 
 practice for human rights. That the current Attorney-General's nose is out of joint over recent High Court cases where he found himself at odds with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission seems, as a result, undisputed, but his argument is extremely weak. He said:
The bill . . . will enable me to ensure that every intervention by the new commission is in the best interests of the Australian community as a whole.
The only way to ensure that the interests of the Australian community as a whole are protected is to ensure that the Attorney-General stays out of the process. There is no evidence that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has ever abused its power. Indeed, the commission has intervened in court proceedings just 18 times in 11 years and has never been rebuked by a court.
 The former head of the Office of the Status of Women, Kathy Townsend, said that what surprised her about this government—and this was during its first term—was that it did not see the issues of discrimination, whether based on gender, race or disability, as being systemic. As a result of his refusal to acknowledge ingrained disadvantage, the Prime Minister has set about downgrading a world-class Australian social institution, first by cutting the supply of money needed to effectively run the commission and then by tampering with hard won and highly respected legislation. The fact is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is respected worldwide, not only for its integrity and  commitment to human rights but also for its independence from government. This bill seeks to destroy that independence.
It is just over 50 years since the United Nations signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is just 14 years since the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission took centre stage in protecting those rights for all Australians. It has taken just four years for this government to place them in jeopardy. It was of course a previous Labor government that established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and we certainly will not be a party to dismantling it.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  this evening because, as my colleague the member for Jagajaga has just pointed out, there are some significant issues in relation to human rights which confront us as a community and as a nation and which we need to be concerned about and aware of when we are discussing this piece of legislation. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the difficulties to our near north being confronted by the people of East Timor and the obvious abuse of very fundamental human and civil rights that has happened in that part of the world over recent weeks. We will have a debate about this in some detail tomorrow, but it is worth pointing out that those human rights abuses are continuing. Whilst we have an Australian led peace enforcement operation in the first instance in East Timor, significant abuses of human rights are now being chronicled, particularly in West Timor but also in other parts of Indonesia.
There are now confirmed consistent reports of people being summarily executed, and in one particular case there is now direct evidence from a variety of sources confirming that on a ferry between Dili and Kupang 35 people were executed by militia. Of course, we need to be concerned about the veracity of these reports, but the consistency and the variety of sources make it demonstrably clear to the world that there is a great deal of evidence now about dramatic abuses of human rights. We now have a number of eyewitness accounts of bodies mounted up in the main police station in Dili. We have confirmed reports of militia going around West Timor with lists of people who are to be targeted. We know that the militia in West Timor are covering all entry and exit points of that part of Indonesia to identify these people. We know that there has been a dramatic attempt particularly to persecute members of religious orders, especially those of the Catholic Church.
These things are happening currently, and what they demonstrate to us is the importance of we people here in Australia recognising our 
 responsibilities to our citizens for human rights. We should not let what is happening to our near north, in East Timor, and West Timor in particular, cloud our view about our obligations to our own community. But at the same time we need to recognise the case of East Timor and the recent atrocities that have occurred and continue to occur. It is now evident that in this pogrom the pro-independence supporters—the 78.5 per cent of the East Timor community who voted to oppose integration with Indonesia—have been the subject of a well-orchestrated, planned military-controlled attack upon their basic rights and that many lives have been lost.
These reports of what is happening in our near north should make us very concerned about the proposals within this legislation to downgrade the status of human rights in this country. It is not that we can compare at all the abuse of human rights in East Timor or West Timor, and currently in other parts of Indonesia, with what is being proposed in this piece of legislation, but it is important that we acknowledge that the legislation before us reduces quite dramatically, in ways which should be of concern to all Australians, the status of human rights within our legal and administrative frameworks.
Previous speakers have referred to the purposes of this bill, which are to rename the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission; to restructure the new commission by abolishing the five specific commissioners—responsible for matters dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, social justice, human rights, disability, racial and sex discrimination—and replace these commissioners with three deputy presidents with responsibility for human rights and disability discrimination, racial discrimination and social justice, and sex discrimination and equal opportunity; and to create a requirement that the Attorney-General must grant approval before the commission can seek leave of a court to intervene in a court proceeding related to human rights and discrimination.
I want to concentrate particularly on the issue of the impact of this legislation in terms of racial discrimination. I want to do that for 
 the reason, among other things, that my electorate, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the Northern Territory, where 30 per cent, or thereabouts, of the electors are Aboriginal people and feel particularly close to issues relating to human rights. It is worth commenting that recently we had the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission report to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in February 1999. In their report, they canvassed the issues involved in this piece of legislation. They pointed out that the bill proposes that the deputy presidents will exercise an amicus curiae role, subject to the leave of the Attorney-General and the court to proceed where they think orders sought may affect to a significant extent the human rights of persons not party in proceedings which have significant implications for the administration of the relevant legislation and proceedings that involve special circumstances that satisfy them it would be in the public interest to assist the court as amicus curiae.
I do not have to tell you what this means. The proposal that the exercise of an amicus curiae role by the deputy presidents will be subject to the leave of the Attorney will give rise to significant conflicts of interest. In many cases in which human rights issues arise and are the subject of complaints, the federal government is the respondent. It must be a matter for the Federal Court, and not the Attorney-General, to decide whether to allow HREOC a role in human rights proceedings before it.
I would have thought that that argument was an eminently sensible one, yet the fact of that argument has forced the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to submit it in a report to the United Nations about the way in which this government is dealing with the issues relating to human rights in this country. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, when ATSIC submit, as they have done, that this proposal seriously threatens the role of HREOC as an independent human rights watchdog, they are absolutely correct. It also undermines the principle of the separation of powers, in that a political decision will precede the exercise of judicial discretion.
I would have thought that is a very fundamental issue. Yet for some reason or other—something that I do not comprehend and certainly do not understand—this government seems imbued with the idea that somehow or other by these changes it is improving the capacity of people to have redress in relation to human rights issues. If you take this amicus curiae role and the decision to get rid of the Racial Discrimination Commissioner, I think you can see how the government is seeking to control an agenda here which it believes it has had no control over.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to take you to the first report, of 1993, of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission, which was delivered to the then government by its first commissioner, Mick Dodson. He notes in his report, on page 2:
There must necessarily exist a certain structural tension between the performance of my functions and the Commonwealth Government.
Knowing, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, the importance of these issues to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the fact that Aboriginal people have a legitimate desire to see issues to do with the abuse of human rights properly addressed in this country, as we have seen in the context of the report of the Social Justice Commissioner and also in the report on the stolen generation, I would have thought that they see some remedies that can be delivered to, in their case, indigenous Australians in relation to human rights by having a human rights commissioner who is independent of government and can seek to take actions to court. Here we have a proposal which will handicap the capacity of an independent body to take decisions which are independent of the government. There is no doubt, as then Commissioner Dodson said, that there will always be a vigorous debate concerning social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. At that time, when he was referring to the fact of the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission, he said:
It was proof of a determination to provide an agency which will genuinely assist in the fuller exercise of human rights by Australia's indigenous peoples and to accept well-founded criticism. 

We are seeing here an exercise which is a sort of dumb and dumber exercise, trying to gag those people who would be critical and stop those people who otherwise, on the advice of an independent body, would want to take matters to the courts.
The other issue which Mr Dodson reflected upon, in what I think was a fairly prophetic report in 1993, was the belief that there was a great need for the position of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner. He argued then—and I think it stands scrutiny now—that such a mandatory requirement would be amply justified as a special measure for the purposes of article 1, paragraph 4 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. He further went on to talk about the importance, in the context of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of having an indigenous person, and someone who was seen as identifying with and understanding issues relating to indigenous Australians, represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests in this context. It is important. He made the point then, saying:
It is of critical importance, if I am to genuinely fulfil my commission, that I accurately reflect the experience and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia.
To this end he said:
I will not only consult, as I am obliged to, with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, but will also consult with community organisations and individual communities as much as possible.
Mr Deputy Speaker, if you see where he was coming from when he wrote those remarks then and where we are today, you can see that what we are doing is effectively removing the capacity in this case of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission—because it no longer exists—to perform the roles that arguably it should be performing under what I would see as our international obligations. I note also, again in the context of ATSIC's report to the United Nations, that it made a number of very strong criticisms of the government's attitude towards the issue of self-determination. I think it is worth reporting on this to the House, because in August of last year our Minister for Foreign Affairs 
 was reported to have confirmed that Australia would urge the UN to abandon the term `self-determination' for indigenous peoples and replace it with concepts of self-management or self-empowerment. He said:
We don't want to see a separate country created for indigenous Australians. We will be arguing that it might be better to use the term self-management rather than leaving the impression that we are prepared to have a separate indigenous state.
I say to the foreign minister and the government that they should have some regard for the reports of this parliament. There was a report to this parliament which was brought down in August 1989 which had the unanimous support of the people on the committee. It was the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. The title of the report was A chance for the future  and in this unanimously adopted report the issue of self-determination was addressed. It said at paragraph 1.9:
Self-determination means Aboriginal people having the authority, resources and capacity to control the future of their own communities within the legal structure common to all Australians. If self-determination is implemented in this form, then important but subsidiary objectives which have become incorporated into the self-determination approach—such as retention of cultural identity, community management and improved economic and social status—will be achieved as a result.
That, I would have thought, would have been an eminently sensible approach to the issue of self-determination for indigenous Australians, one which does not imply that we would have a separate country created for indigenous people. There was no need to go down this road of trying to denude the language of the word `self-determination' in relation to the rights of indigenous Australians because it is amply qualified in this report, given to this parliament in 1989, as to what in fact self-determination should mean to us as Australians. I reiterate that the report was adopted unanimously.
I say to the government: if you are serious about human rights, you will reconsider your position in relation to this bill. You will ensure that the rights of people, which we would argue should be prescribed by our international obligations, are properly represented here in the parliament. We should not 
 do anything that would diminish the human rights of any Australian wherever they might be, whether they are indigenous Australians, women or disabled people. No matter who they are, it is extremely important, as we contemplate the future of our nation as we go into the next millennium, to maintain the strongest possible standards for human rights. I do not believe that the legislation before us tonight contributes in any way to that end.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I had the privilege last week of being involved in the opening of a marvellous project here in Canberra to raise funds for a number of charities. A local builder, Mr David O'Keeffe of Madison Homes, had a dream of constructing a house which could then be auctioned off for charity. Not a unique idea in itself but, be 
 cause of his vision and determination, David O'Keeffe turned his dream into a unique project. Over some time, during a period in which the building industry in Canberra was suffering low activity, David managed to convince a large number of other businesses to donate their time, expertise and services to enhance the possible return on the house. David believed that, if he could maximise the amount of materials through donation, much more money could then be handed to the charities.
In all, 62 local companies and businesses involved themselves in one way or another. The house has now been completed, and I had the privilege of opening it last week. It has been independently valued at around $250,000, and it is expected that, with a sale at that figure or above, a sum of more than $170,000 will be left for distribution to the successful charities. That in itself demonstrates the enormous donations that this project received from these 62 companies and businesses.
Money raised in excess of the amounts applied for will be placed in a trust and used for future charity requirements. Whilst he is not planning another similar project immediately, I would not be at all surprised to see, with a little encouragement, a biannual or triannual project in the future.
The successful charities who will benefit from this wonderful project are the Smith Family—Learning for Life Student Assistance Program; Koomarri—All Season Gardens Maintenance Program; Australian Red Cross—Roadhouse Youth Service Program; the Spastic Centre—the David Hart walker, which I know many members here have heard about; Camp Quality—reunion weekend; the Richmond Fellowship—Adolescent Sexual Assault Counselling Program; and Open Family—Canberra Streetworker Program. These are all very worthwhile projects, with an effect that will reach far into our community.
But that was not enough—the ideas kept flowing. A new web site—charityspot.com—was developed, and it was also launched last week. Charities can register to use this site for their fundraising, and it is also being used as 
 a bid site for this special house. Last week, one of the largest single bids on the Internet in Australia was made for this house, with a bid of $220,000. My congratulations go to everyone concerned with charityspot.com.
The auction of this house will take place on 16 October, and I know that everyone concerned is more than confident of a great return on the investment of the people who devoted so much to the project. This is truly a great example of a community getting together and producing a project and outcome which will benefit those needing some support and assistance within their own community.
To everyone concerned I offer my heartiest congratulations. On behalf of the charities and the many people who will benefit, our thanks go to them all. To David O'Keeffe and his vision: I do not think he ever quite realised what he would be able to achieve but, with the help of these 62 companies and businesses, he has been able to achieve it. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the list of 62 businesses and companies which assisted in this project.
—I imagine so, but the normal courtesy is to show it to someone before seeking leave to have it incorporated.
—I was not aware that the member for Moncrieff had not seen it. Subject to it meeting the guidelines, the member for Moncrieff has indicated that she is happy to accede to that request.
