Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:33):  I rise today to offer my profound and wholehearted support for this apology to everyone who experienced or was affected in any way by the practice of forced adoption in Australia. That includes, of course, the mothers and fathers, the families who were affected, the children and the siblings. It was a terrible period in Australian history when people who so badly wanted their child and wanted to keep their child were subjected to practices that led to them being forced to give up their children.


It is rare in parliamentary life that you can be part of an occasion which is not only dignified but profoundly important and a day that is shared by everyone across the whole political spectrum. I thought the day that we were all in the Great Hall with so many people gathered from around Australia to hear the apology being offered by the Prime Minister and on behalf of the parliament was an incredibly special occasion to be part of. I was reminded that in my own political career there have only been two other occasions when I could say the same thing. One was in Tasmania when the Tasmanian parliament gave an apology to the stolen generations, and there was the same at the federal parliament when Prime Minister Rudd was in power—and then there was this apology to people affected by forced adoption.


I am really disappointed that the day was marred by the politics of the hour, when this was such an occasion for so many people and meant so much to families and to people who had suffered for generations. I just want to say to everybody who came that, as hard as it might be to put aside the politics of the day, the parliament genuinely did come together to apologise and does stand together in apology, and we do stand together to say that not only do we offer this apology but we are all behind the measures that have been taken to assist people who have been affected and who, to this day, are struggling to come to terms with the impacts of what occurred then.


I also wanted to stand today and thank my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert for the incredible commitment she demonstrated in bringing this issue to the parliament, in pursuing it in the Senate on several occasions, in securing the inquiry and in the work that she and her fellow senators on the inquiry put into what was really comprehensive listening across Australia, as people came forward to tell their stories. I also congratulate the people who did have the courage to come forward and speak, because it was not an easy thing to do. It was incredibly brave for people to be able, sometimes for the first time in decades, to talk about the awful experience that they had not only had but had had to live with ever since. 


As someone who was growing up in the late fifties and sixties in Australia, I am very, very well aware of the level of pressure that was put on young women who became pregnant, of the shame that was transferred to them and of the sense of their being made to feel as if they were in some way to be punished for the fact that they were pregnant and unmarried. They were made to feel as if it were in the best interests of the baby to be taken away when that baby was so wanted by their young mother. I grew up in that era of shame being transferred and of fear of retribution in the community. Young women went away, no questions asked, and when they came back they were told never to mention it again. People chose not to speak about it again. It was like a shameful episode in someone’s life. That has carried on through the generations in many families. 


I think it is so good that at last this period has had a light shone upon it and that people have been given an opportunity to talk about just how it has impacted their lives. It is fantastic that they have been able to say to the children who they were forced to give away that they never wanted to give them away, that they loved them throughout, that they loved them from the day they were born and they loved them throughout their lives. That is such an important thing, because so many adoptees were told that their mothers had not wanted them, so these young people were growing up with this idea that they were given away. This is an opportunity for mothers to say, 'I always wanted you,' and that makes so much difference in the way that people will be able to at least try to come to terms with and deal with the experience. 


I want to congratulate everyone concerned. As I said, it is not often in a parliamentary career that you can stand up and feel really proud of the efforts of your colleagues in addressing an issue that needed to be addressed, an issue that was a longstanding wound in the soul of the nation. It is particularly good as a female member of parliament to feel that, of those issues which have been long ignored, this one has now been brought forward and given the kind of consideration and serious thought and compassion that led to such a day as we had in the Great Hall, where we all felt that, at last, justice was being done and being seen to be done, with the opportunity to move forward for all of those people directly and indirectly affected. In fact, the whole community has been affected, because we have all been impacted by the fact that this practice went on around us in our community, and it has taken till now to name it for what it was and to change the practices and offer the support that is necessary for people who have been impacted. 


I conclude by saying that the Greens, as a party, one and all, profoundly and wholeheartedly support the apology to people who experienced or were affected by forced adoption.

 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:43):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL 2013


The government has now introduced amendments that will create a new matter of national environmental significance under national environmental law. This amendment will enable the Commonwealth Environment Minister to take into account significant impacts of coal seam gas and large coalmining development on a water resource. 


These amendments are the product of a long period of engagement with the community, as well as with members of this parliament who have been strong in their advocacy of this issue. 


The challenge we have had up until now is that people quite reasonably expect the Minister for the Environment and Water to take into account, by law, the impacts of coal seam gas and large coal mining on water resources. They want to know that the Environment Minister is considering: if there is an irreversible depletion and contamination of our surface and groundwater resources; the impacts on the way critical water systems operate; and the related effects on our ecosystems. 


But, under our current national environment law, the Commonwealth Environment Minister cannot take these concerns into consideration directly, because the Commonwealth does not directly regulate projects that are likely to have an impact on a water resource—either surface water or groundwater. This is because water resources are not currently a matter of national environmental significance. 


Under our current laws, the only way the Environment Minister can take these issues into consideration is where there is a connection to an existing matter of national environmental significance. 


For example, that connection may be to a threatened species which is legally listed but may be a hundred kilometres away downstream of the project. If there is an impact on that species downstream, only then can the Environment Minister take account the impact the project is having on that water source, to the extent that it affects the listed species. 


The Australian government has already taken steps to provide more certainty for regional communities around coal seam gas and large coalmining developments, and the protection of water resources. 


Last year we established the independent expert scientific committee under national environment law, to provide independent expert scientific advice to all governments on the water related impacts of coal seam gas and large coalmining. 


The independence of the expert committee provides the community with the confidence they need that the scientific work being done has the integrity that people want. 


However, when that advice comes back, the Environment Minister can only take that information into account if it is having that flow-on effect to an existing matter of national environmental significance. 


Proposed amendments 


The amendment does not seek to invoke the Commonwealth in all water decisions. The trigger will not capture small projects such as farm dams. The amendments will create a new matter of national environmental significance for coal seam gas and large coalmining developments which are likely to have a significant impact on a water resource. It will provide the strong legal basis for protection that the community wants. 


In addition, the Bill includes an amendment to prevent states and territories from being accredited to make approval decisions in relation to the water trigger.


This is not a broad trigger. The Australian government has already established independent expert scientific committee, which considers coal seam gas and large coalmine developments. This amendment provides the appropriate gateway for federal approval, and should continue to do so. 


The amendments also deal with the transition to the new trigger. 


There are a number of projects that have already been referred under national environment law which are already undergoing assessment. The government thinks it would be a perverse outcome if every project already in the system was finished without taking account the new matter of national environmental significance. 


This is why the amendments provide that, for any project that is already undergoing assessment, provided the Independent Expert Scientific Committee has not yet given its advice and a proposed decision on the project has not yet been made, the new trigger will apply. 


This does not mean that the assessment will need to begin again and completely restart for those projects that are captured. 


We know that the sort of information that would be needed to make a decision for the new matter of national environmental significance already gets collected in different ways for state approvals, and for the work of the independent expert scientific committee. 


The Commonwealth environment department is contacting proponents to advise them of any additional information requirements which may apply, the same way they frequently seek additional information, so that the full impacts of those projects on water resources can be assessed. 


Stakeholder engagement


Since the introduction of the amendments into the House of Representatives, the Australian Government has consulted with industry and community stakeholders. 


The government will continue to engage industry and stakeholders in the lead-up to, and following the commencement of, the amendments, should they be passed by the Parliament. This will include providing guidance on the application of the new environmental law to their projects, such as the likely information requirements.


Conclusion 


Up until now Australia's Environment Minister has not been able to take into account this information, which is already being collected. The information is provided and analysed but does not currently form part of the decision-making process. Under the new trigger, it will. 


It means that when an approval is given or an approval decision is made, the community expectation that the Environment Minister has taken into account the impacts on water resources will match up with the legal obligations of environment minister. 


At the same time, the Australian government is making sure that the administrative processes for the transition are done in a way that delivers better scrutiny and gives better-quality and more thorough decisions, without needlessly adding to time frames. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-05-14,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:43):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013, which the government has just rushed into the Senate chamber. It is noteworthy that the Senate committee report on this bill was only concluded and tabled this morning, but this of course is symptomatic of a government whose policy agenda is overwhelmingly driven by politics rather than by sound public policy, and in this case this legislation firmly fits that trend. This legislation has been driven completely by the politics of the government—in particular, the politics of the government's precarious position in the House of Representatives, where they rely very much on the member for New England and other crossbenchers for support.


Just months ago the government rejected proposals similar to those contained in this legislation, which were essentially to establish a water trigger in the EPBC Act—that is, to add a water trigger to the range of triggers on matters of national environmental importance which exist in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It is not to be an all-encompassing water trigger, mind you. Instead, and this is an unprecedented step, it is a trigger specific to certain industries—in this case, the coal industry and the coal seam gas industry. The government had previously pilloried the idea that a water trigger needed to be added to the EPBC Act. It was not even a factor in the recommendations of the comprehensive Hawke review of the EPBC Act. Yet, all of a sudden, because Mr Windsor walked into the Prime Minister's office and said, 'I demand this be done,' here we are debating this legislation. It is an appalling way to make public policy. It is an appalling way for the government to change its mind and to change the rules and regulations that industry has to comply with.


We already have in this country very extensive and comprehensive environmental planning laws. They operate at the state and federal levels and they provide for the assessment and recognition of all manner of factors, including the impact on water. It is estimated that, on environmental planning, there are around 1,500 state conditions that must be complied with and 300 or so federal conditions that must be complied with. Within these conditions there is ample scope to address issues of water, and that is exactly what occurs already. This bill will add a new layer of regulation and a new level of duplication by which the federal government will find itself assessing things that state governments are already assessing and industry will have to go through and get approvals from the federal government just as they already have to get approvals from state governments. It will add to the cost and time frame of approvals, it will add to the delays and it will add to the risk that industry will simply take its bat and ball and invest elsewhere.


I acknowledge and understand that there are significant community concerns, especially in agricultural environments, about coal seam gas and its impact on water and that there are also community concerns about the proximity to urban centres, in some cases, of coal seam gas developments. That is why, on changes to water, the coalition supported the independent expert scientific panel, which was embraced on bipartisan lines with, I acknowledge, Mr Windsor's encouragement as well. Under such changes, hundreds of millions of dollars were to be invested to make sure that all projects were subject to completely rigorous scrutiny and that the advice resulting from the scrutiny would be provided to both state and federal governments. Ministers, in making their assessments, would have to have taken the advice into account—and, lest they ignored the advice of the independent committee, its findings were to be made public. Woe would betide a minister, whether state or federal,  who went against the independent scientific advice in making their determinations.


I acknowledge the community concerns. Such concerns were the reason that this parliament acted to set up the committee with its expert assessment process just last year. Yet now we have legislation which goes further than what was done last year without giving a fair go to what was done last year and to see whether it would have addressed the community concerns and whether it would have worked. At the time last year's measures were proposed, Mr Windsor was pushing his proposal for an environmental water trigger to the EPBC Act—and, at that time, the government rejected the idea. The question for the government to answer in this debate is: what has changed in the many times that the government rejected the proposal for it to now see the proposal as urgent? Of course, what has changed is that Mr Windsor no doubt made acceptance of his proposal a condition of his ongoing support for the government.


There is clear evidence that this legislation was arrived at by a very dubious and questionable process. The department confirmed during a Senate inquiry into the legislation that consultation was not undertaken on the detailed text of the bill prior to its introduction and consideration by parliament. Indeed, any consultation on the general principles of this legislation was minimal at best. Even those who support it, such as the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices, have said that the legislation came out of a bad process. We had, as I said before, a very comprehensive review—the Hawke review—of the EPBC Act. It did not recommend the change found in this legislation. It recommended a number of other changes, which the government has thus far ignored. The fact that it ignored them is symptomatic of a government which goes out, seeks advice for which it pays taxpayers' money and then completely ignores the advice that it has been provided with and does the opposite or something else entirely. What is the point of undertaking reviews such as the Hawke review and getting a whole lot of advice and then ignoring it and doing something which was not even proposed by the Hawke review? It is quite remarkable.


Equally, the government in the lofty rhetoric of its earlier days, placed great importance on making sure that it did not impose undue regulation on industry. To make sure that there was not undue regulation on industry, the government would be handing down a regulatory impact statement on all new legislation or regulatory reform which could have an impact. Is there a regulatory impact statement for this legislation? No, there is not. The government, despite promising to do so and despite saying that it was essential to make sure that it minimised the level of regulation on the Australian economy and that the regulations were effective, has ignored its own processes once again.


As I stated, there are real concerns about how this reform creates a level of duplication with existing state laws. We should never forget in this place—and sadly in this the states' house it seems to be too often forgotten—that the states have a primary role when it comes to regulating land use and that the states have a primary role when it comes to regulating the exploitation of minerals and resources in those lands. That is how our Constitution was set up and that is how this country has effectively worked from the day of Federation: that the states take the lead in those planning roles. We do not have a planning minister at a federal level; states have planning ministers. They make the relevant decisions here. The resources are owned in essence by the people of those states. They are there for their benefit and their benefit to exploit as is appropriate. 


Over the years, the Commonwealth has taken sensible steps to make sure that, where there are matters of national environmental importance, the Commonwealth has a say in regulating those. There were some proud reforms of the Howard government in that regard. They were important reforms that gave the Commonwealth a say in this regard, but that does not change the fundamentals that the states have extensive processes in place. The interesting thing that we saw in the Senate inquiry into this legislation was that, as Senator McKenzie in particular highlighted, all the criticisms seemed to be coming from just one state, and there is perhaps a good question to be asked here: whether the laws of that state are working effectively enough or not—whether they have provided sufficient confidence to their communities in their laws. But that does not mean that we should be coming in and imposing a new level of regulation that applies across all states—and applies right across the Commonwealth—and that will affect those states where there seems to be minimal or no community concern just as much as it affects those where there is very strong concern.


As I have also said, the independent expert scientific committee process is still in its relative infancy. This is still a fairly new process. It is a process that we supported. It is a process that we believe can and should provide greater rigour to assessments at a state level as well as a federal level. If there are legitimate concerns about the impact on water resources, it should ensure that state ministers have to take those into account when they are approving these developments. So, the changes to make sure that those with the power are well informed and well educated on these issues have already been made. The information is now being provided and the information is then made available to the public, as I said before. So why on earth is it now necessary, while this new process is still so young, to apply another different process on top of that? The government has given no justification for that, and that, of course, is because it is such a politically driven process.


There are also grave concerns about the fact that this legislation targets specific industries. This is a whole new world of activity for the EPBC Act, which traditionally has said that there are broad matters of national environmental significance that should be considered, regardless of what industry is proposing to undertake a development. If this legislation passes, we are putting in place a new area of assessment, but only as it relates to the coal industry or the coal seam gas industry, only as it relates to those sectors. Anybody else is still subject to the state laws or to the original areas of the EPBC Act assessment. This targeting of specific industries is again a terribly flawed approach to legislative process in this place. It is a real concern that the government has decided to target these sectors and, beyond the immediacy of those sectors targeted, there are genuine concerns in many places, particularly in the farming sector, that, if one industry group can be targeted with specific environmental laws, what is to say that other industry groups in future cannot be targeted with specific environmental laws? There is genuine concern there about the precedent this bill sets and the distortion in terms of the universality of application of the EPBC Act.


We also heard during the Senate inquiry numerous concerns about the definitions applied to this legislation. The coalition senators have made some requests for the government to think about how it deals with those definitions. First and foremost, there are concerns about whether applications may be required simply to undertake exploration activities—not to undertake production, not to undertake the types of activities that could be highly disruptive to communities or to water resources but simply to undertake exploration activities. As many sectors of industry said during this inquiry, if they cannot do the exploration in the first place, they cannot undertake the thorough assessment to see what the environmental impacts will be. They need to be able to drill test sites in the first place so that they have a comprehensive understanding of the geography and geology of the circumstances they are working in. That is why the government should look very closely at how it defines what activities are captured by this bill. It should be excluding those that relate to exploration activities, and I urge the government to consider doing so. Equally, there were concerns expressed about the breadth of the definition that may apply to a water resource. The New South Wales Irrigators' Council, for example, argued that they believed that it could apply to all water resources. The Minerals Council asked the question: are we talking dry creek beds? Are we talking dams? Are we talking tailing dams? Are we talking water, coal seam gas? What are we talking—surface, groundwater, the lot? What is a large coalmine? What and where do mining related activities fit in the equation?


These questions seem to be left unanswered by this bill. The government should answer these questions clearly and should, ideally, amend its legislation to ensure it clarifies these concerns. 


There are also concerns about the retrospectivity aspect of this legislation. This legislation would mean that, even if you are already undergoing an assessment process—even if you are already part of the way through your assessment—you are going to have to meet a new standard. You have already invested your money and you have already started to go through the very expensive and time-consuming process of getting your environmental approvals, but now, halfway through, the rules are going to be changed on you. That is not good enough. If this bill has to pass, it should only apply to new applications and not to those where the process is already underway.


Most remarkable is that during the debate on this legislation in the House of Representatives the government once again completely contradicted their own previous position by adopting at the last minute—while they were yet again in a complete state of turmoil over their leadership—amendments moved by Mr Tony Windsor. Those amendments serve to prevent bilateral approvals processes in this area. The government have previously rightly rejected pushes by the Greens to rule out bilateral approvals processes—processes where the states can be authorised to make approvals on behalf of the Commonwealth, subject to certain criteria. The government have previously ruled out Greens attempts to universally ban bilateral approvals, but they yielded to Mr Windsor's request. Yet again there was no consideration of the impact. They just said, 'For these specific types of activities, we will exclude bilateral approvals.' That flies in the face of what Prime Minister Gillard said in April last year, although we know—particularly on this day, budget day—that we cannot believe anything which was said 12 months ago. But last April she said:


… what we want to work towards here is a streamlined system, so that projects don’t go through two layers of assessment for no real gain.


She was arguing for increased use of bilaterals at that stage. By December, she had changed her mind and had ditched that proposal. Now the government are proposing to outlaw bilaterals in certain circumstances. Talk about a complete about-face! Now they do not even want the legislation to include provision for bilaterals to possibly exist. The coalition will move an amendment to remove the change to the bill inserted by the House of Representatives. I urge the government, in the cold light of day, after having had a couple of months to think about it, to support the coalition's change in that regard. I also urge them to ensure that there is at least some level of consistency of application across the EPBC Act, rather than a complete hotchpotch. 


We have many concerns about this legislation. As I said, though, we understand the concerns of the community as well. We hear those concerns and we are not, by opposing this legislation, going to allow the government to politicise this issue. We will work to fix these issues should we succeed later this year. We want to work to ensure that we get community confidence for this important industry, because it is an important industry. It is generating billions of export dollars and thousands of new jobs and is very important to the economic wellbeing of all states of Australia—to securing, in particular, our future gas supplies.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2013-05-14,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:03):  In my opinion, it is well beyond time for us to have a full discussion in this chamber of coal seam gas and coalmines, particularly their effect on our precious and limited water resources—the subject of the Environment Conservation and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013, which is before us today. The Greens support this bill. In fact, we brought a bill quite similar to this one into this place about 18 months ago. We did so off the back of huge scientific concern about the potential for long-term damage to our water resources and off the back of increasing community concern—concern which has only intensified in the intervening 18 months. So I am pleased the government has now reconsidered its former position and has agreed that it is, in fact, incumbent upon the federal government to act in the national interest to protect our precious groundwater and surface water resources from the possibility of massive damage being done to them by coal seam gas and coalmines.


There have been a lot of remarks made by the coalition. Indeed, they have had several positions on this issue; it is difficult to keep up with them. But Senator Birmingham has put on record that they will be supporting this bill. I appreciate that support and I think members of the community will be greatly relieved to feel they are finally being listened to by this parliament. Some of the farming families who have had a strong attachment to their land for generations, and who have a huge dependence on groundwater, have expressed genuine, heartfelt concern for many years. Until now, they have felt abandoned by the other political parties. I think it will be a really lovely day for those folk—knowing that their parliament is finally taking an interest in conserving that precious water resource and protecting it from damage. 


I want to put on record, though, that this bill is not a panacea. This bill will simply allow the federal environment minister to consider the impact on water of coal seam gas and coalmining. Whether or not he or she—depending on who the minister is—then decides to act upon those concerns is an entirely different kettle of fish. Today's bill will put in place the process for making a good decision, but it remains a matter of ministerial discretion whether those scientific and community concerns are properly acted upon and whether or not our water resources will actually be protected. I would therefore urge the current Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and whoever the next environment minister is—of whichever colour—to take the advice of the independent expert scientific committee, the advice this bill will now enable the minister to consider. I thought it a little farcical to set up a federal committee and then preclude the minister from listening to it. That seemed a bit ridiculous to me, so I am glad we are correcting that anomaly today.


The need for federal intervention is abundantly clear. We have heard evidence about this from all around the nation and not just one state, as Senator Birmingham seemed to contend. I do not think he attended all the hearings, so perhaps he missed the bits explaining, for example, the real problems in Queensland with coal seam gas. I am disappointed to report that the concern about the potential impact for damage is not confined to New South Wales. We heard from folk at a number of Senate committee hearings about their huge concern. 


Anyone watching the Four Corners report of a month or so ago could see that the state processes are not properly dealing with the risks of coal seam gas and coal to our groundwater resources. Can I put on record my admiration for the courage of that wonderful whistleblower, Simone Marsh. I understand she has been on leave without pay because of the stress and anguish she has suffered after blowing the whistle on poor practices, and our heartfelt thanks go out to her. She revealed that after a fairly protracted environmental impact statement process done by the company, as is proper, she was then heavied by senior bureaucrats to issue approvals in sometimes as little as half a day. She was informed by folks in the department she was working for that there would not be government consideration of the water impacts of two of the big coal seam gas projects, QGC and Santos, in the Coordinator-General's report—effectively the summary report upon which the final decision is then made. That makes an absolute mockery of the process and it clearly shows up the highly political nature of these decisions. 


Unfortunately we have seen that reflected at the federal level too. Previously the Labor government was not so keen on this idea; in fact, I think I was even laughed at when I first brought legislation to parliament a year and a half ago. Earlier this year Minister Burke ticked off on the big coal seam gas project in Gloucester, ticked off on the coalmine in Maules Creek, ticked off on the coalmine in Boggabri and about a week after that ticked off on the coalmine in Taranganba. About two days after that he suddenly discovered that water was a problem and, gee, he would like to listen to scientific and community concern. That is great, but unfortunately he had just ticked off on some of the largest projects in New South Wales, and the massive projects in Queensland had already been approved—barring the final project, Arrow, which we hope will never see the light of day.


We do welcome this belated action to protect our water but we are conscious that it comes after many concerning approvals have already been issued—and those approvals have been issued despite the scientific evidence warning of irreversible damage to the groundwater table and warning that we do not even understand the scope of the potential for damage; we do not even know enough about the interactions between coal seams, aquifers and the pressure system to know how much damage this industry could be doing. The sheer abandonment of the precautionary principle, the lack of concern for those long-term impacts and this overriding drive for short-term profit to the possible detriment in the long-term of our farming communities and of our very water resources make me crestfallen. It is part of the reason why the community is so disappointed with both sides of politics. Be that as it may, as I have said, the Four Corners program sadly highlighted the flaws in the state process, particularly in Queensland—all the more reason for the federal government to do more and to step in and protect this national resource, our water. 


We also heard some very telling evidence in the hearings into this bill in New South Wales about the new you-beaut revised coal seam gas rules which were meant to solve everything. Unfortunately, according to the community and the experts in that state, they have not solved the problem. The example was given that, in dry times, cease-to-pump-water notices can be issued that irrigators and farmers have to comply with but that coal seam gas companies and big mining companies can seek a compliance exemption from. Once again you have two sets of rules—one rule for farming folk and for the average person in the street and a special rule for the fossil fuel companies. This is exactly the sort of behaviour that is yet more proof that the states are not up to the job of properly protecting water and properly acting to regulate this potentially very damaging industry. So, I am relieved that the federal government is finally deciding to list the impact of these industries on water as a matter of national environmental significance. It is long overdue.


Senator Birmingham referred to a poor process in the formulation of this bill. Perhaps he has not been paying attention, but this issue has been bubbling and has been a matter of community and scientific concern for many years. It is belated action that we are seeing from the government; it is not hasty action—far from it. They are finally catching up with community sentiment, and we welcome that. On the point of process, we saw the big mining companies chuck a bit of a hissy fit—they were annoyed that they had not been able to write their own rules, like they normally do, so they pulled out of the Senate inquiry hearings about 24 hours before they were due to proceed. The irony of complaining about not being consulted and then voluntarily withdrawing from a process where they could have shared their views was clearly lost on them. Thankfully it was not lost on other participants in the inquiry.


I want to put on record how the Greens will seek to improve this bill. The bill is a good start and it does bear a very close resemblance to legislation we introduced 18 months ago which, sadly, did not receive support at that time. There are some key areas where we can do better. Given that the debate has moved on and given the acceptance now of the need to act on this issue, I urge senators from both sides of politics to properly consider these amendments and see if they can support them. The first amendment would be particularly attractive to the opposition, given their on-again off-again, on-again off-again, on-again as of last weekend position about protecting landholder rights. Mr Tony Abbott has had a vexed position on this. He seems to be changing his mind quite frequently, but his most recent statement is that actually he does think that landholders should not have their livelihoods disrupted by big coal seam gas companies and big coalmines, and they should be able to say no. We agree, which is why we proposed legislation to allow farmers the right to say no when Tony Abbott first made those remarks. Unfortunately, he has now resiled a little from that and said that, even though he thinks that—it is his personal view—'It's up to the states.' It is out of his hands; he cannot do anything to fix that!


In good news, I have an amendment that would enable him to fix that issue and would enable this parliament to allow the farmers the right to say, 'I don't want to take the risk with my land that has been in my family for generations that the water resources will dry up and my kids won't have anything to farm with. I don't want to take that risk.' It is a very simple amendment. It is clearly constitutional, using the corporations head of power—no need for excuses on that basis. If we get to move those amendments today, or whenever this bill comes back on if we do not get to it today, we will see just what the coalition really think about landholder rights, particularly whether the folk from the Nationals are willing to put their money where their mouth is and act in the interests of those farming communities. I look forward to the opportunity to give a voice to those farmers who feel that they have not had their rights respected—indeed, because they have no rights in this issue. Let us try to give them some.


The second amendment that I will be moving to strengthen this EPBC Act goes to the very projects I mentioned before and that the environment minister, Mr Tony Burke, ticked off on just before announcing this bill. The reason we would like this new bill to apply to those projects is that they have only just been ticked off; they have not commenced work. Clearly, the government had an inkling that this was what they were going to do: within days of those approvals, this bill was announced. Let us make sure that communities in that region, the Namoi region, can actually get the benefit of this protection for their water resources. The amendment goes further, saying, given that we still have some projects in Queensland that have not yet been approved, thank goodness—namely, the Arrow coal seam gas project—let us make those existing three coal seam gas proponents, QGC, Santos and AGL, do those water studies, because they got off scot-free last time. Look at the process that was exposed on Four Corners; the government did not even properly scrutinise water impacts. Let us make them do those studies and put that information on the table so that the federal minister can be properly armed with that information when making future decisions. There is no interruption of their approval processes, no acquisition of rights, no change to their legal status but simply an obligation to now supply that information—to turn their minds to those water impacts and inform our decision-makers of the consequences of future decisions on other projects. So that is a very important amendment that will overcome, I think, the cynicism of the minister's announcement and the timing of the announcement of this bill.


The third of my four amendments goes to the scope of this bill, to the fact that it is not just coal seam gas that is threatening our groundwater and our surface water on the east coast but also shale gas and tight gas, which we have across this country. It seems strange to me that we are contemplating creating two tiers of rights, where east coast folk, where there is coal seam gas, could have their water protected by the minister if he or she makes the right decision, based on the evidence, but folk in the south, west and north would not have that same level of protection from shale gas mining extraction, which uses similar extraction processes and has similar potential impacts on water. Let us make sure that we are not creating a two-tiered system of rights here, and let us make sure that all of those unconventional gas resources can be treated the same and can be scrutinised for their potential to damage our water resources. So I look forward to moving that very sensible amendment to put all unconventional gas resources on a level playing field.


The final amendment I will be moving relates to the amendment to this bill that was made in the House. I am really pleased that Mr Tony Windsor moved the amendment that he did, after many discussions with many folk, including community groups, to make sure that this new power to protect water not be simply given back to the very state governments who, frankly, stuffed it up in the first place. It is a crucial amendment to the environment laws because there is that little section in the act where it says you can hand off your federal approval powers to the states, write yourself completely out of the picture, but the amendment means you cannot do that for water. I think that is really important. But, again, we are creating two classes here. We have a special rule for water, where those powers need to stay where they belong—in federal hands. But all of those other matters of national environmental significance, which are, as the name suggests, nationally significant—and sometimes internationally significant in the case of World Heritage, such as migratory birds, wetlands and threatened species—can be given away to state premiers.


We have seen the environmental legacy of state premiers. The whole genesis of federal involvement in the environmental arena came from the Franklin Dam, as we all know, when Bob Hawke stepped in and said to the states: 'No, it is too important. You cannot simply trash the Franklin River. We're going to take it all the way to the High Court using our constitutional means of doing so,' using the foreign affairs power, 'and protect this river in the national interest.' It would be a great shame if a Labor government, 30 years on, undid that very important reform, which was really the springboard for all of our federal environmental regulation over the last 30 years.


So we have 30 years of environment protection at stake, and the amendment I will be moving is to delete that section, section 46, where it simply says, inoffensively, that you can accredit the states to make your approval decision for you. The effect of that will be that the federal government will always have to tick off on a damaging development in a World Heritage area. It will always have the power to veto anything that is going to have a significant impact on something that is so nationally significant that the government has seen fit to protect it. I think those powers to act in the national interest should stay in national hands. We do not expect the states to act in the national interest; it is not their job. They will always act in their own interest, and that is what they are meant to do. So let us make sure that this national government can act in the interests of all Australians and protect those places that are too precious to lose and those species that are unique to Australia and make them so special to Australia that they are part of our very identity.


This is a really important amendment because we know that the coalition have said on many occasions that they will use that ability. They will give away to state premiers the approval powers that sit now with the federal government. The thought of Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland having even more power to wind back even more laws than he already has—we are up to about 12 environmental protections that he has wound back—and the thought of him having the sole say over our nationally significant environmental icons sends shivers down my spine, and I hope it sends shivers down the spines of at least half of this chamber. We will let you guys off the hook, given that it is your side that is running the states in the main. As a question of process, no matter what colour you are from, we need to make sure that we do not simply have one level of government in sole control. We need the national government to act in the national interest. That is why it is crucial that in the last few weeks of our sittings this Labor government takes the chance to protect its very own legacy—the original intervention of Bob Hawke—which has led to the Commonwealth being able to step up and protect the environment. Let us make sure that those powers can be maintained. 


I congratulate the government and I certainly congratulate Mr Tony Windsor on bringing this bill forward; it is long overdue. It will provide the framework to protect water from coal seam gas and coalmines. It will still be up to the minister's discretion whether that eventuates. I urge the minister to listen to the science, the advice of that independent scientific committee, the advice of CSIRO and the advice of the National Water Commission, to take proper decisions and to act employing that precautionary principle that he or she is meant to employ when making those decisions. We do not know if coal seam gas is safe. All indications are that it is going to do immeasurable damage to our aquifers. We know that it leaks like a sieve, so it is no better than coal when it comes to climate impacts. We know that, if Australia is going to continue to be a net food exporter in the coming age of food insecurity, we will need to safeguard the precious farmland that is so unique to us. So I commend this bill and the amendments to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:23):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013 and commend it to the Senate, particularly in relation to coal seam gas mining and water resources. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, typically known as the EPBC, is Australia's principal national mechanism for environmental protection. Many of Australia's international environmental obligations are discharged very much through the EPBC. These include responsibilities derived from our participation in international agreements and through our custodianship of shared resources. They involve caring for World Heritage sites, looking after wetlands and habitats for migratory birds, ensuring the survival of threatened plant and animal species and regulating nuclear actions, including uranium mining. The EPBC also includes some matters of national significance, such as places of national heritage and the declaration of Commonwealth marine areas, which have expanded substantially under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.


The listing of matters in the EPBC is indicative of matters that are of concern to all Australians—not just to local, state and territory communities but to all Australians. So the inclusion of threatened species in the EPBC reflects the fact that biodiversity, particularly iconic species like the Tasmanian devil and the Wollemi pine, is important to all Australians. Similarly, we take pride as a nation in our heritage and in our special places such as the ancient Gondwana rainforests or the Great Barrier Reef. Australians, too, believe in the close and careful regulation of uranium mining and the handling of nuclear material—an issue that has motivated and continues to motivate people across our nation. 


The EPBC provides a trigger for projects to be assessed by the federal government. Many major developments fall under the EPBC by virtue of their direct and indirect impact on one of the matters listed in part 3 of the act, such as the effect of development on surrounding habitats in which threatened species may live. However, developments that do not have a demonstrative impact on any of the currently listed projects cannot be assessed by the federal government's environmental authority. The legislative scope of the EPBC does not necessarily grant the minister for the environment discretion to assess any or all developments that may have a substantial impact on the environment or on a matter of national significance that may have emerged. Indeed, when the minister for the environment introduced this bill in the other place, he noted that most Australians would reasonably expect the minister for the environment to take into account, by law, the matters included in this bill. 


There is no doubt that when we learn more about the environmental impact of the different processes and operations we should ensure that our legislation reflects new science and our new environmental conscience. We must also ensure that our legislation measures up to the expectations of the Australian people. That is why this bill introduces a new category of matters to the EPBC. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013 adds the protection of water resources from coal seam gas development and large-scale coalmining development to the ambit of the EPBC. As it stands, there is no direct protection under national environmental law for groundwater and table resources that keep our land and waterways healthy and our arable lands balanced. Water resources are drawn on extensively by flora and fauna as well as by humans for consumption and agricultural use. As we have seen in other areas of environmental policy, such as in the debate on the Murray-Darling River Basin, the availability, use and health of our water table and waterways resonate right across our country. This is linked to the wellbeing of country communities, which are part of our national story and part of our national food security network. 


While the science on coal seam gas extraction is still emerging, there is no doubt that coal seam gas exploration and extraction should be carefully monitored. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's recent inquiry into this bill received a raft of submissions from a diverse range of people and organisations on a diverse range of concerns. I will take a moment to highlight why the work of the Senate committee process is so important: it allows that deeper scrutiny of the legislation and it allows those peak organisations and individuals—anyone in the community—to come forward with their concerns, their science and their information as to why they believe the bill should or should not pass this Senate. I have to say that, during this process, I realised that perhaps coal seam gas was not something about which I had a great amount of knowledge. But being part of that committee process allowed me to have a much deeper understanding of why this bill is so important, why the amendments are so important to add water resources to the EPBC when we are talking about coal seam gas and large coalmining developments.


Among the number of concerns that were raised by submitters to that inquiry process was the uncertainty and ambiguity around current science. There were a range of concerns. In 2012 the parliament passed the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill to create a reference panel to provide that expertise to assessment processes and to address some of those concerns. However, the persistent perception of any stakeholder is that some regulatory authorities in states—particularly New South Wales and Queensland, where coal seam gas exploration is most common—have relegated good environmental outcomes and processes to a secondary role in favour of development. That is a very self-interested approach they have taken to address their legislative roles in their own states. I am particularly talking about Premier Barry O'Farrell and Premier Campbell Newman, who are happy to ignore genuine environmental concerns for a quick buck. As the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales submitted:


… it is important to recognise that the states do not necessarily have the national interest at heart when they are assessing these types of proposals. States can often directly benefit from projects that they are assessing, whether it is through royalties on mining and gas resources or through direct income to state-owned agencies that are carrying out projects within their own state.


That is exactly why the member for New England's amendment is so important. It is because of that self-interested attitude of some state governments when it comes to developmental proposals around this issue of coal seam gas in return for dollars in their coffers and poor environmental outcomes. That is why the EPBC is so important and that is why the addition of water resources to it is so important. It is also why, on top of that, the amendment provided by the member for New England is so important.


Further, the Australian Network of Environmental Defender's Offices, ANEDO, also made a number of representations to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, including the recommendation of a broad water trigger in the EPBC to cover other forms of mining. It submitted that:


… drawing on our extensive experience as environmental lawyers, we developed 10 best practice standards for planning and environmental regulation in response to COAG proposal to streamline environmental assessment. We then evaluated relevant laws in each State and Territory against these standards. Based on our analysis, no State or Territory currently has a regulatory regime that reflects ANEDO's 'best practice metric'.


The committee was sympathetic to these concerns, as it was to the significant level of community concern around coal seam gas proposals.


In addition to the environmental and agricultural concerns, there was a uniform concern about the general regulatory approach and the inability of farmers to prevent broad-scale development activity on their own properties. Farmers on their own properties are unable to prevent such broad-scale development. On that basis, I take the point made by Senator Birmingham, who tried to suggest that the opposition has interest and concern when it comes to the environment and, presumably, farmers—those living and working in the agricultural areas of our nation. Yet he then rebutted such a claim by not showing any kind of support for the addition of the water trigger to the act. He did not give any alternative though as to what his solution would be for farmers who have no opportunity to prevent broad-scale development on their own properties. Would Senator Birmingham like the addition of water to all developments? I did not hear him saying that. I would not think he would be referring to that. He did talk about the lack of uniformity of water and that it does not apply to all developments through this amendment, but it is actually focused on coal seam gas developments and large-scale developments of the coalmining industry. He did not provide any alternative and yet at the same time he wanted to appear to be all concerned for and interested in those poor farmers who are affected. All of that, to me, is just gobbledygook and does not make any sense. It does not do anything, as opposed to the bill that is before us today that does do something for those farmers. It goes to the heart of the Australian community's concern when it comes to our water resources that are affected by coal seam gas developments and large-scale coalmining developments. Through its process, the Senate committee found that:


… the rapid and extensive development of coal mining and CSG mining in particular and the great community concern that these activities have raised require that concerns about these activities should now be addressed.


That is exactly what we are doing here today. Indeed, it is important to recognise that the investigation into coal seam gas is substantially a story of powerful interests at a state level avoiding the proper scrutiny that the federal government is able to provide as a result of its expertise and distance from that specific development. That is why the committee and the government are supporting this bill to bring coal seam gas and other coalmining projects under the appropriate environmental scrutiny. The federal government very much has an important role here to act in the national interest. That is why the amendment to this bill is so very important.


In closing, I would like to recognise the efforts of a number of my parliamentary colleagues: those Senate committee members who were part of the inquiry into this bill, those colleagues who were part of the development of this bill in this place and in the other place—particularly Mr Windsor's amendment to ensure that proper assessments of coal seam gas are not overridden by bilateral agreements—and also Senator Waters, who previously presented a bill to the Senate attempting to address some of these concerns. Also, I particularly want to recognise the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, who has been a stalwart defender of the environment, due process and science. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-05-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:38):  In commencing my contribution to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill, I remind senators of the very proud record the Liberal and National parties have when it comes to the environment in Australia. If you look back, every single piece of practical environmental legislation that actually benefits Australia and benefits our biodiversity is an action of Liberal-National party governments. Can I mention a few of those before I get onto the EPBC Act, which is, again, a creation of the Liberal-National party coalition.


Liberal governments prohibited sand mining on Fraser Island. Liberal governments banned whaling in Australian waters. Liberal governments declared the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The same governments proclaimed the Kakadu, Uluru, Christmas Island and Coral Sea national and maritime parks. Five properties were placed on the World Heritage List under the Fraser government. They included the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and South West Tasmania. Liberal-National party governments also passed the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act.


Our governments regulated the uranium industry in the Northern Territory and enacted major pieces of legislation to control pollution, especially for the protection of the high seas. Coalition governments legislated for the introduction of things which are now taken for granted such as unleaded petrol as a pollution-control measure. Right throughout the history of coalition governments, programs have been introduced for water protection, soil protection and tree promotion around our country. It was a Liberal government that had Australia's first ever environment minister.


We have a very proud record of practical and sensible work for Australia's environment and biodiversity. It is something that you will never, ever hear uttered from the lips of the Greens political party because they loath with a passion anyone from this side of the chamber—particularly in an environmental sense. If you look back through history, you will see that all of the sensible and practical actions taken in Australia for our environment have been the work of coalition governments. Indeed, it was my friend the then Senator Robert Hill, as Minister for the Environment, who introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Nowhere did we hear the Greens or the Labor Party calling for this sort of legislation, but it is something that came through—like the green zones on the Great Barrier Reef. These are major, practical enhancements to Australia's environmental protection and management.


We are proud of what we have done, but we have done it in a sensible way and in a way that did not impinge on Australia's economy, increase our costs of living or decrease our attractiveness for investment—the sort of investment that has kept Australia to the forefront of the world. The difficulty with the legislation that has been introduced by coalition governments is that sometimes other governments get to be in charge of them. Once they are in charge, they can make very stupid decisions that really take us no further but make political points and attract preferences from the Greens political party, keeping the current Labor government—and many other Labor governments—in power.


I heard the previous speaker praising Mr Windsor, as well the Labor Party should because, if it were not for Mr Windsor, Australia would have had a decent government, a proactive government and a sound financially managing government three years ago. But Mr Windsor—through his, I might say, crassness—kept Ms Gillard and this dysfunctional Labor government in power long after they should have been thrown onto the scrap heap of political history—as they will no doubt be later this year.


The bill before us is another example of overkill by the Australian Labor Party at the urgings of Mr Windsor, for his own purposes, and the Greens political party. The coalition will not be opposing it, but we do make the point—yet again—that this legislation simply duplicates the powers that the states already have. The Labor government has spoken a lot about this one-stop shop process of environmental regulating, but again—as with everything the Labor government does—it is all just words. I, like 95 per cent of other Australians, have simply stopped listening to anything this government says.


Today, on what I call 'fantasy Tuesday', when we are preparing for what is very loosely called a budget, again we see that nobody really cares what is going to be said tonight. Nobody cares at all what is said because everybody knows from past performance that, no matter what the Treasurer says tonight, it will not happen. Remember in the last two or three budgets when he promised those surpluses? Do you remember that, Madam Acting Deputy President? His speech last budget night was so exact, so precise, so forceful about the need for a surplus. And not only on budget night, but 500 times since, have the Treasurer and the Prime Minister assured every Australian it was essential for the peace, order and good government of Australia, and for our children and grandchildren, that we must have a surplus. And yet a few weeks ago we eventually heard from the government's own lips what every sane commentator has been saying for 12 months: that there was not going to be a surplus. Of course, the only mystery about tonight's so-called budget is how big the deficit will be. Senator Carr is sitting here. He knows. He has robbed his foreign aid budget to try and reduce the deficit. How could any foreign minister do that! I have not heard the Greens comment too much about that just yet.




Senator Bob Carr:
  The aid budget has been increased by 9.6 per cent!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Oh, I see! So you are just taking it away to spend it onshore in trying to deal with a problem you created, Minister—not you personally but your party—with all those illegal arrivals into Australia. So you shift the foreign aid budget from offshore and bring it onshore and spend it in Australia. And what did I hear this morning? I heard that Australia is the third biggest recipient in the world of its own foreign aid budget. Only a Labor Party could do that! And have we heard a murmur from the Greens about this? We hear about how the Greens all want to increase foreign aid. But when they are mates of the Labor Party, which diverts foreign aid from overseas onto Australian shores to look after that hideous problem that Ms Gillard and her crew have brought upon Australia, do we hear anything but a murmur from the Greens political party?


I expect that tonight in the budget there will be no money allocated for the Great Artesian Basin. Senator Waters has gone on for 20 minutes, just before me, telling us how important the underground aquifers are—in particular, the Great Artesian Basin. When I was conservation minister the Howard government spent some $40 million capping and piping and protecting the Great Artesian Basin. I suspect that tonight, because the Labor Party has run out of money—and run out of lenders, I suspect—that program will not be renewed again. I hope I am wrong, but I doubt it. Like Senator Carr's foreign aid budget, that will be attacked to try to reduce the extent of the deficit we are facing. And do we hear the Greens political party talk about the Great Artesian Basin? No. But they are pretty big on coal seam gas because they see it as an issue of the day, an issue where they can try to resurrect their dwindling political fortunes. We have all seen how the Greens political party has nosedived in recent elections everywhere. So they look around desperately and say: 'Who can we fool to come onside and support us? Ah, the farmers! Let's pretend we are the farmers' friends.' Well, Senator Waters, if you are the farmers' friends, what are you doing for all those farmers and landholders up in my neck of the woods in Northern Australia who are in desperate straits because of the live cattle ban that you and your Labor Party mates inflicted on them? That action of the Labor government and the Greens, supported by Mr Windsor, has been the single most destructive action of any government in recent times towards our farming community.


And it is not only the northern beef cattle herd that is suffering, it is not only all of those people up there who are losing their homes, their livelihoods, their kids' schooling and, in many cases, their lives because of this stupid decision; it is now descending further down into our country and impacting on the southern beef cattle industry as well. The drought is exacerbating things but it all started with the Labor government's stupid decision on live cattle exports—that time when we insulted our closest neighbour, the Indonesian people, 240 million of them, by cutting off a substantial amount of their food supply without so much as a phone call; they read about it the next morning, as did the rest of us in Australia. Thank you, Senator Carr; what a magnificent action as a foreign minister trying to protect or build our relationship with our closest neighbour!




Senator Bob Carr:
  I was not even in the parliament then!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You were not even in the parliament. Thank you, Senator Carr; by saying so, you indicate that, if you had been in the parliament, perhaps you would not have done anything quite as stupid as that. And that is the point I wanted you to make, because it was perhaps the silliest, the most ridiculous, the most stupid decision that this government has ever made—and supported by the Greens political party. But hang on, it is the Greens political party who are now the farmers' friends!


This bill adds to the legislation a ninth matter of national environmental significance. Under the original legislation, introduced by former Senator Hill, the matters of national environmental significance were world heritage sites; national heritage sites; wetlands of international importance—that is, Ramsar wetlands; nationally threatened species and ecological communities; migratory species; Commonwealth marine areas; and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We are adding to that, now, another matter of national environmental significance: the impacts of coal-seam gas development and large coalmining developments on a water source. Nobody really objects to that—except for the fact that the state parliaments already have that power and have been actively using that power.


What this Labor government initiative does is what Labor governments always do: make more regulation, more red tape and more taxes; increase the cost of living and just make Australia an investment destination that is rapidly dwindling in favour. Whilst the Greens and the Labor Party all like the standard of living that we have in Australia, even they should be able to see that investment in Australia is going elsewhere. It is a bit awful when I have foreign investors telling me that they find Mali a better sovereign risk than the Commonwealth of Australia.




Senator Bob Carr:
  That is absurd.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, it is absurd, Minister, but that is what people are saying. And, Minister, you, more than others, go up to Korea and Japan; I know you are always floating around Korea and Japan. But you have been told by the Japanese, the Koreans and the Chinese exactly what I have been told.




Senator Bob Carr:
  Not once.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You have never been told that once, Minister?




Senator Bob Carr:
  Not once.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Not once! You have never been told that they are putting their investments into Africa and South America rather than into Australia? Here is our Foreign Minister—he claims that that has never been told to him once! Well, gee, Minister, you must live and work in a cocoon, because I am a mere backbencher and, when I go to those places, people—and I do not ask them—come up and tell me; they plead with me. But then I suspect that most in Korea, Japan and China can read the opinion polls, as we can here, and I suspect that, Minister, if you are being truthful in saying that no-one has told you that, they clearly have not told you that because they see you as a complete irrelevance for the next three or four months of your term as Foreign Minister.


The idea of regulating the impacts of coal-seam gas developments and large coalmining development on a water source, as I say, is not a bad one, but it is not a new one. I know that, in my state of Queensland—even, I have to concede, under the former Bligh Labor government this issue was being addressed, however poorly. But, since the Campbell Newman government has come into operation, they have been addressing this issue very precisely and exactly, with all of the science behind it and with care and the sort of management that is needed.


Again, we see the hypocrisy of the Greens political party and the Labor Party. You have only to read what Ms Gillard said when this idea was floated a little while ago. She indicated it was completely unnecessary. She goes back, I might say, to repeat—and I never thought I would say this but, by comparison you have got to—what those great Labor governments of Hawke and Keating did when these issues were addressed. They said, 'Let the states do it. Let's not duplicate the regulation. Let's not make Australia the sort of country where everything is regulated twice and even thrice by different governments.'


So the bill, as I say, addresses a sensible issue, but it is an issue that was already very clearly, precisely and exactly addressed by the various state governments around. And now that you have decent state governments across almost the length and breadth of that part of Australia that counts, you will find that this management and protection of our water resources is very well looked after by the states.


I will be voting for this bill—not that I have any reason for thinking that it is necessary. But it is simply another Labor initiative that duplicates and triplicates regulation in this country.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-05-14,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:57):  This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013 is going to be basically waved through. It will be supported. It is interesting that one of its grand architects—because they are concerned about coal and coal-seam gas—that sits behind this is none other than the independent member for New England, Mr Windsor, who sold his place to Werris Creek coal, a subsidiary of Whitehaven, for $4.625 million, which is $2,000 an acre—rather a good price, if you can get it!


In 2010, who was the minister in New South Wales? Let us see if we can remember. That is right! Wasn't it Macdonald? Wasn't Ian Macdonald the minister at that time? What was going on? It was just a very good price—a great price; such a good price that he then went on to spend another $5.9 million buying other places over near Coonamble which are also under coal licences. What a good trick! That is just a great trick.


No matter where you go with his crowd, you end up back at Macdonald and Obeid—not the good Senator Macdonald, but the other, former minister, Macdonald—because Minister Macdonald was the minister in New South Wales when Mr Windsor sold his place for a very good price; for a very good price. We have to remember that they said, 'We believe that we should have the proper environmental protections.' They set up these traps. The traps do not work. But it is a question we rightly want to ask: how do you manage to sell your place for such a good price? How do you manage to get three times what it is worth? How do you manage to do that? How do you manage to get such a good price for your place? I do not know. Do you know? How do you? I would like to sell my place for three times the price. How do I do it?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:00):  I table supplementary information to a response I previously provided to a question asked by Senator Xenophon and seek leave to have the additional response incorporated into Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—





Question:



Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that $240 million of this fund is meant to return 40 gigalitres of water to the environment, will the Commonwealth be as innovative with the rules governing the fund as they are in asking river communities in South Australia to be innovative in their approach to optimising water use? For instance, will funding be allocated to projects that assist economies of scale and new tertiary processing facilities?




Answer:



On 28 October 2012, The Hon Tony Burke, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities announced that the Commonwealth had set aside funding of $265 million for water recovery and industry regeneration projects in South Australian River Murray communities. The $265 million consists of:


Up to $180 million, subject to due diligence, from SRWUIP for the River Murray Improvements Program to recover up to 40GL of water for the environment; and


Up to $85 million, subject to due diligence, for the South Australia Industry Futures Program that will provide funds for research, regional development and industry development activities.


Funding of up to $1.2 million was approved in June 2012, for the South Australian Government to undertake a feasibility study and to prepare a business case for the proposed River Murray Improvements Program. The final business case has not been received by the Commonwealth to date. The due diligence process will review South Australia's proposal against criteria which have already been agreed by South Australia.


The scope and content of the proposed South Australian Industry Futures Program is still being developed by the South Australian Government and will be subject to due diligence assessment on submission of a business case for the program.




Question:



Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Does the government acknowledge the fear of many river communities in South Australia that this $265 million fund may go the same way as the PIIP-SA water infrastructure fund, which has such restrictive, unsuitable and poorly targeted guidelines for funding that, after more than four years, only $14 million of $110 million in the fund has been allocated?




Answer:



The Government does not accept the criticisms of PIIP-SA. It is important to note that PIIP-SA has not conducted further grant rounds because the South Australian Government has sought to use the remaining funds allocated to PIIP-SA for other State Priority Projects.


The Commonwealth is already funding projects which support irrigation communities in the South Australian River Murray. For example, South Australian irrigators were successful in receiving approval of $35 million for on-farm irrigation modernisation under the competitive on-farm program in the Southern Basin. Further funding will flow as and when the new programs pass due diligence, are approved for funding and the required funding agreements are put in place.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:11):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2013-14 Budget.


Senator Wong was asked to answer a number of questions today relating principally to the promises made in last year's budget with respect to things like the delivery of a surplus. Senator Abetz quoted directly from the budget speech given last year by the Treasurer in relation to the absolutely 'rock solid' commitment made by the government at that time that a surplus would be delivered in the present financial year. This was indeed part of a rollout of four years of budget surpluses, stretching as far as the eye could see. Minister Wong, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, was asked simply to confirm that those budget surpluses promised in the budget would still be government policy. Senator Wong made every effort she could to avoid answering that question. She made a vague allusion to governments having to respond to economic circumstances but did not illustrate for the benefit of the Senate what those circumstances might be.


I think we can safely assume that Senator Wong was not standing by the commitment made by the Treasurer in last year's budget. Nor should she, because it is already patently clear that this government has no intention of standing by those promises. They are promises that they have repeated from time to time—indeed, in the case of the commitment to produce a surplus. They are promises made some 500 times in the last 18 months or so by the Treasurer alone and countless tens of thousands of times by other Labor members, senators and representatives across the nation.


This comes in light of the commitment made by Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, in March 2008, where he said:


We will honour all of our pre-election commitments. Every one of them, every one of them.


Before that, Ms Gillard, who was then a shadow minister, said in May 2005:


The Labor Party is the party of truth telling. When we go out into the electorate and make promises, do you know what we would do in government: we would keep them. When we say them, we mean them.


Well, if a week is a long time in politics, eight years or so is an eternity.


So Minister Wong says that economic circumstances have somehow affected the outlook for this government. Something has changed to cause the government not to be able to sit by the commitment it made last year with respect to a budget surplus. Can the minister tell us which of the other promises Labor has made in the last few years are also now to be sacrificed because of economic circumstances?


When the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' was that a promise she was entitled to break because of economic circumstances, or was it other reasons that led to that breach of faith with the Australian people? When the government promised that the Commonwealth would take over public hospitals if the states did not act by the middle of 2009, was that a promise broken by virtue of economic circumstances? The promise that there would be no reckless spending, that they would make major infrastructure decisions underpinned by cost-benefit analyses—was that a promise broken by virtue of economic circumstances? The promises that there would be no new taxes, that there would be no cutbacks in IVF treatment and that there would be 64 GP superclinics—were they all broken by virtue of economic circumstances? The 12 new Defence family healthcare clinics—was that promise broken for that reason?


The government was going to get tough on people-smuggling. Well, from what Senator Cash has had to say, far from it. Was that also to do with economic circumstances? The promise that there would be no changes to the private health insurance rebate—was that caused by changed economic circumstances? What happened to the Department of Homeland Security? Do you remember that promise? Is that still coming, or has that gone—economic circumstances?


They said there would be no change to the baby bonus and there would be 260 childcare centres to end the double drop-off. What happened to them? I think we got about 10 before that promise petered out. They promised a trade training centre in every Australian secondary school. What happened to that—economic circumstances? We were promised that no trade union official or ex-trade union official would be appointed to Fair Work Australia. What happened to that promise? Gone. A promise to consult stakeholders on problem gambling reforms—gone. A promise to increase defence spending by three per cent in real terms—gone. A promise to cut red tape—gone. Tax relief, tax cuts based on the carbon tax— (Time expired)

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:17):  A budget reflects what a government does in terms of the economy. If you look at our record on the economy, there cannot be another government that comes close to demonstrating what we have delivered through previous budgets.



Opposition members interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  All that those opposite want to do is talk down the economy. Conversely, what would they do? Let us reflect on my home state of Queensland and what the Liberal National Party has done up there. They have sacked 25,000 workers. The flow-on effect for the economy in Queensland is an increase in the unemployment rate and a lack of confidence among people to go out and spend. On top of that, what else are they doing? They are selling schools. They are selling aged-care homes as well, the homes of people who are in the last days of their lives, who should be respected and treated with dignity. The LNP are selling their homes out from under their feet. What a disgrace! This is a curtain raiser to what we will see if we end up with the unfortunate situation later this year where those opposite form  government. On top of that, they are privatising all our assets in Queensland where possible. Last week I was on a road trip from Brisbane to Central Queensland. I had a very positive meeting with the council in Gladstone and they expressed deep concern over the LNP government's proposal to sell off the port. They referred to that proposal as a huge step backwards in time. The sorts of comments coming from councils who are concerned about what Campbell Newman's government has done in Queensland are also reflected in recent comments by former Prime Minister John Howard at the MFAA conference in Sydney. He said the economy is in good shape. He said that, while many people believe the Australian economy is running on empty at the moment, it is actually showing unexpected resilience. He went on to say that he is optimistic, bullish, about the future of the country and when Prime Minister Gillard, Treasurer Swan and others tell you the economy is doing better than most, they are right. That is Mr John Howard saying that we have got it right and you have got it wrong. That is your former leader in this place saying that we have got it right.


Let us look at the other things we have done. We have created nearly one million jobs since we have been in government, and that has created growth. We have 5.6 per cent unemployment, which is half the rate in Europe, which is presently at 11.9 per cent. Mr Deputy President, you are on the same committee as me, so you know that many ambassadors have come before that committee and commended us on how we handled the economy during the global financial crisis. That is why we have a AAA credit rating. We are one of only eight countries in the world to hold that rating. It is a rating that John Howard and the previous coalition government could never achieve. We are the 12th biggest economy in the world, up from 15th. That is the result of the way we managed the economy through the global financial crisis and protected jobs and growth.


I was travelling up the Bruce Highway on that trip last week. Another commitment we have made is $4.1 billion over 10 years for the Bruce Highway, compared to the $1.3 billion that those opposite managed to spend over 11½ years. The Bruce Highway is a construction site. When you drive on it, there are people with stop/go signs along the way. It is great to see. Although your trip is disrupted, it is great to see people employed on building new, better and safer roads for Queenslanders and for this nation—one thing that those opposite opposed in the stimulus package.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:22):  I rise to take note of answers to questions, especially the question from Senator Abetz to Senator Wong where Senator Wong said, 'We'll update the forecasts.' They are always updating the forecasts because they never get them right. They are not even making a good guess. Here we are: 'The surplus is here; we are out of deficit—here to stay for surpluses.' Where will the surplus be tonight? We will hear more detail—it will be around a $10 billion, $15 billion or perhaps $20 billion deficit for this financial year, whereas they, the government under Treasurer Swan, had forecast a surplus this year, even at MYEFO, back in October: 'We will have a surplus.' There will be no surplus. The Labor Party does not know what the word means. They simply borrow and borrow—and they have done it all my life, whether they be state or federal governments.


Senator Furner referred to Queensland. You would not believe it. There are 4½ million people in Queensland—roughly the same population as Ireland. Ireland owes $120 billion; the government took over the debts of their banks during the global financial crisis. Here we have Queensland owing $73 billion, and that is forecast to grow to $85 billion by 2015. They are heading down the road of Ireland. That is where the Bligh Labor government took the finances of Queensland. No wonder they have to take harsh action now to try to stop themselves going down the road of Greece. Now we have this government doing exactly the same thing. Just in the 10 months this year, on the figures of the Australian Office of Financial Management, this government has borrowed $37 billion. And there was going to be a surplus! No, there will be no surplus.


They do not care if they impact on the confidence of the Australian people. That is what Senator Wong was saying: that we on this side are destroying the confidence of the Australian people. No; you, this government, have destroyed it, through your $273 billion of debt—your waste. We can go through all the schemes: the Pink Batts; the school buildings. Take the building where we in the National Party launched our campaign at Wagga Wagga last year; just on that day the covered outdoor learning area they had built fell over—collapsed. I could go to schemes in Moree where a builder carried out the Building the Education Revolution building and was never paid. That was $600,000 of bad debt to a builder, from Reed Constructions, carrying out a government scheme for the New South Wales incompetent government at the time—I forget who was Premier, whether it was Nathan Rees or Kristina Keneally, or Morris Iemma; I know they changed premiers pretty often in those days. And here is a contractor, someone in the private sector, blowing $600,000 doing a government job. What an absolute fiasco! 


We could go out to Tottenham, a little town literally in the centre of New South Wales, where they spent $600,000 to build a school kiosk. It was so small they could not fit the microwave in it—$600,000 worth!


You are an absolute disgrace, and the Australian people do not trust you. They will not believe what the Treasurer says tonight. He is going to talk about 10 years time: $100 billion worth of infrastructure over the next 10 years. You cannot get it right three weeks out. Three weeks ago there was going to be a shortfall of income of $7½ billion. Two weeks ago it was $12 billion. A week ago it was $17 billion. You are not even making a good guess. And if you cannot manage the money, you cannot manage the economy.


This is the craziest thing of all. In October 2009, the Reserve Bank started raising interest rates. We had seven interest rate rises in a row, while the government was doing what? Stimulating the economy! So the government is borrowing money; they have their foot on the accelerator flat out, stimulating the economy, and the Reserve Bank is pulling on the handbrake! Who drives their car with their foot on the accelerator while pulling on the handbrake as they drive along? That is how stupid it is. You would not find an economist in the world who would say it would be good economic policy to borrow money and spend it while your central bank is raising interest rates to slow the economy. That is a stupidity. Of course, up went the Australian dollar. Have a look at the ramifications for rural Australia of that.


We could talk about the live exports of cattle. What a mess it has made of the beef industry! Instead of 750,000 animals going to Indonesia each year it is now down to 250,000. With the dry weather in Queensland, there is a flood of beef coming down to the southern areas and flooding the markets, and we are seeing cattle back at $20 a head. I wonder what would happen if wages went back to 1970 levels. There would be a hell of a fuss from the union movement. That will never happen. But it does not matter when you destroy the beef industry in Australia and put so many under so much pressure! You are a disgrace and the Australian people do not trust you. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:27):  I will not be lectured by the coalition on economic responsibility—absolutely no way. This is a government who has delivered for this country, a government who have strong growth. The economy is nearly 13 per cent larger than when we came to power. We are now the 12th largest economy in the world. We have a AAA credit rating. We have low unemployment—5.2 per cent. We have an exceptional job creation record. We have contained inflation. We have a low cash rate and interest rates are sitting at some of their lowest ever. That means that a family with a $300,000 mortgage is paying $5,000 less in repayments every year than under the coalition government. We have very low debt. We are the envy of the world in relation to our debt. And, on investment, there has been $1 trillion worth of investment since Labor came to power.


You just cannot get away with one-liners when you come to talk about the economy. You really cannot get away with the nonsense that spews out of Senator Joyce. I know that some of you guys over there are embarrassed when you see Senator Joyce in full flight. Well, I am sure that the voters of New England will see him in full flight and will certainly cast their view on what he will be doing.


What is the great Liberal tradition? The great Liberal tradition on the economy is: if there is a problem, throw money at the problem. That is what the coalition do. What have you got now? You had a problem with your leader, Mr Tony Abbott. The problem was that women did not respect Mr Abbott. So what was the decision? 'Well, we will give women earning up to $150,000 a year 26 weeks paid maternity leave.'


Now the rebellion has started in the coalition. Mr Hawke, Dr Jensen, Dr Washer and Senator Eggleston are all saying that this is a problem, not consistent with coalition values—whatever they are. Senator Joyce was out defending it today, when every one of the Nationals has told you that it is a dog of a policy. It is a policy that you should not put in. It is economically irresponsible. It is unfair. It is unegalitarian. And you know that is the position, so you know you are in trouble with that.


I heard Senator Ryan talking before the Senate sat for question time today. He said, 'We have a conservative approach to budgeting.' Let us go back and have a look at how the last coalition government actually budgeted. I like the quote from George Megalogenis where he said:


Every voter that cried ""cost of living"" was given a wad of cash to quieten them down.


That is the great economic responsibility of the Howard government—an absolute joke. He said:


The competition for handouts infected the government itself. Howard and Costello argued, repeatedly, over the quantity and the content of the largesse.


That was the coalition's position on the economy. You had the Treasurer and the Prime Minister arguing about largesse, and you had Mr Costello done over by the Prime Minister time and time again. He was done over—that guy had no backbone, a jelly backbone, and no credibility—and he just gave in. That is the problem we had. George Megalogenis said: 


While Howard searched for the next payment to make to his target audience Costello tried to reinforce a sense of purity—


well, he failed—


by cutting income taxes as well.


He said:


The upshot was taxes were no longer being collected to provide public services, or to build buffers in good times to deploy in bad times, but to churn back to the electorate. The budget became a frequent-voter program …

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (15:32):  I too rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong in relation to questions asked by Senators Abetz, Brandis, Joyce and Sinodinos. Senator Cameron and those senators on the other side who spoke before you, we are talking about broken promises, when you say one thing and you do something completely different. This is not about the interpretation of economic indicators, as you have just stood up and talked about; it is actually about telling the Australian public the truth. I draw to your attention that in 2008—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator RUSTON:
  I draw to your attention, Senator Cameron and others in this chamber, that in 2008 the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, titled his budget speech 'The new era of responsible economic management'. I have to say that I do not think that at the time anybody probably took a great deal of notice, but some five years on I think there is probably quite a lot of amusement out there that somebody could have entitled a speech that proved to be so wrong. The real tragedy is that the joke has been on the Australian public.


Hundreds and hundreds of times over the last five years, we have been told that we are going to have a surplus—we are going to have a surplus soon. At Christmas time, we were still going to have a surplus this year. After Christmas, we thought that maybe we were going to break even and we were going to have a small budget deficit. Two weeks ago, it was a $12 billion shortfall in revenue. One week ago, it was $17 billion in shortfall. One can only wonder, if we are losing about $5 billion a week, whether tonight's budget is actually going to tell us that we have a $22 billion budget revenue write-down. I bet we do not hear the word 'surplus' used too often in tonight's budget speech by the Treasurer.


Let us have a look at some of the other comments that the Treasurer has made. I draw these to the house's attention simply because you cannot constantly keep saying something that is constantly proved to be wrong. We all accept that every now and again you can make a mistake, but what we do in our businesses is go back and revise the errors that we have made. In 2011-12, the Treasurer said:


We are on track for surplus in 2012-13, on time, as promised—and this provides the solid foundations for the targeted investments we announce tonight.


And then, in 2012-13:


… on time, as promised.


The alternative—meandering back to surplus—would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.


And then another comment, from last year's budget:


This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time—


et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I am afraid to say how many times you can say the same thing incorrectly. You start questioning whether this Treasurer actually understands what a budget surplus is.


So what have we got? As a consequence of what I would now refer to as 'a new era of irresponsible economic mismanagement', we have a series of resulting backflips that have been caused simply because the government have had to balance the budget. Family tax benefit increases have been scrapped. Increases in the tax-free threshold, as were promised, have been scrapped. We were not going to have a levy to fund the NDIS, but apparently we now have a levy. And the list goes on and on and on. How many houses were we promised would be connected to the NBN by now? I do not have the exact figures, but I would almost guarantee that not as many houses have been connected as were promised by the minister. Where is the funding for Gonski? Where is the funding for the dental scheme? Where are the boats that were going to be stopped, as we heard Senator Cash say earlier? We believe that one of them probably popped into Australia just in the last few minutes.


But I have to say that the winner of the biggest untruth of this government's reign has got to be the carbon tax: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' As was mentioned earlier, it is not because of the global financial crisis that we have ended up with a situation where we were promised no carbon tax and we got one, but the real tragedy of the carbon tax is not the fact that the Prime Minister told us a lie but the consequences of that carbon tax on Australia. It is not just the cost of power; it is transferred into the cost of living. We have seen closed businesses. We see people out of work. We have seen the economy being constricted, and we have seen businesses become totally and utterly uncompetitive. So the great legacy of the lies and the untruths and the constant misrepresentation to the Australian people is that this government will leave a legacy that this country does not want.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:42):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death on 2 April 2013 of the Honourable Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson, AM, former minister and member for Sturt, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Ian Wilson was a minister in the Fraser government and a member of the Australian House of Representatives for 24 years, from 1966 to 1969 and from 1972 until he retired prior to the general election in 1993. Ian was born on 2 May 1932 in Adelaide to a well-known South Australian family with longstanding links to the Liberal Party. Ian's father, Sir Keith Wilson, was a prominent Australia Party and Liberal Party politician. His mother, Lady Betty Wilson, was the granddaughter of Sir John Bonython, owner of the Advertiser and a member of the first House of Representatives. She was also the great-granddaughter of Sir John Bray, the first Premier of South Australia born in that state. 


Ian Wilson was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide, and graduated in law from the University of Adelaide. As a 1955 Rhodes scholar, he obtained a further degree at Oxford. After returning to Australia, he then practised as a barrister and solicitor before entering federal parliament. His father was also the member for Sturt, from 1949 to 1966, serving for 16 years with a brief period out of office from 1954 to 1955. Following in his father's footsteps, Ian was elected to the seat of Sturt, taking over from his father in 1966. Like his father, Ian lost the seat from short period. Labor's Norman Foster held the seat for three years, from 1969 to 1972, before Ian's re-election in 1972. Ian became a member of the executive of the Fraser government when he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, a position he held for four months before being appointed to the ministry. Ian had three ministerial appointments. He was Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment from 1981 to 1982 and was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as well as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security from 1982 to 1983.


By today's standards Ian Wilson was a liberal rather than a conservative. It is notable that some of the issues Ian Wilson was particularly interested in as a parliamentarian remain current for this parliament some 20 years on. The question on the constitutional recognition of local government was opposed by the coalition in the 1988 referendum, though Ian Wilson supported the question. At the next election, the issue of constitutional recognition of local government will again be the subject of a referendum question. Hopefully the question will be successful later this year, perhaps even with the support of conservative parties. Similarly, and like our current South Australian Senate colleagues, Ian Wilson was interested in addressing the issues of water quality and water flow in the Murray-Darling system. This is another issue that this Labor government has addressed in this parliament, with the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Ian's position on income splitting for families has in part been met through tax benefits for families with children. Even so, the issue of the appropriate level of income support for women in the workforce who have children remains current for the conservative members of this parliament.


Ian Wilson served as a notable member of the liberal tradition in the Australian parliament. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences as to his wife, Mary, and to his sons, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and their families.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:46):  Today we mourn a man who was universally regarded as one of nature's gentlemen—softly spoken, somewhat diffident in manner and completely decent. I speak of the Hon. Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson AM. He was part of the unique group of Oxbridge educated small 'l' South Australian liberals who were highly thought of across the political spectrum.


Ian Wilson grew up in a family which believed in service to the community and the nation. Their service over several generations is such that their family history is interwoven with South Australia's history. Ian was born in Adelaide in 1932. He was the son of Sir Keith Wilson, a prominent UAP and Liberal parliamentarian and close friend of Sir Robert Menzies, who actually proposed the toast for the then young Ian's 21st birthday and was part of the inspiration for Ian's career in politics. It is worth remembering that Ian's father, Keith, served for 20 years in the federal parliament—six of them in the Senate—during which time he also served in the Western Desert during War II. One trusts that pairs were not an issue!


Ian's mother, Lady Betty Wilson CBE, was a granddaughter of Sir John Langdon Bonython, owner of the Advertiser and a member of the federal House of Representatives; she was also a great-granddaughter of Sir John Cox Bray, South Australia's first native-born Premier. She was heavily involved in the Women's Council of the Liberal and Country League. Ian's great-grandfather was a delegate to the pre-Federation constitutional conventions of the 1890s. So Ian certainly had politics in his blood from both sides of his family.


He went to St Peter's College in Adelaide—where an ancestor, the Reverend Theodore Percival Wilson, had been the first headmaster—and afterwards went on to Adelaide university, where he graduated in law. While at university in the early 1950s, Ian became very involved with reorganising the Young Liberals. He was the first South Australian president of the Young Liberals, which had waned during the war years, when so many young men were absent. He read for his Bachelor of Civil Law at Magdalen College, Oxford, as a 1955 Rhodes scholar from South Australia before being called to the bar at Gray's Inn. Back in Australia he worked in the family law firm, Genders Wilson and Bray, as a solicitor and was also on the board of the ALMA shoe company, later Clarks shoes.


In 1958, at the time of the split of the DLP from the Labor Party, Ian stood for the seat of Adelaide but lost as a result of the leakage of DLP preferences. On his father's retirement, in 1966, after winning a plebiscite—and here is a number—of the 10,000 party members in the Sturt electorate, Ian Wilson retained the then enormous seat for the Liberal Country League. Following a disadvantageous redistribution, he lost it by about 500 votes to Labor in 1969—to a colourful waterside worker, 'Stormy Normy' Foster. Not to be outdone, he ran for Sturt again in 1972 and beat Norm Foster by 2½ thousand votes, at a time when Gough Whitlam was winning everywhere else. He held the seat as a marginal seat thereafter.


As a backbencher at the old Parliament House, he shared offices with one John Winston Howard for a period of 18 months. According to Ian, they got to know each other quite well and respected each other, as they both strongly supported the Liberal cause. Ian respected that Mr Howard was more on the conservative side, and Howard respected that Wilson was more on the small 'l' liberal side of the broad church known as the Liberal Party.


Ian became a minister in the final years of the Fraser government. From March 1981 to May 1982, he was the minister for Home Affairs and the Environment. During his ministry he oversaw the World Heritage listing of the Great Barrier Reef over the initial opposition of the then Queensland Premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen. During this time, in his ministerial capacity, he also went to Cocos (Keeling) Islands to tell John Clunies-Ross that his rule of the islands was at an end. He protected the red crab on Christmas Island. One wonders how all these things occurred without the Greens, but a lot of things did occur, and Mr Wilson has a great record. He also oversaw the National Gallery's transition from collecting towards exhibiting. Given the intense effort he had put into the home affairs portfolio, Ian was disappointed to be so quickly elevated to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security, which occurred as a result of a reshuffle. Like his father, Ian had an abiding interest in social security. In his maiden speech in 1967, Ian made the following remarks, which are relevant today:


For the last eighteen years a Liberal-Country Party Government has implemented policies which have permitted the economic growth of the nation. The growth rate has outstripped the rate at which the population has increased, with the result that the standard of living has improved significantly. The real value—the purchasing power—of wages increased and there have been improvements in ancillary benefits such as long service leave and annual leave.


… The steady yet dramatic economic progress which has been made has enabled the Government to embark upon the development of a comprehensive social security programme.


Ian then went on to detail that program before stating: 


Members on this side of the House believe in adequate provision not only for the aged, the invalid, the widowed, the sick and the unemployed, but also for the children.


Ian was particularly interested in the impact of taxation on families and throughout his career was an advocate of income splitting, which was eventually included in the coalition's 1984 tax policy. It would be good if that could be revisited, but I doubt it will be.


During the Hawke-Keating years, Ian played an active role in the Martin banking inquiry. Ian Wilson was a classic 'small l' or moderate liberal, who played a prominent role in the formation of the South Australian Liberal Movement. Indeed, for some years he used his influence to contain the Liberal Movement within the confines of the South Australian Liberal Party, before it eventually separated. He described his political philosophy as follows:


I was a Liberal rather than a Conservative. But I believed that the Liberal Party of that period, as of even earlier periods, had to be a broad based party in circumstances where its members had the opportunity within the party to express their views and they would win some arguments and they would lose some arguments. But the give and take then was a strength that the party had.


In 1993 Ian Wilson retired from parliament, having lost the preselection for the seat of Sturt to one Christopher Pyne. The circumstances by which Ian lost the preselection for Sturt have become the stuff of folklore, and I will leave that issue to others. The then South Australian state director of the Liberal Party, Nick Minchin, noted that Ian had: 


… served the party with great distinction for 23 years, including two years as a minister in the Fraser Government and has a great and distinguished record of service to the party and the country. 


After parliament, Ian returned to his career as solicitor. He was a highly respected solicitor and became involved in a number of charities. He also chaired the company managing the heritage listed Adelaide Arcade. Continuing his interest in the arts from when he was minister, Ian became national chairman of the May Gibbs Children's Literature Trust. The North Sydney Council wanted to use May Gibbs's harbourside home, Nutcote, at Neutral Bay, as a museum rather than as a facility that encouraged today's writers for children. Ian took over the corporate structure to help run the May Gibbs Children's Literature Trust, which has given children's writers the opportunity to have a quiet creative time in studio apartments around Australian capitals, despite funding being cut by the Australia Council.


In 2002 Ian Wilson was made a Member of the Order of Australia. Significantly, the citation on his award read 'for service to the community through a range of literature, health, social welfare and cultural organisations.' In other words, his AM was not for his role as a parliamentarian but for his service to the community in the areas that were mentioned in the citation. Indeed, over his life Ian was involved in many charitable organisations, including as Vice President of the South Australian Good Neighbour Council, Vice President of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Chairman of St Matthew's Home for the Aged and President of the Australian Birthright Movement, now the Lone Parent Family Support Service. In 2001 Ian was awarded a Centenary Medal for his 'service to public life as a federal member of parliament and minister'. Ian was a committed Anglican.


I am told that Ian Wilson deliberately elected not to have a state funeral, believing that those who wished to honour his life would attend regardless. And, at his funeral on 10 April in Adelaide, St Peter's Cathedral was packed. It was attended by many of his former colleagues from the Labor Party as well as the Liberal Party, including his contemporary Chris Hurford. Ian's life was, and is, an inspiration to others. He was a man to whom service to others came naturally.


I could not end this condolence speech without paying a special tribute to Ian's wife of 52 years, Mary. Mary helped Ian doorknock his electorate. She looked after the family while Ian was at parliament, taking the whole family to Canberra when parliament sat during school holidays. By all accounts, she is a truly exceptional woman. Our condolences extend to Ian's remarkable wife, Mary, to his four children, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and to their families. The coalition mourns a truly great Australian whom we are proud to call one of our own.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT
 (16:04):  I inform the Senate that, at 8.30 am today, Senators Fifield and Siewert each submitted a letter in accordance with standing order 75, proposing a matter of public importance. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I call on the matter proposed by Senator Siewert, namely:


Cutting the budget of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency by $100m slows down Australia’s transition to a low carbon economy and ignores the evidence provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator showing that achieving 100% renewable energy is technically straightforward and increases in electricity prices would be similar to business as usual projections.


Is the proposal supported?

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-05-14,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:05):  First, the bad news: last week climate scientists reported that for the first time atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration figures exceeded 400 parts per million. It is estimated that the last time CO2 levels were so high was during the Pliocene geological era between three and five million years ago, prior to the evolution of humans. Climatologists estimate that the last time CO2 concentration levels were this high, global average temperatures were around three to four degrees Celsius higher than today, and sea levels ranged between five and 40 metres higher. Concentrations of CO2 are the same now. They are increasing rapidly and world leaders are still procrastinating about future climate treaties, when we are supposed to have negotiated a global treaty by no later than 2015. 


At the same time, we have coal ports and a massive surge in coal exports and exploration of coal seam gas. That is why we are in a climate emergency right now—and we are in a climate emergency. In the real world—the physical world that we live in, the world of ice, of oceans, of atmosphere and of ecosystems—we are in crisis. We are in an emergency and it is a critical decade. If we do not reduce CO2 levels rapidly then we are leaving to our children and their children, to all future generations, a planet which is increasingly unliveable. Lord Stern said just this week that there will be continent-wide collapses in agriculture, with millions being forced to leave their homes and seek refuge in other places. That is the kind of world that we are facing unless we get on with acting on climate change. Unfortunately, when the 400 parts per million record ticked over it did not receive the same kinds of headlines that it should have got around the world and particularly here in Australia. I suggest that is because people simply do not want to know—their heads are not in the real world; their heads are in the world of the profits being generated by the coal companies, by the resource based economy, and they do not want to see an alternative future. 


It is in this context of the obvious need to get on with building a 100 per cent renewable energy future that I want to talk about the absurdity of cutting funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. After the last election the Greens insisted upon the creation of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to negotiate a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Within the MPCCC we argued that more money was required to support renewable energy research and development as well as commercialisation, and that the allocation of funds should be depoliticised. ARENA was established as an independent statutory authority because this government, and in particular the previous energy minister, Martin Ferguson, were unable to effectively administer many renewable energy programs. He was a coal and gas man through and through, and we saw a constant raiding of the funds available for renewable energy.


A classic example is the Solar Flagships program. What a fiasco that was. It started in 2009 with $1.5 billion, and Labor will go to the 2013 election with not a single panel or heliostat installed, despite more than 50 projects worth some $80 billion jostling for a bite of the action. It beggars belief that just a single project, a 150-megawatt solar PV facility at Broken Hill and Nyngan, will eventually be built with flagships funding. It is a shame, a disgrace, that that has been allowed to occur. The main failure of the scheme was that it insisted upon very large projects, and these projects could not negotiate power purchase agreements. It should be remembered that the industry warned the government about these problems at the outset. I am confident that ARENA, together with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, with whom it will collaborate closely, has absorbed those lessons. 


The Greens have set up two statutory authorities, starting from the earliest research and development through to the pilot stage, which is the ARENA funding, and then an overlap on the pilot stage and out to delivering and leveraging private sector finance through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These were meant to be independent statutory authorities beyond the ability of the fingers of governments to raid them, because these are the technologies we need for the future. It has now been reported that around $100 million, it could even be $200 million, will be cut from the ARENA budget tonight. 


There is also the view that the government is out there saying that these carbon-pricing schemes were designed to be revenue neutral—that is, receipts from the sale of permits should equal expenditure on assistance measures and industry development. This makes absolutely no economic sense. Why should expenditure on climate related programs be revenue neutral? Should we not be making the building blocks of the future, the race to 100 per cent renewable energy, a priority in this nation? If we are going for a society which is low economy, new jobs and new innovation with a sustainable planet and life and wellbeing for the people on it, then the race is on and it makes no sense to cut these programs.


We have a situation where, in this climate emergency, we will not be able to contribute equitably to the global challenge of limiting global warming to two degrees unless we get on with it. Australia's carbon budget is going to be tight as we proceed, and we will ultimately require complete decarbonisation of the electricity sector. That is why it is important to get on with it now, as it is apparent that renewable energy is reliable, and not more expensive than the status quo, and we should seek to capture the benefits of long-term transition planning and driving down costs with well-focused R&D. That is what ARENA's job was to do, and I can inform the Senate that the Greens will not be supporting legislation that cuts funding to ARENA. It will have to come through as separate legislation. We set it up in such a way that that would be the case. We will not be supporting legislation and we challenge the coalition to not support it either and, if the coalition goes into government, to not go ahead with those cuts.


AEMO recently reported on how we can achieve 100 per cent renewable energy. That report is special because for years it has been argued that we could not go ahead with 100 per cent renewable energy. We listened endlessly to people in here saying we could not have 100 per cent renewable energy. AEMO undertook the study as a result of the work we had done in the climate change committee, and they have come up with this finding that 100 per cent renewable energy is possible and now it is just a question of cost. The AEMO report estimated that there was the potential for increases in wholesale electricity prices, but the problem is that AEMO did not look at a business-as-usual increase in electricity prices as a comparison. For the life of me I cannot understand why they refused to model business as usual as opposed to the cost of going to 100 per cent renewables. We can only assume that AEMO's bias is against renewables—but no matter. 


Other assessments have also projected that we can get to 100 per cent renewable energy right now. That is exactly what we should be doing. The carbon price modelling commissioned by Treasury, particularly that which assumes that the world will adopt policies to achieve the agreed objective of limiting global warming to two degrees, and the current CSIRO eFuture modelling both project wholesale electricity prices that are similar to the AEMO study. Of course it is important to remember that wholesale prices are a relatively small component of retail prices.


The point I want to make very strongly today is that we can be getting on with it; we can deliver 100 per cent renewable energy. It is technically feasible to do so; it is just a matter of political will, of timing, of the amount of money we put into it. Now is not the time to be cutting and slowing down our move to 100 per cent renewables. I had the good fortune, with my colleague Senator Ludlam, to be in Spain last year when we went to the Gemma solar plant—a large solar thermal plant with molten salt in storage—and we stood in what Australia still thinks of as the future, but it is the present in Spain. Other places are doing it. We should have large-scale solar thermal in Australia. I want to see ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation delivering for Australia, and I want to see AEMO getting on with the job of driving and working with the community and with business to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:15):  I also rise to speak on this MPI, joining with Senator Milne—both of us coming from the state of Tasmania as senators—in recognising that Tasmania is the state with a very high amount of renewable energy, something that we both I am sure are proud of. And, in some way, one day Tasmania may be the first state to be 100 per cent renewable, one would hope. I speak on this MPI, first and foremost to highlight the fact that of course the government will not—and it has been said many times by the Treasurer—be providing a running commentary on speculation about possible budget measures. Suffice to say, obviously the budget will be handed down tonight at 7.30 by the Treasurer and then we will be made aware of its full detail. 


Having said that, I would like to say the Labor government very much remains committed to ARENA and its important role of improving the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies in Australia. ARENA plays a vital role in doing that, and that is why the minister bought forward legislation to ensure we have an ARENA that can do that role. In doing so, the government has a very proud record of helping develop renewable energy in this country. In fact, when Labor returned to office in 2007, solar PV was a niche industry and our emissions were growing strongly each year. Last month, the government reached the milestone of supporting over one million rooftop solar panels with a total capacity of 2,500 megawatts. Around 2.5 million Australians live under rooftops with solar power. Again, in 2007, around 20,000 megawatt hours were produced each year by household solar. Now it is around 3.3 million megawatt hours—the equivalent of taking around a million cars off the road. Again, in 2007, there was around 1,140 megawatts of wind farm capacity across the country. Now, wind farms with capacity totalling 3,000 megawatts are registered under the Renewable Energy Target, and many more projects are being developed. Again, I refer to some of those in Tasmania, one recently coming on board being Musselroe Wind Farm.


Labor's response to the Climate Change Authority's Renewable Energy Target review makes it clear that we are committed very much to the 41,000 gigawatt hour large-scale target, and we welcome the fact that, with lower demand, renewable energy is now likely to exceed the 20 per cent target by 2020. The rise of household solar and wind generation is now part of a broader transformation of Australia's electricity market with both the carbon price and Renewable Energy Target playing a key role. After the first nine months of the carbon price in operation, emissions in the National Electricity Market are down by 7.7 per cent, or 10 million tonnes. Generation from seven of the most highly polluting power stations is down by 16 per cent and renewable energy output is up by almost 30 per cent. That shows very much how carbon pricing is having an effect on our emissions output.


To maximise our potential for large-scale renewables and Australian innovation the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, ARENA and Clean Technology Innovation Program are very important measures to complement both the carbon price and the Renewable Energy Target. ARENA is already administering $1 billion allocated to assisting operations like this CS Energy's Kogan Creek solar boost project. This will be the world's largest solar project to be integrated with a coal fired power station and will provide 44,000 megawatt hours of zero emission electricity a year. ARENA is also supporting AGL Energy MPV manufacturer First Solar to build a project in western New South Wales that will generate enough electricity to power 30,000 homes. 


I did note that Senator Milne referred to the AEMO report. I understand it is only a draft report at this stage. We will need to wait until the end of this month for the government to consider the AEMO final report, but the draft model does paint a couple of scenarios and estimates costs for 2030 and 2050. It may not have looked at costs of shifting to 100 per cent renewable energy, but whatever the detail of that report we should wait until it is handed down in full. I understand it is only in a draft phase. 


I would again like to point out the importance of ARENA. It has been playing a key role in ensuring that we do meet our renewable energy targets, that we go beyond those targets. I am very supportive of Australia becoming a renewable energy country and being a leader in that sense for our neighbours, who are looking at us and looking at the work we are doing in leading the Asian region when it comes to reducing our emissions. We know that some of those developing nations have some way to go. But we also know that some of the more economically advanced parts of our Asian region, such as China and India, are working very hard to ensure that they reduce their emissions just as we are doing. That, of course, is where ARENA brings together a range of renewable energy initiatives that need to be taken into account.


I would like to point out the fact that we do have an alternative here, an alternative that hopefully will not become a reality post-September 14 this year. That is of course the coalition's plan for reducing emissions. I understand the coalition is committed to reaching the same emissions reduction target. However, the means and ways by which they have decided to go about doing this is certainly going to be hitting taxpayers in this country in a very hard way. The coalition's plan, as we know, will be funded entirely on-budget as opposed to the carbon price, which we have in place which is paid by the biggest polluters. The coalition claim its policy would cost $10.5 billion over 10 years, but we know that the real cost of the coalition's policy is at least $48 billion by 2020.


In fact, Treasury analysis released last year shows that the economic costs of the coalition's plan would be higher for two reasons:


First, direct domestic action would forego opportunities for cheaper, internationally sourced abatement. Second, direct action programs are generally less effective at driving take up of all potential abatement opportunities.


On top of that, the independent Grattan Institute has estimated that there is a $100 billion black hole in the opposition's costings due to the impact of their direct action plan. Without a carbon price or ETS in the federal budget, $100 billion is a third of the entire federal government budget. That is coming from the Grattan Institute. We know exactly where that $100 billion black hole will be funded from—it will be borne by taxpayers. Let us make no mistake: we have an opposition who says they are committed to reducing emissions, but the ways and means that they are going to use to go about doing this is going to be hurting every single taxpayer in this country. 


We already have in place a scheme, which will soon be a trading scheme, that is already working well and already reducing emissions. I have just provided to you the figures on that. But because the coalition's plan is entirely on budget, taxpayers' funds will be used to pay polluters to lower their pollution. Not only is that going to hurt taxpayers; it is also going to absurdly have taxpayers giving money to polluters to reduce their pollution. It is the polluters that are doing something wrong to our environment, not the taxpayers. And yet the coalition will make taxpayers pay for the wrongdoings of polluters, who therefore will have no impetus at all to change their behaviour. They do have that impetus under the carbon pricing scheme that the Labor government has put in place. The differences are clear there. That is something for taxpayers to consider when they are thinking about government policy to reduce emissions after September. I know which one I would prefer; I know which one my family would prefer. In fact, I cannot imagine any taxpayer in the country wanting the coalition's direct action plan. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-05-14,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:25):  I thank the Greens for the opportunity to speak to this matter of public importance and note the fact that in doing so the Greens have highlighted another Labor broken promise. I am pleased that the Greens have done so. There are a number of ways in which they and their priorities have been the victims of these broken promises.


That, perhaps, is why the level of coordination and communication that used to exist between the marriage partners of the Greens and the Labor Party seems to have broken down a little bit. They obviously cannot manage to get their lines straight anymore. Senator Singh was just waxing lyrical about reductions in emissions that may have occurred and yet prior to her Senator Milne was waxing equally lyrical about how the latest global data indicates record level of emissions and emissions growth. Senator Milne is right: the challenge of climate change remains one of how you get a global solution; how you get global action; how you get emissions down from those who are far bigger emitters than Australia. Far too much of the debate in this place and far too much of the sidelining seems to be about this belief that Australia going it alone can make all the difference when the reality is that we need the action of the major emitters to make a real difference in this regard. From her rhetoric, Senator Singh seems to believe this. And this is true of Labor's and even the Greens' rhetoric.


We got this little lecture at the end about the biggest polluters—those evil and terrible biggest polluters. The carbon tax is paid by the biggest polluters, Senator Singh was telling the Senate. The carbon tax is paid by voters, because voters are consumers, just like tax is paid generally by voters. In the end, the carbon tax is passed through the economy, passed through the goods and services, into all manner of prices—and in particular, of course, the price of electricity, which has spiked directly because of the carbon tax by around 10 per cent nationwide. That is the impact that is hurting small businesses and consumers around the country and contributing very much to the tight margins that many businesses are facing.


Senator Singh went on from wrongly stating who is paying the price of Labor's carbon tax to talking about the fact that these are the polluters who are doing wrong. Let us make sure that these evil and terrible polluters are named and shamed! Should we try to reduce carbon emissions? Absolutely. But let us understand that the companies we are talking about here are in many instances companies that employ thousands and thousands of Australians. They generate jobs for many Australians. Entire towns and communities have been built upon these companies. They are making products, in many cases, that are essential to our public and private infrastructure needs. These are not evil wrongdoers; these are companies undertaking valuable economic activities. We should be seeking, of course, to reduce their emissions; but we should not be demonising them as the government—and Senator Singh in particular—seem hell-bent on doing. We should not be running around describing these companies with such pejorative language as 'evil big polluters' when the truth is that these are companies that overwhelmingly are simply doing their bit to try to employ Australians and grow our economy, and paying a whole world of Labor's new and increased taxes along the way.


It may come as a surprise, because the Greens had enough faith to sit down and do a handshake agreement or indeed sign a piece of paper with the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, that the Greens have been dudded in relation to the deal they stitched up on the carbon tax. They have been dudded $100 million in today's budget. But it should not really come as a surprise, because it is one of so may broken promises—and, of course, the Greens have been dudded by the government before. It should not be a surprise, because tonight we will see a world of broken promises in the budget. We will see the biggest of all: the broken promise that relates to the delivery of a surplus this year, a promise that had been made on some 500 or 600 occasions by Ms Gillard and Mr Swan, let alone countless times by all the other members of the government. Just 12 months ago this was the surplus that was going to deliver; this was the start of a whole wave of surpluses. Now what we know is that, under this government, we are simply in the middle of a decade of debt.


There are other broken promises in this budget alone that also relate to the Greens' carbon tax deal: the promise of further tax cuts in 2015, the promise of an increase in the tax-free threshold that was due to occur—that was part of the Greens' deal with the Labor Party for the carbon tax, and that is another promise that will be broken in tonight's budget. So, even the carbon tax compensation to consumers and households is not sacred under this government. That compensation that consumers and households were promised they would get in return for having to pay the increased costs of living that come with a carbon tax is now starting to be stripped away. That is not the only part of assistance to households that is going to be stripped away in this budget. The so-called mining-tax-funded changes to FTB A are equally being stripped away tonight.


But there are other areas of the Greens' carbon tax package that we have started to see the government unwind. We have had a hit to families and to households with the 2015 tax cuts being abolished, and we have this $100 million cut to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Equally, once upon a time in the life of this carbon tax was the $2 billion Contract for Closure Program, which was going to provide funds and incentives to support the early closure of, in particular, brown coal fired power stations. Ultimately, the government scrapped that program and returned the funds to consolidated revenue. It has not helped their budget bottom line, I must note, as an aside; nonetheless, the government abandoned another commitment of what it would do out of the carbon tax.


And it is hardly surprising, because it is a long and sorry list of broken promises and bungles and mistakes that this government has racked up across the environment and climate change portfolios. It is little wonder the Greens decided to tear up their agreement with the government. It is just a shame that the Greens continue to prop up the government in every way possible—in the types of things that we have discussed many times in this chamber before, like the Home Insulation Program and the Green Loans Program, programs that were bungled by this government, programs that cost billions, inconvenienced thousands and caused severe hardship to many.


We have seen other programs come and go under this government. Indeed, just at the last election we saw commitments to things like the Citizens Assembly, or the Cash for Clunkers—Labor Party policies—



Senator Lundy interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  That's right, Senator Lundy: Labor Party policies you took and ran under the last election and then promptly forgot about and tore up and abandoned straight afterwards in favour of imposing a carbon tax instead.


So we have seen dramatic change from this government of always doing, it seems, the opposite of that which it promised to do previously. I stand in this chamber not at all surprised by the fact that the government has broken another promise—that it has stepped away from another part of their carbon tax package. Of course, it is not making any changes to the tax itself. I note, though, that tonight when the budget is handed down the tax looks destined still to have unbelievable rates attached to it once it reaches its floating period. Once the carbon tax is floated I expect, based on all reports, that the government's budget will still be estimating far greater revenue receipts than it is likely to receive, despite the fact that it will be writing down billions of dollars in revenue in the budget tonight for those forward years.


The Greens can come into this place and complain if they like about the fact that the government has dudded them, but this is a government that has dudded so many others, broken so many other promises and has such a track record of breaking its promises that, frankly, I have little sympathy for the Greens in this regard, and it should certainly come as no surprise to them.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-05-14,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (16:35):  It is always interesting to follow Senator Birmingham on a speech about climate change. We are certainly not looking for your sympathy, Senator Birmingham. Although I know that you believe that climate change is a massive issue that we need to face up to, regrettably, Senator Birmingham, you boss does not. He thinks it is crap. That is quite a big part of the problem. The cross-party consensus is that pricing carbon and making polluting industries pay, thereby becoming more efficient and financing the next generation of energy infrastructure in this country, was the most efficient way to drive emissions reduction. It is not the only way to do it, but it is a pretty good place to get going. That consensus broke down. It broke down around the time that the defective CPRS was being debated by this parliament.


As for the government, the problem with the Labor Party is that you never know what you are going to get. It seems to depend on which faction has its hands on the steering wheel at any given time as to whether you get something like the Clean Energy Act, which is working and driving carbon emissions down in the electricity sector in Australia. That is the data. It is not coming from Greenpeace. It is coming from the people who collect energy and greenhouse gas statistics in Australia. Greenhouse gas emissions are going down, electricity use is falling and it is becoming more efficient. Also, renewable energy infrastructure is displacing coal. That is a fact. The scheme we set up is working. It was written with the Greens—with Senator Brown, Senator Milne and the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt—with the Minister for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation, Greg Combet, and with the House Independents in the cross-party climate change committee that was proposed by Senator Milne after the last election. The outcome we got was not perfect, but it was better than nothing. It is certainly better than the defective CPRS, which was unmourned, from a few years before, in that it actually works. We knew that the CPRS would not. So I am very happy to give credit to the government for entering into that agreement and delivering a package that worked.


This is also, of course, the party that is trying to double fossil fuel exports, not just out of the east coast coal ports but also out of the gas industry in Western Australia. It appears that you can never really tell what you are going to get with the Labor Party. It seems to depend more on internal factional disputes as to what sort of public policy result is going to fall out, so we get the sort of outcomes we are seeing tonight, where it is believed something in the order of $100 million will be cut out of ARENA. These are good programs. They are programs that get renewable energy developers a leg up so that they can participate in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation process. So, you take the small scale investments, the loans, the grants, and the research and development funding that ARENA provides and that gets you into the main game of building large-scale renewable plants, where the CEFC has been established, with $10 billion worth of funding, to get large-scale projects over the line. And it is working. If it is given time, if it is allowed to continue to work and does not have a wrecking ball put through it by a proposed alternative government, led by an individual who does not even believe climate change is real, we in Australia will continue the transition to a clean energy future.


As Senator Milne said, on the basis of our visit to Spain last year we realised it was not the future that we were talking about; it was the present: it has been built. And a plant six times larger than the one we visited in December is under construction in Nevada at the moment, at much less cost per megawatt hour. These are plants we should be building in Australia. What we say to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and what we say to the government is: look west, look to the goldfields of Western Australia, look to the inland Pilbara and look to the mid-west, to the east of Geraldton, where there is a whole community calling out for this, and a town—a regional city—that has developed its future plan for development based on zero-emissions electricity. Again, this is an initiative not led by the Greens—but supported, certainly, wholeheartedly by the Greens.


This is breaking out all over the place, in areas like Geraldton and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. One of the things I did when I went to work as a staffer in a state Greens office in Western Australia in 2001 was write a letter in support of the Solar Cities bid by the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, whose mayor at the time was Ron Yuryevich. There are towns and regional centres right across Australia that are crying out for this kind of investment and this kind of technology, not just for the sorts of reasons we might expect but also, in terms of the mining industry, as a hedge against rising gas prices. We developed because Western Australia is not in the national electricity market and the Western Australian Independent Market Operator could not be compelled to do a 100 per cent renewable energy study for WA. We undertook to do it ourselves, because the state government is aggressively disinterested in understanding what kind of investment will be required to build out this sort of infrastructure in WA. So, we had consultants come in and assist us in developing scenarios for 100 per cent renewable energy for WA, and we call this Energy 2029.


I think it is tremendously important that AEMO—as Senator Milne has outlined, a pretty conservative entity that would not necessarily be prone to flights of fancy in its models around 100 per cent renewable energy—came to the conclusion that it is possible for Australia to run on renewable energy in its entirety. That is a big ask. The south-west of Western Australia is an island grid, not connected across the Nullarbor to the NEM. In collaboration with the body Sustainable Energy Now—engineers and people who have worked in the electricity—we are taken through the fast-moving world of renewable energy: the runaway uptake of rooftop PV, the astonishing solar fields of Andalucia and Nevada, and innovations in wind energy, wave energy, geothermal energy and bioenergy. The largest renewable energy generator in Western Australia at the present time is the Perth metropolitan area, because of the amount of rooftop PV that has gone in in Western Australia. These things are happening.


The policies we have put in place are not perfect. They need to stay stable, they need to not be pulled apart by people who have managed to convince themselves that there is nothing here to worry about. But they are working, and we are now driving the transition we have been seeking. The Energy 2029 study, like the AEMO report, found that the move to 100 per cent renewable energy is possible. And, if you take fuel costs out to 2029 into account, it is not that much more expensive than business as usual because once you have put the capital plant in you have eliminated your fuel costs. It is a completely different way of thinking about electricity generation. A crucial thing that our report found—which I think goes against some of the hysteria that is levelled at people promoting the next generation of installation of this sort of technology—is that a renewable future in fact provides at least three times as many jobs as the current number employed in coal, oil and gas in WA. There are two or three gas power stations in WA that have no staff at all. It is not necessarily a huge employer, and that is something we need to keep in mind. Again, these are based on very conservative government figures from BREE that show more than 22,000 net new jobs would be created just in WA through that transition out to the year 2029.


So this is something that the Australian Greens will be taking to the next election, and we will certainly be looking very closely at the budget when the Treasurer stands up tonight and delivers his speech. The question is whether we can take the government seriously—because we know we cannot take the opposition seriously—on renewable energy not just as an investment strategy for places like Western Australia, the Sunbelt, the inland Pilbara and the mid-west but also because climate change is real, because time is running out and because we are forcing our climate back to a place where it has not been for at least three million years. Whether Mr Abbott believes it or not is immaterial, because you cannot fool the atmosphere. The strategic leak that appear to have been made to the gallery—to soften the blow, as it were—is that there will be cuts to funding in this vital area of research and development into renewable energy, which would have ensured that we do not end up simply buying this stuff from overseas countries in 10 or 20 years time, when it is too late.


We can do this here. For all the acknowledgement right across the chamber of the crisis in the Australian manufacturing sector—and what has been done to it, partly by the high value of the dollar—we have some of these things right in front of us. We have some of the best research institutions in the world and some of the best researchers, who then go overseas to do this work. We have absolutely no excuse.


Senator Birmingham stands up and says things like, 'This is all about much larger emitters than us.' This is not just a crisis; it is also an opportunity. But it is not an opportunity that will be met by cutting the vital research and development funding that Australian renewable energy developers need to do the job that we urgently need them to do.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-05-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:45):  I am a bit sick and tired of the lectures and pontificating from the Greens in relation to renewable energy, as if they were the only ones who cared about the climate. The position that they are putting up now is that they want the complete decarbonisation of the Australian economy. I am not sure over what period this complete decarbonisation will take place, but I know, from a Labor perspective, that we would like to see the economy decarbonised over a period of time. But it has to be done on the basis of taking into account the national interest and the interests of communities that are reliant on coal and coal fired power stations.


I brought my kids up in Muswellbrook. I was a worker in a coal fired station, so I know how much a lot of these workers rely on coal and coal fired power stations for their future. I agree with the theoretical position of decarbonising the economy, but I am also pragmatic about how that should come about, what length of period it would take and the implications for communities and industry in this country. So, for the Greens to come here and simply say, 'We're going to decarbonise the economy; we're going to take that to the next election,' is fine, but that is why they end up with a vote of about 10 per cent—because people do not believe that they are actually dealing with wider problems.


The Greens have the great luxury of never being able to govern. The luxury they have is that they can take these positions, focus in on the 10 per cent vote that they have now, and try to ensure that that 10 per cent shows up. And talking about decarbonisation of the economy—talking as if they are the only ones that care about the future for our grandkids—is a bit rich, I reckon.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  Sorry?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Cameron, ignore the interjections.




Senator CAMERON:
  It was a great interjection but it did not make any sense!


In terms of the decarbonisation issue, the other argument that has been put forward by the Greens is about research and development. I was in Spain a couple of years ago. I went there to have a look at carbon capture and storage technology. I went to the UK and spoke to some of the experts there. Let me tell you, everywhere around the world the green groups are starting to understand that carbon capture and storage is important—except here, in Australia, where carbon capture and storage is not accepted as a technology that needs to come into place to ensure the future of many countries and many industries.


You see, you cannot continue to produce cement without carbon. These issues are being dealt with by trying to get the technology in place for carbon capture and storage. I know it is difficult. I know it is expensive. I know it will mean a high price on carbon before it becomes competitive. But the International Energy Association argues that 15 per cent of all power produced in the world will have to be produced by power plants with carbon capture and storage either bolted on to the plant, or a new carbon and capture storage plant built with new power stations. So nowhere around the world are people saying we have to walk away from coal-fired power. What they are saying is there are huge problems with coal-fired power but we need to deal with those through technology and through research and development.


I am not sure what the Greens will say if the AEMO starts looking at the issue of carbon capture and storage. That would be a horror for them. But it is a practical thing that some of the major corporations around the world are looking at because without carbon capture and storage our steel and other industries that are reliant on carbon for processes will be in real trouble. I do not accept the pontification and the lecture that we get from the coalition.


The other issue is that the AEMO report says that 100 per cent renewable energy is possible—but at a cost. The estimated cost—and they said these are hypothetical costs because there is a range of costs that you would have to add on to it—in 2030 would be between $219 billion and $285 billion, and in 2050 from $252 billion to $332 billion.


The report also says one of the big issues is the distribution network. Spain—as every senator here would understand—is a much different nation to Australia in terms of where its cities are, how big the cities are, the small size of the country and where they can actually do this work. The big problem for us is we would have to run from some of the areas where we could actually get some of the thermal power capacity. We would have to have huge distribution networks and that has not been costed in to those figures that I indicated. I am not saying this to say why we should not do it. I am saying that these are the challenges that we have to face. I totally agree that climate change is real. But for us it is not like going from Malaga in the south of Spain up to Seville and up to Madrid where there are major centres, big cities with thermal power available. You just cannot do that in Australia so easily. The cost of transmission is much easier in Spain because they can get some of the networks close to the big cities. The other issue, as outlined by the AEMO, is the cost of securing land to do all of this. What is the cost of biofuels? How much land do we need to get the biofuels?


I am a big supporter of doing something about climate change. I think it would have been much better if back in 2009 the ETS had been picked up by the Greens. They did not have their eye on a double dissolution. They did not have their eye on trying to get more seats in the Senate if a double dissolution came up. Because the ETS would have been in place, the arguments that we are still facing now about pricing carbon would have been long gone and we would have been on the road to making any changes we could have made because the public would have accepted that we were in this place. The Greens, because of a mixture of purity and political expedience, just ignored what was in the interests of the nation. I am not going to be lectured by the Greens on this. I do not think it is reasonable that the public should ignore some of the costs involved in moving to complete decarbonisation, what the job impacts are on complete decarbonisation and how we can bring the public with us. I think the big problem for the Greens is a coalition whose leadership could not agree that carbon is causing a problem in the atmosphere. So it is a job for Labor and the Greens to educate the public about why we need to do this, because it will be a strongly contested political debate. To simply say that we are going to move from where we are now to decarbonisation gives those in the opposition who are opposed to action on climate change—those who do not believe in climate change—an easy attack point against communities and people who rely on coal and on carbon for their jobs.


We must educate. We must organise around this issue. We must get out there and make sure the public understands all of the realities and problems that the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are informing us of—and not just say there is going to be a magic wand of decarbonisation and everything will be okay. This will be a hard political battle and it will go on after the election. It is a battle about how we can make sure that we do not see global warming that destroys the capacity for people to live in some areas around this country. I think some sense from the Greens and less pontification and less purity would be good for this parliament.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-05-14,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (16:56):  Senator Cameron, I have to pull you up on one point that you made earlier in your speech. You said that the Greens have the luxury of never having to govern. I beg to differ; I believe over the last 2½ years the Greens have had a huge role in governing this country. In fact, I do not think we would have a carbon tax had it not been for the Greens' interference in the policies of the Labor Party. Do not forget, it was your very leader who stood up and said: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and, as soon as she was in a minority government and required the Greens' support, all of a sudden we had a carbon tax. I raise that as a point of clarification on your comments.


Senator Ludlam, I agree with you: research and development is an extraordinarily important part of this country's future. It has played a hugely important role in this country over many, many decades. The fact that we are a very smart country has allowed us to keep a competitive advantage. So I hope that you support research and development in other areas, including agriculture and primary industries, to the same level that you support research and development continuing in the area of climate change.


What we are discussing here today is, basically, another broken promise by this government, made necessary by the total mismanagement of the budget. I am sure we would not see $100 million being taken out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency had we had the budget surpluses that we have been promised over the last five years by the 'world's greatest Treasurer'. But it is somewhat ironic, and tremendously interesting, that it is actually the Greens who have brought this matter of public importance before us today. As I said before, it was the Greens who sided with the government on many of the decisions that have caused this budget to tumble into the terrible state that it is in today.


There would not be too many people in Australia who, over the long term, would suggest that renewable energy is not a desirable outcome for Australia and for the world. But what we cannot support is putting businesses out of business in this morally pure policy of moving immediately to it. I support Senator Cameron's comments in the sense that, if we want to try to achieve a green and clean economy, we have to do it with our economy still intact and not destroy it on the way.


The Greens need to take some responsibility for the MPI they have raised today and for the $100 million being taken out of this budget line. They are the ones who have sat in this place and supported a number of programs put forward by the Labor Party that have been a complete and utter disaster for the Australian public and the Australian budget. Obviously, the carbon tax is an absolutely classic example of the impact that an ill-designed tax can have on an economy. The fact is that domestic emissions have increased since it was brought in, and everybody now admits that carbon emissions are going to increase under this carbon tax between now and 2020. So we have to accept that this is not working, for all the reasons that have been stated before.


We have to look at the Home Insulation Program; it was scrapped. What a disaster that turned out to be. In fact, four people lost their lives through the bungling of the Home Insulation Program; 224 houses were burnt, while 70,000 required repair. This cost Australia $2.2 billion. Imagine what we could have done with $2.2 billion if we had been able to apply it to programs that were going to be of genuine benefit to Australia. Some of it might even have gone towards the development of a sustainable and ongoing renewable energy program for this country.


There are many examples. The citizens assembly was scrapped before it even started. There was cash for clunkers, the Green Car Innovation Fund—the list of things that have been put in place by this government, supposedly to assist in the process of dealing with whatever implications climate change may have for this country and for the world, that have failed goes on and on. The list of things that the government has put in place have delivered absolutely no outcome and, in the process, have damaged our budget to such a significant extent that all Australians are today absolutely terrified of thinking about what is likely to happen tonight when we go to the budget.


I also draw to the attention of the house the number of—I would say 'funny' if they were not so serious—crazy things that have expended taxpayers money in relation to the government's promotion of the carbon tax. Back in the middle of last year, the Labor government spent $69.5 million advertising the carbon tax. When they had already committed to implementing the carbon tax, why on earth did they then have to spend nearly $70 million of taxpayers' money telling the electorate why they needed to have something they were going to get anyway? During Senate estimates last year, it was also revealed that the government spent $100,000 building fake kitchens for the television ads, when we know that, if you wanted to build an actual kitchen, you could probably put a really nice one in your house for about $15,000. Then there was the carbon cop—sorry, I should refer to it as Labor's Clean Energy Regulator. Because it had a bit of a bad image out there, the government spent $4.4 billion sprucing up its new offices.


These are the kinds of things that I think the Australian public are heartily sick of—when their cost of living is being attacked every single day and they realise that, in the name of the so-called carbon tax, which has been a complete debacle and has destroyed their way of life, we are spending money on stupid things, like $4.4 million to spruce up some offices.


Another classic example is that the government gave $93,000 to the ACTU so that it could teach its officials how to sell the carbon tax. Given that all of a sudden it was such a fundamental platform for the Labor government, one would have hoped that the officials understood what was so good about it. Then there was $600 million of Australia's foreign aid program spent on developing climate change leaders in the Pacific. Then, of course, there was the image makeover for the carbon cop, where we spent nearly half a million dollars on a public relations strategy so that they looked a bit better in the eyes of Australia. Julia Gillard had to admit that she had $660 worth of carbon tax payments in her Lodge bill, but I do not suppose she had to worry about that because of course the taxpayers of Australia pick up that tab.


Going back to the fact that it is the Greens who raised this matter of public importance, I note that $3 million worth of grants were paid to green groups so that they would support the 'say yes' campaign during the introduction of the carbon tax. To add insult to injury, the Auditor-General has revealed that key documents relating to $20 million in Energy Efficiency Information Grants have been destroyed. I wonder why they were destroyed! I will not pass any judgement on that, but I leave the house to ponder why anyone would need to destroy documentation relating to the allocation of grants. One can only hope that we get to the bottom of that.


But the main reason we have this MPI before us today, no matter who proposed it, is simply that our budget is in such a terrible, terrible state. Think about all the money we could have saved from these bungled programs, these useless things that we so did not need to have—all the silly money that has been spent by the government on trying to sell something just to make themselves look better. For example, they spent $2.2 billion on rectifying the pink batts situation. If they had spent that money on real programs that the Australian public wanted and needed, they would probably have had some money for the Gonski education reforms, they would not have had to put on a levy to pay for the NDIS and they might have been able to implement a dental scheme.


The thing that annoys me more than anything else is that we have spent all this money on those programs while people in rural and regional Australia are screaming out for infrastructure projects. They are screaming out for their roads to be upgraded. They are screaming out for access to services that people in the city take for granted. People in the country do not get the same level of connectivity for their communications. Businesses in the country do not get access to full amounts of power to be able to run their businesses. So it makes me very cross to see how much money has been wasted when there are so many worthy projects out there in the country.


Finally, I think the most important thing that we should be doing right now with the money is not worrying about all these little programs but relieving the cost of living for all Australians.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:10): I seek leave to speak to the Joint Select Committee on Cyber Safety—second interim report—Cybersafety for seniors: a worthwhile journey.


Leave granted.  




Senator BILYK:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


As Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety, I want to speak to the report of the committee's inquiry into cyber-safety and senior Australians. While the act of exploring the unknowns of the internet is one that many seniors are reluctant to take, it is the conclusion of this committee that it is a worthwhile journey for them to embark upon. The internet provides opportunities for all seniors, no matter their age. And, while the speed of the information technology revolution has meant that many older Australians have found themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide, seniors should not let concerns about cybercrime, or unfamiliarity with technology, stop them from learning the skills required to being active online.


With an increasing trend of business and government services being available online, we need to help every senior Australian become active online so that they can reap the benefits of the new technologies. While there are many seniors who are active online, who may have gained their skills working with computers, there are also a large number of seniors who did not and who fear for their cyber-safety. However, education is the means by which they can overcome that fear. 


Evidence was taken during the inquiry showing that education and training is the key to helping seniors move into the cyber-world with confidence and skill. The committee found across the nation that public libraries and various seniors organisations are doing excellent work teaching seniors about cyber-safety. Several seniors groups and representatives from the public libraries addressed the committee at public hearings, and I would like to thank them for their evidence. Some of these groups told the committee that they cannot meet existing demand from seniors for cyber-safety training due to lack of resources but with increased funding they could do more training.


The Australian Federal Police told the committee that cybercrime targets everyone, and even cyber-savvy people can become victims, so it is up to each individual to take the same degree of responsibility for their own actions when online as they do in everyday life. The AFP said that keeping seniors cyber-safe requires a multifaceted approach combining the right mix of law enforcement, policy, legislation, education and also some level of user vigilance.


The inquiry also found that access to the internet was a barrier for some seniors, particularly those who are housebound or who live on low incomes in remote places. Those living in metropolitan areas and larger regional centres who do not have an internet connection in their home can generally find free access to the internet in public libraries and various seniors clubs. The Broadband for Seniors kiosks are in community centres, retirement villages, libraries and senior citizens clubs across Australia. The committee has recommended that this worthwhile initiative could benefit from much wider publicity. The committee also found that when seniors experience cybercrime there is often confusion about how to report the crime, and therefore the committee recommended that a centralised user-friendly reporting and cyber-safety awareness portal should be developed with links to relevant regulators. The site should feature a dedicated seniors reporting tab, backed up by a telephone service which links individuals to appropriate victim support, training and other advice.


The committee is pleased to see that the government has recently launched a seniors helpline under its Broadband for Seniors initiative but believes that there would be merit in centralising reporting and support mechanisms for all cybercrime victims who need support or advice. The committee also recommended that cyber-awareness campaigns using clear and practical messages about cyber-safety could feature on the cyber-safety awareness portal. Another recommendation of the committee was to establish a consultative working group, with wide stakeholder representation to coordinate and promote government and industry partnerships and initiatives in support of a healthy and secure online environment. In total, the committee made 13 recommendations in its report and committee members believe that the adoption of the recommendations would greatly improve cyber-safety for seniors in Australia. 


I would like to express my thanks to my colleagues on the committee, from across all parties in both the Senate and the other place, and especially to the Deputy Chair from the other place, as well as to the secretariat for the enthusiasm and dedication they have shown to this inquiry. I am pleased that we were able to work together to produce a unanimous report involving this important situation. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

And, while the speed of the information technology revolution has meant that many older Australians have found themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide, seniors should not let concerns about cybercrime, or unfamiliarity with technology, stop them from learning the skills required to being active online.


With an increasing trend of business and government services being available online, we need to help every senior Australian become active online so that they can reap the benefits of the new technologies. While there are many seniors who are active online, who may have gained their skills working with computers, there are also a large number of seniors who did not and who fear for their cyber-safety. However, education is the means by which they can overcome that fear. 


Evidence was taken during the inquiry showing that education and training is the key to helping seniors move into the cyber-world with confidence and skill. The committee found across the nation that public libraries and various seniors organisations are doing excellent work teaching seniors about cyber-safety. Several seniors groups and representatives from the public libraries addressed the committee at public hearings, and I would like to thank them for their evidence. Some of these groups told the committee that they cannot meet existing demand from seniors for cyber-safety training due to lack of resources but with increased funding they could do more training.


The Australian Federal Police told the committee that cybercrime targets everyone, and even cyber-savvy people can become victims, so it is up to each individual to take the same degree of responsibility for their own actions when online as they do in everyday life. The AFP said that keeping seniors cyber-safe requires a multifaceted approach combining the right mix of law enforcement, policy, legislation, education and also some level of user vigilance.


The inquiry also found that access to the internet was a barrier for some seniors, particularly those who are housebound or who live on low incomes in remote places. Those living in metropolitan areas and larger regional centres who do not have an internet connection in their home can generally find free access to the internet in public libraries and various seniors clubs. The Broadband for Seniors kiosks are in community centres, retirement villages, libraries and senior citizens clubs across Australia. The committee has recommended that this worthwhile initiative could benefit from much wider publicity. The committee also found that when seniors experience cybercrime there is often confusion about how to report the crime, and therefore the committee recommended that a centralised user-friendly reporting and cyber-safety awareness portal should be developed with links to relevant regulators. The site should feature a dedicated seniors reporting tab, backed up by a telephone service which links individuals to appropriate victim support, training and other advice.


The committee is pleased to see that the government has recently launched a seniors helpline under its Broadband for Seniors initiative but believes that there would be merit in centralising reporting and support mechanisms for all cybercrime victims who need support or advice. The committee also recommended that cyber-awareness campaigns using clear and practical messages about cyber-safety could feature on the cyber-safety awareness portal. Another recommendation of the committee was to establish a consultative working group, with wide stakeholder representation to coordinate and promote government and industry partnerships and initiatives in support of a healthy and secure online environment. In total, the committee made 13 recommendations in its report and committee members believe that the adoption of the recommendations would greatly improve cyber-safety for seniors in Australia. 


I would like to express my thanks to my colleagues on the committee, from across all parties in both the Senate and the other place, and especially to the Deputy Chair from the other place, as well as to the secretariat for the enthusiasm and dedication they have shown to this inquiry. I am pleased that we were able to work together to produce a unanimous report involving this important situation. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:15):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Chief of Staff to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to the motion on National Close the Gap Day.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


To remind the chamber, this was a motion that the chamber passed on 21 March that recognised that National Close the Gap Day and in particular made a firm commitment to the Closing the Gap campaign statement of intent as the blueprint of action to close the health equality gap. That statement, I will remind people, was signed in 2008 and committed Australians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to work together to achieve equality in health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by the year 2030. That commitment also shared a determination to close the fundamental divide between the health outcomes and life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-Aboriginal people, which we know was around 17 years. In places around Australia that 17-year gap in life expectancy still exists, so we still have a long way to go. Unfortunately, the national partnership agreement on Indigenous health expires in about six weeks at the end of this financial year. We need to ensure that that is re-funded to ensure that these gaps in life expectancy and health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are closed by the year 2030.


Unfortunately, we are still seeing many gaps in the delivery of appropriate health services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I will go to a commitment that this government made a couple of years ago to work on dialysis. I have spoken in this place on the need to address end-stage kidney disease and the growing need for dialysis, particularly in Central Australia and the tri-state area between Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. I was over the moon when the government announced that they would commit $13 million to more accommodation and more support for dialysis in Central Australia. It seems to me in looking at the work that has been done on dialysis that it has been two steps forward and one step back. While we have had more chairs provided around Australia for dialysis, unfortunately when we looked at this in estimates we found that $3 million of that commitment of $13 million had already been returned unspent. So that money that was committed did not deliver the dialysis support, chairs and accommodation for those dialysis patients in Central Australia. There is a very real concern now hanging over the other $10 million and whether that is actually going to be delivered. That is what I mean about it sometimes being two steps forward and one step back. We need to be serious about addressing health outcomes, which is why we need a commitment from not only the Commonwealth but also state and territory governments.


We also heard in the past that there were agreements in the tri-state area between my home state of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory around how to deliver these services. We heard at estimates, that those agreements are falling apart. We have had two steps forward and one step back with them failing to reach an agreement about how those services will be delivered. So we will return to that farcical situation where Aboriginal people who are living in the north of Western Australia potentially will have to, for example, go to Perth and people in Central Australia and South Australia will have to go to Adelaide to receive services rather than the closer centre of, for example, Alice Springs. I was devastated when I was sitting in estimates and was told that the progress that had been made was stalling. I urge the government to address those really important issues.


One of the other issues that I have addressed strongly in this place is Aboriginal ear health and the issue around otitis media. Otitis media is in pandemic proportions in many Aboriginal communities. I have explained on many occasions the link between otitis media and poor hearing health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the need to address that. There is a need to identify that hearing loss and to provide early intervention programs that enable children to catch up on the language skills that are needed to enable them to engage in school and the education system. The links have been clearly shown between poor hearing health and the number of people, Aboriginal people in particular, in our justice system, both in our adult justice system and in our juvenile justice system. The links are clearly there.


Of course, you can then draw a link to the social determinants of health, which is why under these programs we also need to be clearly addressing the social determinants of health. The Senate Community Affairs References Committee earlier this year tabled our report into the social determinants of health and implementation of those in Australia and made a series of recommendations. I am greatly looking forward to the government's response to that report because, if we are going to address Aboriginal health and life expectancy outcomes, it is essential that we are also addressing the social determinants of health.


As I conclude—because I know there are other people who want to speak on a large number of responses of the government to the motions that went through the chamber before the break—I want to say that we are looking for the government to be making more announcements today in the budget about how they are going to fulfil the commitments they have made to close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in life expectancy and health outcomes. We know this is a long-term problem. We know we have to have sustained investment if we are going to achieve that objective by the year 2030. It is an objective that everybody shares. If we are going to do that, we need to make sure that we commit on an ongoing basis to these essential funding programs and not be funding them so that organisations are constantly wondering whether they are going to get re-funded. We also need to see that being delivered through the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan.


I am looking forward to at least a little bit of positive news in terms of being able to support these commitments, which have been made across the board. It can only be delivered if that funding is delivered to appropriate programs, which is largely through community-controlled health organisations.


I note that the response the chamber received from Minister Macklin's office said I needed to ask Warren Snowdon, as he is the Minister for Indigenous, Rural and Regional Health. I must admit I would have expected a bit better from Minister Macklin, given that she has ultimate responsibility for Indigenous affairs. I would have thought she would have been able to engage with this a bit more, particularly as it is essential that social determinants of health are addressed. It goes back to her portfolio. She cannot write it off by saying, 'This is actually the responsibility of the Minister for Indigenous, Rural and Regional Health,' when key parts of her portfolio are absolutely essentially to delivering Closing the Gap.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (17:43):  I seek leave to speak to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories' Report, An estate for the future.


Leave granted.




Senator PRATT:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I am delighted that this report has come before the Senate. An estate for the future is the report of the inquiry into the allocation of land to diplomatic missions here in the ACT. It was presented out of session on 28 March.


All of us who spend time here know this great city quite well and would be aware that there are a great many diplomatic missions here—in fact, over 80—reflecting the great cultural and economic links that we have with a great many different nations. Indeed, it is a key role of our capital to host the missions and to foster relationships with those nations. They are an important part of the fabric of our capital city. They are diverse and often attractive buildings that reflect both Canberra's history, in the history of those buildings and their architecture, the architectural traditions that have been employed through Canberra throughout its history—and it is interesting to note in that sense the anniversary that Canberra celebrates this year—and also the architectural traditions of many of the nations that occupy those buildings.


The management of this estate, if you like, brings with it some considerable challenges, unique ones, which are quite different to those of ordinary property development and property management. They include the need not only to manage the usual planning questions but to be sensitive to the national interests of the nations with a presence in our capital.


This inquiry came out of concern amongst residents of the Canberra community and within the committee over the way that land is allocated to diplomatic missions here in the ACT. People were concerned that the method currently used for allocating land to diplomatic missions lacked coherence and that, despite there being a long-term need for such land, there was no long-term strategy underpinning that land allocation. There was no obvious or meaningful coordination between the Commonwealth and ACT governments regarding that allocation of land for national use, despite the obvious need for such coordination, given the fundamental demand confronting the Commonwealth and the fundamental issue confronting the Commonwealth, which is a shortage of national land suitable to the diplomatic estate which the Commonwealth needs to take responsibility for managing.


These concerns were brought to prominence by a decision here in the ACT to reserve land adjacent to Stirling Ridge in Yarralumla for incorporation into the diplomatic estate. This decision was part of draft amendment 78 to the National Capital Plan, and it aroused some considerable community concern. Indeed, residents raised concerns about its impact on local open space and the local environment.


But, from the committee's point of view, what we found of key concern is that this allocation highlighted the essentially ad hoc process by which land is allocated as part of the diplomatic estate. The committee could not be assured—indeed, nor could residents. We could not be clear about whether this land had been chosen not because it is the most suitable but just because it appeared to be the most readily available. The committee was in agreement that this is not the best criterion for assessment.


In examining this issue, the committee undertook a couple of tasks. Firstly, we looked at the methodology for allocating land to diplomatic missions, looking at a number of factors influencing the decision making as it currently exists and the kinds of problems that arise. We explored the various alternatives for allocating land to diplomatic missions, including some examples from overseas, and were particularly impressed with the kind of planning that is employed in Washington DC. They have a much greater emphasis there on the integration of the diplomatic estate with the rest of the city. They also have far more substantial use of the free market in the allocation of land to diplomatic missions, whereas here in the ACT it is essentially a task that is undertaken by government, noting of course that government has an obligation under international treaties to facilitate access to diplomatic land. Government seems to have taken that very literally in therefore leaving the free market out of it, whereas I think our committee would contend that, yes, government has a special responsibility but that does not mean that the free market should not also have a role.


The result of our deliberations as a committee was that we took the view that the process of allocating land to diplomatic missions in the ACT does require an overhaul. It needs to be more flexible and responsive to the needs of our diplomatic community, local residents and the city. It needs to be updated to reflect the changing nature of Canberra as a modern and mature city facing the usual challenges of urban development, noting of course its significant and special role as our capital.


In looking at the evidence before the committee, we recommended that, in order to better utilise the limited land resources, the Australian government needs to strengthen policies and regulations surrounding diplomatic leases to ensure compliance with the conditions of those leases. Indeed, we recommended that land be resumed within 36 months where development has not yet commenced.


We also recommended complementary arrangements to those in place, including the use of medium- and high-density premises to house chanceries, the subdivision of existing leases and the use of residential land and commercial properties to house missions—noting, of course, that there is a security footprint which those missions currently occupy. The committee has also urged that in the future there should be a steady evolution, if you like, to a more commercial approach to looking at these issues, such as that which applies in Washington.


The committee has also recommended the development of a long-term strategy for the allocation of land to diplomatic missions in the ACT and that it should be developed in conjunction with DFAT, the AFP and the ACT government to integrate with ACT plans. We need to look at a policy for medium- and high-density properties, a mechanism for subdividing existing leases—noting, of course, that some countries are sitting on substantial economic assets when they do not necessarily want to maintain such large sites and that in these global economic times, where there is pressure on the local post, it might actually be a good thing for them to be able to release some equity from those properties and in turn make more space available to other countries that might like to establish a mission.


We need to look at a review of resources in O'Malley, Yarralumla and Deakin to ensure their optimal use for diplomatic purposes. We also recommended that, on that basis, given this need for a new approach, draft amendment 78 should be withdrawn. We are very pleased to note that the government has responded by saying it would withdraw draft amendment 78 as a stand-alone proposal and would be looking to some of the broader responses that need to be addressed. 


In closing, I want to thank all of those who contributed, not least of all my committee colleagues, including Senator Humphries, who I know has taken a very active interest in what is an issue of importance to the nation and to the capital as well as to our diplomatic community. We did receive terrific evidence from a range of sources, including Washington DC. I think the outcome of this inquiry, in the finest tradition of parliamentary committees, reflects a bipartisan approach to policymaking, to the benefit of all.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:54):  I present the 152nd report of the Committee of Privileges entitled Possible unauthorised disclosure of the draft report of the Select Committee on Electricity Prices.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate endorse the conclusion at paragraph 1.57 of the 152nd report of the Privileges Committee and adopt the recommendation that no contempt be found in respect of the matter referred.


The committee reports to the Senate in its inquiry into the possible unauthorised disclosure of the draft report of the Senate Select Committee on Electricity Prices. I note that the committee finalised this report during the March sittings but was unable to present it due to certain unusual proceedings on the last sitting day of the Senate. It is not the practice of the Privileges Committee to present reports on contempt matters out of sitting, so the report has been held over until today.


According to the former chair of the Senate Select Committee on Electricity Prices, the report of that committee was pre-empted by an article and video commentary published by a journalist online. This occurred at a late stage in the development of the report but prior to the select committee meeting to consider and adopt it. In his letter to the President raising the matter, the former chair stated, 'In the committee's view, the disclosure not only impeded its freedom to deliberate but reflected adversely on the value of the committee's inquiry.' 


The investigation of unauthorised disclosures is a subject which has attracted detailed consideration by the Privileges Committee, most recently in its 122nd report, which considered the principles that should apply. While any unauthorised disclosure may, in some circumstances, constitute a contempt of the Senate, it does not follow that every unauthorised disclosure warrants investigation. Parliamentary privilege is intended to protect the parliament's processes from obstruction and interference, and it is that principle—the necessity to protect the integrity of the work of the Senate and its committees—which guides the Senate in determining questions relating to contempt.


In relation to unauthorised disclosures, this determination is based on an assessment of the harm or interference they cause. Committees are required to undertake their own investigations into unauthorised disclosures to make an assessment about harm or interference and to consult the Privileges Committee before raising them as matters of privilege. They are guided in this process by a Senate resolution adopted on 17 December 2007. It was not possible in this case for the select committee to complete this process, as it ceased to exist upon presentation of its report. 


Having received the reference, the Privileges Committee determined that it would consider the matter in accordance with the principles embodied in the 2007 resolution. Although the select committee considered that the disclosure amounted to a serious breach of its confidences, the Privileges Committee has concluded that the unauthorised disclosure did not substantially interfere with the Senate select committee's work in the terms of the 2007 resolution and accordingly does not warrant further investigation. This conclusion was drawn on the basis of correspondence with members of the select committee, and that correspondence is published with the report.


The Privileges Committee has also concluded that it is not a matter on which it would have recommended further action had it been in a position to consult with the select committee. On reaching that conclusion, the committee has applied the principles set out in its 122nd report. The cases revealed a gap in relevant procedure, in that the 2007 resolution is not available as a remedy where a committee has ceased to exist. In similar circumstances in the future it might be appropriate for such a committee to seek from the Senate a brief extension of time for the limited purpose of complying with that resolution.


The committee is unable to conclude on the evidence before it that a contempt of the Senate has been committed. The effect of the motion I have moved is for the Senate to endorse that conclusion and to adopt the committee's recommendation that a contempt not be found.


If no other senator wishes to speak at this time on the matter, I shall seek leave to continue my remarks later in order to preserve the matter for future debate.

The SMSF supervisory levy is a cost recovery levy designed to cover the costs of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) regulating the sector.  However, the current levy does not fully recover the ATO’s cost of supervising this rapidly growing and diverse sector.


This Bill will ensure the levy is collected from SMSFs in a more timely way, and will increase the levy to ensure the Taxation Office's costs of regulating the SMSF sector are fully recovered.


To this end, the Bill increases the maximum levy payable by a self managed fund for a year of income from $200 to $300.  However, the actual levy payable from the 2013-14 income year will be $259 and this amount will be prescribed in the Regulations.


This Bill also allows for the change in timing of collection of the SMSF levy so that it is levied and paid in the same financial year, rather than the following financial year.  The change will ensure consistency with super funds regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which pay the superannuation supervisory levy in the same financial year it’s levied.  The Government considers that this is appropriate for a cost recovery levy.


It should be noted that the lodgement of returns will continue as normal, and the timing of the collection of the levy will be phased in over two years, to give the sector time to adjust.


Accordingly, in 2013-14, SMSFs will pay the $191 levy for the 2012-13 income year, and half the $259 levy for the 2013-14 income year (that is, a total of $321, rounding up).


Then in 2014-15, they will pay the other half of the $259 levy for the 2013-14 income year, and the $259 levy for the 2014-15 income year (or a total of $388, rounding down).


And from 2015-16, funds will pay the $259 levy in the relevant income year.  Just to clarify, the amount of the levy payable for a year of income will not exceed the cap, as the total amount payable for 2013-14 and 2014-15 each represents the levy for one and a half years, while the levy for the particular income year will be below the cap. 


In addition, I can assure the ATO is working to minimise any compliance costs associated with these measures. 


I note that the SMSF levy is intended to help offset the costs of implementing the Government’s SMSF Stronger Super reforms, which aim to improve the operation, efficiency and integrity of the SMSF sector.


This Bill will enhance the ATO’s ability to deliver these important reforms and continue to effectively regulate the self-managed super fund sector. 


Finally, as I mentioned before, SMSFs are a rapidly growing and diverse sector.  For example, between 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2012, the number of SMSFs increased from almost 376,000 to over 478,000, representing growth of over 27 per cent.


Let’s be clear – the Government strongly supports self-managed superannuation funds.  At their core, these reforms are about improving the integrity of the SMSF sector, and providing for better regulation, and ultimately better protection, for fund members.


Full details of the amendments in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:04):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I commend the report to the chamber. I thank all who have been involved in the preparation of the report, appeared as witnesses and put in submissions. I particularly applaud the secretariat for the excellent job they have undertaken in the preparation of this report. There were 59 submissions to the inquiry, and there are 23 recommendations which emanate from the report.


The report is based around six pillars. The first relates to disadvantaged students. The second is parental involvement and the essence of parental involvement in the education of the child—along, of course, with the involvement of the school and the teachers. The third is a movement towards autonomy in the administration and management of schools. The fourth relates to student behaviour. The fifth is ensuring that we select quality applicants as student teachers and have the highest quality of education for student teachers. The sixth is professional learning for teachers in their classrooms. I will now speak briefly to these six pillars.


Australia stands very highly against international education standards. But we are not improving, despite expenditure of funds. It is recognised that there are four large groups of disadvantaged students—those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, those with disability, Indigenous students and students living in rural and remote areas. But the committee rejects the thinking that students from these four disadvantaged backgrounds need to be condemned to poor educational outcomes because of their demographic or whatever background. Recommendations point to areas in which, this committee believes, the disadvantage faced by students from these backgrounds can be addressed and overcome. It should not be the case that students from such backgrounds are condemned to not being able to perform to the best of their ability in the Australian education system.


The second pillar is parental involvement. It came through as evidence to the committee that chief among the influences on student achievement are parental engagement, parental as well as teacher expectations, effective behaviour management and teacher quality But of all of those it is critical that parents believe that their child will do their best at school, that they will experience success and that they will move into employment or a trade or a university qualification. I would urge those interested in this area to examine the evidence of the witnesses that speaks to those points. Education is a team effort. It is the parents and, by association, grandparents and others in the family; it is the school, its management and its teachers; it is the environment; and, at the end of the day, we also recognise that there is a role for governments—be they state or territory, which actually deliver education, or the Catholic or independent school systems and the federal government, which is involved in funding.


I will be brief because I know that others wish to speak. The committee was impressed by the argument from many of the submitters and witnesses that school autonomy, the role of the principal guided by a board, is the best model, where it is appropriate. They should be well trained, well skilled and well supported to be able to identify where the local needs are for students in that community. As I look at research into Finland, which is always placed before us as a country of excellence in education, what impresses is in fact the local decision making that takes place in the Finnish education system. There are recommendations in the report pointing to this.


I come to the question of student behaviour and very compelling evidence by a witness, who said:


[W]ell-behaved children learn a great deal better and a great deal more than poorly behaved children. 


If there is one point to come out of this report over some of the 30 reports over 30 years into education in Australia, it is recognition that the teachers should be allowed to get on with the job of teaching in their schools and not be in the role of babysitters or disciplinarians. As one witness said to us: 


If I have had to deal with a classroom bully, by the time I deal with that child, get them out of the room, when I go back into that room, I may have 25 or 26 scared children who are in no position to learn.


Again I am proud to say that the committee has made recommendations pertaining to behaviour. Again if I can draw the Finnish analogy, only last August did its minister for education introduce legislation into the parliament to allow exactly that—greater authority and greater stimulus for teachers to be able to teach in the classroom.


The fifth of those pillars is quality teaching students going into courses in Australia. We should select those who are most appropriate to teaching. The committee was impressed by evidence that there are definitely criteria for those applying to go into teaching and we can identify those who are most likely, both academically and in having an aptitude, to be the best teachers. There is no doubt at all that we have far too many people in teacher training in this country—100,000 bodies, representing some 66,000 full-time equivalents. The other interesting evidence that came before the committee was that, prior to their making a decision to go into that career, prospective students should be informed of which disciplines are in demand and which are not. We had evidence that in some schools only one or two teachers are qualified to teach mathematics or science in a secondary school, but eight or nine may have qualifications in the arts or in physical education and sport. We think it is essential that those matters are addressed. 


The last of those six pillars I spoke of was the need for the ongoing professional learning and support of classroom teachers throughout their teaching careers. If teachers are being asked to teach out of field and if it is the case that the best teachers are those who are across their subject, then surely we must give professional learning to those who are being asked to teach out of field. The enormous benefit both to newer teachers and to more experienced teachers is having the opportunity to have someone observe them in the classroom, be they a mentor or be they a mentee. A lot came out of this inquiry, and the secretariat was good enough to provide in an appendix the recommendations of many of those 30 inquiries of the last 30 years. I am very pleased to say that by consensus this committee has come up with recommendations that are not over the top in terms of cost to the Australian taxpayer but that are designed to enhance teaching and learning in Australian schools. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:12):  I rise to speak on the tabling of this report of the Senate References Committee for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Teaching and learning—maximising our investment in Australian schools. I participated in this inquiry as the Australian Greens spokesperson for schools and education, and I would like to acknowledge the high quality of submissions received and the time given up by witnesses to the inquiry. I must acknowledge that there have been an inordinate number of inquiries into education and schools over the last three decades, but it is a matter of enduring importance and concern to the Australian community. Nevertheless, there is still always work to be done and consideration to be given to emerging issues. 


I would like to thank those who took the time to contribute their knowledge, their experience, their wisdom and, indeed, their passion. One thing about the education area is that most people have an opinion and many people have passions about Australia doing the best it possibly can in this area. We heard from educators, primary and secondary teachers, some of whom were relatively recently admitted to the profession and others of whom were retired and looked back on a lifetime of experience. We heard from principals, teacher educators and other academics, non-government organisations and interested citizens. They all reflected the fact that education is so important to us as a society.


The recommendations of the report reflect the constitutional reality that states and territories are primarily responsible for education. But we also know that the Commonwealth government has become increasingly involved and has assumed an increasingly important role both in education policy development and in funding. There is certainly a role for Commonwealth leadership in collaboration with the states and territories. 


It is a comprehensive report, so I will highlight just three themes which were of particular interest to me. But I encourage those who are interested to read the full report. The first theme of particular interest to me is covered in the chapter on Australia's performance, and it is the issue of testing—how we actually ascertain what Australia's performance is. There was a great deal of discussion about issues relating to what is currently quite a topical subject: NAPLAN testing, or the National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy. This subject evoked strong views from witnesses and from people and organisations making submissions to the committee, both from those in favour of the current NAPLAN program and how it is being administered and from those against. Certainly many in the latter group, including many retired teachers and principals, expressed serious concerns, including that NAPLAN is causing more competition among students and among schools, to the detriment of some students and to the detriment of teaching and the curriculum. I suggest that people look at the submissions and the way the report has covered this subject, but I believe that there is sufficient evidence of ongoing disagreement in this area to suggest that it warrants further inquiry. We really need to look at the evidence for the efficacy of NAPLAN testing and whether it is achieving its objectives. 


The second theme is the relevance of various factors in student performance and achievement, particularly the role of socioeconomic background in influencing educational outcomes in Australia. It is not the only important factor influencing outcomes for Australia students, but there is no denying that it is an important factor. This has been recognised by PISA. In their tests, they compare like countries in the OECD. Paragraph 3.42 of the report says:


PISA measures socioeconomic background by taking into account economic, social and cultural status. Across the three tests, the mean score for students from the highest socioeconomic quartile was much higher than the other three quartiles—indeed the schooling gap was between 1 and 3 years.


Basically, this gap was referable to the socioeconomic band in which those students were located. That was true for both literacy and numeracy. 


The Smith Family is a notable Australian non-government organisation particularly devoted to assisting students of disadvantaged backgrounds in their education. It noted the importance of socioeconomic background and the fact that inequalities need to be addressed to ensure that all children can achieve their full potential, irrespective of their background. Paragraph 3.47 of the report refers to the Smith Family's submission and points out that, if we do not address this disparity in achievement levels arising out of socioeconomic background, there will be consequences for the whole nation as well as for individual students. It is not only inherently terribly unfair but also squanders the potential of those students—making us all worse off in the long run. The Smith Family stated:


The individual and collective impact of not addressing this situation is significant. Young people with poor educational outcomes are more likely to experience unemployment and poorer health outcomes, and rely more heavily on income support payments. This creates additional economic and social costs for individuals and the community as a whole.


The third theme I wanted to highlight is training support for teachers and their retention and development. It is obvious just how pivotal teachers are in our education system and in educational outcomes. There were some very interesting insights gained from the witnesses to the inquiry, and the recommendations reflect this. Particularly highlighted was the importance of mentoring for teachers, not only for new teachers and preservice teachers—although clearly it is particularly important for them as they find their way in this profession, one most of them have chosen with passion—but even for more experienced teachers. They too can gain from mentoring, support, collaboration and sufficient time to reflect and plan lessons. This is reflected in recommendation 19 of the report.


Having heard the evidence put before the inquiry, a particular issue of concern to me is the incidence of casualisation in the teaching workforce. Even in the case of very experienced teachers, there was evidence that this leads to insecurity. They lurch from contract to contract. There are obviously economic consequences for them, but as well as that it impedes a sense of security and continuity—really being able to commit to long-term development of the school knowing that they will be able to stay on there. It is unsettling, it undermines their confidence and it often means that professional development opportunities are not as available to contract teachers as they are to permanent teachers. There was anecdotal evidence put before the inquiry, but in my own visits to schools throughout Australia there was a constant refrain. I heard about this issue not only from those teachers being employed on contract but from their peers and from principals. Principals would often say things like: 'This teacher is wonderful, remarkable. We absolutely want to hang onto this person, but there is no guarantee from year to year that we will be able to.' It is quite corrosive of confidence and security. My view is that we lose highly qualified and high-quality teachers from the system because, ultimately, they feel undervalued and leave. 


We know there is attrition in the teaching profession. Recommendation 18 of the report is for further research to be undertaken into why teachers are leaving the profession. Although it does not specifically refer to casualisation, I would be very surprised if the research did not identify it as an important factor behind teachers, ultimately, voting with their feet. 


To conclude, I thank all who made submissions and attended hearings. I also thank the hardworking and enthusiastic secretariat. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:21):  I rise to speak on the tabling of the report of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee entitled Teaching and Learning (maximising our investment in Australian schools). I take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat, who have worked incredibly hard over a long period to bring something fresh to the public debate about teaching and learning in this country. Even this month, after 30 reports, we are still having fresh things to say, and that says something quite fantastic about our nation—that we all, on both sides of the parliament, see education providing great opportunity for all young Australians and, if we take the principles of lifelong learning into account, for all Australians no matter their age. This report does offer fresh insights despite, sometimes, the muddled and congested public conversation that occurs about education.


I would like particularly to put on the record my thanks to the chair of the committee, Senator Chris Back. He has championed this report and he has championed the terms of reference and the work we have done. This inquiry came about when the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee had the opportunity to investigate the Chinese education system last year, particularly in light of the PISA results for Shanghai. We had discussions across party lines on education systems and what measures of success were needed, and indeed the different practices in classrooms, and those issues were highlighted for us as we looked at the Chinese education system not just in primary schools but right through to teacher training, polytechnics and universities. That had a big impact on us and the way we came back to start this inquiry.


As a National senator I obviously have particular concern for the one million students being educated in regional Australia—660,000 of whom attend state schools. I have a strong interest in a productive, well-funded, vibrant and quality state school education system right through our nation. I am rapt that our recommendations reflect that we do live in a federated nation and we are not expecting the Commonwealth to intercede and to override states but rather to work hand in hand with state education ministers to address our concerns.


I probably come to this place as a statistic in the research that we hope will be conducted into teacher retention. I no longer teach. I was a teacher and a very passionate mathematics teacher at that, in rural areas, and I hope that my number will not be counted. I have a lot more to say about this but in light of this evening's proceedings I will leave any further comments to a later date.

I take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat, who have worked incredibly hard over a long period to bring something fresh to the public debate about teaching and learning in this country. Even this month, after 30 reports, we are still having fresh things to say, and that says something quite fantastic about our nation—that we all, on both sides of the parliament, see education providing great opportunity for all young Australians and, if we take the principles of lifelong learning into account, for all Australians no matter their age. This report does offer fresh insights despite, sometimes, the muddled and congested public conversation that occurs about education.


I would like particularly to put on the record my thanks to the chair of the committee, Senator Chris Back. He has championed this report and he has championed the terms of reference and the work we have done. This inquiry came about when the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee had the opportunity to investigate the Chinese education system last year, particularly in light of the PISA results for Shanghai. We had discussions across party lines on education systems and what measures of success were needed, and indeed the different practices in classrooms, and those issues were highlighted for us as we looked at the Chinese education system not just in primary schools but right through to teacher training, polytechnics and universities. That had a big impact on us and the way we came back to start this inquiry.


As a National senator I obviously have particular concern for the one million students being educated in regional Australia—660,000 of whom attend state schools. I have a strong interest in a productive, well-funded, vibrant and quality state school education system right through our nation. I am rapt that our recommendations reflect that we do live in a federated nation and we are not expecting the Commonwealth to intercede and to override states but rather to work hand in hand with state education ministers to address our concerns.


I probably come to this place as a statistic in the research that we hope will be conducted into teacher retention. I no longer teach. I was a teacher and a very passionate mathematics teacher at that, in rural areas, and I hope that my number will not be counted. I have a lot more to say about this but in light of this evening's proceedings I will leave any further comments to a later date.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (20:02):  For many Australians, there is no place like home. Our homes provide us with security, relaxation and personal comfort. For some Australian women however home is a place of pain, humiliation and, in the worst of circumstances, death. Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem in Australia. Seventy-six women on average are killed each year by either a current or a former partner. The economic cost to the country is estimated at around $13 billion a year. But there is a much greater loss to our society, in particular the devastating physical and emotional cost to individuals, families and communities.


There is no doubt that acts of domestic violence can leave women with their lives ruined and destroyed. But there is something governments can do. The 2009 Canadian Conference on the Prevention of Domestic Homicide referred to domestic violence deaths as the most predictable unpreventable homicides. Each domestic violence death is preventable because they are the result of extremely predictable patterns of escalated behaviour within a relationship. The victims are often women who are known to police, courts and community groups. These women and their children have often passed through healthcare providers and women's shelters, have called our police and have been assessed by our social services. In many circumstances these victims reached out for help. Their deaths are not unpredictable nor are they unforeseeable. This is why we must act.


A significant and crucial insight can be gained by reviewing the surrounding circumstances of a domestic violence death. Review processes allow us to develop informed and effective prevention strategies and identify gaps in existing systems. Risk factors include prior physical abuse, repeated separations, access to firearms, stalking, choking or strangulation, frequency of violence as well as threats of violence. 


Many states and territories have already introduced domestic violence death reviews, which allow for systemic and systematic forensic analysis of domestic violence deaths. At present, our state of Tasmania lacks such a system. This means that domestic violence related deaths are treated in the same manner as any other homicide through the coronial division of the Magistrates Court. Unfortunately, these inquests fall short because they are merely an inquiry to determine the victim's identity, the date and place of death and the manner in which the death occurred. In contrast, domestic violence death reviews take an in-depth look at the incident which led to the death. They also identify common patterns and trends among multiple domestic violence deaths. These reviews can also receive unrestricted input from community groups, women's shelters, government agencies, medical specialists and other family members who can shed light on the circumstances of the relationship and the experiences of the victim.


Last year I had the pleasure of meeting with University of South Australia senior lecturer Elspeth McInnes, representing the National Domestic Violence Death Review Advocacy Group at the unveiling of the National Remembrance Quilt. Elspeth had travelled to Canberra to represent the group WEAVE—Women Everywhere Against Violence Everywhere—in the hope of encouraging each state in Australia to establish a domestic violence death review process. Elspeth kindly agreed to travel to Launceston in December to facilitate a round table discussion on the issue. 


This initial forum included stakeholders from Tasmanian agencies and groups, including the police, the Magistrates Court and the Commissioner for Children. Women's shelters and support groups and services such as the women's legal service, the Yemaya Women's Support Service and the Hobart Women's Health Centre also took part. On the government's side were representatives from the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, along with representatives from the office of the Hon. Julie Collins MP, the federal Minister for the Status of Women. 



The Tasmanian forum was a success and my office remains in regular contact with the attendees to monitor the progress of the issue. A death review process ensures that a broader perspective can be gained by assessing both the culture and the context of domestic violence deaths. This can reduce the incidence of domestic violence deaths by informing improvements to our systems and services. For far too many victims, domestic violence is deadly. We should never accept that these deaths are inevitable or unpredictable. As representatives in this place, we must commit to supporting policy which gives both— (Time expired.)
