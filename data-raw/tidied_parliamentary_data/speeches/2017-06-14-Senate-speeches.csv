Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:32):  I table three supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill and seek leave to move government amendments (1), (2) and (4) on sheet ZA429 together.


Leave granted. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  The government opposes schedule 1 in the following terms:


(1)     Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (lines 23 and 24), to be opposed.


(2)     Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (lines 7 and 8), to be opposed.


(4)     Schedule 1, item 11, page 6 (line 28) to page 7 (line 11), to be opposed.


I thank the members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and, in particular, the chairman of the committee, the distinguished father of the Senate, Senator Macdonald, for their work in reviewing the bill. The committee's majority report contained two recommendations, the key recommendation being that the bill be passed. This reflects the significant uncertainty that the native title sector was faced with following the decision in McGlade, something I mentioned in closing the second reading debate last night. The government was urged by Indigenous and non-Indigenous stakeholders alike to address the ambiguous situation faced by the parties to an estimated 126 ILUAs following that decision. 


The committee's other recommendation is for the removal of two separate measures from the bill at this time, with the recommendation that they be considered in a later bill, involving government proposals arising from the 2015 Australian Law Reform Commission report Connection to country: review of the Native Title Act. The committee recommended that the proposed amendments to sections 251A and 251B of the act be removed. Those amendments, items 4 and 6 of schedule 1, would have permitted claim groups to authorise an ILUA and to make applications for compensation or the determination of native title by a traditional process or a method agreed upon by the group. These changes implemented recommendations 10-1 and 10-2 of the ALRC report. The Senate committee has taken the view that the amendments require further consultation and are not strictly necessary to respond to the McGlade decision. Given that the purpose of this bill, as I indicated last night, was merely to respond to the McGlade decision, their presence in the bill might be regarded as supererogatory. The government accepts this point of view and proposes to remove these measures from the bill and consider the issues again at a later point, along with other important recommendations made by the 2015 Law Reform Commission report.


The committee also recommended the removal of item 11 of the bill for later consideration. This item would have allowed for the validation of applications to register ILUAs and was intended to address any unforeseen consequences of McGlade. The committee formed the view that the impact of the provision was not clear. The government considers that the provision can be removed without affecting the integrity of the bill. 


I also note that the committee expressed concerns about the onerous administrative burden placed on the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council and the Noongar people by having to proceed through the registration process once again. The committee, however, did not see this as an impediment to recommending that the Senate pass the bill, and I note the government's commitment to considering this in the future.


One further matter raised by the committee which I wish to comment on is the status of what are known as section 31 agreements under the Native Title Act following the McGlade decision. Section 31 agreements are another way that agreements can be made under the act through the right-to-negotiate procedure. While the McGlade decision did not involve these types of agreements, stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that these agreements could be challenged. However, as agreements made under the right-to-negotiate procedure have different requirements to ILUAs, the government will consider these matters further and will consider the ramifications of McGlade on the right-to-negotiate procedure more closely with stakeholders before making amendments to the law.


Just to be clear, with these government amendments there is nothing in this bill at all that does anything beyond legislatively reverse the effect of the McGlade decision and reinstate the status quo ante of the law as settled by the Bygraves case.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (09:37):  I wish to speak to the amendments moved by the minister but also to the other amendments that I know the government is intending to move—that is, those amendments on sheet ZA431 as well as those on sheet ZA429. Labor has been a long-time supporter of native title and the Indigenous land rights movement, and has worked for many decades to protect and strengthen these rights for Indigenous people around Australia. After the High Court decision, the 25th anniversary of which we celebrated around the nation last week, it was Labor that introduced and legislated the Native Title Act in 1993. That act, while achieving a balance of certainty for existing landholders, established a process for a legal system for native title claimants to achieve recognition and ownership of their ancestral lands. It is our strong belief that this amendment act and the developments of future legislative amendments that affect the act need to be carried out in a consultative and respectful way. Indigenous people need to provide their free, prior and informed consent on things that affect their interests, most especially on the issue of native title. 


I want to reiterate that, for Labor, the amendments to the Native Title Act in this bill have always been about land rights, not mining rights. I wish that that were the case for the government, many of the senior members of which have made it clear that, for them, the bill is about the Adani Carmichael coalmine. The Prime Minister's statement and last year's closing the gap speech that did seek to do things with Indigenous people, not to them, reflects these same principles.


I was very disappointed to read the comments of the Prime Minister while he was in India, in April, where he said to the head of the Adani corporation that the native title laws that stood in the way of the mine would be fixed. In relation to specific amendments, Labor acknowledges that the decision of the full court of McGlade has created a great deal of uncertainty, both for native title holders and for other land users around Australia.


We have been informed by the government that some 125 Indigenous land-use area agreements that have been negotiated and agreed with native title holders and their respective representatives are now subject to uncertainty and potential renegotiation. So let me make it clear again: there are some 125 ILUAs that this bill will validate and we accept that this is a just outcome for the communities that made those agreements under the law as it then was and to those with whom they made those agreements. But it is not my understanding that this bill will provide some kind of green light for the Adani mine as some media reports seem to suggest. To the contrary. 


I understand that the Wangan and Jagalingou people—the traditional owners of much of the land on which the mine and its facilities are proposed to be built—have several legal actions afoot against Adani. Most of this litigation will be entirely unaffected by the passage of this bill. In particular, there are very serious allegations of fraud that have been made against Adani regarding the processes under which agreements with the Wangan and Jagalingou people were purportedly reached. And those proceedings, which may impact on the validity of any ILUA, will only commence hearings in March next year. 


Other legal action is always underway, including a case challenging the validity of the licences issued by the Queensland government. Be that as it may, since the decision in McGlade we have sought to work constructively with the government to agree upon a position that balances the need for a reasonable and timely resolution of the matters with the need to properly consult with Indigenous people, native title holders and their representatives. That is why we insisted that the legislation be the subject of a proper Senate inquiry prior to its passage through the parliament. A very short time was agreed upon by the government for submissions—only one day of hearings was allowed. 


Despite those constraints, in the process of the Senate inquiry a number of very significant issues arose with the bill. First, despite the assertion in the explanatory memorandum that the legislation 'amends the Native Title Act 1993 to resolve the uncertainty created by the full Federal Court decision in McGlade' in fact, the draft bill contained provisions that went well beyond that objective. Those included but were not limited to amendments that had been first proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Connection to country. Second, it became clear to us that little or no consultation had occurred with Indigenous people prior to the introduction of the legislation. 


Considering the significance of these changes, we considered this as a breach of the concept of free, prior and informed consent. Through the Senate committee process, Labor senators secured important amendments to the legislation which removed those provisions that went beyond the stated purpose of the bill. That inquiry recommended:


… subject to paragraph 2.75, that proposed amendments to sections 251A and 251B of the Native Title Act 1993 be removed from the current bill and dealt with in any later bill involving government proposals arising from the Australian Law Reform Commission report …


Following the Senate inquiry tabled on Monday, 20 March 2017 the government undertook to draft amendments to give effect to this agreed position. More than a week later, on Tuesday, 28 March 2017, the government tabled amendments and sought to have the legislation debated prior to the April recess. Unfortunately, in subsequent briefings from the Attorney-General's Department, it quickly became clear that these amendments were again defective in a number of respects: (a) they contained provisions which went beyond the original intentions of the bill and the agreed position of the Senate inquiry; and (b) not one single person outside the government, Indigenous or otherwise, had been consulted in their preparation. Labor considered this to be such a breach of the good-faith agreement reached through the Senate committee process and a clear breach of the concept, again, of free prior and informed consent.


It was necessary for the government to urgently convene, for the purposes of consultation, a meeting of the major native title representative bodies under the umbrella of the Native Title Council. Labor supported these consultations, although they were brief and some of the amendments were still unclear. I note that Senator Brandis had been selectively generous in his recognition of my role in encouraging this point of consultation and I thank him for that. However, he is completely wrong in saying that I have been alone in supporting a balanced and principled position on this issue. My Senate and House colleagues have been of one mind and one focus in working through the issue, and I thank them for that. 


At the Melbourne consultation arranged by the government, we noted that a further amendment was proposed to address concerns raised by representatives of the Cape York Land Council over the longstanding ILUA that underpins the Weipa agreement, the Western Cape Communities Coexistence Agreement. Even after that point, the government sought to rush through passage in the last sittings, which was a simple stunt on the pretence that the sky was about fall in and it was only the Attorney-General who was going to be able to hold the sky up.


Labor seeks to work constructively and productively with the government but this process has been challenging, leading to the sentiment expressed in Senator McCarthy's amendment in the second reading speech moved and agreed to yesterday. We seek to ensure that the land use agreement system is sufficiently stable and sound after the judicial decision in McGlade that created a high degree of uncertainty, not only for those agreements before McGlade but for the security and clarity of agreement making going forward. Agreement making is important to Labor and we support the need for some sense of confidence for those native title holders who have negotiated access and use agreements across the country. Having removed many of the problematic elements of the draft bill, and having now engaged in consultations, at least with those native title representative bodies and those who made submissions to the Senate committee, Labor can now support the amendments.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:48):  I have a few comments to make, but I should also let the chamber know I have a series of questions to the Attorney-General through you, Chair, that I will be seeking some clarification on. First off, I very quickly wanted to address some of the comments that Senator Brandis made last night and, in fact, Senator Dobson just touched on then, in terms of the consultation process and how the message Senator Brandis was intending to deliver yesterday was that everybody should be on board now because they have held another meeting and there is consensus now to these amendments! There is not consensus to these amendments. Yes, the bill is a relatively short bill, but it deals with complex issues. It does not mean just because a bill is short that it does not still involve complex issues.


There is not consensus, because last night we had people in the gallery who were clearly not on board with supporting these amendments. Just last night I had an email from a member of the Noongar community in Perth, Western Australia, who clearly was representing a number of people who do not support these changes. So there is not consensus. There was one more meeting that the Attorney-General convened and invited people from the representative bodies to. I acknowledge that that was extra, and that is a good thing, but you cannot claim that you have consensus because you convened that particular meeting.


We were getting, and we are still getting, a lot of messages from people saying, 'Don't support these amendments.' These are people that recognise that we need to be addressing this issue, and I and the Greens have acknowledged that in our contributions. We need to be addressing these issues. We are deeply concerned that these amendments are being rushed through because of Adani. These issues have been on the books for some time, and all of a sudden the government decide that they are going to deal with it now.


I will indicate that, although we cannot support the bill because we are still concerned about these amendments, we will be supporting this particular set of amendments because they deal with part of the concerns that were expressed during the Senate inquiry and that the Greens had identified. The amendments do pull back a little bit on the changes being made around the decision-making process. On schedule 11, I am also pleased to see that the ALP did in fact pick up on the issues that I raised through the Senate inquiry. So I can indicate that we will be supporting the amendments on this sheet, ZA429, even if that means we have to vote in the negative, because the question we will be asked to vote on is whether we should support the bill as printed.


However, what I would like to do now is to go to some of the questions that I have. I have some general questions, and I also have some specific questions around the second set of government amendments, which are on sheet ZA431. I ask this through you, Chair, to the Attorney-General: I do not know if you want to deal with them all at once or if you would rather do it when we deal with that amendment.




Senator Brandis:
  We will deal with them together.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Thank you. I have some overarching questions first, in that case. Could I ask now: do we have a definitive list of the agreements that are affected by the McGlade decision? We have never been able to get a clarified number.

As you know, the way in which this system works is that ILUAs are registered, so one can rely upon the state of the register for accurate guidance. That is, as I am advised, the number that are registered, and all that are capable of registration should have been registered. So that is the best information that we can provide from the state of the register.

Does that mean that they were already in the mix but the issues around those specific agreements—and I will come to the numbers when we discuss that amendment—were already there? They are not additional agreements that were subsequently identified as having issues?

Those are the matters that are on the public record. None of the matters about which your colleague Senator Waters has just asked are matters of public record, so why you would be asking me about that, I do not know. The record speaks for itself, and a modest amount of research by you or your colleagues could have established what is on the record. Nevertheless, in relation to those that have not been registered yet, I have read the details of them onto the record, and I am happy to provide you with the list from which I read.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:03):  Thank you. This pertains to the bill, and in fact, amendments that the Greens are going to be moving, which is why I am asking about this. The list you just read out—I am sorry if I am being obtuse here—does not include the south-west amendments from what I could tell and yet, in your previous answer, you said the list did include those, so I am seeking clarification about that list.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:04):  Senator, those ILUAs that you refer to, I am advised, are not on the list because they are no longer pending, because the effect of the McGlade decision was to knock them out.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:04):  That is what I was seeking some clarification about. I got confused when you said they were on the list. I am not trying to be tricky here; I am just trying to get some clarification, because the list of the eight then changes. They are completely different to the ILUAs that would previously have been on the list.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:05):  We are talking about three different things now. There are the ILUAs that are registered—that is the 126. There are the eight ILUAs that are pending, and those are on the list that I am providing to you and just read onto the record. Then there were some other ILUAs, including those to which you have referred, which had been pending registration but, as a consequence of the McGlade decision, were no longer capable of registration, as it were—and the purpose of this bill, as you know, is to reverse legislatively the effect of the McGlade decision.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:05):  Thank you for that clarification—it is much clearer. I want to go back to the 126 ILUAs and get an understanding of the answer that you gave. During the Senate inquiry hearing, we were told very clearly that the 126 was a bit of a rubbery number and you could not tell us what the agreements were because there was not a clear understanding of which agreements had the majority sign-on and which actually had all the named applicants on them. Am I to understand from the answer you just gave that we are now clear about that? Why weren't you and the department able to tell us during the Senate inquiry what the list of 126 was when we asked? We definitely were not told during the Senate inquiry.

That is being provided to you by the attendant as we speak. I am not in a position to inform you of that much detail. I was not, as you would know, at the Senate committee hearing. My officers, no doubt, were very forthcoming about the information they had. The figure of 126 is the figure that has been arrived at by inspection of the register.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:07):  My question referred to the 126—I am sorry if I was not clear. Why could you not have told us that in the inquiry when there were specific questions around the number of agreements? We were clearly told that we could not know all of them and that there was some question mark over the numbers and what was on the list because you had not been through them.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:10):  Yes. If I had not pursued this line of questioning, one would take from your first answer of 'Look, it's on the register' that one could easily go to the register and find these agreements. You cannot unless there is a separate list. So my question is: is there a separate list? You have just said you do not have it with you. That does not mean there is not a separate list. Can you, therefore, take on notice and provide to this chamber a list of those agreements?

  You just asserted to me that I had said I have a list and I am not prepared to provide it to you. That is not the case. I do not have a list. The figure of 126 was established by the tribunal by their inspection of the register, so perhaps this is an inquiry you ought to direct to the tribunal.

There have been a lot of wild things said in this debate, including from your party—and not only your party—many of them inaccurate, speculative and at variance from reality, so I am not going to reflect upon the sentiment you have just expressed. Suffice it to say, the bill before the chamber does one thing and one thing only, and that is to protect the ILUAs that would have been put at risk by the McGlade decision, and there are 126 of them.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:13):  Just for the record, I was not wildly speculating about the national parks or the issue around the agreements being reached over native title during the agreement process. It is on the record from the Senate inquiry that these may be. I am seeking to clarify whether they were or not. I found it astounding that there is not a list available to back up the claims of urgency for dealing with this matter.


I turn specifically to the South West ILUAs. Could you clarify for us now the process from here, if this bill goes through—and I am speculating that it probably will—for the South West ILUAs? The reason I am asking is that there is now some doubt in the community about the process. We were told one thing during the Senate inquiry, and certainly there is a group in the South West who understand the process a bit differently. I know the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council had some concerns about the process as well. So, for the record, could you please clarify what that process is?

This legislation is to restore the status quo ante, before, the McGlade decision, and that of course is what the Prime Minister was referring to. The government had a very extensive consultation, which I described last night in the second reading debate. In the end it was the unanimous view of all of the native title representative groups whom the government consulted—and all of them were invited to the consultation by the way—and I think it is right to say that all or nearly all attended. Also, as expressed by their peak body, the National Native Title Council, in the letter from Mr Kelly of 5 May that I read into the record last night, it was the unanimous view of the native title claimant groups that this problem needed to be fixed.

Prior to that, though, within a matter of days of the McGlade decision being delivered—that is, not later than the second week of February this year—Senator Scullion and I met with Mr Kelly, the CEO of the National Native Title Council, the peak body that speaks for all native title groups, and he, at that meeting, urged us to fix the problem, or words to the effect of, 'Fix the problem caused by the McGlade decision,' and to ask the parliament to do so urgently, and we did. The purpose of the consultation meeting on 27 April was merely to share the government's proposed bill with the native title claimant groups to ensure they were happy with the manner of the solution to it. They made some helpful suggestions at the margins, which we have adopted and they are embodied in the government amendments before the chamber today. But the request, on behalf of the native title claimant groups, that the problem presented by the McGlade decision be fixed, came as early as the first meeting Senator Scullion and I had with Mr Kelly in early February of this year.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:27):  The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 15 February, and I had already announced that, because of the urging of the native title groups, we were urging the parliament to deal with the matter urgently. Now, the parliament, obviously, has not dealt with the matter urgently because four months have now elapsed and we are still debating it. Nevertheless, if you are seeking to establish some kind of cause-and-effect link between the Prime Minister's discussions with Mr Adani in India and the bill, you are completely wrong, Senator Waters. The government determined upon this course in response to the request of the traditional owners within days of the McGlade decision being delivered by the Federal Court in the first week of February.

My question is completely apposite to the whole purpose and reason for this bill. I want to know who first instigated the need for this rushed response, which tramples on native title rights, and whether it was Adani himself or one of his representatives.

But, to answer your question, so far as I am aware, the first approach came from the National Native Title Council through Mr Kelly. That is the first approach that I am aware of. I am also aware of the Premier of Queensland, Ms Palaszczuk's, letter to the Prime Minister asking that the problem be dealt with urgently, which I think, if my memory serves me correct, was by a letter dated 6 February.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (10:30):  Minister, you said this morning that stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that section 31 agreements could be challenged. Can you explain to the Senate why section 31 is of concern and why you have raised that this morning?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:30):  Well, I have not actually raised that. This is what I said about section 31, Senator McCarthy—and let me read it to you again:


One further matter raised by the committee which I want to comment on is the status of what are known as section 31 agreements under the Native Title Act following the McGlade decision. Section 31 agreements are another way that agreements can be made under the act through the right to negotiate procedure. While the McGlade decision did not involve these types of agreements, stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that these agreements could be challenged. However, as agreements made under the right to negotiate procedure have different requirements to ILUAs, the government will consider these matters further and will consider the ramification of McGlade on the right to negotiate procedure more closely with stakeholders before making amendments to the law.


That is what I said. So, Senator McCarthy, far from saying what you have attributed to me, I actually said the opposite: that the right to negotiate issue under section 31 are not the subject of this bill but will be the subject of consideration when the government reviews in a more holistic way the Native Title Act, as we have foreshadowed we will do.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:32):  No. What we are doing is we are legislatively reversing the McGlade decision, and that is all we are doing. In the course of debate on this bill, other issues have been raised which go way beyond its scope—one of them being the right to negotiate provisions of the act. And, as I have said, that is not part of this bill, because it is not necessary to its purpose. But there is a view—certainly a view that was expressed to Senator Scullion and me by the native title representative groups at our meeting on 27 April—that a broader, more comprehensive review of the act was desirable. The government accepts that point of view. That will involve many issues, including the section 31 issue. That is the work of another day, but it is not part of this bill.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:33):  I think it is fair to say that the McGlade decision changed the playing field and put at legal risk ILUAs in which native title claimants and, indeed, all parties to the ILUAs have proceeded on the basis that they were on a sound legal footing. As a result of McGlade, some of them were put at risk for reasons that you understand. Therefore, the government's immediate focus, urged by, in particular, the native title claimants, was to restore certainty following the McGlade decision. That is the narrow, surgical focus of this bill. A broader review of provisions of the Native Title Act may very well be desirable but is the work of another day.

On that matter, you are correct that it is before the Federal Court. I understand the hearing date is March of next year and that there are several grounds to that case, which Senator Dodson referred to earlier in his initial contribution as well. The Prime Minister promised Mr Adani that he would fix the native tile issue. This bill is seeking to fix a small aspect, but is it not the case that there are multiple prongs in that litigation before the Federal Court by the W&J mob and that even if this bill does succeed, thanks to Labor rolling over and trashing Indigenous rights with this government's bill, that in fact the issue will not be fixed and that there will still be many other grounds before the court such that a registered ILUA could not be completed any time before March? Is the Prime Minister now going to tell Mr Adani that in fact he has not been able to 'fix' native title issues at all?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:44):  I want to make another attempt at understanding the government's logic with respect to the issue of extinguishment. During the Senate inquiry, we received a number of submissions that raised concerns about ILUAs that were agreed by the majority, not all the named applicants, as per the McGlade decision. Instead of this blanket approach to agreeing to all of the registered ILUAs, a number proposed that there should be a process to review them to make sure people are happy with those agreements. To my mind, this is germane to the discussion we are having, because they are proposing an alternative approach. I know for a fact that in the South West WA the extinguishment of native title is one of the issues for the people who are opposing the ILUAs in the South West. They are concerned that they have to give up extinguishment over, admittedly, rather smaller areas of land, but that is one of their key concerns. To my mind, if not to yours, this is an important issue, because these may be the agreements that people would particularly like to have a look at. The fact that they are included here means it was not a consensus decision to extinguish native title. Some people see that as a threshold—I am not saying everybody, but some people do. That is why I do not understand, when you actually have pulled out the information, you cannot give us a list. We know there is one in Queensland, which has to do with transport corridor, as I understand it, but what are the others? That is why it is important. This goes to the heart of what many people are concerned about.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:46): Senator Brandis, you know very well that there are disputes over that, and I know where the South West Land and Sea Council stand. I have a lot of sympathy for their argument. In fact at the inquiry, they raised concerns that it did not go far enough for them. They have to go through that application process, which you have just articulated, again. Yes, they agree, but they want it to go further. I know they have some issues there, but they do want to see the passage of the bill. I also know very strongly, because I have spoken to people, and they are the groups of claimants who took the court case in the first place. 


To answer my question by simply quoting the South West Land and Sea Council does not answer my question at all. You know very well we are here right now is because of the group of people who took the action in the Supreme Court in the first place, and that is now the McGlade decision. You know very well that there is a group of people who do not agree with where we are at in the South West of WA. I am not seeking to prosecute that argument here, but I am using it as a clear example of claimants' concerns about the extinguishment of native title. It is one of the key issues that has been raised with me as the reason they do not agree. As I said, I am not seeking to prosecute that discussion here—it is not my place to do so. I am raising it as an example of why extinguishment of native title is a really important issue, when there has not been a consensus decision on it.

As the minister responsible for the carriage of the bill, I can assure you I have had no communication with Adani whatsoever.

Of those eight ILUAs that were pending registration which this bill seeks to validate despite the fact that they may not have unanimous support by the registered native title claimants, at least two of the mining companies involved are Fortescue and Rio Tinto. Both companies have donated to the Liberal Party. What discussions, if any, were had between either you or the Prime Minister and representatives from Fortescue and Rio about this bill?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:56):  I had no discussions with Rio about this bill—none at all. As to Fortescue, I had a meeting with Mr Andrew Forrest about two or three months ago in my office in which he came to see me about human slavery and to give me a briefing about human slavery, a cause about which I would have hoped you would care but plainly do not. During the course of my meeting with Mr Forrest I have no recollection of any discussion of anything other than the question of human slavery. I put that on the record for the sake of completeness because I have had one meeting with Mr Forrest during the time in which this bill has been before the parliament. We did not discuss the bill; we discussed human slavery.


In relation to whether the Prime Minister has discussed this with representatives of either of those companies or anyone else, I am not in a position to tell you.

(3) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (line 26), after ""native"", insert ""title"".

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:02):  I move government amendment on sheet ZA431. 


(1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (after line 26), after subitem (1), insert:


   (1A) This item also applies if:


   (a) paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) apply to an agreement; and


   (b) the agreement was not an indigenous land use agreement (within the meaning of that section) only because:


      (i) if there was only one registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area—none of the persons who comprised that registered native title claimant was a party to the agreement; and


      (ii) if there was more than one registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area—for any registered native title claimant, none of the persons who comprised that registered native title claimant was a party to the agreement; and


   (c) the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017.


Since the bill's introduction, the Cape York Land Council has advised the government of a small number of ILUAs that were made and registered when none of the members of the registered native title claimant were a party to the ILUA. These agreements are small in number and are the result of circumstances where it may not have been possible or indeed appropriate to obtain the signatures of the members of the registered native title claimant. I have been advised that this practice was confined to very limited situations such as where all members of the registered native title claimant were deceased or where they were not the right people to be party to agreements over a certain area of land in the claim—that is to say, it was not appropriate for them to speak for that part of the country.


One of these agreements, the Western Cape Communities Co-Existence Agreement, was entered into back in 2001 at a time when practice in relation to the negotiation and registration of ILUAs was developing. This agreement has provided and continues to provide considerable benefits to the Indigenous people of Cape York. It would be a significant detriment to these people were this agreement to be invalidated. All of these agreements were accepted for registration by the National Native Title Tribunal and were subject to the usual objections process following lodgement for registration.


The government therefore believes it is important to give effect to requests from the Cape York Land Council to validate these ILUAs. The bill now includes an additional round for application of the retrospective validation provisions where an agreement had been registered on or before 2 February 2017 but no members of the registered native title claimant were party. The measure is confined to retrospectively validating only those agreements that have been already registered and therefore would have been through the rigorous authorisation and objection processes set out by the act. The bill will not validate agreements without signatures where the agreement is under negotiation or not yet registered, and should not be taken to indicate the way in which agreements will be made in the future.

I just note that the Cape York agreements are very much according to customary laws that pertain to the people involved here. Such matters are vital to the nature of native title itself. Obviously, the law under the Western system has required these amendments that are to be made necessary in order to validate those agreements that were done in good faith and under customary law arrangements, as I understand it.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:16):  The point at the heart of this amendment, as I understand it, is that you have nine agreements that relate to Cape York—the one claim—and, due to the process by which Cape York deals with native title, they were not signed by any of the named applicants.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:17):  I am advised that the way I have described it was the way in which, by custom, this was done in Cape York. I am at pains to make this point: this particular amendment was requested specifically by the Cape York Land Council. The government accepted the Cape York Land Council's request that, in order to protect the interests of the people whom they represent, the bill be amended in this way, which is why we have included it.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:18):  I do understand the rationale and I have some sympathy for the way that Cape York has addressed and does address native title decision-making and agreement-making. We went through some of that during the inquiry. What we did not do during the inquiry was go through these issues, because they were not raised at the time by the Cape York institute when we were discussing the amendments. If you read their submission to the inquiry, they actually took quite a different approach. Through that original submission, they did not agree to this legislation. In fact, they are one of the organisations, if I remember the submission correctly, who were saying that you needed to look more specifically at some of the agreements as to whether they should be revisited or not. As I said, I have some sympathy for the way they make decisions and the approach they have taken. However, the point here is that, with no named applicants, they clearly do not even meet the majority approach under Bygrave. In fact, at least one of these agreements was made way before Bygrave.


So before that decision was taken that the majority could sign on—that is what the Bygrave decision was, that you could go with the majority—at least one, if not more, of these agreements were made. They were made way before that interpretation was put into effect—that is my understanding of the situation. How, with all the goodwill in terms of the way that Cape York run their processes, could the register be clearly inconsistent with the act? That has been happening for a significant period of time. How did that occur? Was this flagged at the time? I understand that this relates to some time ago; I am not having a go at the government. I want to know how this process could have occurred when, as I understand it, there was not even an interpretation at the time that no named applicants could sign.

It is not right to say that there were no named applicants. I am advised that there were, but the signatories on their behalf were representatives signing on their behalf.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:23):  Attorney, can I just clarify this? I think you have said it twice, but from the way this debate is proceeding I perhaps am not sure of my hearing. Is it a fact that the Cape York Land Council, who I know to be to be made up of very responsible and intelligent people, have looked into this very carefully—looked into it with the best interests of not only clan groups from Cape York but all those affected by native title legislation? They have looked into this very carefully. They have asked for this particular amendment—I am sure you have said that three times already. The debate is being dragged out for reasons that I do not understand and there seems to be questioning of the ability or the authority of the Cape York Land Council to deal with this amendment and to make the request or to consult with you on the amendment.


What might have happened in years gone by is, I am sure, interesting for the history books. I am sure if it were relevant to this amendment then those at the Cape York Land Council and, indeed, those at the Native Title Council would have all fully considered this. They obviously do not think this interesting sojourn into past history is of any relevance to matters today, to matters relating to this bill, and to the interests of Indigenous people right around Australia, because I am sure if they thought these were relevant, if they thought it were necessary for this parliament to go into past history, then they would have raised that with you. I am assuming that they have not, but I seek your confirmation again that this is an amendment that the Cape York Land Council—intelligent, capable people themselves—have asked for and are desirous of seeing passed through this parliament at the earliest possible time.

I met with the representatives of the Cape York Land Council on 27 April. That was part of the non-consultation that has been alleged. They requested this amendment of me. An amendment to meet their wishes was prepared and shared with them for careful study. That was another aspect of the non-consultation that was said to have occurred or the consultation that was said never to have occurred, and the Cape York Land Council have asked, as part of the failure to consult them, the government to amend the bill in this way, and the government has agreed, which is why this government amendment is being moved. This is part of the absence of the consensus that has been pointed to by the Greens. So every native title council in Australia was consulted and every single one has agreed to this bill, and, particularly in relation to the Cape York Land Council who particularly asked for this very amendment to protect the interests of their people, this is the amendment they asked for that I am moving.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:27):  Senator Brandis, perhaps you could share with the chamber the process that you went through to take this to the reps bodies, because I and a number of other senators have received a letter from the NLC, the Northern Land Council, expressing their concerns. Ultimately, I do understand that you agreed to amend the original amendment that you proposed here, but I think it is clear, certainly from the correspondence that I received, that there was concern from other representative bodies about this approach. I will accept that they ultimately agreed—I understand, with some reluctance—to the amendments that you subsequently made to the original amendment.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:28):  Senator, rather than prolong the debate, I will merely refer you to my remarks last night in winding up the second reading debate in which I did that very thing and explained at length the consultations that occurred. You say 'reluctance' on the part of the Northern Land Council. The fact is that the Northern Land Council, like every other land council in the country, has asked for the parliament to pass this bill in this form and to do it urgently.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:28):  I notice very clearly that you did not answer the question that I just asked, which was for you to explain the NLC's original concern. I would like to go back to the question that I asked and the points that I raised earlier. I understand the Cape York decision-making process. They explained it, and I have a lot of sympathy for it. But the fact is that it does not meet the requirements of the legislation at the time. How many of these agreements—not just Cape York but others—had representatives sign onto them as part of the majority?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:29):  I am only aware of the issue arising in relation to Cape York.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:29):  I do not seek to prolong this. I want to get these answers; and I am not going to get these answers. It is clear that these agreements, for all the goodwill in the world, did not meet the provisions of the Native Title Act. That is why you are having to validate them in this way. A 'representative of the named applicant'? How many other times has a 'representative of the named applicant' signed on?


I am not having a go at Cape York about this; I am having a go at the fact that these were registered in the first place. We cannot be confident that there was not some other interpretation used for some of the other agreements that have been registered. It is not just about Cape York; it is about all of them and in what other circumstances this has occurred. That is why people are concerned. That is why we remain concerned about this blanket agreement supporting all these ILUAs. These were not consistent with the law. I acknowledge that there was probably goodwill on most of them, but we do not know. That is why we had a lot of sympathy and support for the submissions to the inquiry that said that we should be looking at these agreements in more detail rather than just signing them all off. Minister, I note that the piece of paper that you tabled—and thank you—says at the end:


This information was provided in good faith by the National Native Title Tribunal and should be treated as sensitive. A more extensive review of the ILUA register and each ILUA would need to be conducted to confirm these figures.


So, in other words, you cannot confirm that it is just 126. You cannot give me the list of those that extinguish native title.


We have at least nine agreements that we know that no registered claimants signed on to. Some had representatives sign on and there was one where the claimant, as I understand it, was deceased. That is why there are still so many questions over what you say is a really simple piece of legislation. It is not. That is why the Greens cannot support this agreement, despite having sympathy for the approach that the Cape York council takes in terms of one claim having representatives from the regions involved as named applicants and then getting specific traditional owners to sign off on some agreements. I understand that. There are too many open questions about how these were registered in the first place. They were not consistent with the law—however you want to spin it. That is why we cannot sign on to this amendment.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:33):  Senator Siewert, I note the point you make, and let me just respond to two respects. First of all, the list of 126 is the advice to the government of the Native Title Tribunal. They have included that reservation out of abundant caution, but that is their advice to the government of the number of ILUAs—126. That is the best advice and evidence we have.


Secondly, in relation to the question you raise about the registration of the Cape York ILUAs, the Native Title Act, as I am sure you know, provides for a procedure whereby an agreement will be registered if it appears to meet the formal requirements of the act, and that is a matter for the registrar. The registrar, plainly, by accepting these agreements, formed the view that they met the formal requirements of the act. That has never been challenged, so far as I am aware, in any court of law, which is the appropriate forum—not here—for such an argument to be made. In any event, I do not understand you to be suggesting otherwise. The Cape York Land Council, by urging the government to move this amendment, is merely looking after the best interests of the people of Cape York and particularly the native title owners. For that reason, I ask you to now allow the amendment to proceed to a vote.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:39):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (1), (2) and (5) on sheet 8161 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (line 26), at the end of subitem (1), add:


; and (e) the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017.


(2) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (lines 30 to 32), omit “Without limiting subitem (2), if on or before 2 February 2017 the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, then the”, substitute “The”.


(5) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (lines 13 to 16), omit subitem (1), substitute:


   (1) This item applies to an agreement if, if the agreement had been registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017, item 9 would have applied to the agreement except for the application of subitem 9(4).


We also oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:


(3) Schedule 1, item 10, page 6 (lines 11 to 27), to be opposed.


(4) Schedule 1, item 11, page 6 (line 28) to page 7 (line 11), to be opposed.


We are opposed to clause 10, which deals with validating the applications that are currently before the registrar—in other words, where agreements have been discussed, applications have been made and they are before the registrar. The Adani agreement is one of those. The other amendments there relate to the consequences that taking that section out have. Because these are counted as agreements they are also included under clause 9 in the bill, so we are amending that to address that situation. We are also amending clause 12 because it is a different situation for the south-west agreements. That is the basis of these amendments. We think that, if we take out of the process the Adani application and those pending agreements that are clearly not registered and clearly do not have consensus decisions, that would be a more satisfactory approach to dealing with the particular matters.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:41):  The government will be opposing these Greens amendments because their effect would be to confine the bill to registered agreements. Agreements that have been authorised by the entire claim group but not yet registered would be left out if the Greens amendments were to be accepted. The government does not accept that such agreements should be excluded from the bill. The government's approach respects the choices of Australia's traditional owners; the Greens' approach does not. I remind the chamber once again that the bill in the form in which it currently stands, with the government amendments recommended by the Native Title Council and particularly the Cape York amendment, is now the bill that native title owners have asked this parliament to pass.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (11:42):  Labor will be opposing these Greens amendments as well. For all the discussion I have heard about consultation with Indigenous peoples, I have no indication that these proposals have gone anywhere near the native title rep bodies. They have been put forward at the last minute in my view. They are beyond the scope of the agreed position that the Senate committee came to. The more important matter around extinguishment that I heard raised is a very important point of policy, but that is for another day. I certainly repudiate the allegation made against Labor that we are simply rolling over and trashing native title rights. We have stood up for native title rights and we will continue to do so. What I have heard in this debate is primarily about Adani and a coalmine, and that is a bit sad.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:43):  With all due respect, Senator Dodson, you know as well as I do that the timing on this is directly related to Adani. There are significant points of conflict around the Adani decision-making process. You heard the same arguments I did through the Senate inquiry, where there was very strong dispute about their decision-making process, specifically related to the Adani mine. I would have loved for this discussion not to be about Adani. In fact, the Native Title Council has raised the issue with the government. It is clearly on the record that it had been asking for some time before the McGlade case came up for this issue to be addressed.


What has pushed the government's buttons is Adani—let's make that clear. I am really regretful that the debate on this has had to centre on Adani, which is clearly the government's agenda. If we take this off, we take some of the heat out of that discussion. By not supporting this amendment gives the government one more way to support the Adani coalmine. Senator Macdonald was in here not long ago saying, 'Oh, they are talking about 600 more jobs in Townsville.' I for one know that we need more jobs—you cannot hold the portfolios I hold without knowing that—but killing the reef is going to kill a lot more jobs, and that is what this project will do. We can address that issue here and not facilitate the development and not go against the wishes of the majority. It is not just a minority of people in this case of Adani—there are really strong claims that this process was manipulated and that it does not have majority support. Take that off the table, and that is what this amendment does, and you take that argument somewhere else. I commend the amendments to the chamber.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments as moved by Senator Siewert on sheet 8161 be agreed to.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:08):  Could I ask the minister how many of these ILUAs that are at risk or that will be regularised by this bill are in my state of Queensland? Attorney, you would appreciate me asking that, as I, like you, am a Queensland representative in this place. 


I should just mention that I had the pleasure of meeting with a large number of Indigenous people just last week—I forget when it was; Tuesday, I think—when the Adani corporation came to Townsville and made the official announcement that Townsville would be the headquarters of the Adani project. Of course, that was great news for Townsville, which is currently suffering the highest unemployment, I regret to say, around the country—more than 11 per cent. Youth unemployment is unreasonably and unconscionably high. 


This announcement by Adani of anywhere up to 600 new jobs—as I understood them—being created just in the headquarters in Townsville was great news for Townsville. I have to say that I do not always agree with the Labor Mayor of Townsville, but the Labor Mayor of Townsville was totally involved in the announcement and very pleased. The Queensland government was there, represented by the Premier of Queensland—of all people—and some of her ministers, all lauding Adani for establishing their headquarters in Townsville and going ahead with this project that will mean so much to all Queenslanders, particularly Indigenous people. I had the pleasure, at a little function after the announcement, of sitting with a group of Indigenous people. Some of them lawyers— 




Senator Siewert:
  And the question is? 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I have raised the question. I thought, Senator Siewert, that you had asked a series of question, most of which you had already asked at the committee hearing that you attended, so you are simply re-asking the same questions; for what purpose, I do not know. I thought I heard you make— 




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Macdonald, please address your comments to the chair. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you. Yes, quite right, Chair. I thought I heard Senator Siewert make quite lengthy statements earlier in this debate; yet, it seems to be, as always, that there is one rule for the Greens, one rule for Senator Siewert and a different rule for everybody else. I would have thought it was important for this debate for senators to understand that Indigenous people are totally behind this amendment and, as an aside might I say, behind the Adani project. But this is not about Adani; this is about a wider thing. Hence, my question to the minister about how many of these Indigenous Land Use Agreements are at risk in Queensland because, Attorney, as I know you know—but I will repeat for other senators who do not—Indigenous people in the area supported this Adani proposal very strongly, almost unanimously. They are very keen to see this particular piece of legislation passed. In fact, last week in Townsville the National Native Title Council met. Whilst I was not party to the meeting, I understand from talking to people that they are all very, very keen. There were a lot of representatives and a lot of Indigenous lawyers there, and they were all saying to me: 'When are you going to get this through? Because we need this. We need this for our people.' They were very keen and very appreciative to the Attorney for acting so quickly. I think the McGlade decision was on 2 February. I know the Attorney introduced this bill on 15 February and it has taken us to the middle of June— 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Four months. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  four months, to get here. If it was something that people were wildly opposed to, if Indigenous people were widely opposed to it, one could understand why it might take four months to get to this particular state of being, but I understand that the Labor Party and certainly the Labor Party in Queensland—Premier Palaszczuk and her ministers—are all totally in support of this amendment and always have been. Clearly, if the Labor Party, the coalition and One Nation are so much in favour of this, it amazes me that it has taken us four months to get to this stage where we are almost ready to pass a piece of legislation that has all but the unanimous support of this chamber. People can make their own opinions on the motives of those who have delayed it until this time. I simply come back to my question: Attorney, it is very important for Queensland to know how many of these Indigenous Land Use Agreements will be regularised or confirmed—or whatever the terminology is—when, as appears likely, this amendment is passed.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:32):  I table three supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill and seek leave to move government amendments (1), (2) and (4) on sheet ZA429 together.


Leave granted. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  The government opposes schedule 1 in the following terms:


(1)     Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (lines 23 and 24), to be opposed.


(2)     Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (lines 7 and 8), to be opposed.


(4)     Schedule 1, item 11, page 6 (line 28) to page 7 (line 11), to be opposed.


I thank the members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and, in particular, the chairman of the committee, the distinguished father of the Senate, Senator Macdonald, for their work in reviewing the bill. The committee's majority report contained two recommendations, the key recommendation being that the bill be passed. This reflects the significant uncertainty that the native title sector was faced with following the decision in McGlade, something I mentioned in closing the second reading debate last night. The government was urged by Indigenous and non-Indigenous stakeholders alike to address the ambiguous situation faced by the parties to an estimated 126 ILUAs following that decision. 


The committee's other recommendation is for the removal of two separate measures from the bill at this time, with the recommendation that they be considered in a later bill, involving government proposals arising from the 2015 Australian Law Reform Commission report Connection to country: review of the Native Title Act. The committee recommended that the proposed amendments to sections 251A and 251B of the act be removed. Those amendments, items 4 and 6 of schedule 1, would have permitted claim groups to authorise an ILUA and to make applications for compensation or the determination of native title by a traditional process or a method agreed upon by the group. These changes implemented recommendations 10-1 and 10-2 of the ALRC report. The Senate committee has taken the view that the amendments require further consultation and are not strictly necessary to respond to the McGlade decision. Given that the purpose of this bill, as I indicated last night, was merely to respond to the McGlade decision, their presence in the bill might be regarded as supererogatory. The government accepts this point of view and proposes to remove these measures from the bill and consider the issues again at a later point, along with other important recommendations made by the 2015 Law Reform Commission report.


The committee also recommended the removal of item 11 of the bill for later consideration. This item would have allowed for the validation of applications to register ILUAs and was intended to address any unforeseen consequences of McGlade. The committee formed the view that the impact of the provision was not clear. The government considers that the provision can be removed without affecting the integrity of the bill. 


I also note that the committee expressed concerns about the onerous administrative burden placed on the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council and the Noongar people by having to proceed through the registration process once again. The committee, however, did not see this as an impediment to recommending that the Senate pass the bill, and I note the government's commitment to considering this in the future.


One further matter raised by the committee which I wish to comment on is the status of what are known as section 31 agreements under the Native Title Act following the McGlade decision. Section 31 agreements are another way that agreements can be made under the act through the right-to-negotiate procedure. While the McGlade decision did not involve these types of agreements, stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that these agreements could be challenged. However, as agreements made under the right-to-negotiate procedure have different requirements to ILUAs, the government will consider these matters further and will consider the ramifications of McGlade on the right-to-negotiate procedure more closely with stakeholders before making amendments to the law.


Just to be clear, with these government amendments there is nothing in this bill at all that does anything beyond legislatively reverse the effect of the McGlade decision and reinstate the status quo ante of the law as settled by the Bygraves case.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (09:37):  I wish to speak to the amendments moved by the minister but also to the other amendments that I know the government is intending to move—that is, those amendments on sheet ZA431 as well as those on sheet ZA429. Labor has been a long-time supporter of native title and the Indigenous land rights movement, and has worked for many decades to protect and strengthen these rights for Indigenous people around Australia. After the High Court decision, the 25th anniversary of which we celebrated around the nation last week, it was Labor that introduced and legislated the Native Title Act in 1993. That act, while achieving a balance of certainty for existing landholders, established a process for a legal system for native title claimants to achieve recognition and ownership of their ancestral lands. It is our strong belief that this amendment act and the developments of future legislative amendments that affect the act need to be carried out in a consultative and respectful way. Indigenous people need to provide their free, prior and informed consent on things that affect their interests, most especially on the issue of native title. 


I want to reiterate that, for Labor, the amendments to the Native Title Act in this bill have always been about land rights, not mining rights. I wish that that were the case for the government, many of the senior members of which have made it clear that, for them, the bill is about the Adani Carmichael coalmine. The Prime Minister's statement and last year's closing the gap speech that did seek to do things with Indigenous people, not to them, reflects these same principles.


I was very disappointed to read the comments of the Prime Minister while he was in India, in April, where he said to the head of the Adani corporation that the native title laws that stood in the way of the mine would be fixed. In relation to specific amendments, Labor acknowledges that the decision of the full court of McGlade has created a great deal of uncertainty, both for native title holders and for other land users around Australia.


We have been informed by the government that some 125 Indigenous land-use area agreements that have been negotiated and agreed with native title holders and their respective representatives are now subject to uncertainty and potential renegotiation. So let me make it clear again: there are some 125 ILUAs that this bill will validate and we accept that this is a just outcome for the communities that made those agreements under the law as it then was and to those with whom they made those agreements. But it is not my understanding that this bill will provide some kind of green light for the Adani mine as some media reports seem to suggest. To the contrary. 


I understand that the Wangan and Jagalingou people—the traditional owners of much of the land on which the mine and its facilities are proposed to be built—have several legal actions afoot against Adani. Most of this litigation will be entirely unaffected by the passage of this bill. In particular, there are very serious allegations of fraud that have been made against Adani regarding the processes under which agreements with the Wangan and Jagalingou people were purportedly reached. And those proceedings, which may impact on the validity of any ILUA, will only commence hearings in March next year. 


Other legal action is always underway, including a case challenging the validity of the licences issued by the Queensland government. Be that as it may, since the decision in McGlade we have sought to work constructively with the government to agree upon a position that balances the need for a reasonable and timely resolution of the matters with the need to properly consult with Indigenous people, native title holders and their representatives. That is why we insisted that the legislation be the subject of a proper Senate inquiry prior to its passage through the parliament. A very short time was agreed upon by the government for submissions—only one day of hearings was allowed. 


Despite those constraints, in the process of the Senate inquiry a number of very significant issues arose with the bill. First, despite the assertion in the explanatory memorandum that the legislation 'amends the Native Title Act 1993 to resolve the uncertainty created by the full Federal Court decision in McGlade' in fact, the draft bill contained provisions that went well beyond that objective. Those included but were not limited to amendments that had been first proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Connection to country. Second, it became clear to us that little or no consultation had occurred with Indigenous people prior to the introduction of the legislation. 


Considering the significance of these changes, we considered this as a breach of the concept of free, prior and informed consent. Through the Senate committee process, Labor senators secured important amendments to the legislation which removed those provisions that went beyond the stated purpose of the bill. That inquiry recommended:


… subject to paragraph 2.75, that proposed amendments to sections 251A and 251B of the Native Title Act 1993 be removed from the current bill and dealt with in any later bill involving government proposals arising from the Australian Law Reform Commission report …


Following the Senate inquiry tabled on Monday, 20 March 2017 the government undertook to draft amendments to give effect to this agreed position. More than a week later, on Tuesday, 28 March 2017, the government tabled amendments and sought to have the legislation debated prior to the April recess. Unfortunately, in subsequent briefings from the Attorney-General's Department, it quickly became clear that these amendments were again defective in a number of respects: (a) they contained provisions which went beyond the original intentions of the bill and the agreed position of the Senate inquiry; and (b) not one single person outside the government, Indigenous or otherwise, had been consulted in their preparation. Labor considered this to be such a breach of the good-faith agreement reached through the Senate committee process and a clear breach of the concept, again, of free prior and informed consent.


It was necessary for the government to urgently convene, for the purposes of consultation, a meeting of the major native title representative bodies under the umbrella of the Native Title Council. Labor supported these consultations, although they were brief and some of the amendments were still unclear. I note that Senator Brandis had been selectively generous in his recognition of my role in encouraging this point of consultation and I thank him for that. However, he is completely wrong in saying that I have been alone in supporting a balanced and principled position on this issue. My Senate and House colleagues have been of one mind and one focus in working through the issue, and I thank them for that. 


At the Melbourne consultation arranged by the government, we noted that a further amendment was proposed to address concerns raised by representatives of the Cape York Land Council over the longstanding ILUA that underpins the Weipa agreement, the Western Cape Communities Coexistence Agreement. Even after that point, the government sought to rush through passage in the last sittings, which was a simple stunt on the pretence that the sky was about fall in and it was only the Attorney-General who was going to be able to hold the sky up.


Labor seeks to work constructively and productively with the government but this process has been challenging, leading to the sentiment expressed in Senator McCarthy's amendment in the second reading speech moved and agreed to yesterday. We seek to ensure that the land use agreement system is sufficiently stable and sound after the judicial decision in McGlade that created a high degree of uncertainty, not only for those agreements before McGlade but for the security and clarity of agreement making going forward. Agreement making is important to Labor and we support the need for some sense of confidence for those native title holders who have negotiated access and use agreements across the country. Having removed many of the problematic elements of the draft bill, and having now engaged in consultations, at least with those native title representative bodies and those who made submissions to the Senate committee, Labor can now support the amendments.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:48):  I have a few comments to make, but I should also let the chamber know I have a series of questions to the Attorney-General through you, Chair, that I will be seeking some clarification on. First off, I very quickly wanted to address some of the comments that Senator Brandis made last night and, in fact, Senator Dobson just touched on then, in terms of the consultation process and how the message Senator Brandis was intending to deliver yesterday was that everybody should be on board now because they have held another meeting and there is consensus now to these amendments! There is not consensus to these amendments. Yes, the bill is a relatively short bill, but it deals with complex issues. It does not mean just because a bill is short that it does not still involve complex issues.


There is not consensus, because last night we had people in the gallery who were clearly not on board with supporting these amendments. Just last night I had an email from a member of the Noongar community in Perth, Western Australia, who clearly was representing a number of people who do not support these changes. So there is not consensus. There was one more meeting that the Attorney-General convened and invited people from the representative bodies to. I acknowledge that that was extra, and that is a good thing, but you cannot claim that you have consensus because you convened that particular meeting.


We were getting, and we are still getting, a lot of messages from people saying, 'Don't support these amendments.' These are people that recognise that we need to be addressing this issue, and I and the Greens have acknowledged that in our contributions. We need to be addressing these issues. We are deeply concerned that these amendments are being rushed through because of Adani. These issues have been on the books for some time, and all of a sudden the government decide that they are going to deal with it now.


I will indicate that, although we cannot support the bill because we are still concerned about these amendments, we will be supporting this particular set of amendments because they deal with part of the concerns that were expressed during the Senate inquiry and that the Greens had identified. The amendments do pull back a little bit on the changes being made around the decision-making process. On schedule 11, I am also pleased to see that the ALP did in fact pick up on the issues that I raised through the Senate inquiry. So I can indicate that we will be supporting the amendments on this sheet, ZA429, even if that means we have to vote in the negative, because the question we will be asked to vote on is whether we should support the bill as printed.


However, what I would like to do now is to go to some of the questions that I have. I have some general questions, and I also have some specific questions around the second set of government amendments, which are on sheet ZA431. I ask this through you, Chair, to the Attorney-General: I do not know if you want to deal with them all at once or if you would rather do it when we deal with that amendment.




Senator Brandis:
  We will deal with them together.




Senator SIEWERT:
  Thank you. I have some overarching questions first, in that case. Could I ask now: do we have a definitive list of the agreements that are affected by the McGlade decision? We have never been able to get a clarified number.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:04):  That is what I was seeking some clarification about. I got confused when you said they were on the list. I am not trying to be tricky here; I am just trying to get some clarification, because the list of the eight then changes. They are completely different to the ILUAs that would previously have been on the list.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:05):  We are talking about three different things now. There are the ILUAs that are registered—that is the 126. There are the eight ILUAs that are pending, and those are on the list that I am providing to you and just read onto the record. Then there were some other ILUAs, including those to which you have referred, which had been pending registration but, as a consequence of the McGlade decision, were no longer capable of registration, as it were—and the purpose of this bill, as you know, is to reverse legislatively the effect of the McGlade decision.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:05):  Thank you for that clarification—it is much clearer. I want to go back to the 126 ILUAs and get an understanding of the answer that you gave. During the Senate inquiry hearing, we were told very clearly that the 126 was a bit of a rubbery number and you could not tell us what the agreements were because there was not a clear understanding of which agreements had the majority sign-on and which actually had all the named applicants on them. Am I to understand from the answer you just gave that we are now clear about that? Why weren't you and the department able to tell us during the Senate inquiry what the list of 126 was when we asked? We definitely were not told during the Senate inquiry.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:06):  First of all, I have just given you a copy of a list that you have been seeking. That is being provided to you by the attendant as we speak. I am not in a position to inform you of that much detail. I was not, as you would know, at the Senate committee hearing. My officers, no doubt, were very forthcoming about the information they had. The figure of 126 is the figure that has been arrived at by inspection of the register.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:07):  My question referred to the 126—I am sorry if I was not clear. Why could you not have told us that in the inquiry when there were specific questions around the number of agreements? We were clearly told that we could not know all of them and that there was some question mark over the numbers and what was on the list because you had not been through them.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:07):  As you know, I was not at the inquiry, but I am advised by the officers of my department who were and who are with me in the chamber today that the number was not available at the time because the tribunal was still working through the register to establish the number. That number has now been established and, in response to your question, I am telling you the number that has been established is 126.

I expected that they would be listed on the website. However, let us go to the context of the issue and the substance of the issue. Is there a separate list of the 126? If so, please table it.

Senator Siewert, I think you are asking me to compile a list or to inquire whether a list has been compiled.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:10):  Yes. If I had not pursued this line of questioning, one would take from your first answer of 'Look, it's on the register' that one could easily go to the register and find these agreements. You cannot unless there is a separate list. So my question is: is there a separate list? You have just said you do not have it with you. That does not mean there is not a separate list. Can you, therefore, take on notice and provide to this chamber a list of those agreements?

Senator BRANDIS

The details—or those of the details that I have indicated are a matter of public record—are available by inspection of the register, and, with all due respect, it is not for my officials to do your research for you. The register is a public document. By whatever mode accessible, it is a public document, and if you want to inspect the register it is available to you.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:11):  In other words, you have the list—you must have the list because you know categorically that there are 126—and you are not prepared to provide that list to this chamber or take it on notice. They are the very agreements that we are having this debate about, and you are not prepared to provide that list; you are telling us to go through the whole register to find them. Is that what you are saying?

Senator Siewert:
  But how do you know there are 126?




Senator BRANDIS:
  You just asserted to me that I had said I have a list and I am not prepared to provide it to you. That is not the case. I do not have a list. The figure of 126 was established by the tribunal by their inspection of the register, so perhaps this is an inquiry you ought to direct to the tribunal. I do not have a list, but I do have advice from the tribunal that, on the basis of their examination of the register, the number is 126.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  You have never inquired? There has been speculation that these agreements cover some national parks and that, during the process of negotiation of the agreements, some covered agreements reached over native title. You have never inquired as to the nature of these agreements—for example, what mining areas or other areas do they cover? You keep telling us that there are areas in these agreements that are at risk and that there are important things that are at stake here, yet you have never inquired as to the nature of those agreements or asked for the list.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:13):  I certainly have not. These are registered ILUAs. My concern has been to protect their registration following the McGlade decision, and that is my only concern. There have been a lot of wild things said in this debate, including from your party—and not only your party—many of them inaccurate, speculative and at variance from reality, so I am not going to reflect upon the sentiment you have just expressed. Suffice it to say, the bill before the chamber does one thing and one thing only, and that is to protect the ILUAs that would have been put at risk by the McGlade decision, and there are 126 of them. I am advised they are available—or at least the public details of them are available—on the register.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:13):  Just for the record, I was not wildly speculating about the national parks or the issue around the agreements being reached over native title during the agreement process. It is on the record from the Senate inquiry that these may be. I am seeking to clarify whether they were or not. I found it astounding that there is not a list available to back up the claims of urgency for dealing with this matter.


I turn specifically to the South West ILUAs. Could you clarify for us now the process from here, if this bill goes through—and I am speculating that it probably will—for the South West ILUAs? The reason I am asking is that there is now some doubt in the community about the process. We were told one thing during the Senate inquiry, and certainly there is a group in the South West who understand the process a bit differently. I know the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council had some concerns about the process as well. So, for the record, could you please clarify what that process is?

I am advised that the relevant representative body will have to restart the application process—in other words, apply again.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:15):  That is a useful clarification, because, as I said, there is some misunderstanding at the moment. I can tell you that because I got an email about it last night. Just to be clear, that means that they go through the application process and people get an opportunity again to lodge complaints about the process and go through that process. Is that right?

They say that on three occasions since 2012, the natural majority of the claim group have rejected an ILUA with Adani. They also say that in a meeting at which the current ILUA under application was voted upon that, whilst the vote was 294 to one, over 220 of the meeting's attendees were people who have never been involved in the Wangan and Jagalingou claim, and in fact that those people were bussed in at Adani's' expense.

  No. Can I go to the fact that the Prime Minister has acknowledged—

Senator WATERS:
  Fine; I will withdraw, but I have another question. The Prime Minister himself said, 'The issue needs to be fixed and will be fixed,' after he met the head of the Adani group in India. Clearly, this is trying to fix the issue, and hence my earlier imputation. So I stand by that, even though I have technically withdrawn it. My question—

The issue needs to be fixed and will be fixed.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:24):  Plainly, there is a problem that does need to be fixed. This legislation is to restore the status quo ante, before, the McGlade decision, and that of course is what the Prime Minister was referring to. The government had a very extensive consultation, which I described last night in the second reading debate. In the end it was the unanimous view of all of the native title representative groups whom the government consulted—and all of them were invited to the consultation by the way—and I think it is right to say that all or nearly all attended. Also, as expressed by their peak body, the National Native Title Council, in the letter from Mr Kelly of 5 May that I read into the record last night, it was the unanimous view of the native title claimant groups that this problem needed to be fixed.

Prior to that, though, within a matter of days of the McGlade decision being delivered—that is, not later than the second week of February this year—Senator Scullion and I met with Mr Kelly, the CEO of the National Native Title Council, the peak body that speaks for all native title groups, and he, at that meeting, urged us to fix the problem, or words to the effect of, 'Fix the problem caused by the McGlade decision,' and to ask the parliament to do so urgently, and we did. The purpose of the consultation meeting on 27 April was merely to share the government's proposed bill with the native title claimant groups to ensure they were happy with the manner of the solution to it. They made some helpful suggestions at the margins, which we have adopted and they are embodied in the government amendments before the chamber today. But the request, on behalf of the native title claimant groups, that the problem presented by the McGlade decision be fixed, came as early as the first meeting Senator Scullion and I had with Mr Kelly in early February of this year.

Now, the parliament, obviously, has not dealt with the matter urgently because four months have now elapsed and we are still debating it. Nevertheless, if you are seeking to establish some kind of cause-and-effect link between the Prime Minister's discussions with Mr Adani in India and the bill, you are completely wrong, Senator Waters.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:29):  As you know, it is factually false to say that it has been rushed, this having now been in the parliament for four months. But, to answer your question, so far as I am aware, the first approach came from the National Native Title Council through Mr Kelly. That is the first approach that I am aware of. I am also aware of the Premier of Queensland, Ms Palaszczuk's, letter to the Prime Minister asking that the problem be dealt with urgently, which I think, if my memory serves me correct, was by a letter dated 6 February.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (10:30):  Minister, you said this morning that stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that section 31 agreements could be challenged. Can you explain to the Senate why section 31 is of concern and why you have raised that this morning?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:30):  Well, I have not actually raised that. This is what I said about section 31, Senator McCarthy—and let me read it to you again:


One further matter raised by the committee which I want to comment on is the status of what are known as section 31 agreements under the Native Title Act following the McGlade decision. Section 31 agreements are another way that agreements can be made under the act through the right to negotiate procedure. While the McGlade decision did not involve these types of agreements, stakeholders have raised concerns about the potential that these agreements could be challenged. However, as agreements made under the right to negotiate procedure have different requirements to ILUAs, the government will consider these matters further and will consider the ramification of McGlade on the right to negotiate procedure more closely with stakeholders before making amendments to the law.


That is what I said. So, Senator McCarthy, far from saying what you have attributed to me, I actually said the opposite: that the right to negotiate issue under section 31 are not the subject of this bill but will be the subject of consideration when the government reviews in a more holistic way the Native Title Act, as we have foreshadowed we will do.

Senator BRANDIS

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:32):  No. What we are doing is we are legislatively reversing the McGlade decision, and that is all we are doing. In the course of debate on this bill, other issues have been raised which go way beyond its scope—one of them being the right to negotiate provisions of the act. And, as I have said, that is not part of this bill, because it is not necessary to its purpose. But there is a view—certainly a view that was expressed to Senator Scullion and me by the native title representative groups at our meeting on 27 April—that a broader, more comprehensive review of the act was desirable. The government accepts that point of view. That will involve many issues, including the section 31 issue. That is the work of another day, but it is not part of this bill.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:33):  I think it is fair to say that the McGlade decision changed the playing field and put at legal risk ILUAs in which native title claimants and, indeed, all parties to the ILUAs have proceeded on the basis that they were on a sound legal footing. As a result of McGlade, some of them were put at risk for reasons that you understand. Therefore, the government's immediate focus, urged by, in particular, the native title claimants, was to restore certainty following the McGlade decision. That is the narrow, surgical focus of this bill. A broader review of provisions of the Native Title Act may very well be desirable but is the work of another day.

A lot of people have made remarks in this debate which are, frankly, irrelevant to the McGlade decision, whether out of an imperfect understanding of the way the act works or for the sake of making mischief, or for whatever reason. But the narrow focus of this bill is the McGlade decision. And that does not require reform of section 31.

You asked me how many were pending; you asked me how many were affected. That information is relevant to the process by which the government approaches this legislation. But, now, you are asking me about the content of particular ILUAs. I am not in a position to tell you that. It is not something that I know—the Commonwealth not being a party to the ILUAs.

The other point I would make to you, Senator Waters, and you as a lawyer should know this, is that this particular ILUA is currently the subject of pending proceedings in the Federal Court. Whether or not the assertion you make is one of the issues in those Federal Court proceedings, I am not aware of; but, for all I know, it could be.

On that matter, you are correct that it is before the Federal Court. I understand the hearing date is March of next year and that there are several grounds to that case, which Senator Dodson referred to earlier in his initial contribution as well. The Prime Minister promised Mr Adani that he would fix the native tile issue. This bill is seeking to fix a small aspect, but is it not the case that there are multiple prongs in that litigation before the Federal Court by the W&J mob and that even if this bill does succeed, thanks to Labor rolling over and trashing Indigenous rights with this government's bill, that in fact the issue will not be fixed and that there will still be many other grounds before the court such that a registered ILUA could not be completed any time before March? Is the Prime Minister now going to tell Mr Adani that in fact he has not been able to 'fix' native title issues at all?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:44):  I want to make another attempt at understanding the government's logic with respect to the issue of extinguishment. During the Senate inquiry, we received a number of submissions that raised concerns about ILUAs that were agreed by the majority, not all the named applicants, as per the McGlade decision. Instead of this blanket approach to agreeing to all of the registered ILUAs, a number proposed that there should be a process to review them to make sure people are happy with those agreements. To my mind, this is germane to the discussion we are having, because they are proposing an alternative approach. I know for a fact that in the South West WA the extinguishment of native title is one of the issues for the people who are opposing the ILUAs in the South West. They are concerned that they have to give up extinguishment over, admittedly, rather smaller areas of land, but that is one of their key concerns. To my mind, if not to yours, this is an important issue, because these may be the agreements that people would particularly like to have a look at. The fact that they are included here means it was not a consensus decision to extinguish native title. Some people see that as a threshold—I am not saying everybody, but some people do. That is why I do not understand, when you actually have pulled out the information, you cannot give us a list. We know there is one in Queensland, which has to do with transport corridor, as I understand it, but what are the others? That is why it is important. This goes to the heart of what many people are concerned about.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:46): Senator Brandis, you know very well that there are disputes over that, and I know where the South West Land and Sea Council stand. I have a lot of sympathy for their argument. In fact at the inquiry, they raised concerns that it did not go far enough for them. They have to go through that application process, which you have just articulated, again. Yes, they agree, but they want it to go further. I know they have some issues there, but they do want to see the passage of the bill. I also know very strongly, because I have spoken to people, and they are the groups of claimants who took the court case in the first place. 


To answer my question by simply quoting the South West Land and Sea Council does not answer my question at all. You know very well we are here right now is because of the group of people who took the action in the Supreme Court in the first place, and that is now the McGlade decision. You know very well that there is a group of people who do not agree with where we are at in the South West of WA. I am not seeking to prosecute that argument here, but I am using it as a clear example of claimants' concerns about the extinguishment of native title. It is one of the key issues that has been raised with me as the reason they do not agree. As I said, I am not seeking to prosecute that discussion here—it is not my place to do so. I am raising it as an example of why extinguishment of native title is a really important issue, when there has not been a consensus decision on it.

There may be particular disputes among the South West Land and Sea Council, but I am not aware of them. That may very well be the case, but it is not relevant. The only question before the chamber at the moment is whether this bill should be passed, and the representative body of those people has asked the government to introduce this bill—we have done so—and the parliament to deal with it urgently.

You are swapping from a consensus view that is currently in the Native Title Act to a majority view. It is no wonder we are at odds; you do not even understand the term 'consensus' by the sound of it. There is not consensus. The south-west claimants are not the only ones who do not consent to this bill. But let's go back to the question that I asked: why do you not know—when this is one of the key issues at the heart of people's concerns—about the extinguishment of native title. I think there are many people who want to know which ILUAs extinguished native title.

Of those eight ILUAs that were pending registration which this bill seeks to validate despite the fact that they may not have unanimous support by the registered native title claimants, at least two of the mining companies involved are Fortescue and Rio Tinto.

During the course of my meeting with Mr Forrest I have no recollection of any discussion of anything other than the question of human slavery. I put that on the record for the sake of completeness because I have had one meeting with Mr Forrest during the time in which this bill has been before the parliament. We did not discuss the bill; we discussed human slavery.

Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017




(Government)



(3) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (line 26), after ""native"", insert ""title"".


That merely corrects a typographical error in item 9 of the schedule, the omission of the word 'Title' so that it would read 'Native Title' as it was plainly intended to read.


Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:02):  I move government amendment on sheet ZA431. 


(1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (after line 26), after subitem (1), insert:


   (1A) This item also applies if:


   (a) paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) apply to an agreement; and


   (b) the agreement was not an indigenous land use agreement (within the meaning of that section) only because:


      (i) if there was only one registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area—none of the persons who comprised that registered native title claimant was a party to the agreement; and


      (ii) if there was more than one registered native title claimant in relation to land or waters in the area—for any registered native title claimant, none of the persons who comprised that registered native title claimant was a party to the agreement; and


   (c) the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017.


Since the bill's introduction, the Cape York Land Council has advised the government of a small number of ILUAs that were made and registered when none of the members of the registered native title claimant were a party to the ILUA. These agreements are small in number and are the result of circumstances where it may not have been possible or indeed appropriate to obtain the signatures of the members of the registered native title claimant. I have been advised that this practice was confined to very limited situations such as where all members of the registered native title claimant were deceased or where they were not the right people to be party to agreements over a certain area of land in the claim—that is to say, it was not appropriate for them to speak for that part of the country.


One of these agreements, the Western Cape Communities Co-Existence Agreement, was entered into back in 2001 at a time when practice in relation to the negotiation and registration of ILUAs was developing. This agreement has provided and continues to provide considerable benefits to the Indigenous people of Cape York. It would be a significant detriment to these people were this agreement to be invalidated. All of these agreements were accepted for registration by the National Native Title Tribunal and were subject to the usual objections process following lodgement for registration.


The government therefore believes it is important to give effect to requests from the Cape York Land Council to validate these ILUAs. The bill now includes an additional round for application of the retrospective validation provisions where an agreement had been registered on or before 2 February 2017 but no members of the registered native title claimant were party. The measure is confined to retrospectively validating only those agreements that have been already registered and therefore would have been through the rigorous authorisation and objection processes set out by the act. The bill will not validate agreements without signatures where the agreement is under negotiation or not yet registered, and should not be taken to indicate the way in which agreements will be made in the future.

 (Western Australia) (11:04):  I made my comments fairly clear, I think, in earlier comments. I just note that the Cape York agreements are very much according to customary laws that pertain to the people involved here. Such matters are vital to the nature of native title itself. Obviously, the law under the Western system has required these amendments that are to be made necessary in order to validate those agreements that were done in good faith and under customary law arrangements, as I understand it.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:16):  The point at the heart of this amendment, as I understand it, is that you have nine agreements that relate to Cape York—the one claim—and, due to the process by which Cape York deals with native title, they were not signed by any of the named applicants. I am trying to work out the period during which this occurred because I have some questions as to the process that occurred.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:17):  I am advised that the way I have described it was the way in which, by custom, this was done in Cape York. I am at pains to make this point: this particular amendment was requested specifically by the Cape York Land Council. The government accepted the Cape York Land Council's request that, in order to protect the interests of the people whom they represent, the bill be amended in this way, which is why we have included it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:18):  I do understand the rationale and I have some sympathy for the way that Cape York has addressed and does address native title decision-making and agreement-making. We went through some of that during the inquiry. What we did not do during the inquiry was go through these issues, because they were not raised at the time by the Cape York institute when we were discussing the amendments. If you read their submission to the inquiry, they actually took quite a different approach. Through that original submission, they did not agree to this legislation. In fact, they are one of the organisations, if I remember the submission correctly, who were saying that you needed to look more specifically at some of the agreements as to whether they should be revisited or not. As I said, I have some sympathy for the way they make decisions and the approach they have taken. However, the point here is that, with no named applicants, they clearly do not even meet the majority approach under Bygrave. In fact, at least one of these agreements was made way before Bygrave.


So before that decision was taken that the majority could sign on—that is what the Bygrave decision was, that you could go with the majority—at least one, if not more, of these agreements were made. They were made way before that interpretation was put into effect—that is my understanding of the situation. How, with all the goodwill in terms of the way that Cape York run their processes, could the register be clearly inconsistent with the act? That has been happening for a significant period of time. How did that occur? Was this flagged at the time? I understand that this relates to some time ago; I am not having a go at the government. I want to know how this process could have occurred when, as I understand it, there was not even an interpretation at the time that no named applicants could sign.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:20):  I am advised that the answer is they were signed by representatives of the members of the clan group as their agents. That is the answer to your question.


You seem to me to be raising a question of the legal validity of some of these ILUAs. I cannot speak to that, but if there were to be such a question then that is a matter for the courts.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:21):  The ILUAs were authorised and registered through the appropriate registration process. I cannot speak to the formal requirements of the National Native Title Tribunal in accepting ILUAs for registration, but they were formally registered. The Cape York Land Council, which exists to protect the interests of members of claimant groups, have asked that this amendment that be included in the bill in order to protect their interests. You are asking me about historical processes about which I am not in a position to advise you.

I understand the issues that have been raised, but the fact is that it was not consistent with the law. How can we be confident that none of these other ILUAs are in the same situation, where maybe the registrar made up their own rules about what they would or would not accept?

But I am advised that the manner in which this was done was that representatives or agents, acting on behalf of members of the claimant group, caused the registration to be effected and that was accepted by the tribunal. It is not right to say that there were no named applicants. I am advised that there were, but the signatories on their behalf were representatives signing on their behalf. That was accepted by the registrar as being sufficient compliance with the provisions of the act.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:23):  Attorney, can I just clarify this? I think you have said it twice, but from the way this debate is proceeding I perhaps am not sure of my hearing. Is it a fact that the Cape York Land Council, who I know to be to be made up of very responsible and intelligent people, have looked into this very carefully—looked into it with the best interests of not only clan groups from Cape York but all those affected by native title legislation? They have looked into this very carefully. They have asked for this particular amendment—I am sure you have said that three times already. The debate is being dragged out for reasons that I do not understand and there seems to be questioning of the ability or the authority of the Cape York Land Council to deal with this amendment and to make the request or to consult with you on the amendment.


What might have happened in years gone by is, I am sure, interesting for the history books. I am sure if it were relevant to this amendment then those at the Cape York Land Council and, indeed, those at the Native Title Council would have all fully considered this. They obviously do not think this interesting sojourn into past history is of any relevance to matters today, to matters relating to this bill, and to the interests of Indigenous people right around Australia, because I am sure if they thought these were relevant, if they thought it were necessary for this parliament to go into past history, then they would have raised that with you. I am assuming that they have not, but I seek your confirmation again that this is an amendment that the Cape York Land Council—intelligent, capable people themselves—have asked for and are desirous of seeing passed through this parliament at the earliest possible time.

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:26):  Yes, Senator, that is correct. I met with the representatives of the Cape York Land Council on 27 April. That was part of the non-consultation that has been alleged. They requested this amendment of me. An amendment to meet their wishes was prepared and shared with them for careful study. That was another aspect of the non-consultation that was said to have occurred or the consultation that was said never to have occurred, and the Cape York Land Council have asked, as part of the failure to consult them, the government to amend the bill in this way, and the government has agreed, which is why this government amendment is being moved. This is part of the absence of the consensus that has been pointed to by the Greens. So every native title council in Australia was consulted and every single one has agreed to this bill, and, particularly in relation to the Cape York Land Council who particularly asked for this very amendment to protect the interests of their people, this is the amendment they asked for that I am moving.

Ultimately, I do understand that you agreed to amend the original amendment that you proposed here, but I think it is clear, certainly from the correspondence that I received, that there was concern from other representative bodies about this approach. I will accept that they ultimately agreed—I understand, with some reluctance—to the amendments that you subsequently made to the original amendment.

You say 'reluctance' on the part of the Northern Land Council.

I would like to go back to the question that I asked and the points that I raised earlier. I understand the Cape York decision-making process. They explained it, and I have a lot of sympathy for it. But the fact is that it does not meet the requirements of the legislation at the time. How many of these agreements—not just Cape York but others—had representatives sign onto them as part of the majority?

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:29):  I do not seek to prolong this. I want to get these answers; and I am not going to get these answers. It is clear that these agreements, for all the goodwill in the world, did not meet the provisions of the Native Title Act. That is why you are having to validate them in this way. A 'representative of the named applicant'? How many other times has a 'representative of the named applicant' signed on?


I am not having a go at Cape York about this; I am having a go at the fact that these were registered in the first place. We cannot be confident that there was not some other interpretation used for some of the other agreements that have been registered. It is not just about Cape York; it is about all of them and in what other circumstances this has occurred. That is why people are concerned. That is why we remain concerned about this blanket agreement supporting all these ILUAs. These were not consistent with the law. I acknowledge that there was probably goodwill on most of them, but we do not know. That is why we had a lot of sympathy and support for the submissions to the inquiry that said that we should be looking at these agreements in more detail rather than just signing them all off. Minister, I note that the piece of paper that you tabled—and thank you—says at the end:


This information was provided in good faith by the National Native Title Tribunal and should be treated as sensitive. A more extensive review of the ILUA register and each ILUA would need to be conducted to confirm these figures.


So, in other words, you cannot confirm that it is just 126. You cannot give me the list of those that extinguish native title.


We have at least nine agreements that we know that no registered claimants signed on to. Some had representatives sign on and there was one where the claimant, as I understand it, was deceased. That is why there are still so many questions over what you say is a really simple piece of legislation. It is not. That is why the Greens cannot support this agreement, despite having sympathy for the approach that the Cape York council takes in terms of one claim having representatives from the regions involved as named applicants and then getting specific traditional owners to sign off on some agreements. I understand that. There are too many open questions about how these were registered in the first place. They were not consistent with the law—however you want to spin it. That is why we cannot sign on to this amendment.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:33):  Senator Siewert, I note the point you make, and let me just respond to two respects. First of all, the list of 126 is the advice to the government of the Native Title Tribunal. They have included that reservation out of abundant caution, but that is their advice to the government of the number of ILUAs—126. That is the best advice and evidence we have.


Secondly, in relation to the question you raise about the registration of the Cape York ILUAs, the Native Title Act, as I am sure you know, provides for a procedure whereby an agreement will be registered if it appears to meet the formal requirements of the act, and that is a matter for the registrar. The registrar, plainly, by accepting these agreements, formed the view that they met the formal requirements of the act. That has never been challenged, so far as I am aware, in any court of law, which is the appropriate forum—not here—for such an argument to be made. In any event, I do not understand you to be suggesting otherwise. The Cape York Land Council, by urging the government to move this amendment, is merely looking after the best interests of the people of Cape York and particularly the native title owners. For that reason, I ask you to now allow the amendment to proceed to a vote.

  You can tell us more, Senator Brandis. You can tell us when you actually met with the Queensland Resources Council. Also, you have already said you discussed the Cape York situation. I am trying to work out when you found out about those amendments, because we did not know about those amendments when we had the Senate inquiry.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:39):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (1), (2) and (5) on sheet 8161 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (line 26), at the end of subitem (1), add:


; and (e) the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017.


(2) Schedule 1, item 9, page 5 (lines 30 to 32), omit “Without limiting subitem (2), if on or before 2 February 2017 the agreement was registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, then the”, substitute “The”.


(5) Schedule 1, item 12, page 7 (lines 13 to 16), omit subitem (1), substitute:


   (1) This item applies to an agreement if, if the agreement had been registered on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements on or before 2 February 2017, item 9 would have applied to the agreement except for the application of subitem 9(4).


We also oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:


(3) Schedule 1, item 10, page 6 (lines 11 to 27), to be opposed.


(4) Schedule 1, item 11, page 6 (line 28) to page 7 (line 11), to be opposed.


We are opposed to clause 10, which deals with validating the applications that are currently before the registrar—in other words, where agreements have been discussed, applications have been made and they are before the registrar. The Adani agreement is one of those. The other amendments there relate to the consequences that taking that section out have. Because these are counted as agreements they are also included under clause 9 in the bill, so we are amending that to address that situation. We are also amending clause 12 because it is a different situation for the south-west agreements. That is the basis of these amendments. We think that, if we take out of the process the Adani application and those pending agreements that are clearly not registered and clearly do not have consensus decisions, that would be a more satisfactory approach to dealing with the particular matters.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:41):  The government will be opposing these Greens amendments because their effect would be to confine the bill to registered agreements. Agreements that have been authorised by the entire claim group but not yet registered would be left out if the Greens amendments were to be accepted. The government does not accept that such agreements should be excluded from the bill. The government's approach respects the choices of Australia's traditional owners; the Greens' approach does not. I remind the chamber once again that the bill in the form in which it currently stands, with the government amendments recommended by the Native Title Council and particularly the Cape York amendment, is now the bill that native title owners have asked this parliament to pass.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (11:42):  Labor will be opposing these Greens amendments as well. For all the discussion I have heard about consultation with Indigenous peoples, I have no indication that these proposals have gone anywhere near the native title rep bodies. They have been put forward at the last minute in my view. They are beyond the scope of the agreed position that the Senate committee came to. The more important matter around extinguishment that I heard raised is a very important point of policy, but that is for another day. I certainly repudiate the allegation made against Labor that we are simply rolling over and trashing native title rights. We have stood up for native title rights and we will continue to do so. What I have heard in this debate is primarily about Adani and a coalmine, and that is a bit sad.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:43):  With all due respect, Senator Dodson, you know as well as I do that the timing on this is directly related to Adani. There are significant points of conflict around the Adani decision-making process. You heard the same arguments I did through the Senate inquiry, where there was very strong dispute about their decision-making process, specifically related to the Adani mine. I would have loved for this discussion not to be about Adani. In fact, the Native Title Council has raised the issue with the government. It is clearly on the record that it had been asking for some time before the McGlade case came up for this issue to be addressed.


What has pushed the government's buttons is Adani—let's make that clear. I am really regretful that the debate on this has had to centre on Adani, which is clearly the government's agenda. If we take this off, we take some of the heat out of that discussion. By not supporting this amendment gives the government one more way to support the Adani coalmine. Senator Macdonald was in here not long ago saying, 'Oh, they are talking about 600 more jobs in Townsville.' I for one know that we need more jobs—you cannot hold the portfolios I hold without knowing that—but killing the reef is going to kill a lot more jobs, and that is what this project will do. We can address that issue here and not facilitate the development and not go against the wishes of the majority. It is not just a minority of people in this case of Adani—there are really strong claims that this process was manipulated and that it does not have majority support. Take that off the table, and that is what this amendment does, and you take that argument somewhere else. I commend the amendments to the chamber.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments as moved by Senator Siewert on sheet 8161 be agreed to.



The CHAIR:  The question now is that item 10 of schedule 1 stand as printed.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:08):  Could I ask the minister how many of these ILUAs that are at risk or that will be regularised by this bill are in my state of Queensland? Attorney, you would appreciate me asking that, as I, like you, am a Queensland representative in this place. 


I should just mention that I had the pleasure of meeting with a large number of Indigenous people just last week—I forget when it was; Tuesday, I think—when the Adani corporation came to Townsville and made the official announcement that Townsville would be the headquarters of the Adani project. Of course, that was great news for Townsville, which is currently suffering the highest unemployment, I regret to say, around the country—more than 11 per cent. Youth unemployment is unreasonably and unconscionably high. 


This announcement by Adani of anywhere up to 600 new jobs—as I understood them—being created just in the headquarters in Townsville was great news for Townsville. I have to say that I do not always agree with the Labor Mayor of Townsville, but the Labor Mayor of Townsville was totally involved in the announcement and very pleased. The Queensland government was there, represented by the Premier of Queensland—of all people—and some of her ministers, all lauding Adani for establishing their headquarters in Townsville and going ahead with this project that will mean so much to all Queenslanders, particularly Indigenous people. I had the pleasure, at a little function after the announcement, of sitting with a group of Indigenous people. Some of them lawyers— 




Senator Siewert:
  And the question is? 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I have raised the question. I thought, Senator Siewert, that you had asked a series of question, most of which you had already asked at the committee hearing that you attended, so you are simply re-asking the same questions; for what purpose, I do not know. I thought I heard you make— 




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Macdonald, please address your comments to the chair. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you. Yes, quite right, Chair. I thought I heard Senator Siewert make quite lengthy statements earlier in this debate; yet, it seems to be, as always, that there is one rule for the Greens, one rule for Senator Siewert and a different rule for everybody else. I would have thought it was important for this debate for senators to understand that Indigenous people are totally behind this amendment and, as an aside might I say, behind the Adani project. But this is not about Adani; this is about a wider thing. Hence, my question to the minister about how many of these Indigenous Land Use Agreements are at risk in Queensland because, Attorney, as I know you know—but I will repeat for other senators who do not—Indigenous people in the area supported this Adani proposal very strongly, almost unanimously. They are very keen to see this particular piece of legislation passed. In fact, last week in Townsville the National Native Title Council met. Whilst I was not party to the meeting, I understand from talking to people that they are all very, very keen. There were a lot of representatives and a lot of Indigenous lawyers there, and they were all saying to me: 'When are you going to get this through? Because we need this. We need this for our people.' They were very keen and very appreciative to the Attorney for acting so quickly. I think the McGlade decision was on 2 February. I know the Attorney introduced this bill on 15 February and it has taken us to the middle of June— 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Four months. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  four months, to get here. If it was something that people were wildly opposed to, if Indigenous people were widely opposed to it, one could understand why it might take four months to get to this particular state of being, but I understand that the Labor Party and certainly the Labor Party in Queensland—Premier Palaszczuk and her ministers—are all totally in support of this amendment and always have been. Clearly, if the Labor Party, the coalition and One Nation are so much in favour of this, it amazes me that it has taken us four months to get to this stage where we are almost ready to pass a piece of legislation that has all but the unanimous support of this chamber. People can make their own opinions on the motives of those who have delayed it until this time. I simply come back to my question: Attorney, it is very important for Queensland to know how many of these Indigenous Land Use Agreements will be regularised or confirmed—or whatever the terminology is—when, as appears likely, this amendment is passed.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (12:47):  It is great to raise a couple of important local issues today in the Senate. I was grateful to have the chance to attend the graduation ceremony recently for the first cohort of Project Booyah participants. This is run by the Canberra PCYC. Project Booyah has been funded by the coalition government to help young people build a better life for themselves. Many of the people who were part of Project Booyah did not finish school and have had trouble finding work or getting their drivers licence. We have invested nearly half a million dollars into Project Booyah, and it is definitely money well spent. Young people who went through this program have more confidence, have increased life skills and have their drivers licences, which help them find jobs. Many are now also enrolled in various training courses through the local CIT.


Canberra PCYC have been doing great work for nearly 60 years, engaging with young people to give them assistance and training to help them deal with the challenges that life throws up. It is the commitment of Cheryl O'Donnell, Canberra PCYC Executive Manager, and her team, including the Project Booyah youth mentors who work closely with participants, that makes this program such a great success. This program was part of the Safer Streets initiative and not only makes our community safer but makes young people better equipped to reach their potential and make a great contribution to our city and to our nation.


I would also like to note that presiding over this ceremony was former ACT MLA Jayson Hinder, who some time later tragically passed away in a road accident overseas. He did great work with the PCYC and served the people of Canberra well as a MLA. My sincere condolences go to his family, his friends and all of his loved ones.


On another issue, I recently had the opportunity to visit the Belconnen men's shed and hear about the great work they are doing to support men in our local community. The men's shed allows men to come together and share their skills for the benefit of the community, and, of course, for each other. Inside the Belconnen men's shed you will find men making furniture, restoring bikes for a local school, fixing lawnmowers or making a cubby house for a local children's charity. You will also find tea bags, coffee cups and an area where the men can sit and talk. Men's shed allows them to be real, honest and open about where they are in life's journey, and, by doing that, get support and encouragement. I would like to thank Gordon Cooper and the men from the Belconnen men's shed for sharing their stories with me. I would like to thank them for all they do in our community, and the way they support each other and contribute to their community.


Last month I had my first meeting this year of the Youth Advisory Council. I formed my Youth Advisory Council in 2014 to better inform me of the biggest issues facing young people in Canberra. Students from a range of different schools in the ACT have already taken part and learnt valuable skills to develop their future career and study plans. Council appointments are for one year and provide opportunities for engagement and roundtable discussions. Each year I seek applications for new members of the council to take it forward. I have a number of outstanding young people who are contributing this year. I look forward to working with these outstanding young Canberrans throughout the year. I would like to thank the outgoing members of the council for their engagement in its work and their dedication to causes important to young people in Canberra.


Over the past few months I have been meeting with the local community to hear about particularly dangerous roads in the ACT, and as chair of the ACT blackspot committee, I work to allocate funding to roads which are identified by the community as being in need of urgent upgrade. Last year through the program the ACT received $2.4 million to fix roads and intersections in Canberra that see a lot of accidents. Most of us would have seen the benefits of this funding as we drive down the Tuggeranong Parkway and see the animal fencing and the new lighting. This was just one of a number of projects in 2016. This year we have new projects being undertaken in Lyneham, Isabella Plains, Braddon, Greenway, Kingston, Tuggeranong and Forrest. On average, fixing these areas reduced crashes by around 30 per cent, so I am delighted to be a part of a government that can make sure these much needed upgrades occur. I say to members of the community that we are always interested in their feedback so that we can get in front of black spots before, perhaps, we see those serious accidents, particularly those fatal accidents.


As Canberra paused to remember the sacrifices made by our service personnel on Anzac Day, it was fantastic to see such strong support for this year's Pollie Pedal. Each year members of parliament go on this bike tour to raise funds for a specific cause. I have had the opportunity to be a part of it over the past couple of years. This year the partner was Soldier On, who work with current and former service men and women to help them through their reintegration to civilian life. Their work focuses on both physical and mental health and supports those who have served with Army, Navy, Air Force, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the AFP and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. Since it began in 1998, Pollie Pedal has raised over $5 million for organisations including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Ronald McDonald House, Youth Insearch, the Paralympic Games and Carers Australia. This year over $400,000 was raised for Soldier On—a wonderful organisation. Well done to all of those who made the donations, and also those who participated in the Pollie Pedal and put this money towards such good cause.

… what the Turnbull government is committed to doing is to put the climate wars behind us …


Reports today revealed that approximately 30 coalition MPs fought against support for the Finkel review in yesterday's coalition party room, with 10 MPs vehemently opposed to a push away from coal-fired power and about 20 MPs expressing serious misgivings. Isn't it clear that the climate wars the minister referred to are in fact being waged within the coalition party room?

  As Senator Cormann wisely interjects, we should not believe everything we read in the newspapers—unless, of course, it is NewsWeekly; I am sure, Senator Farrell, you and I would both believe everything we read in NewsWeekly! I actually happened to be at that meeting yesterday afternoon.



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am about to tell you what happened. I will tell you precisely what happened. We had a very good and intelligent discussion about the Finkel report. That is what we had. My colleague and friend Josh Frydenberg, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, gave a very detailed presentation complete with a slide show explaining the conclusions and the analysis of the Finkel report, and then we had quite a long meeting in which a number of colleagues asked questions about the Finkel report and made some observations about it. And that is the way we do policy in the coalition.


First of all, we find out what the evidence is. Then we engage the relevant experts. Then we publish their findings. Then we have a discussion about the matter so that all members of the coalition party room, representing all the different parts of Australia, can have their views heard. That is precisely what we did. It was an extremely useful exercise. I even learned some things that I did not know before, and I am delighted we had such a good discussion.

What the Prime Minister is concerned to do and what he did last night was to chair a useful, constructive discussion led by Mr Frydenberg, who is a very accomplished expert in this field, based on the Finkel report, which was prepared by Australia's Chief Scientist—not, by the way, at the request of this government but at the request of COAG, of governments of both political persuasions, of all the governments of Australia. And we had a discussion about the Finkel report. Questions were asked of Mr Frydenberg by a number of colleagues. A number of different perspectives were brought to bear. Many people spoke and, as a result of that discussion, everyone in the room, I would make bold to say, felt they had a better understanding of the issues than they had when they began.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:05):  Senator Farrell, what we saw last night from the Prime Minister was all about leadership—it was all about the Prime Minister leading the coalition in an intelligent, fully informed debate about a very difficult policy area which your side of politics has squibbed for years. Let us not forget, Senator Farrell, that you have proposed these unachievable emissions reduction targets with no plan, no policy whatsoever, to show how Australia will get there. We, in the coalition, are committed to resolving the 'trilemma' of affordable prices, security of supply and fidelity to our international commitments. We can do all three at once and, in making the policy choices we have to make, we will be informed by the wisdom of Dr Finkel.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator.Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the final report of the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market


Today, Senator Brandis told us how informed the party room discussion was yesterday—over five hours of debate. I have the slides from that meeting—the Finkel review into the future security of the National Electricity Market. It is apparent that Minister Frydenberg did provide quite substantial advice to the party room about the directions in which the government was hoping to go. It is a pity that the Attorney-General did not pay any attention to what those slides said or the advice that was tendered. When he was asked simple questions about the modelling that underpins the proposals that Dr Finkel has put forward, he was not able to come anywhere near answering a question. He is not interested in the slightest in the underlying assumptions of the government's program, which the government says is of critical importance to the future directions of the energy system in this country. 


The Labor Party have offered to work with the government because we understand how critical this is, given the failure of our political system to come to terms with the critical issues about the future of our energy system. What we have seen, of course, in the last day is that the government cannot even work within itself, let alone work across this parliament. It is not able to come to terms with its own backbench about these fundamental questions, despite the extraordinary advice that has been tendered. What we do know is that the modelling that was provided and released last night demonstrates the shambolic mess of the energy policy that has been advanced by those within the government who want to, in effect, stand against the realities of time and the whole notion of climate change and pretend that none of these developments are actually occurring within the world. 


Mr Abbott, in particular, is reported to have suggested that the clean energy target that has been proposed by Dr Finkel is a new tax on coal. Of course, it would be an entire farce if he had looked at any of the details. The Jacobs Group modelling, which underpins the report that the government itself released last night, shows that the business-as-usual proposition—of course, this government and, clearly, Senator Brandis demonstrate that the prime policy is do nothing, and the reality is that the hard Right of the Liberal Party takes the view that we do nothing—would actually undermine more quickly the question of the future of coal in this country. Under that model, the propositions that have been advanced by Dr Finkel are that there would be less electricity generated through coal by doing nothing than by advancing the position that has been put forward by Dr Finkel's review. The clean energy target suggests that we are able to provide a model whereby we could extend the life of baseload power generation in this country in a more rational way to see a more reasoned and careful reduction in the use of coal throughout the economy—an approach that would actually provide far greater protection for the security of this country, the security of the living standards of working people and the security of industry in a manner that would deliver the reliability of supplies to businesses and households and would produce, in my judgement, a better economic outcome for the country. 


But what has been said over there? There is a refusal to engage on an important principle that does require a bipartisan approach across this parliament from a government that is not even able to get agreement within its own party room about such fundamental principles. What we are seeing, of course, is that the knuckle draggers that have dominated this Prime Minister and forced him to turn his back on what have been his lifelong commitments on these issues are now seeking to dominate once again. The cost to the country from the bitterness and power games that are being played out is quite extraordinary and profound. It is important for the whole country to understand what is at stake and the fates that we are dealing with in terms of a proper approach to policy that meets the requirements of this country and would allow this parliament to move past the policy paralysis that has so completely undermined the capacity to attract new technologies and investments in the future of energy generation in this country. It is appalling to see the level of disquiet that has developed within this government because of the failure of their people, and the Liberal Party in particular, to face up to the realities of climate change and the real economic needs of this country.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:09):  I thank my colleague opposite for his contribution. I had the pleasure of visiting Germany, in fact the part that was the old East Germany, with my colleague, who proudly talked about the benefits of the socialist system over there. I had a great trip and I learnt a lot about the socialist republic there. One of the things about a free liberal pluralist democracy, such as we have here—particularly in the Liberal Party—is that rather than central control, we actually encourage people to bring a diversity, a plurality, of ideas to any debate. When we consider a topic, rather than people just lining up and accepting the direction from an external agency or a particular head of power, we encourage people to engage with it intellectually, to debate it and to come up with the best position for our nation. That is the basis upon which the Liberal Party and the National Party, in coalition, have governed. If you look back through Australia's history, many of the best developments in our nation have been developed through a robust process of engaging.


It is no different with the Finkel review. Dr Finkel clearly, as a senior scientist, has a very informed and important voice in this debate. As policymakers in this place representing our communities—the consumers of electricity, whether residential or industrial; the producers of electricity; and those people who are involved in the retailing of electricity—there is a range of voices that we need to consider in making decisions around the policy directions.


I come to this debate as somebody who has a background steeped in systems engineering as an experimental test pilot. I was deeply suspicious of the advertising brochures that were often proffered, in my case to the Defence Force I used to work for, saying why a new idea or a new product was going to be the best thing since sliced bread. One of the jobs in the test environment was to examine those claims based on the facts—to work out what are the constraints around this, what are the things we are trying to achieve, what is the performance—and then, based on transparent, quantifiable facts, to present a brief to the decision-maker to decide whether or not they should invest in that particular piece of equipment or the direction a modification might be going.


So as I come to this whole debate around energy, I look at it through a fairly simple prism of systems engineering, which is: we do have some constraints that we wish to meet. Our objective is to have low energy prices. One of the things that has kept Australia engaged in the international economy for decades is the fact we have been able to have low energy prices, which means our standard of living, driven off good wages and other things, has made us a First World country. But the low energy price has underpinned that, and so low energy cost has to be one of the key targets that we have.


Reliability is clearly another target. I am a South Australian. I was there in South Australia through some of the blackouts that we have had. Regardless of the trigger event for those blackouts, you need to look at the system from a systems engineering perspective. You need to understand the inputs, the outputs and the interconnections where the failure modes are of a system. What we have seen—again, Dr Finkel's report talks about this—is that renewables, whatever you think of them—whether you like them or loathe them, the fact is there are considerations around the nature of the supply of electricity interfacing with a system that was designed, built and established on baseload power that outputs at consistent frequency. This means there is additional engineering work, therefore cost, that is associated with integrating renewable energy into our network. One of the concerns I have to date is that ideology has pushed the rapid uptake and the subsidising of renewable energy without actually taking into account that additional engineering work, and that is one of the costs that should be borne by that sector if it is to proceed.


Clearly, the other objective we have is to meet emissions targets in terms of our international obligations. So put those three things together and what this report provides is an important voice into the discussion we need to have as a nation. First and foremost, we need to ask: how do we redesign a system that will provide reliable and affordable power while also working within the constraints of meeting our climate obligations? First and foremost, we need to be looking at ways we can have baseload power that is affordable and reliable. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:14):  Isn't it extraordinary that a sensible proposal that should have been taken seriously by the coalition party room is treated in this way? We have in our nation, as is well documented by the Finkel report itself, an energy crisis. We have increasing prices in our nation, as you can see in the very charts that were presented to the coalition party room just yesterday. That very presentation that you all would have listened to outlines very clearly that policy uncertainty is holding back new investment, resulting in higher costs and gas-fired generation setting the price more often. Here it is in your very own presentation.


We had from Senator Brandis this afternoon and, indeed, yesterday an absolute denial of the evidence and facts presented to his own party room. He refuses, as Senator Carr highlighted, to engage with even the basic evidence that is presented to his party room that is in the Finkel report itself. We have here documented evidence that went before the party room about how electricity prices are rising. We have evidence here that says a clean-energy target would indeed lower prices. We also have the evidence that shows it is the policy vacuum, the policy uncertainty that is driving energy prices up in our nation.


We have had in our nation a 90 per cent fall in energy investment and one in three renewable-energy jobs lost, and yet we see coming from the coalition a continued war on renewable energy. Instead of moving to solve our energy crisis, the crisis is within the coalition party room. They refuse to take responsibility for the policy uncertainty that is holding back investment and placing our energy systems in crisis.


The simple fact is we had in place under the Labor government a perfectly good mechanism that would have set certainty in place, enabled electricity prices to stabilise and come down and enabled the energy investment that we as a nation need to happen. Instead what we see is a policy vacuum and a policy crisis despite the fact that you have asked for policies. They are on the table, and you are riven by complete division and uncertainty. We have had Senator Brandis and Senator Fawcett defending their party room processes and the robustness of people expressing their views and having their voices heard. You seem to value those views in a way that is completely devoid of facts or evidence. Not all views are equal. Not all opinions are as important as other views. Why? Because they are not based on evidence. They are not based on research. Instead you are quite happy to accede to these voices. Why? Because your government is in crisis. Because you are trying to stabilise Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership.


There is incredible disquiet, as reported, in the coalition party room. It seems apparent that the backbench of the coalition wants to significantly modify the clean energy target as proposed. Why? Because you are into a descent away from evidence and facts and toward meritless opinions.


This is a sensible policy proposal that should have been taken seriously. We have a preferred policy position that is not the one that is on the table, but we can engage in effective discussion about the policy directions of this nation. But the simple fact is the climate wars in our nation are back in a civil war within the coalition party room. We have power prices up and pollution up. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:19):  I too rise to speak on this motion to take note of answers. For me, listening to question time today, it was the perfect demonstration yet again of why the Australian public is so disillusioned in all of us in this chamber. The questions from those opposite and what I have heard during this take note really highlight the divide between both sides of this chamber. First of all, Senator Pratt just said that not all views are equal. I have got to say, that again highlights the ideological difference between those opposite and those on this side. We on this side firmly believe that the views of all Australians matter, that they count, and not just those of the ideological left. All views count and that is absolutely replicated in our party room.


So not only am I happy to defend, along with my colleague Senator Fawcett, the process that we have gone through to date but I am actually very proud of it and I will tell you the reasons why. As we know, to do nothing on this critically important issue is not an option. Let's have a look at the process. COAG commissioned a review on this critically important issue of energy security by none other than our Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, and there was no better to undertake this review. I commend him and his team for the production of this report. There are 50 critically important recommendations for all of us in our party rooms and in this chamber to discuss.


The report was delivered to COAG on Friday. On Tuesday this week, we had a brilliant brief by Minister Josh Frydenberg, who I commend for his work in this very challenging policy area. We had a great brief, a very comprehensive brief. My colleagues got together again later that afternoon after we had had an opportunity to digest some more of the report. Yes, it was discussed. Yes, it was robust but it was respectful and comprehensive. This is absolutely no different a process than we have in our party room all the time. Unlike those opposite, unlike Senator Pratt, we believe every single voice in our community counts, as Senator Fawcett said. We represent quite a broad church in our party room but that is a strength, not a weakness as those opposite seem to assert. We have had a great robust discussion on the report. The government no doubt will go away and look further into the issues that have been raised in the party room and come back to the party room in due course unlike those opposite, who clearly spent their party room time yesterday discussing all of these great zingers, all of these great insults they can throw our way—knuckle draggers, ideologues, those sorts of things.




Senator Moore:
  Socialists!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Socialists? Absolutely, if the shoe fits! We on this side had a discussion of substance on security, affordability and reliability—the most important issue facing our nation at the moment—and on how we do all of that and still meet our emission reduction targets. Again, this was necessary because Labor and the Greens together with their ideological zealotry—words that have been used by those opposite—have actually made the power go out in South Australia. As Dr Finkel said, it has put us in a very precarious situation in energy security. That must be addressed.


While those opposite may not believe that every voice counts and may not have actually gone through and started to come up with substantive debating points, would it not be fabulous if tomorrow they actually came back into this chamber whether during in the MPI, question time or take note and actually started asking questions about the substance of the Finkel report? Bring questions about the recommendations for security, for affordability, for reliability, about meeting our international targets instead of throwing insults at us. How fabulous would that be for our democracy if those opposite actually came in and discussed the issues of substance rather than throw insults at us? But sadly, I am very confident that they will not do it. Those opposite will come in tomorrow and will repeat the same zingers and insults at those of us on this side rather than raise issues of policy. I think this country is all the worse for that lack of ability of those opposite to come in here and debate the issues and not try to debate the process. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  I also rise to take note of the answers from Senator Brandis on the Prime Minister's disastrous lack of climate change policy and the ongoing divisions in the Liberal and National parties over this fundamental issue. It is an issue that we must come to terms with and find a way forward on. The review by Australia's Chief Scientist gives us just that. The Chief Scientist proposes a mechanism—a clean energy target—which predicts lower electricity prices for consumers as well as investment certainty in our energy sector. Labor want to give this review and its recommendations a chance, but we need a respectful debate. That begins with all parties respecting the office of the Chief Scientist and examining his report and his recommendations without prejudice.


In my home state of Tasmania renewable energy has been fundamental to our economy for over half a century. Access to cheap hydropower has supported tens of thousands of jobs in heavy industry and will continue to do so for decades to come. Going forward it is vital that our energy and climate change policies provide the certainty industry needs to continue to make investment in Tasmania. What Tasmania needs is for Senator Abetz and the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team to represent the Tasmanian people's interests in the party room, to set aside their ideological positions and to actually examine the evidence. We must find a way forward because at present the energy policy uncertainty is driving up energy prices and is driving down investment in renewable energy.


I remind the Senate of the comments from the chief of staff to the Prime Minister Mr Abbott earlier this year. Ms Credlin famously confessed on Sky News that the coalition made the debate about the hip pocket rather than the environment. The cat has been belled, Mr Abbott. Your scare campaigns will not work anymore. Despite this revelation, there is a large rump of coalition members and senators who continue to push an incorrect, illogical argument that further renewable energy investments will drive up power prices.


Senator Brandis was asked by Senator Farrell about the status of the debate in the coalition. He claimed that the coalition considers the evidence and then engages in a debate. I put it to the Senate that, in fact, what we have seen take place is the coalition receive the evidence and receive some sensible recommendations and then the 21 of them completely ignore that in the party room meeting. Senator Back stood up at the conclusion of Senator Farrell's questions and added some commentary at the start of his question and said that he would now ask a serious question of the Attorney. What a farce the coalition government has become. How can questions about the government's lack of an energy policy not be serious? 


I note that Senator Back made today's papers as reportedly speaking against the Finkel review's recommendations in the party room yesterday. In the last parliament I travelled the country with Senator Back on the Select Committee on Wind Turbines. Senator Back's clear prejudice against renewable energy was on display during that inquiry and it was on display again today. Either the coalition is serious about finding a way forward on climate change and energy policy or it is happy to continue the old Abbott game of scare campaign first and Australia's future somewhere way behind.


Senator Gallagher then asked if the government was any closer to reaching a position on energy and climate change. Senator Brandis's response was telling. He said that doing nothing is not an option and that the government must take action without delay. Senator Brandis went on and on about the long discussion in their party room, but he could not outline if the coalition under Malcolm Turnbull is any closer to reaching a position. Of course, given the prejudice displayed by his own backbench, one who scoffs at questions in this place and another who reportedly said 'Finkel in its current form is dead', it is no wonder that Senator Brandis could not answer Labor's questions today.


We have industry and consumers crying out for a clear policy going forward and then we have a Liberal and National coalition engaged in the most self-absorbed debate within their own party room. Labor are offering to work with the government to find a middle ground here. We want to move beyond the years of division and set in place a credible low-carbon energy policy for Australia's future, for our children's future and for the betterment of this country. It is time that the government started to put aside the silly ideological arguments, look at the facts and look at how they can develop policy, and we are prepared to work with them in doing that.

PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION AMENDMENT (ADDRESSING INEQUALITY) BILL 2017


Economic inequality in Australia is on the rise.


The share of national income going to the top one percent of earners is now higher than it has been at almost any time in the last seventy five years. Over the past four decades, real earnings for the top ten percent have risen nearly four times faster than they have for the bottom ten percent.


Whilst it is true that this growing inequality has come against a backdrop of rising living standards for much of the Australian community, this should not alleviate our concerns. A deeply unequal society, as exists in some other countries, would be at odds with the ethos of egalitarianism that underpins Australia's national story.


Economic inequality, whether income or wealth inequality, can ultimately manifest itself as an unacceptable inequality of outcomes and opportunities for members of the Australian community.


Economic inequality can foreclose educational opportunities to talented children from


underprivileged backgrounds, and health care options to the elderly. It can lead to social dislocation as insecurity of work or housing forces parents to move frequently, and children to bounce between schools.


Furthermore, economists have identified a connection between the inequality of a society and its intergenerational mobility, a relationship dubbed the ""Gatsby Curve"". The more unequal a society, the less likely children are to be able to do better than their parents.


Economic inequality is not just a social justice issue - it is also a macroeconomic issue. Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and development (OECD) estimates that income inequality in the twenty years from 1985 to 2005 reduced economic growth in the OECD zone by almost five percent. Institutions including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have found that inequality can warp patterns of demand and consumption, and can prevent talented individuals from participating to their full extent in the economy, affecting productivity and growth.


The Productivity Commission (the Commission) should play a role in addressing this.


The purpose of the Productivity Commission Amendment (Addressing Inequality) Bill 2017 is to empower the Commission to improve the quality of information and analysis available about economic inequality in Australia, and to ensure that proper consideration is given to inequality in the public debate about economic policy


It does this in two ways.


First, the Bill establishes inequality as a mandatory consideration for the Commission.


It should be noted that inequality has not been ignored by the Commission. Its reports often contain analysis on inequality, and it has produced standalone research on income distribution in Australia.



However, it is important that responding to inequality is fixed as a permanent and inescapable part of the mandate of the Commission. The Commission is more than just an advisory body. Its work helps set the national agenda, and is often relied upon as a basis for substantial policy changes. This was seen recently, for instance, with the reliance on the Commission's Report on Workplace Relations in the Fair Work Commission's 2017 decision on Penalty Rates. Consideration of inequality should be a part of its work.


A requirement to consider inequality would not be out of place in the Commission's governing legislation. Section 8 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998 as it presently stands sets out general policy guidelines for the Commission; including the considerations the Commission must have regard to in the exercise of its functions. These include a wide variety of social, environmental, and economic considerations, such as:


the need to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and the avoidance of social and economic hardships arising from those changes — s8(1) (d);


the need to promote regional development - s8(1) (g); and


the need to ensure that industry develops in a way that is ecologically sustainable — s8(1) (i).


The Bill adds a further consideration to this list: the need to mitigate the negative effects of inequality on the Australian economy and the Australian community.


Second, the Bill establishes a framework for the Commission to regularly research and report on economic inequality in Australia.


The timeline for the Commission to produce Inequality Reports is linked to the Intergenerational Reports that are produced every five years by the Parliamentary Budget Office. This because the release of the Intergenerational Report poses an opportunity for longer term thinking by the government and other participants in policy debates. Long term thinking and policy making on social issues would be helped by an understanding of the state of inequality in Australia.


An Inequality Report would have three key roles.


An Inequality Report would assess the extent of economic inequality in Australia. The Commission would be responsible for establishing reliable and consistent measures for economic inequality. These measures should together be capable of describing the different dimensions of economic inequality, such as geography, gender, age, and other relevant dimensions. Regular and sound measurement is essential if inequality is to be addressed. Not only can governments struggle to respond effectively if the problem is not measured, but the community at large may remain unware of the extent of the problem all together.


An Inequality Report would also assess the effects of economic inequality on different aspects of Australia's society and economy. As discussed earlier, there is a connection between inequality and growth. In producing its report, the Commission would consider the extent to which economic performance has been affected by inequality. Economic inequality also presents across multiple vectors of disadvantage. In practice, economic inequality means inequality of social, educational and other outcomes and opportunities. The Commission would consider these effects of economic inequality, as well as considering how economic inequality affects intergenerational mobility.


Finally, an Inequality Report would assess the effect of existing government programs on economic inequality. Consideration and evaluation of existing policy setting is a critical part in the policy development cycle.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:43):  At the request of Senators Bilyk and Brown today, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that the Government cut all 27 Australian Federal Police (AFP) staff from Hobart International Airport in the 2014-15 Budget, leaving Hobart as the only capital city airport in Australia without an AFP presence;


(b) further notes that the Government in the 2017-18 Budget locked in a $184 million funding cut to the AFP over the forward estimates, and formalised the reduction of 150 staff in the upcoming year alone – no funding was provided for the restoration of staff in Hobart;


(c) acknowledges that concerns have previously been raised by the Tasmanian Government, Tasmania Police, and the Police Union about the withdrawal of the AFP in Hobart and that Tasmania Police want the presence restored; and


(d) calls on the Government to explain why it believes that Hobart International Airport is the only capital city airport in Australia which does not require an AFP presence, explain the factual basis for its decision to withdraw those police, and outline the steps that it is taking to ensure safety and security at Hobart International Airport is not compromised.

 (Tasmania) (15:44):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator ABETZ:
  I thank the Senate. AFP resources were withdrawn from Hobart airport in 2014 following a review by the relevant department, not a budget cut as falsely asserted in the motion. This mirrors the decision in 2011 to withdraw the AFP's presence from Alice Springs Airport, which occurred under Labor. 


Our national security situation is under constant review and assessment. If the risk profiles change, security settings will change accordingly. The Tasmanian Liberal Senate team has continually monitored the need for an AFP presence with the minister's office. Just last week the AFP advised the government that the risk profile for Hobart has, thankfully, not changed. The AFP is an operational agency and deploys their resources depending on the threat assessment. The government has full confidence in the AFP's assessment.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-14,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:31):  There is a need to limit the number of new dwellings purchased by foreign investors. In Australia there is no limit on the number of new dwellings which can be purchased by foreign investors. There is no way of knowing how many residential properties are owned by foreign investors. We do know that foreign investors are seeking to buy new dwellings in ever-increasing numbers, because each year more and more approvals are sought by the Foreign Investment Review Board. Let me just explain: in 2012-13 it was 4,499; in 2015-16 it was 26,052. In a four-year period, from 2012 to 2016, foreign investors were given approval to purchase 62,440 properties. A fee of $5,000 is paid for each approval, making it very likely that these approval numbers do represent properties purchased. In 2014-15, foreign investors were given approval to purchase 17.5 per cent of all new property in New South Wales, and over 15 per cent in Victoria. It is not unreasonable to suggest that in areas of Sydney and Melbourne the percentage of new dwellings being bought by foreign investors is likely to be 30 to 40 per cent, displacing many Australians wanting to buy in these areas.


I have asked the Treasury about the policy intent that underpins the unlimited sale of new residential property to foreign investors. They tell me that allowing foreign investors to buy as many new homes as they like increases the supply of new homes and creates jobs in the construction industry. Well, these are bureaucrats gone absolutely mad. These people who live in Canberra can probably have their homes. They have no relevance to people in Sydney or Melbourne who cannot buy homes in their own cities, where they have grown up as children and where they wish to be around family and friends. This is nonsensical, and it is ridiculous. Yes, I support the building industry, by all means, but not at the expense of Australians owning their own homes.


We know that the government no longer believes that story, because the government announced in the budget an annual vacancy charge. This charge will apply when a property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months each year. The charge is to be equal to the application fee at the time the property was acquired, which is currently $5,000. It is unclear how the new annual vacancy charge will operate. How will the government identify properties which are vacant for six months or more? How will the government maintain a current address for each foreign investor? And, if they do manage to have a current address, how will the government collect the penalty in a cost-effective way in foreign jurisdictions? My opinion of this, of what has been put before us, is that it is unworkable. It is not going to work out. The government will be chasing their tail. Of course, they will set up another administration and put on another 50 or 100 people at total cost to the taxpayer.


But I do agree with the government's plan to cap at 50 per cent the number of new dwellings a developer can sell to foreign investors. At least they are doing something about it, but under Labor in 2009 and I believe it was Minister Chris Bowen who said at the time: 'Oh, no, it will be all foreign investors. We'll allow you to build all these units, but you can sell the whole lot to foreign investors.' So now we have a situation, mainly in Melbourne, where you have these complexes that have been built and are totally foreign-owned. No-one lives in them, so it has just done Australians out of the opportunity of owning their own homes.


It is common knowledge that the housing shortage in Australia results from an imbalance between supply and demand. There is too much demand for housing due in part to foreign investors, as well as too little supply in areas where people need to live. So people have to move out of the place where they grew up. They need to work there and need family assistance when they have children and they want to be around friends. But these are the people who are being forced out their places because of foreign investors driving up the prices of housing. So they have been told to move out further. They are moving away from the places that they have grown up in, close to the work, and it is costing them more and more.


The government wants to increase the supply of new housing, but this plan avoids the need to deal with the underlying problem. Very few people are talking about the demand side of the housing problem, but I am going to. As a community, we do have the ability to reduce demand by slowing the rate of immigration into this country, and this is something I have advocated for a long time. A reduction in the number of migrants, together with changes in the ability of foreign investors to buy residential housing, would make a genuine difference to the lives of so many who would dearly love to buy a new or existing home.


The present rate of immigration is too high, at 190,000 annually. The figure should be reduced to around 100,000 until we can rebalance housing, jobs and infrastructure. We cannot provide sufficient quality housing at a price ordinary people can afford. This is evidenced in the alarming increase of homeless people on the streets and the number of families and children sleeping in cars in hospital car parks or where they feel safe.


The advocates of unlimited immigration through the humanitarian program or the points system show remarkably little interest in the Australians who already live here and are struggling. The Australian Greens want to open up our borders to anyone, but they always want others to pay. My suggestion to the Australian Greens is that they and their supporters take up sponsorship of the new settlers—take them into your homes, pay all their outgoings and do not burden other Australians.


The shortage of housing in Australia is a government-made problem and can be solved by government. The buck-passing between the federal government and the states needs to stop. What stops the government reducing the number of new migrants, refugees, 457 visa holders and those buying their way into this country? Their answer is: while our productivity remains low, the only way to grow the economy is to increase the size of the population. Well, they are wrong. Big businesses are the ones that will profit from this. They are the ones making money out of it, while Australians are queuing for housing, health, nursing homes and everything else that was available to them, even jobs. The federal government needs to be honest with the people of Australia and tell them the truth. The truth is that poor decision making by successive governments has led to a less productive economy than we might otherwise have had.


One Nation believes the shortage of housing for Australians would be improved by limiting foreign investors to one new property and making it illegal to sell an established home to a foreign investor. What we are advocating is that at point of sale, when you are wanting to buy an established house, you must present identification that you are a permanent resident or an Australian citizen entitled to buy an established house. You must sign on the contract, and that must match the name. That is then sent to the Foreign Investment Review Board and also sent to the immigration department. I do not believe that foreign students should be able to buy houses in Australia. They are entitled to, but a lot them do not sell the houses when they leave the country. The Australian dream is to own your own home, and I will continue my fight to give that opportunity to every Australian.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:39):  I had a look at One Nation's policy in relation to housing and to say that it is a scant policy would be overselling the position. Senator Hanson talks about One Nation working for the people. If you were actually serious about housing policy, you would support many of the policies Labor has put forward to deal with housing issues. To simply come in here and run a rant against foreign investment, when it is not the biggest housing policy issue that this country is facing, just demonstrates what One Nation are about. They are about division and they are about pushing a line that plays to the lowest common denominator in this country. They do not have a clue about dealing with housing policy.


On 21 April, Labor announced a tranche of policy which is about trying to deal seriously with the issue and not just using it as some attack on migration and on foreigners, playing to the lowest common denominator within Australia. We have a comprehensive package of policies on housing and we will continue to develop our housing policy leading up to the next election. There is a crisis for many young people in this country who are trying to buy a home and set up a home for the future. The housing crisis is only getting worse. You look at the skyrocketing prices in places like Melbourne and Sydney and other places around the country and you wonder how some young kids are ever going to get into a home. Home ownership is at 60-year lows and home ownership rates for 25- to 34-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the past 30 years. Rental stress is also on the rise, with the proportion of low-income households in rental stress now at more than 40 per cent. So 40 per cent of people who cannot own their own home and are renting a home are in rental stress. To pay the rent they are not putting food on the table; they are not getting the kids new shoes when they need new shoes. These are the practical issues that, surely, One Nation, if they claim they are working for the people, should be addressing. But, no, let's go for the easy hit, and that is foreign investment, and let's never develop a policy that actually goes to the real issues—that is One Nation.


Only a Labor government will tackle housing affordability. We are building on our existing proposals with new policies to improve affordability, increase housing supply, boost jobs and reduce the economic risks associated with distorted investment decisions. Any housing affordability package that does not involve reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts is an absolute sham. Unless One Nation start to adopt those types of policies, then their argument that they stand up for working people in this country will, like many of their policies, be shown to be nothing more than a sham. Labor's plan involves a number of issues. Firstly, we want to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. Why should investors, backed by taxpayers' funds, be able to lock out young people trying to get their first home? We just do not think it is right and we have taken a strong position on that. We also want to limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds. Rich people with millions of dollars in superannuation are using those superannuation funds to invest in housing and, again, locking people out of the housing market who are simply in there trying to buy a home—especially first homebuyers.


We would facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities. We would increase foreign investor fees and penalties. We think that is an issue, but we do not think it is the basis of a housing policy. We think it is an issue we should deal with, but it cannot be the key issue in any housing affordability package.


We would establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. But we realise that a bond aggregator on its own will not bridge the gap between the investment and returns that are needed to build more affordable housing. We will have more to say about that in the lead-up to the next election. Simply, we accept that the bond aggregator is a positive step but that on its own it is not enough.


We would boost homelessness support for vulnerable Australians. If One Nation say that they stand up for Australian working people, why are they not asking the federal government: 'Why have you taken $44 million a year out of support for low-income housing? And support for women who are trying to get away from domestic violence?' Why would they be silent on that and simply come here and do a 10-minute speech on foreign investment when that is not the key issue that is driving rental stress and problems for working families in this country?


We would also argue that we would get better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement. There is $1.3 billion going into the National Affordable Housing Agreement every year. We would deal with that in the context of getting better results out of that money that is put into place—more accountability from the states. These are all complex issues, but issues that anyone who knows anything about the housing affordability problem would be dealing with. You would not come in here and just run us a racist line about foreign investment.


We would also re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and reinstate a minister for housing. The National Housing Supply Council, when it is up and running, would be able to give advice to government about how to deal with some of these issues in a more comprehensive and sophisticated way. It would actually do the analysis about what is causing the hikes in house prices and come up with policy that assists government to deal with that issue.


We would also reinstate a minister for housing. When the coalition came out with this so-called package of housing at the last budget, people around the country who are dealing with this issue basically dismissed it as being ineffectual and not dealing with the key issues. We certainly believe that the Foreign Investment Review Board rules currently apply a range of restrictions on foreign purchasers of property in Australia, but that is not the key issue. It is not the key issue—the key issue is the tax benefits that rich Australian get, supported by poorer Australians' tax, to go in and run negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. That is one of the fundamental issues. A young person goes into a bidding game against someone who is getting the support of government through negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, and they have absolutely no chance of winning that bidding war.


Again: when these rich people are using self-managed super funds to then boost their capacity to outbid young Australians to buy a home, that is a problem. I am sure we will hear the arguments that this is all about allowing firies, police and teachers to invest. The reality is that the bulk of the benefits from negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions go to some of the richest Liberal seats in the country. They do not go to National Party seats where people are battling. They do not go to battling Labor Party seats. They go to the richest seats in the country. Unless we deal with that unfair advantage, then coming in here and arguing about foreign investment does nothing for working families in this country.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:49):  I think there is one issue on which everyone in this chamber does agree on, and that is that housing affordability is a serious issue and a serious challenge, and it is particularly affecting young people in Australia. As I have said in this chamber before, I am keenly aware of that, as a younger person myself, because it is my friends, my family and other people in my age group who are right now struggling to enter the housing market, who are struggling to save for a deposit and who are worried that they will never be able to pay off a mortgage on a home they would like to live in. So I agree with the concerns raised by fellow senators in this debate so far that housing affordability is a serious issue.


I might shock Senator Cameron here, but I agree with him in part as well. I agree with him that although foreign investment in housing is an issue, it is also right to say it is not the most important issue—it is not the key issue in housing affordability. That is where I disagree with One Nation senators. This government has done a number of things to ensure that foreign investment in housing is appropriate and is regulated as it should be. In a moment I will go through and document for the record some of those initiatives. But it is very misleading to come in here and to tell young people in Australia that the reason they cannot buy and cannot afford a home is that foreign investors are stopping them from doing it. The truth is, and the evidence shows, that this is only one small part of the housing affordability problem. This is a much more complex problem and a much broader problem. To come in here and give people false hope that if we somehow shut off foreign investment in housing tomorrow all of a sudden housing will become affordable and achievable for young Australians is misleading, and I think that is a wrong thing to do.


Where I disagree with Senator Cameron is that rich people are the people to blame for the housing affordability crisis. Rich people are not to blame for the housing affordability crisis, just like they are not to blame for non-existent crises in every other product and service market in Australia which does not have an affordability crisis. No-one comes into this chamber and talks about the national bread affordability crisis, the national milk affordability crisis or the national newspaper affordability crisis. The reason no-one comes in here and talks about an affordability crisis in those areas is because there is not an affordability crisis in those areas. The reason there is no affordability crisis in those areas is there are no artificial government restrictions on the supply of those products or services. If ever price and affordability became an issue in those markets the increasing prices would provide ample incentive for people to enter into those markets to provide those products and services and they would keep those prices under check and under control.


Unfortunately, that is not possible in the housing market. If ever there were a market with incentive to get into, the housing market is it. Prices have skyrocketed. There is profit there to be made. One would think rational, profit-seeking people would be leaping to get into the housing market to provide houses for people to increase the supply of homes and, in doing so, help lower the price of homes. Their inability to do so is not because of their unwillingness or a lack of interest in doing so, but it is because of the artificial restrictions governments have placed on the supply of housing.


The truth is, when we talk about a housing affordability crisis, what we really mean is a land affordability crisis. Yes, the home on top of the land is a bit more expensive than it used to be, but not dramatically so—not 50 per cent more expensive in one year, for example, which is the kind of price increase we have seen in my home state in the city of Melbourne, or a 60 per cent increase, as we have seen in Sydney. What accounts for that spectacular increase in price is the increase in the value of the land that sits underneath the home. It is a land affordability crisis that we have.


In every other market, if we had an affordability crisis, what would we do? We would seek to increase the supply of that scarce good and hope that the prices would fall, as they always do. In this market, though, governments and, particularly in this place, state governments and local governments have artificially restricted the supply of land. So people who want to supply the market and want to provide more affordable homes have less ability to do so.


For the record, I want to detail briefly some of the foreign investment controls that this government has put in place to respond to the concerns of the community that it is a factor influencing housing affordability. For example, in the most recent budget we limited foreign ownership in new developments. The government has ensured that dwellings in new developments in Australia will be kept available for Australians by introducing a 50 per cent cap on foreign ownership in new developments. That means that for Australians who want to buy a home in a new development, whether that is an apartment block or a housing estate, at least 50 per cent of that will be quarantined and set aside for local buyers and only 50 per cent of it can go to foreign buyers.


Another measure in this budget is to charge foreign owners who leave their residential properties vacant. One of the persistent concerns in the media has been that foreign investors are buying properties here in Australia and not leasing those properties and not making them available to be rented and that that is contributing to the lack of housing affordability. So one of the measures announced in the budget this year is that, if a foreign owned residential property is left vacant for more than six months in a year, a charge will be levied on that foreign owner equivalent to the foreign investment application fee which was paid at the time of application. This initiative hopes to encourage those foreign investors who might be buying homes in Australia and leaving them vacant to make them available to rent, because housing affordability is not just about purchasing a home; it is also about being able to rent a home—and the greater the availability of rental property, the better.


Another initiative in this budget is to improve the integrity of capital gains tax rules for foreign investors to make sure that the law is being adhered to there. We do not want foreign investors to avoid capital gains tax that they are required to pay and we do not want to encourage people to invest in homes in Australia under the false belief that they can avoid capital gains tax. They need to pay the capital gains tax that is required. We are assisting in this area by bolstering the foreign resident capital gains tax withholding regime by increasing the withholding rate from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent, as well as increasing the number of foreign residents caught in the regime by reducing the threshold from $2 million to $750,000.


Of course, that is not the only initiative in the budget on housing affordability. One measure which I know is particularly valued by young Australians is the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allows them to use their superannuation account to save towards a deposit for their first home. Contrary to speculation and perhaps some fearmongering in the media, this is not a drawdown on the compulsory contributions that they pay through their income into superannuation, but it is extra contributions that they choose to make from their before-tax income above and beyond the minimum 9.25 per cent contribution that they make. They will do so in a tax concessional way which will allow them to save more quickly and to save more than they may have otherwise been able to save. We hope that that will solve one of those issues in entering the housing market. Servicing a mortgage is a difficult thing to do, but what many young people say is an even more difficult thing to do is to save a sufficient deposit to get into the housing market in the first place.


There are other initiatives in the budget, including a National Housing Infrastructure Facility and unlocking Commonwealth land, which is one of the few levers that the Commonwealth government has when it comes to land supply. The Commonwealth is a landholder and landowner and the government is seeking to make as much of that as possible available for home development. I think that is a really important and welcome initiative. One of them is in my home state of Victoria, in the suburb of Maribyrnong, which could build, I believe, up to 6,000 dwellings. That would be a really substantial increase in supply in an inner urban area of Melbourne. That is a really welcome initiative.


But, as I conclude, I think it is worth pointing out, as I have done before in this place, that overwhelmingly the levers to improve housing affordability lie with state governments and local governments. While ever they choose to artificially restrict the supply of land—both on the fringes of our cities, with urban growth boundaries, as we have in my home state of Victoria, which limit development outside of that boundary, or within urban areas by heavily restricting what one can build on a plot of land, with how long it takes to get approval and how expensive it is to do so—housing will not be as affordable as it should be. All the international evidence shows that cities around the world that have the most liberal and open land release policies and the most liberal and open development procedures and policies are also those which have the most affordable housing. There is no reason why Australia could not have that too. We have a plentiful supply of land and that will require some change in attitude from our state and local governments.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-06-14,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  It is a time-honoured tactic of conservatives to scapegoat foreigners and blame them for social problems. If anyone has so far doubted that One Nation are part of the establishment, witness the xenophobia in this matter of public importance. Truly, this gives One Nation the credentials to be willing and able conservative government partners.


The problems in housing are real. But, as with our problems in employment, climate and infrastructure, they are not caused by so-called 'foreigners'. Blaming them is a tired and true tactic to distract from the real causes of the problem. Blaming foreigners is a characteristic of fascism. We know what the real causes of the housing crisis are. I am not for a minute deluded enough to think that facts matter to the conservative establishment. But I say to One Nation supporters, to all decent people who really want to fix these problems: do not be fooled. The facts show that the villains in housing are wealthy developers, property speculators, corrupt political decision makers and the big banks. And these villains are right here in Australia. Those that are causing these problems are in fact the constituency of conservative politicians. The only problem they are interested in solving is the perception that they do not care. They are not interested in actually providing affordable, secure homes for everyone. The evidence is in this matter of public importance. Limiting the number of new dwellings which can be purchased by foreign nonresidents will do almost nothing for the availability of affordable stable housing. 


Of all the housing problems to pick, One Nation chooses the one that will make the least amount of difference. They could have tackled unfair tax breaks, underfunded homelessness services or underinvestment in public and community housing. But, no, they want to go for the dog-whistle option. One Nation chooses the one that makes the least amount of difference. The facts bear this out. In March, claims were made that more than one in 10 properties sold in New South Wales were bought by foreigners. However, an analysis of the data in the Australian Financial Review showed that only two per cent of buyers were in fact foreign tax residents. The rest of the one in 10 were in fact dual citizens, visa holders or people with long-term connections to Australia. As a reporter argued: if we mean what we say about being a country that gives migrants equal rights, there is no reason to treat them any differently. The only reason to treat them differently is if you are trying to scapegoat them to create a cowardly political distraction. So it is only two per cent of buyers in New South Wales, and this figure is almost certainly lower nationwide. 


One might claim that foreign buyers are still pushing up prices or using up supply that could be housing people living in Australia. A 2016 Treasury report looked into this. They analysed high-demand areas in Sydney and Melbourne. They found that foreign investment added to the supply of housing. When it comes to prices, they found foreign investment only increased prices by between $80 and $122 each quarter. Compare that to the median prices of between $800,000 and $900,000. That is about 0.013 per cent. But, again, facts matter little when you want to drum up xenophobia. One Nation ignores the fact that it is wealthy domestic investors that are buying multiple properties at the expense of people seeking to buy their own home. It is mostly domestic investors that are leaving properties vacant and relying on sky-high capital gains to make money. One Nation deliberately ignores that it is their mates on the Liberal-National benches that allow and encourage wealthy domestic investors to game the system for private gain. The real problems lie not with so-called foreigners but with politicians making decisions in favour of a wealthy few. 


The Greens want to abolish the capital gains tax discount, reform negative gearing and swap stamp duty for a fairer land tax. These measures would put those seeking a home on a more even footing with investors. We want to increase investment in public and community housing. We want to urgently give much needed funds to struggling homelessness services. We want to strengthen rights for people who rent to ensure they enjoy affordable, stable homes for life if they choose not to buy. (Time expired)

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:05):  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to what I do consider to be a matter of public importance—the issue of housing affordability. I welcome the opportunity for discussion about this. What is a matter of regret, though, is that One Nation has chosen to focus on a very narrow aspect of this issue when we know, from numerous inquiries into this matter, that housing affordability is a vexed issue. It is a complex matter: it is not just a supply issue and it is not just a demand issue; it is something that requires a lot of government attention to address. It is overly simplistic to focus on this one aspect of housing affordability.


I am a member of the Senate economics committee, and that committee handed down a very substantial report in 2015 on the matter of housing affordability. During the course of that committee's deliberations, there was consideration of the impact of foreign buyers on the issue of housing affordability. Although it wasn't one of the key concerns of the inquiry, it was raised by a number of witnesses during the hearings as a potential cause of recent house price inflation. 


I note that the committee made reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, which held an inquiry into the subject and released a report in November 2014 that had four key findings: that there was a lack of accurate or timely data that tracks foreign investment in residential real estate; there had been a significant failure of leadership by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which was unable to provide basic compliance information to the committee about its investigations and enforcement activities; that there needed to be a greater willingness to enforce foreign investment rules in order to improve compliance; and that the Australian taxpayer currently foots the bill for the administration of FIRB and the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division of Treasury. There were 12 recommendations following from those particular findings.


The issue of foreign buyers has been looked at, but the view from the Senate economics committee was to acknowledge the complexity and urgency of housing affordability in Australia. As I said earlier, it is not really categorised as a supply-side issue or a demand-side issue but that supply is not keeping up with demand, and there is a need for policy interventions without making the matter worse. This is a complex issue. We know that there is, in fact, a crisis, and I will not reiterate some of the points that Senator Cameron has made in respect of some of the key aspects of the crisis that we are confronting. 


I want to dwell on a couple of the Labor plans for addressing this issue. Of course, chief amongst those is the plan to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. It is a matter of record that Labor is the only party with the courage to come forward with a policy that is going to make some inroads into this particular issue. We admit it is not the be-all and end-all of the response, but many quite credible economists and commentators have identified that these tax distortions are causing the exacerbation of the problem. It is a matter of regret for public policy that, with Labor having held out the opportunity for a bipartisan position on this—and despite the fact that the former Treasurer and the current Treasurer have expressed their concerns about negative gearing and identified it as a particular issue—for base political reasons, the coalition has decided not to take up the lead of Labor in this area. I think it is a matter of great disappointment. I also note that One Nation has not supported the brave proposal to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.


We have also proposed a number of other measures. Increasing foreign investor fees and penalties is another one—I will turn to that in a bit more detail—and re-establishing the National Housing Supply Council, which was abolished by the Abbott government on 8 November 2013. If there is one, I suppose, indicator of the lack of commitment from those opposite on this issue and trying to address this issue, it is that, as a way of addressing what was then referred to as the budget emergency, the coalition, as one of its first major steps, abolished a number of its non-statutory bodies, including the National Housing Supply Council, which had been formed back in May of 2008. 


The council comprised a number of experts of a diverse range of relevant fields, including academia, finance, economics, urban development, residential construction, urban planning and social housing sectors. The council's role was to provide estimates, projections, analysis and policy advice in relation to housing supply and demand. So, in abolishing this body, the government quite clearly demonstrated its lack of interest in this matter and, I think, stands condemned as a result of that. 


Currently, the Foreign Investment Review Board rules apply a range of restrictions on foreign purchases of property in Australia, including a general restriction on the purchase of existing dwellings—although there are some exemptions to that. While foreign investment purchases account for a relatively low amount of overall purchases each year, FIRB data does show that the number of foreign investment purchases has grown by about 275 per cent over the three years to 2014-15. 


As I mentioned earlier, one of the measures that Labor is proposing is to increase application fees for foreign investment in residential real estate. So we would actually double the application fees that currently apply, and what we proposed is that from 1 July 2019, for properties of a million dollars or less, the current fee of $5,000 would be doubled to $10,000; over a million dollars and up to $2 million, the current fee would be increased—as I say, doubled—to $20,200; and between $2 million and less than $3 million, the new fee would be $40,600 Those fees would then in our proposal continue to be indexed by the CPI. 


We also proposed increased penalties for breaching the Foreign Investment Review Board rules. That would mean that, for foreign buyers who acquire new or existing dwellings without approval, we would increase the criminal penalty to $270,000 and $1.35 million for a company; and increase the civil penalty to be the greater of the following: the 20 per cent of the purchase price in addition to the relevant application fee or 20 per cent of the market value of the property in addition to the relevant application fee. 


We would also double the maximum financial penalties for a number of other breaches including where, for example, a nonresident acquired an established property or a temporary resident acquired more than one established property; and a range of other breaches which I will mention: where a temporary resident fails to sell established property when it ceases to be their principal residence; if a temporary resident rents out an established property; failure to complete construction within four years without seeking an extension; where a developer fails to market apartments in Australia; where a property developer fails to comply with reporting conditions associated with an approval; and where a foreign person fails to comply with reporting conditions which require them to notify actual purchase and sale of established properties. So these are some of the more effective ways that we can deal with this issue. Establishing these penalties sends a very clear signal that breaches in this area will not be tolerated. These are the ways to address housing affordability. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-06-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:15):  It is good that this time of debating in the Senate chamber has taken on a very serious subject today. Too often in these matters of public importance we are debating motions put up by the Greens political party, which are simply based on fantasy and which never have any factual base to them. I congratulate the One Nation Party for at least putting forward for discussion in this Senate a motion on the important issue of housing for Australians and the limits that need to be placed on some of the acquisitions by foreign non-residents.


The government will place a limit on foreign ownership in new developments. We will introduce an annual charge on foreign owners who buy residential property and leave it vacant and we will tighten the foreign investor tax integrity rules to reduce avoidance of capital gains tax on Australian property. I intend to elaborate on those three initiatives that the government is already putting in place, if time permits, but first of all can I say that I listened with interest to what Senator Ketter from the Australian Labor Party said. I always wonder with the Australian Labor Party that they were in office for six years—six terribly long years, I might say—and never once did they do anything to seriously address the issues which Senator Ketter says now a Labor government would put in place.


Home ownership, particularly for young Australians, is an important issue; it is a goal for all Australians to own their own homes, but it becomes very difficult if the broader parameters are not in order. I remember when I was buying a home and, admittedly, it was now some time ago—in the days of the Hawke and Keating administration of our country. I say this as often as I can, because people do not believe me when I say that I was paying 17 per cent interest on my housing loan in the Labor years. That was when Paul Keating said that we had to have a recession and the Labor Party was, as they are now, promising everything to everybody and spending wildly without having any idea of where the money was coming from and borrowing money from overseas. As a result of Labor's mismanagement at the time, I and other young home buyers—and I was young in those days—were paying 17 per cent interest on my housing loan. Of course, business loans in those days were above 20 per cent. 


Fortunately, those days are gone, and there is encouragement for young people in some of the initiatives of this government to acquire a house and pay it off over their lifetime. Of course, to do that or to even contemplate acquiring a house, one must have a job. Again, under Labor administrations, we found unemployment very high. Regrettably, at the moment in my home state of Queensland, unemployment is unacceptably high in the city of Townsville, where I have my office. I am embarrassed to say that we currently have the record for the highest unemployment. It means that there will be a lot of people in Townsville who will not even be able to think about buying a house, and those who have in recent years purchased a house at values are now finding it extremely difficult to continue with payments and to maintain the value of their house when it was acquired during the time of the Gillard-Rudd administration. 


It is important that governments not only look at the direct issue of housing affordability and what might be causing the problems that we see, particularly in the major capital cities these days, but also address the wider economic position of Australia so that we can get the fundamentals right, so that we can get people into jobs so that we can get the economy going reasonably well. That is why I can never understand why the Greens political party, in particular, are always attacking the job creation policies of coalition governments. The Adani issue is a classic and very recent issue about that. Adani will create jobs. It will boost the economy of Queensland. It will provide for economic growth in the North of our country, yet the Greens are totally opposed to it. They are trying to use every trick in the parliamentary book to stop that process from proceeding. Fortunately, today, I was delighted to see that the native title amendment bill was passed, which was the last legal impediment to the Adani coalmine. The Senate graciously—well, almost graciously—adopted a motion congratulating the federal government and the minister and also the Queensland government and the Premier on their leadership in bringing those job prospects to a part of Queensland that desperately needs them. 


I did mention in relation to this motion brought forward by Senator Hanson that the government is already acting on the things that Senator Hanson mentioned in her initial contribution. We do not necessarily agree with Senator Hanson in what she is proposing, and I have made that clear. But I do again thank her for raising this important issue for discussion. 


The government will ensure that dwellings in Australia are kept available for Australians by introducing a 50 per cent cap on foreign ownership in new developments. This will be applied through conditions imposed on new dwelling exemption certificates. These new dwelling exemption certificates are granted to property developers and act as a pre-approval, allowing for the sale of new dwellings in a specified development to foreign persons, without each foreign purchaser seeking their own foreign investment approval. The current certificates do not limit the proportion of dwellings that can be sold to foreign investors. What we are doing will strengthen the existing rules that apply to certificates where the government considers whether developers market or advertise the development in Australia. The new 50 per cent cap builds on existing rules to ensure Australian buyers have access to a greater pool of homes to buy in these new developments. Developments have to be multistorey and have at least 50 dwellings. From budget night, developers who are granted a new dwelling exemption certificate will be subject to a condition which limits the sale to foreign investors of new dwellings in that development to 50 per cent. it is a budget measure that is just one of the steps which the government is taking. I did mention at the beginning of my contribution that we are also going to charge foreign owners who leave their residential properties vacant a fee, and we are going to improve the integrity of capital gains tax rules for foreign investors. 


Unfortunately, I am not going to have time in the time allotted to me in this debate to go into the detail of those two issues, suffice to say that they will make a difference and they do demonstrate that the coalition government, the Turnbull government is taking real steps forward to address the problem identified in this motion.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-06-14,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:25):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak to Senator Hanson's important MPI—the need to limit the number of new dwellings which can be purchased by foreign non-residents. Buying a home is the single biggest investment in most people's lives. As the first rung on the ladder to home ownership, the first home purchase is the single most important step people can take towards financial security and independence. What homeownership comes down to is the principle that Australians can own a share of our own country. The very idea that successive governments have allowed this to be put at risk by foreigners is utterly repugnant. The birthright of ordinary Australian working families is being stolen by foreigners, aided by incompetent governments. We had a mining boom yet how many young people these days can afford to buy their own house thanks to energy policies, overregulation and tax that is destroying investment and destroying employment, disrupting markets and smashing freedom?


As our leader has informed the Senate, in 2014-15 alone, over 17 per cent of all new residential properties in New South Wales and over 15 per cent in Victoria were bought by foreign—that is, mainly Chinese—buyers. As these were concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, this means that around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of all new properties in the cities are now bought by foreigners. And where are house prices rising most quickly? Sydney and Melbourne. Where are most immigrants and most foreign purchasers? Sydney and Melbourne. This is a shocking yet totally deplorable fact that around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of all new properties in these cities are now bought by foreigners. Anyone who imagines that adding up to 40 per cent of extra buyers to a market of limited supply does not drive up prices are economic troglodytes.


Never mind negative gearing, it is clear that it is foreign Chinese property speculators together with the flood of new immigrants that are pushing up house price and locking Aussies out of buying a home. Do you remember Kevin Rudd? How could anyone forget Kevin Rudd? Prior to Kevin Rudd, changing the foreign investment rules nearly 10 years ago to allow open slather buying up of Australia properties by foreign owners would have been illegal. The ALP and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd were too busy buying headlines, flinging billions of dollars around and claiming the greatest moral threat—based on a lie—while people were homeless.


In the words of our leader, Senator Hanson, we need to slash immigration numbers. We need to limit all foreign buyers to just one property and actually enforce the law to prevent foreigners buying any established homes. We at Pauline Hanson's One Nation have the courage to say what people think, the courage to cut the number of immigrants and also to raise the discussion on the quality of immigration. We also need all foreign owned empty properties, whose darkened windows blight the Sydney and Melbourne landscapes and skylines, to be returned to the marketplace. What was the government's response to this in the budget? Senator Hanson has already discussed that—tokenism, window-dressing, like so many ineffectual Turnbull budget measures that will have no effect. How much will it cost to enforce this window dressing? How much more regulation will cripple buyers of houses?


So what is the government's response to date? It is to talk about the supply side and to say that it is a state problem. Yes, supply is obviously a part of the equation. However, the other side of soaring prices of the demand problem is firmly the result of federal government policies. The demand problem is all about unrestricted foreign speculators and too many immigrants. Unlike some members and senators who will sell out this country and its interests for a fistful of yuan, One Nation will stand up for the birthright of Australian workers. Just as One Nation senators will never take a plum $900,000 a year job on retirement in return for selling our vital strategic assets to China and just as we will never take a bribe to support Chinese military aggression and the illegal seizure of another nation's territory, so too One Nation will never betray the right of Aussie working families to own their own home. If Chinese investors dare to complain about One Nation's unapologetically nationalist policies, they need only look to their own government that does the same. You and I cannot buy property in mainland China, so why should we let the Chinese snap up all our property here? We should not.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Government is committed to preventing harm to children, both in person or online. Such harm, including sexual exploitation of children, is devastating to the children involved, their families, and their communities.


The introduction of the Protecting Minors Online Bill follows the murder of 15 year old Carly Ryan by a 50 year old man who posed online as a teenage boy.


2017 marks the 10 year anniversary since this tragic event and Carly's mother has worked tirelessly since then to protect children online. Through the introduction of this Bill, Carly's mother has achieved the outcome of a law to better protect young Australians in the online world. I am proud to have worked with Sonya Ryan to develop a measure that is effective and recognises Carly's legacy. I would also like to acknowledge the work and support that the Senator Nick Xenophon and his Team has provided in the development of this Bill.


The Government has a duty to ensure that, with ever evolving technology and expanding communication methods, Commonwealth laws provide a deterrent and a sound basis for prosecuting offenders who would do children harm. 


The Protecting Minors Online Bill sends a clear message: this behaviour will not be tolerated. Australian children must be safe to grow, explore and develop online as 'in real life', and we will protect these spaces for them.


Rapidly evolving technologies and the anonymity that the internet provides have resulted in unprecedented opportunities for harm to and sexual exploitation of children. Our laws need to keep pace with the speed of technological change and the way that technology is used. This government has a demonstrated history of protecting children online through the enactment of a range of offences directed at the use of carriage services, such as the internet and mobile phones, for the sexual exploitation of children. 


The Bill represents a further step to protect Australian children from those who would do them harm. 


The introduction of the Bill improves protection of children online by introducing a new offence that complements existing online child sex offences for preparatory conduct, including grooming or procuring a child for sexual activity. The Bill extends the criminalisation of the use of the internet and social media as a forum for predators to groom or procure our children to engage in sexual activity to a broader range of conduct.


This offence builds upon the proactive policing of online child sex offences, allowing law enforcement to take action against online predators sooner and with greater consequence. 


The Bill introduces a tough new offence for adults preparing or planning to cause harm to, procure, or engage in sexual activity with a child and may be punished by up to 10 years imprisonment. Importantly, this will include those who misrepresent their age as a step towards causing harm to a child.




Conclusion



This Bill will ensure young Australians have greater protection from online predators and serve as a significant deterrent to those who would do them harm.

I just wanted to take note of that, if it is the will of the chamber.

Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, be quiet. I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Specifically, I wish to take note of the absence of a response by the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, to the request of the Senate for the government's response to our inquiry into the future of Australia's video game development industry. This is something we tabled 411 days ago.


This was a unanimous report. All I can do, really, is commend it to the chamber. I do not know that any of the coalition senators who sat on it are actually in here at the moment, but I was really pleasantly surprised. We had a mix of people on this inquiry into what could be an incredibly important and vital part of the Australian economy—the kind of new economy Prime Minister Turnbull used to go on about so much. We had a variety of senators on that committee and by the end of it, no matter how much information they had or how much experience they had with the industry before they started on the inquiry, everybody was of one view: that this is an industry worth supporting, either purely for the economic arguments, which I will go into in a moment, or, to my mind, more importantly, the artistic elements of entire new art forms that are coming into being before our eyes.


So, 411 days ago, we tabled a unanimous report. There were eight recommendations. They were fairly simple and straightforward things, stuff that you would probably expect—I will go into them in a bit of detail in a moment—and we have heard absolutely nothing. So last month I put up a motion, which the Senate supported, to require the government to produce its response. It is the normal practice in here that, when a Senate committees goes away, does a report, tables it and comes up with recommendations, as a courtesy—even if the government disagrees with the recommendations—you get a report back from the government, saying: 'Thank you for your work. Here is what we are going to do with your proposals.' Then, 411 days later, that document still does not exist. We are wondering how much longer Senator Fifield expects it is going to take to respond to the eight recommendations. 


In his comment yesterday, Senator McGrath, his voice dripping with his usual contempt, basically said: 'We're busy. We have to consult with a bunch of ministers. We'll get back to you.' We have a letter today from Senator Fifield—and I get that he is busy; he is dealing with the unfolding catastrophe of the NBN and the defunding of the ABC and SBS and the demands of the commercial media sector. I know he has a lot on his plate, but this is a good-news story. These are creative people who are trying to make an economic and artistic contribution to our country. The scale of the industry they are trying to play into is something that I think has gone over the heads of everybody in here except those who participated in the committee. 


It has been more than three years now since the coalition government announced that it would cancel the Australian Interactive Games Fund. It is nice that Senator Brandis is in here with us at the moment, because it was one of his more casual and destructive acts for the 2014 budget. He basically elbowed a sector in the face; he scratched the line item of the Australian Interactive Games Fund halfway through its three-year funding round. 


We thought it might be interesting to see what has happened in the games industry since that budget line item was so casually wiped out by Senator Brandis during his short and not-at-all-missed tenure as arts minister. But, while Senator Fifield—who I think does bring a more technically and certainly artistically literate point of view to bear on this sector—has been considering the committee report, a couple of things have happened, and I would like to draw the chamber's attention to a couple of predictions the committee got wrong in that time. 


While Senator Fifield has been juggling his portfolios, the global games industry has grown to more than $100 billion in annual revenues. That is 'billion' with a 'b'. It is bigger than the global film industry. That exceeds the expectations the committee set down in the report, which was $96 billion by 2018. It has come in at least 12 months ahead of the projections that we thought of. Even if all you are interested in and all you care about are the revenues that can be gained from the global industry, you would have thought that there was an important story here. 


I think the problem is that we have ministers and expenditure review committees who want to know: 'How many tonnes of software does this industry export every year?' There is a measure of illiteracy there. We only wish that more government MPs had been able to participate and see firsthand what it is these incredibly talented and creative people are trying to do. So, while Senator Fifield has been off consulting his colleagues, the first round of recipients of the $10 million or thereabouts that Screen Australia was able to get out the door—before Senator Brandis kicked them in the face—produced several outstanding products, which I would say far exceeded the government's investment in terms of taxes paid, jobs created, global exports and continued reinvestment back into the industry. It was not a giveaway fund. It was not a slush fund. It was a loan. It was a development fund. At the end of the three-year funding cycle, there is still $21 million bucks in there because it has been paid back. That is a tiny investment to support the really important potential of this industry. 


What we saw in part through the Commonwealth contribution in kickstarting this projects are games like Framed, Bean Dreams, Gems of War, Submerged, Hand of Fate and Crossy Road. Some of these things probably exist on some of the phones carried around by senators in this place, and they are some of the creative, outstanding and—if you are interested—lucrative games produced by the recipients of the first round of the council fund. 


These are people who have been able to stay in Australia and build a career rather than going to California, Europe or Asia. Surely that is what the Prime Minister is on about when he talks about agility and innovation.


I do not want to hold this process up any further, but we do have some more questions for Senator Fifield to consider while he consults his colleagues. How much revenue has the Australian government lost by pulling out too soon and failing to fully recoup its investment in the projects funded in the first round? I would love to know, as part of the government's response, whether they have calculated the opportunity of capping this thing off halfway through and depriving these studios large and small of the ability to do what it was they were trying to do. So how much have we lost?


How much has this lack of vision cost the industry and the Australian economy? There will be a number there if they can be bothered to calculate it. How much damage has been done to the industry in terms of talented and experienced developers leaving the country? Does the government have any idea how many people have left the country because of the economic opportunities that have been squandered by this government? How many young Australians have graduated from games, technology and arts degrees to find no prospects of employment where there could be and there still could be a flourishing industry right here? How many opportunities has Australia missed out on to contribute to the next big hit which drives the industry and the economy onwards and upwards?


I know I am focusing mainly on the economic aspects here, and maybe some in the industry will wish that I would not emphasise that so hard, because it is not all the report covered and, as I said before, I think that, in a way, the incredible artistic developments that are occurring here are, if anything, more important than the economic indicators. But I would have thought it would be interesting to a government trying to balance a precarious budget to know that, if Prime Minister Turnbull just looked up the meaning of some of the buzzwords that he spools out at every opportunity, he would realise there are people right here who actually want to give some substance to that vision.


The government has been pretty well informed by the people who contributed to the inquiry, and I want to thank all of them. I want to thank colleagues on the crossbench, on the government side and on the opposition side for bringing a lot of goodwill to bear and being willing to listen to what the sector had to say. It is clear, though, that every day that the government continues to consider and consult without taking action on the recommendations that we made is actually incurring real costs, not just economic but personal, to people who want to be able to get out there and get a job.


We are up to day 411. I suspect there is something good happening behind the scenes. I suspect Senator Fifield is working on something. Maybe there is going to be something in the winds. I cannot imagine that we could go through all this work and have it come to nothing. But, for heaven's sake, give us a sign. There is a lot of goodwill out there in the industry, and the industry is not asking for much. These people are not asking for a great deal. We are still holding out for some good news—some sign that the government is ready to start making maybe even an apology for the damage that it did to a scheme that was set down when Mr Crean was arts minister under the previous government and to come good, to make right as Senator Fifield did with the disastrous catalyst imposition on the Australia Council funding. He fixed that, and it takes courage to fix stuff that your predecessors have buggered up, but I think this is one really easy thing that could be fixed without too much of an effort, not only with no impact on the budget but with a major net positive to the Australian economy.


This is an industry that is ready to get on its feet if the government is ready to listen. We look forward to getting more than just a letter in the mail from the minister saying, 'We need more time.' I thank the chamber.

These are people who have been able to stay in Australia and build a career rather than going to California, Europe or Asia. Surely that is what the Prime Minister is on about when he talks about agility and innovation.


I do not want to hold this process up any further, but we do have some more questions for Senator Fifield to consider while he consults his colleagues. How much revenue has the Australian government lost by pulling out too soon and failing to fully recoup its investment in the projects funded in the first round? I would love to know, as part of the government's response, whether they have calculated the opportunity of capping this thing off halfway through and depriving these studios large and small of the ability to do what it was they were trying to do. So how much have we lost?


How much has this lack of vision cost the industry and the Australian economy? There will be a number there if they can be bothered to calculate it. How much damage has been done to the industry in terms of talented and experienced developers leaving the country? Does the government have any idea how many people have left the country because of the economic opportunities that have been squandered by this government? How many young Australians have graduated from games, technology and arts degrees to find no prospects of employment where there could be and there still could be a flourishing industry right here? How many opportunities has Australia missed out on to contribute to the next big hit which drives the industry and the economy onwards and upwards?


I know I am focusing mainly on the economic aspects here, and maybe some in the industry will wish that I would not emphasise that so hard, because it is not all the report covered and, as I said before, I think that, in a way, the incredible artistic developments that are occurring here are, if anything, more important than the economic indicators. But I would have thought it would be interesting to a government trying to balance a precarious budget to know that, if Prime Minister Turnbull just looked up the meaning of some of the buzzwords that he spools out at every opportunity, he would realise there are people right here who actually want to give some substance to that vision.


The government has been pretty well informed by the people who contributed to the inquiry, and I want to thank all of them. I want to thank colleagues on the crossbench, on the government side and on the opposition side for bringing a lot of goodwill to bear and being willing to listen to what the sector had to say. It is clear, though, that every day that the government continues to consider and consult without taking action on the recommendations that we made is actually incurring real costs, not just economic but personal, to people who want to be able to get out there and get a job.


We are up to day 411. I suspect there is something good happening behind the scenes. I suspect Senator Fifield is working on something. Maybe there is going to be something in the winds. I cannot imagine that we could go through all this work and have it come to nothing. But, for heaven's sake, give us a sign. There is a lot of goodwill out there in the industry, and the industry is not asking for much. These people are not asking for a great deal. We are still holding out for some good news—some sign that the government is ready to start making maybe even an apology for the damage that it did to a scheme that was set down when Mr Crean was arts minister under the previous government and to come good, to make right as Senator Fifield did with the disastrous catalyst imposition on the Australia Council funding. He fixed that, and it takes courage to fix stuff that your predecessors have buggered up, but I think this is one really easy thing that could be fixed without too much of an effort, not only with no impact on the budget but with a major net positive to the Australian economy.


This is an industry that is ready to get on its feet if the government is ready to listen. We look forward to getting more than just a letter in the mail from the minister saying, 'We need more time.' I thank the chamber.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:48):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to highlight this issue and the injustice of the family law decision that military disability payments are to be divided in Family Law Court decisions. I move:




That the Family Law (Superannuation) (Provision of Information—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme) Amendment Determination 2016, made under the 
Family Law Act 1975
, be disallowed
.



We would like to put on record our opposition within Pauline Hanson's One Nation party to this splitting of payments in cases of disability, since one recipient is not disabled. We understand that this disallowance motion will not resolve the larger problem. We support it as an expression of our opposition to the orderly disbursement of moneys rightly due to disabled veterans who have not suffered disability as a result of service to our country. We will work with the government to help ensure our disabled veterans are given the financial support and dignity that their sacrifices greatly merit. I urge senators to follow the advice of the RSL and vote for a disallowance of the determination by the Attorney-General.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:49):  I just want to provide the Senate with some information in relation to this issue, but first I indicate that the government will be opposing the disallowance motion. In doing so, that does not reflect at all on the genuineness of the concerns which Senator Roberts and his colleagues in the One Nation party hold. Senator Hanson has raised this issue with me, and I am happy to work with her and with others—I see Senator Lambie has arrived in the chamber, and I also acknowledge her interest in this issue—but the way to do this is not by supporting this disallowance motion this evening.


Let me explain to the Senate what the position is. As you know, superannuation can be a significant portion of the property pool in family law proceedings. The family law superannuation splitting regime is set out in the Family Law Act and the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations. That regime allows superannuation interests to be split between parties when a relationship breaks down. It has been in operation since 2002. 


The Family Law Act prohibits the courts from adjusting property interests, including superannuation interests, unless they are satisfied that in all the circumstances it is just and equitable to do so. Family law courts split invalidity pensions between parties, just as they split other superannuation interests where it is just and equitable to do so. Family law courts consider the form, nature and characteristics of superannuation interests in deciding what is just and equitable. The Federal Court of Australia in its decision in Campbell v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal in 2016 confirmed that military super invalidity pensions are superannuation interests for the purposes of the superannuation splitting regime.


I made the Family Law (Superannuation) (Provision of Information—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme) Determination 2016 on 15 November 2016. That determination amended the existing Family Law (Superannuation) (Provision of Information—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme) Determination 2004. The purpose of the 2004 information determination was to authorise the trustee to provide to parties to family law proceedings the information necessary to allow them to value their superannuation interests. A scheme-specific superannuation information determination was necessary in 2004 because military superannuation interests are valued using scheme-specific methods and factors. The methods and factors for valuing military super interests are contained in the Family Law (Superannuation) (Methods and Factors for Valuing Particular Superannuation Interests) Approval 2003, another legislative instrument. That 2003 instrument has not been amended.


The 2016 determination clarifies that the 2004 information determination is to be taken to have been made under both regulation 63, the source of power for accumulation interests, and regulation 64, the source of power for defined benefit interests. It was necessary to make that clarification because the Campbell decision concluded that military super invalidity pensions are accumulation interests for the purposes of the regulations. The characterisation of a military super interest as either an accumulation interest or a defined benefit interest has no impact on how the interest is valued or split. As I have noted, the valuation method is determined in accordance with the Family Law (Superannuation) (Methods and Factors for Valuing Particular Superannuation Interests) Approval 2003, and, as I said, that instrument has not been amended. It remains unchanged and the valuation methods and factors remain the same. The 2016 determination does not change whether military super interests are splitable; it merely removes the potential for uncertainty about the authority under which the trustee can provide the most useful information to facilitate valuation of the superannuation interest.


It is important to note that compensation for workplace injury is paid to ADF members under separate legislation—the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. These incapacity payments are economic loss compensation to ADF members and former members for lost capacity to earn due to a service injury or disease. The operation of that legislation, likewise, is unaffected by the 2016 determination.


For those reasons the government will not be supporting the disallowance motion, but, as I said, we will continue to work with colleagues to ensure that the legitimate concerns that have been raised are appropriately addressed. I thank the Senate.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (17:56):  Labor will not be supporting the disallowance for reasons similar to those that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has outlined. We understand the provisions of this instrument are purely for the purposes of facilitating information sharing. Specifically, the instrument requires the trustee to provide eligible persons with information about their superannuation interests upon request. It is this default information which will allow the Family Court to make a just and equitable decision on the splitting of assets. The issues raised with Labor regarding the valuation of superannuation do not go to this instrument, nor does this instrument have the ability to alter the valuation of invalidity pension interests. The characterisation of military super interests as either an accumulation interest or a defined benefit interest has no impact on how the interest is valued or split. The issues raised around the valuation of the invalidity pension, whether it is a defined benefit interest or an accumulation interest, are not represented in the 2016 determination, and, rather, this is a policy argument for the government.


The impact of the 2016 determination is simply to confirm the type of information that a trustee must provide for the purposes of the valuation of military super, not how the valuation is calculated or split. We are certainly willing to have a conversation about the broader policy issue that has been raised as a consequence of this instrument; however, we do not believe this is best dealt with through this instrument.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (17:57):  The Nick Xenophon Team will be voting against the disallowance motion, which has been taken up by Senator Roberts, with respect to the Family Law (Superannuation) (Provision of Information—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme) Amendment Determination 2016. I and my colleague Senator Lambie had initially lodged the disallowance motion on 15 February this year, following an urgent meeting with the Queensland Returned and Services League to provide them with time to consider the determination and its implications. The day of our meeting was the final day notice could be given to disallow the instrument.


The Queensland RSL and other stakeholders have expressed concern about the way the family law superannuation splitting regime is being applied with respect to military invalidity pensions; however, this determination does not alter the means of dealing with the family law superannuation splitting regime with respect to military invalidity pensions, which are considered superannuation interests and remain splitable. This was affirmed by Judge Logan in the decision of Campbell v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal 2016. In Campbell's case the court considered the definitions of 'superannuation interest' and 'defined benefit interest' in the Family Law Act and regulations respectively and ultimately held that, contrary to the approach taken by the trustee in the tribunal, the applicant's invalidity pension should not have been valued as a defined benefit interest as defined in the family law regulations. However, as noted, the court held that the invalidity pension was still a superannuation interest for the purposes of the relevant provisions of the Family Law Act and should have been valued for family law purposes as an accumulation interest.


The Federal Court's characterisation of military super interests as accumulation interests gave rise to potential uncertainty about the trustee's authority to provide specific information for the valuation of military super interests as prescribed under the 2004 determination. 


The Campbell decision created some doubt about whether the 2004 determination was made under the correct regulation. The consequence was that it was not clear whether the trustee was authorised to provide the most targeted information for the purposes of valuing military invalidity pensions. To that end, the 2016 determination amends the 2004 determination to provide that the 2004 determination is made under both regulations 63 and 64 of the Family Law (Superannuation) Regulations. This ensures that the trustee can provide the prescribed specific information that is most useful for valuing military superannuation interests.


I reiterate that the 2016 determination does not affect whether military super interests are splittable. Consequently, I gave notice of our intention to withdraw the disallowance motion earlier today. Notwithstanding the giving of our notice of our intention to withdraw the disallowance motion, Senator Lambie and I understand the concerns from the veteran community and have written to the government to ask it to provide us with a written assurance that it will consider the underlying policy concerning whether military invalidity pensions should form part of the family law superannuation-splitting regime in circumstances where those pensions are reviewable. Thank you.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:00):  I will be voting against the disallowance motion with respect to the Family Law (Superannuation) (Provision of Information—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme) Amendment Determination 2016.


I will be voting against this because it is nothing more than a stunt, plain and simple. Here comes One Nation! It is a stunt! One Nation know that even if it were still able to be disallowed, what they are proposing will not make one single bit of difference in the life of a single veteran in this country. Not one!


When Senator Kakoschke-Moore, the NXT and I originally proposed this disallowance motion it was to provide the Queensland branch of the Returned Services League of Australia some time to consider the Attorney-General's determination and any implications that would be attached to that. RSL Queensland and other ex-service organisations have expressed valid concerns about how the family law superannuation-splitting regime is being applied with respect to military invalidity pensions. These concerns are valid and deserve to be explored, but this disallowance motion does absolutely nothing to explore them. That is because the determination itself does not alter the means of dealing with the family law superannuation-splitting rule as to military invalidity pensions, which under existing law are considered superannuation interests and remain splittable.


When I realised that the determination will not alter the splitting rule I withdrew from the disallowance motion, along with Senator Kakoschke-Moore. I have asked the government to provide a written assurance, as has Senator Kakoschke-Moore, that it will consider the underlying policy of whether military invalidity pensions should form part of the family law superannuation-splitting rule in circumstances where they are reviewable. That is what is actually needed to make a real difference here—a real difference to veterans' lives.


The veteran community is sick of being played for fools like this. Veterans who have served their country deserve better from One Nation than to be treated like pawns in a political stunt, which is all this is this afternoon. It is a political stunt and they are using veterans as pawns. One Nation need to stand up and own the fact that they know that what they are doing here will achieve absolutely nothing. I would expect, further on, that they would apologise for their actions to every Australian veteran out there. Anything less will be more of the same from the party that likes to pretend they care about veterans only when there is a camera trained on them or they can get attention. Cheap votes from veterans!


Not only does this achieve nothing, it promises false hope to those who actually need our help here. It is a disgraceful, cynical and shocking display of One Nation using the veteran community for their own political gain, and it will make absolutely no difference to a veteran. Veterans do not need any more empty promises and useless gestures. They need our help, and this does nothing to help them.


Some of us in this place actually give a damn about making a difference. Some of us take the work we are doing here seriously. Stop wasting our time with these useless stunts and stop using veterans as a chance to get your names in the newspaper. Shame on you! They deserve better and Australia deserves better. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.


Do you know what blows me away even more? These are the same people who pulled a political stunt on the veterans, pretending they actually cared about them. They did a big thing on Facebook here not that long ago, calling veterans in and pretending that they cared about their PTSD. And yet not one of them has shown up at the veterans' suicide inquiry. Not one!


If this is not a political stunt and using a veteran as a pawn, I do not know what is. But I will tell you what: today, you are an absolute disgrace in my eyes and those of many veterans out there and this will come back to bite you. You deserve everything you get.

 (Queensland) (18:05):  This afternoon, we did our research on this and we saw this as a way of showing our support. After contacting the RSL, they urged us to continue this for them. Our office did that this afternoon to show our support for the RSL and 5,000 veterans who are under pressure with this. We know that the government needs to act on this, and that is what we are doing. We are facilitating and driving that. On behalf of 5,000 veterans and the RSL, who have encouraged us to continue this, that is why we speak. I urge all senators to vote in favour of this disallowance motion.


Question negatived.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:06):  I would like to continue following the brief start that I had for about 30 seconds on this legislation when I first spoke. This is a really good plan put forward by the member for Lyne, David Gillespie—a national rural health commissioner to actually look at the health issues in rural and regional areas and give frank assessments and opinions to the ministers. 


There are many things that we could do within regional areas. One that I am promoting at the moment is neurological nurses throughout not only New South Wales, but Australia, for people with Parkinson's disease—such as I have; so far, so good—but also that terrible disease of motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis. We have just three of those such nurses in New South Wales. I believe there is one at Nowra, one at Wagga Wagga and one at Coffs Harbour. A motion passed at the New South Wales Nationals conference at Broken Hill a couple of weeks ago, and my good colleague Senator Nash was there, to see that the federal government along with the state governments provide 50-50 funding for these neurological nurses. That is one thing we need to discuss with this health commissioner when this commissioner is appointed. I would hope that this legislation would be supported right around the chamber.


Another thing that we are short of, especially in many remote areas, are dentists. Early in this job—eight years or so ago—we received an increase in our electoral allowance payments of some $4,800 a year. Since that very day, I have donated the $4,800 a year to a rural dental scholarship, actually managed by the National Rural Health Alliance, where a first-year dentistry student going to university receives my $4,800—$400 a month—for the 12 months. It is a big assistance to anyone, but especially a university student who has to travel and get accommodation. On a verbal commitment, they come from a rural or regional background and they will return to those areas to practise when they become a fully qualified and professional dentist. I have actually put a bit of money into that and I am very proud to say that we have now paid out some $40,000 in sponsoring my dental scholarship.


There are many things we need in regional Australia as far as health goes. So what will be the role of this health commissioner? How will it work? The commissioner will work across all levels of government to improve rural health policies and champion the cause of rural practice. The first task of the commissioner will be to develop a national rural generalist pathway. Working with the sector and training providers to define what is to be a rural generalist, the commissioner will develop options for increased access to training and appropriate remuneration for rural generalists, recognising their extra skills. While the commissioner's first priority is the development of the pathway, their role will be much broader and will include consultation with stakeholders to give consideration to the nursing, dental health, Indigenous health, mental health, midwifery and allied health needs in rural and remote Australia. Dentistry has been mentioned again.


For the benefit of the whips, I will not be speaking my full term of 20 minutes. That might put you on notice as to who your next speaker is. 



Senator Urquhart interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Thank you for the thumbs up, Senator Urquhart. What we are being told—and I have no reason to doubt this—is that the National Rural Health Commissioner will be very frank in his or her assessment. That is the point of the job. It is for them to look at the details, assess the details, assess the problems, come up with solutions and give frank opinions and directions to our health ministers, regardless of who is in government. I would hope this is supported right around the chamber. The National Rural Health Commissioner will be there for decades to come. 


We talked earlier in the debate about housing prices and foreign investors. There is plenty of room in regional Australia for people to move to. There are plenty of jobs. Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, you would be familiar with the huge argument we had about the backpackers tax and what to charge them, because we need them to work in our abattoirs and to pick our fruit—the seasonal work. We have more than 700,000 Australians unemployed. Why aren't they going out to pick the fruit or to work in abattoirs? That always amazes me. Perhaps we are a bit soft when we actually pay people not to work. When I was a young fella, we did not have enough land to support my father, my brother and me, so I learnt to drive a truck and to sheer sheep. I was never unemployed as a result. Shearing sheep is not the easiest job going, but I was young and fit in those days—a bit different from now. Age does weary us. 


This is a situation where we want people in regional Australia. We have already seen the government working actively in that direction with APVMA and many other government institutions being moved out to the regions, freeing up the housing in the cities. We have the land. We have the housing. The population actually grows jobs. The more population in a town, the more teachers, the more nurses, the more doctors, the more police are needed—the more everything is needed. Population in and of itself builds jobs. If you do not believe me then ask what Canberra had 100 years ago. It probably had some cattle—beef cattle, dairy cattle—some sheep and a few farmers. There was probably a little village somewhere, with a general store. Look at it now. This is a classic example of regional development. 


The National Rural Health Commissioner will play a major role as the regional areas grow—and I am sure they will in time. People will be forced out of the cities because of the simple fact that they will not be able to afford to buy a house. Where I live in Inverell, a lovely town, there is ample water supply—no water restrictions. There are never water restrictions. Even in the biggest drought we do not have water restrictions, thankfully, because of the Copeton Dam water supply. You can buy a good home in Inverell for $300,000. When I say a 'good home' I mean a three-bedroom, brick veneer home on an 800-square metre block in a nice area, a quiet area, of town. That is not a lot of the money; $300,000 would not buy you a dog kennel in Sydney. 


As we grow the regions, it will be vital that the National Rural Health Commissioner provide frank assessments of the things that we need in regional areas as far as health goes. Sure, we are lucky in this country. If you are in a spot of bother or in a serious spot of bother, we have the helicopters, the air ambulances. Those things are there for an emergency. But more than that is needed. There are the aged care facilities. There is the general hospital for people who are just recovering from a minor or, in some cases, even major surgery. Of course, there is a shortage of dentists. As I said, I will be keen to see the neurological nurses established right throughout Australia to take a bit of the load off the GPs. Also, it takes a long time to get in to see a neurologist. It can often take six months, so you have to book ahead to get in to see one. Most of them seem to be based in the cities. The nurses could do a lot of good work out in the regional areas. 


I look forward to the support of senators from right around the chamber. I hope no-one will oppose this legislation. I look forward to the appointment of the National Rural Health Commissioner. Also, I look forward to meeting that commissioner and having a frank discussion with them and saying: 'Look, here are a few things I can bring to your attention straightaway.' 


I do hope there is support around the chamber. It is all right to have everything in the cities—the specialists, the big hospitals and the good care we see in so many cases—and sometimes in the regional areas we are behind simply for lack of population. You are not going to book into the Inverell hospital for a heart transplant, you are going to go to Saint Vincent's. It is as simple as that: we simply do not have big enough casualties, customers, clients, patients—whatever you want to call them. I do think it is going to be very good thing and I hope it is supported all around. I look forward to meeting the commissioner as soon as possible after the commissioner is appointed.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:15):  I do concur with some of the remarks of Senator Williams—




Senator Williams:
  Not all of them?




Senator O'NEILL:
  Of course, not all of them, Senator Williams. I will take that interjection. Living in a rural community I am not surprised that you wanted to stand up and support the arrival of this commissioner, but again it is from this government in the area of health too little and too late, After breaking so many things, there is a great need for repair. This government's appointment of a National Rural Health Commissioner to oversee health care for the people of remote and rural Australia really needed to happen an awful lot sooner. It would have been a much easier job if so much money had not been ripped out of the health system and if the problems of access to health services had not been so exacerbated during this government's time in power.


I would not envy the commissioner's job because this coalition government, despite the rhetoric and despite the very nice visual appeal of this appointment, continues to run the health system into the ground. It is particularly hurting Australians in the bush. About one-third of our Australian population lives in regional, rural and remote areas and that comes in at around seven million people whose access to services is significantly impaired. That is at the heart of what this commissioner will be told he or she has the responsibility to clean up. 


Sadly, on average, rural, regional and remote Australians do not enjoy the same high standards of health and wellbeing as people living in cities, nor do they experience the same access to health services and health-related infrastructure. The truth is that health-care models that work in urban settings do not necessarily translate to rural or remote settings, where services are necessarily more fragmented and often more difficult to reach. We heard a great deal of evidence in the select committee of the last parliament about the simple cost of transport in getting to vital health services. 


One might have hoped that the NBN might have delivered a line of modern access to services away from where you live but, sadly, the NBN committee in this parliament is only hearing about the disastrous rollout of the NBN. People on Sky Muster and people on the border of Victoria describing very clearly their failure in accessing service in a reliable way. Many of them were asking for their ADSL back because the NBN is so bad. I do not mean the real NBN, but the dodgy, lemon version that we have had inflicted on us by the Abbott and Turnbull governments through their poor decision making.


Distances are clearly greater in the bush, and so attracting and retaining staff in the health sector is a major challenge. With the tearing apart of Medicare Locals, we heard story after story all around regional Australia of the incredible waste in human capital—how people had been recruited to the bush but were held up by this government's mismanagement week after week and month after month to the point where they had no certainty of paying their mortgages in regional or remote Australia and so they simply packed up and headed back to the cities. That is how badly this government, in both its Turnbull and Abbott iterations, has dealt with the challenges of getting great Australian health workers to the bush. They killed off the workforce in their mismanagement of the sector.


Some of the challenges that the rural health commissioner has before him or her include the larger proportions of social disadvantage, higher unemployment rates and reduced access to support services such as allied health, pathology, radiology and investigative disciplines. Those are a lived reality which has only become worse in recent years. Where I live on the Central Coast and in communities further away from our capital city communities have higher morbidity and mortality, and their health care costs are usually higher. That is why the Labor government, instead of putting in a commissioner for rural health, had a policy of putting in place 26 regional cancer centres.


I am very pleased to say that it was a federal Labor government that put in $29 million for Gosford regional cancer centre, with $10 million from the Keneally government in New South Wales, to make sure that people on the Central Coast could finally get public access to cancer treatment, to radiotherapy. That was a practical response to the needs of regional and rural Australia. It is very different from what we are seeing here—wreck it first then bring in a commissioner to clean up the mess that you have made or at least look like they are going to clean up the mess that has been made. Why is this so desperately needed?


If we look at children from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, the reality is right now they continue to be more at risk of death, with their mortality rate 2.3 times higher than non-Indigenous children. Clearly there is a great need for a changed response to access to services and management of that whole process. I sincerely hope that the commissioner can work the miracle of resurrecting access to services for Australians in the terrible context that they will find themselves in, given this government's former health decisions.


The National Rural Health Alliance points out that, despite the high health needs of our remote population, there is around 20 per cent less Medicare funded GP activity in remote Australia compared to the same population in the city. It is not because people are sicker; it is because the system is so sick, so broken. It is because access to people who can provide the health care that you need is so difficult to get that you just cannot get the treatment that you need. You just cannot get to see the people that you need. You cannot afford to travel. You cannot find the person to do the job because the speech pathologist that got recruited out to your area by Medicare Local got stuffed around so much they went back to the city, and now you cannot get that service anymore. That is everywhere across the country, and this government has to take responsibility for the brokenness that it has inflicted on workforce around the country.


That situation is not only bad because of the real life outcomes and impacts it has on ordinary Australians but it is terrible because it is leading to a very aberrant set of behaviours about cost-shifting, with the states having to pour more money into acute hospital care for people from rural and remote areas. Sadly, people with mental health issues from remote communities who are unable to access early intervention services are more frequently hospitalised than their fellow Australians in the city. These are the facts of how terrible things have become under the watch of this government through its series of ministers that it has pushed through the portfolio. Why is it like this?


The government deny many of the decisions they have made. I want to talk about one decision on perinatal depression. The federal government wrote to the nation's health ministers saying that they had just pulled up stumps and were not going to fund it anymore. The original $85 million agreement expired and then there was supposed to be a continuation of it. But that terrible budget in 2014 just saw the money disappear. The letter arrived from the federal health minister, according to the Minister for Health in Queensland. He said, 'I received a letter from the federal health minister, Sussan Ley, telling me they are abandoning this initiative.' That is the kind of public action that this government have taken around health that has led to the decay of services and the increasing need for people to have acute hospital care.


Why would this government bother about it? They do not care because it has shifted the cost onto the states so they can play games with their numbers. Playing games with their numbers is actually costing people their health. In its worst manifestations, it is costing lives, and people in the bush know this. They know that access has become harder to achieve and they know the quality of the services and their capacity to be able to get health care when they need it has decreased under this government.


I want to make some remarks about mental health, particularly. According the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3,027 Australians died by suicide in 2015, and that is a 5.4 per cent increase on the previous year. By all reports, that continues to rise. Sadly, death by suicide continues to disproportionately affect remote and rural Australia, especially Indigenous communities and young men. 


I want to acknowledge in my remarks this evening that this week marks Men's Health Week, and I also made some remarks in the adjournment last night about infant mental health. This year's theme for men's health week—Healthy Body Healthy Mind: Keeping the Balance—explores the way men and boys can keep healthy, physically and emotionally, in a busy and challenging world.      


The challenges facing men and boys in rural and regional communities are very significant. There is considerable difficulty, as I said, in accessing services because of isolation, but also financial difficulties means that support services that are needed cannot be accessed in real times of need but are often delayed—delayed to the point where the need increases to the acute level and, in the worst instances, where, sadly, people feel that they simply cannot go on. Sadly, also, in the context of rural and regional Australia, people have more access to suicide means that are likely to result in immediate death. The commissioner and all levels of government need to focus on a holistic approach to suicide prevention. It is only through working together that we can hope to reduce the impact of suicide in our society. 


We have heard this government prattle on about how they really care about mental health. It is one of Mr Turnbull's signature phrases, but the reality is: he has not put it front and centre as he said he would, and there is a massive mess out there—a mess of his own making—that he has now decided this commissioner should come in and sort out. 


The health department revealed to Senate estimates back in October last year that at that time it was yet to provide any detailed evidence and advice to the government on the Turnbull government's commitment of $20 million to 10 new headspace centres. During the course of the election, Mr Turnbull says: 'Look. I'm going to be your man for mental health. I'm definitely going to be doing something good on mental health. Okay, what'll we do? Let's just come up with—10 headspace centres. How much? $20 million. Any advice from the department? Sorry? No, don't worry about that.' That is not evidence based policymaking but prejudiced policymaking; policymaking that is interested in votes, not people; policymaking that is on the run, not consultative; and policymaking that is made by members of this government in isolation without fair and proper consultation with the states with whom they are in deep partnership with regard to health and without proper consultation with the people in Australia in an open and honest way. 


The smoke and mirrors that this government has managed to manufacture—there is an unbelievable construction of myth around medical support. While I support the need for a commissioner to try and come and rectify some of the worst excesses of this government's decision-making in health, the job that they have created for him or her is enormous—absolutely enormous. 


It has been almost 12 months since the federal election. We have had a change of health minister. We have only got half the promises, half of the commitments, that were promised last year. Four of the five new headspace centres that have been announced have been—wait for it—in Liberal-held seats. In one of those cases, the member for Canning, Andrew Hastie, said that it was his collection of 3,000 signatures that tipped the scales—so much for evidence based decision-making.      


Communities are an important part of decision-making in the country, but that is not what this government said it was about. Yet we have got a member out there saying, 'It's thanks to the groundswell of community support that our efforts have been successful. Today's announcement shows that the federal government is listening and responding to the difficulties faced in the Peel region. I thank Minister Greg Hunt for being so receptive to our call for help.'


We have got a member out there campaigning for headspace, getting signatures from people who have experienced incredible grief and loss through the suicide of their children and their friends and their family playing some political game with this—eking out how long they can drip-feed into the Australian population these headspace centres, which are desperately, desperately needed—instead of a transparent announcement of: 'This is the needs analysis. This is the population data. This is what the health professionals are telling us, and we will get it out as quickly as we can.' No, we have got: 'Let's campaign on it. Let's drip feed it, and we won't tell anybody about our decision-making around this with any clarity.' It is wrong. It is exploitative, it is wrong and it is contemptuous.


According to the member for Hastie, Mr Hunt seems to operate using policy by petition. Until estimates questions are answered, this still remains a murky proposition. We are yet to get information from estimates about the criteria for these centres. The government is quick to maximise political capital, but it is very slow in responding to the urgent needs of vulnerable Australians, which it has exacerbated by bad policy-making in the area of health.


In the interests of the work of the Senate, I will restrict my remarks to those key areas this evening. I know that Senator Griff is going to make a contribution shortly. I simply close with the reality of this. In preparing my remarks this evening, I had a look at the explanatory memorandum. I thought, 'We've had a reprint of the explanatory memorandum', but it was not a reprint. There is one explanatory memorandum. Then there is another one entitled 'Revised explanatory memorandum'. And the final one, an additional page—it talks about the need for the commissioner to actually do something about the workforce—is entitled 'Supplementary explanatory memorandum'.


We do have a very big problem with workforce in rural and regional Australia. I have given some of the reasons why the practical decisions of this government have made that worse. But let us not forget that there was an organisation established under Labor, called Health Workforce Australia, and its job was to plan, to audit and to see that Australians got the support that they needed where they lived. Doctors certainly. The rural specialist program, which has come out of Queensland and is now being replicated around the country, is a great part of giving health care to Australians in the bush.


But this government, with three explanatory memoranda on the appointment of this commission, show that they are making it up as they go. That is because they are not governing with care. They are not governing in a way that explores and really uses the expertise of great Australians working in the health sector. They are using health as a political football and creating a mythology over the top of it to pretend that they actually care about Australians. And while the commissioner is a step in the right direction, I hope I have made clear to those listening this evening that they cannot trust this government on health. A commissioner charged with the scale of repair that is required after the coalition's wrecking of the health system is a piece of window dressing at worst. Please God, let an amazingly talented Australian come in who can do some genuine work to clean up the dog's breakfast of policy making that has been inflicted on the Australian population, particularly those most vulnerable in regional and rural Australia.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2017-06-14,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (18:33):  I rise to briefly speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017, which provides the appointment of a National Rural Health Commissioner. At the outset, I wish to commend the government for this most worthwhile initiative. With roughly one-third of Australians living outside metropolitan areas, the need for this bill speaks for itself. We know that those living in rural areas experience higher rates of chronic disease; have shorter life expectancy; face higher health risk factors such as smoking, drinking and obesity rates; have poorer access to medical and allied health services; and are, on average, older than their city counterparts.


The health needs of these Australians are, in many ways, unique. This bill recognises this and focuses on providing an agenda dedicated solely to addressing the needs of our regional communities. The commissioner will, as we know, be responsible for the development of a new national rural generalist pathway to increase access to training for doctors in regional, rural and remote Australia; for working with the government and the health sector to enhance policy and to promote opportunities for a career in rural health; and for developing options for increased access to training and appropriate remuneration for rural generalists.


I am pleased to see that the government has listened to some of the concerns raised—particularly by those members who represent rural electorates, including Rebecca Sharkey, the member for Mayo. The government's amendments are very much a good first step, but there is no doubt that we need to do much more in this space. In today's day and age, there is absolutely no justification for treating those Australians who live in regional areas as second-class citizens. There is absolutely no reason why they should not have access to the same levels of health care as people living in the metropolitan areas.


The member for Mayo highlighted very succinctly in the other place just how much electorates like hers have to gain from the implementation of this bill. It is not acceptable, for instance, that the Adelaide Hills does not offer its ageing population a renal dialysis service, or that around 1,500 trips have to be made to the city annually by patients so that they can receive that treatment. There are no Medicare rebate machines in the Adelaide Hills region, which means that patients are forced to foot massive medical bills that often they can ill afford. Again, this is another issue that is only in rural and regional Australia.


The Gumeracha Medical Practice, for example, has been forced to fight for funding that was arbitrarily axed because the practice was deemed to be located within 20 kilometres of a town with 50,000 people. This is despite the fact that the practice itself extends its services across a region with a catchment of almost 7,000 people and that it offers services far beyond what would be expected of a small country town GP clinic, including, importantly, providing training opportunities for 40 general practice registrars since 2003.


Another example is the Southern Fleurieu Family Practice, which is struggling to continue its services after having its after-hours services funding withdrawn. That practice is the only medical facility on the west coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula, which covers an area of approximately 450 square kilometres. It services a population of 4,700 people that swells in the summertime to over 16,000 people. If its services fold, patients will be left with no choice but to travel over 30 kilometres to the Victor Harbor hospital, or north more than 50 kilometres to the Noarlunga Hospital. It is not acceptable that all of the South Australian radiation facilities for patients with cancer are within 15 kilometres of the Adelaide CBD and that rural patients always have to travel to Adelaide for treatment.


We anticipate that the National Rural Health Commissioner will put a spotlight on all of these issues, and, importantly, help rural people get the health care that they deserve. These issues are certainly not unique to South Australia's regional areas. According to an ABC report the hundreds of kilometres of roads leading to larger places like Orange, Dubbo and Canberra are well-worn for many patients, who often have to wait weeks for even the most basic health services in their local district. There are very real fears that if basic medical facilities are not built and supported that some of these communities will slowly be wiped out.


Often, what we do not think about is that it is not as simple as hopping in the car and driving to the nearest metropolitan area for treatment. In many instances, partners are required to take time off work, alternative arrangements have to be made for the kids and sometimes it will mean an overnight stay and so accommodation will also be required. Seeking basic health care can significantly impact on a patient's ability to maintain a job, as a person from a rural area may need two to three days off work for something that a person from a metropolitan area can do in a morning or an afternoon. If these trips are required on a regular basis they can also have profound effects on the family unit, never mind the family budget.


The establishment of a rural commissioner is, as I said, a good first step. But we need to do all we can to ensure that the sorts of situations I just outlined are addressed—that a person living in regional Australia can visit the doctor during business hours or after hours without worrying about whether the consultation will eat into their weekly income and that they can visit a doctor without needing to travel 20, 30 or 50 kilometres for that consultation.


A good next step would also be allowing the use of Telehealth for GP-delivered mental health services. Suicide and mental health issues in particular are made even more significant by isolation and distance.


The fact that there will be a greater emphasis on training for doctors in regional areas and career opportunities in rural health is something that has been wanting for a very long time. As it is, so few doctors are electing to go into GP training. In the past decade, only one in 11 doctors in training have decided to become GPs—and that is a staggering number. The rest choose to go into specialist training, and this has been impacting on the availability of GPs for regional and rural areas significantly. In my home state of South Australia, the shortage of generalist doctors has, in recent times, seen doctors at breaking point, with many of them complaining that they have had to do 24-hour emergency department shifts to cope with staff shortages. National health workforce figures show that, in 2012, there was double the number of doctors for city residents compared to regional and remote areas—437 medical practitioners per 100,000 people in the major cities, compared with 262 for inner regional areas, 247 for outer regional areas and 274 for remote areas. Many regional and rural communities are now at crisis point and it is imperative that decisive action be taken to address these shortages. The development of a pathway to increase access to training and promote career opportunities in rural health is key to addressing this issue.


We will be watching closely to ensure that this bill results in real outcomes for Australian families in regional and rural areas, and we will be watching to ensure that this is the first instalment in a series of measures aimed at strengthening our regional communities even further. With those few words, I support the second reading of this bill.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:41):  It is a pleasure to deliver these summing-up remarks in relation to the Health Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017—indeed, particularly as I was the minister at the time who announced this. I place on record my congratulations to the member for Lyne, Dr Gillespie—the good Dr Dave—for the work he has done in making this a reality. He has done a tremendous job.


This bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 for the purpose of establishing Australia's first National Rural Health Commissioner. This government recognises the many challenges of delivery, access and provision of health services in rural, regional and remote Australia. The most pressing concern is a lack of access to training for doctors and health professionals who practice outside of our major cities. Establishing the National Rural Health Commissioner will ensure this issue is front and centre of the government's rural health agenda. The National Rural Health Commissioner will be an independent statutory office holder who will champion the cause of rural health, provide expert advice to government and report directly to the responsible minister for rural health. The first priority of the National Rural Health Commissioner will be to develop a national rural generalist pathway which will improve access to training for doctors in rural, regional and remote Australia and consider options for appropriate remuneration for rural generalists.


In recognition of the importance of the commissioner's role, the government has introduced its own amendments that will clarify the scope of the commissioner's role and review the role 12 months before cessation and, finally, an amendment that will direct the commissioner to consider the advice of the Rural Health Stakeholder Roundtable and the Distribution Working Group. The two other amendments of this bill are the repeal of sections 3GC and 19AD of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Repealing section 3GC of the act will remove the duplication of functions between the Medical Training Review Panel and the National Medical Training Advisory Network. It will also simplify legislation in the Health portfolio. Under section 19AD, a review was required every five years into the operation of the Medicare provider legislation in the Health Insurance Act 1973. These previous reviews have been costly, time consuming and resource intensive and have not provided any operational improvements to the application of the legislation.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all senators for their contributions to this bill. Appointing the National Rural Health Commissioner is an important step forward in the government's aim to improve the access and provision of health services for all Australians who live outside of our major cities. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the many rural health stakeholders and organisations around the nation, many of whom I have worked with, who have welcomed our decision to establish a National Rural Health Commissioner. We are looking forward to working closely with the commissioner, rural health stakeholders and organisations over the coming years to achieve our shared aim of delivering a quality standard of health care for our rural, regional and remote communities. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:06):  I would like to continue following the brief start that I had for about 30 seconds on this legislation when I first spoke. This is a really good plan put forward by the member for Lyne, David Gillespie—a national rural health commissioner to actually look at the health issues in rural and regional areas and give frank assessments and opinions to the ministers. 


There are many things that we could do within regional areas. One that I am promoting at the moment is neurological nurses throughout not only New South Wales, but Australia, for people with Parkinson's disease—such as I have; so far, so good—but also that terrible disease of motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis. We have just three of those such nurses in New South Wales. I believe there is one at Nowra, one at Wagga Wagga and one at Coffs Harbour. A motion passed at the New South Wales Nationals conference at Broken Hill a couple of weeks ago, and my good colleague Senator Nash was there, to see that the federal government along with the state governments provide 50-50 funding for these neurological nurses. That is one thing we need to discuss with this health commissioner when this commissioner is appointed. I would hope that this legislation would be supported right around the chamber.


Another thing that we are short of, especially in many remote areas, are dentists. Early in this job—eight years or so ago—we received an increase in our electoral allowance payments of some $4,800 a year. Since that very day, I have donated the $4,800 a year to a rural dental scholarship, actually managed by the National Rural Health Alliance, where a first-year dentistry student going to university receives my $4,800—$400 a month—for the 12 months. It is a big assistance to anyone, but especially a university student who has to travel and get accommodation. On a verbal commitment, they come from a rural or regional background and they will return to those areas to practise when they become a fully qualified and professional dentist. I have actually put a bit of money into that and I am very proud to say that we have now paid out some $40,000 in sponsoring my dental scholarship.


There are many things we need in regional Australia as far as health goes. So what will be the role of this health commissioner? How will it work? The commissioner will work across all levels of government to improve rural health policies and champion the cause of rural practice. The first task of the commissioner will be to develop a national rural generalist pathway. Working with the sector and training providers to define what is to be a rural generalist, the commissioner will develop options for increased access to training and appropriate remuneration for rural generalists, recognising their extra skills. While the commissioner's first priority is the development of the pathway, their role will be much broader and will include consultation with stakeholders to give consideration to the nursing, dental health, Indigenous health, mental health, midwifery and allied health needs in rural and remote Australia. Dentistry has been mentioned again.


For the benefit of the whips, I will not be speaking my full term of 20 minutes. That might put you on notice as to who your next speaker is. 



Senator Urquhart interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Thank you for the thumbs up, Senator Urquhart. What we are being told—and I have no reason to doubt this—is that the National Rural Health Commissioner will be very frank in his or her assessment. That is the point of the job. It is for them to look at the details, assess the details, assess the problems, come up with solutions and give frank opinions and directions to our health ministers, regardless of who is in government. I would hope this is supported right around the chamber. The National Rural Health Commissioner will be there for decades to come. 


We talked earlier in the debate about housing prices and foreign investors. There is plenty of room in regional Australia for people to move to. There are plenty of jobs. Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, you would be familiar with the huge argument we had about the backpackers tax and what to charge them, because we need them to work in our abattoirs and to pick our fruit—the seasonal work. We have more than 700,000 Australians unemployed. Why aren't they going out to pick the fruit or to work in abattoirs? That always amazes me. Perhaps we are a bit soft when we actually pay people not to work. When I was a young fella, we did not have enough land to support my father, my brother and me, so I learnt to drive a truck and to sheer sheep. I was never unemployed as a result. Shearing sheep is not the easiest job going, but I was young and fit in those days—a bit different from now. Age does weary us. 


This is a situation where we want people in regional Australia. We have already seen the government working actively in that direction with APVMA and many other government institutions being moved out to the regions, freeing up the housing in the cities. We have the land. We have the housing. The population actually grows jobs. The more population in a town, the more teachers, the more nurses, the more doctors, the more police are needed—the more everything is needed. Population in and of itself builds jobs. If you do not believe me then ask what Canberra had 100 years ago. It probably had some cattle—beef cattle, dairy cattle—some sheep and a few farmers. There was probably a little village somewhere, with a general store. Look at it now. This is a classic example of regional development. 


The National Rural Health Commissioner will play a major role as the regional areas grow—and I am sure they will in time. People will be forced out of the cities because of the simple fact that they will not be able to afford to buy a house. Where I live in Inverell, a lovely town, there is ample water supply—no water restrictions. There are never water restrictions. Even in the biggest drought we do not have water restrictions, thankfully, because of the Copeton Dam water supply. You can buy a good home in Inverell for $300,000. When I say a 'good home' I mean a three-bedroom, brick veneer home on an 800-square metre block in a nice area, a quiet area, of town. That is not a lot of the money; $300,000 would not buy you a dog kennel in Sydney. 


As we grow the regions, it will be vital that the National Rural Health Commissioner provide frank assessments of the things that we need in regional areas as far as health goes. Sure, we are lucky in this country. If you are in a spot of bother or in a serious spot of bother, we have the helicopters, the air ambulances. Those things are there for an emergency. But more than that is needed. There are the aged care facilities. There is the general hospital for people who are just recovering from a minor or, in some cases, even major surgery. Of course, there is a shortage of dentists. As I said, I will be keen to see the neurological nurses established right throughout Australia to take a bit of the load off the GPs. Also, it takes a long time to get in to see a neurologist. It can often take six months, so you have to book ahead to get in to see one. Most of them seem to be based in the cities. The nurses could do a lot of good work out in the regional areas. 


I look forward to the support of senators from right around the chamber. I hope no-one will oppose this legislation. I look forward to the appointment of the National Rural Health Commissioner. Also, I look forward to meeting that commissioner and having a frank discussion with them and saying: 'Look, here are a few things I can bring to your attention straightaway.' 


I do hope there is support around the chamber. It is all right to have everything in the cities—the specialists, the big hospitals and the good care we see in so many cases—and sometimes in the regional areas we are behind simply for lack of population. You are not going to book into the Inverell hospital for a heart transplant, you are going to go to Saint Vincent's. It is as simple as that: we simply do not have big enough casualties, customers, clients, patients—whatever you want to call them. I do think it is going to be very good thing and I hope it is supported all around. I look forward to meeting the commissioner as soon as possible after the commissioner is appointed.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:15):  I do concur with some of the remarks of Senator Williams—




Senator Williams:
  Not all of them?




Senator O'NEILL:
  Of course, not all of them, Senator Williams. I will take that interjection. Living in a rural community I am not surprised that you wanted to stand up and support the arrival of this commissioner, but again it is from this government in the area of health too little and too late, After breaking so many things, there is a great need for repair. This government's appointment of a National Rural Health Commissioner to oversee health care for the people of remote and rural Australia really needed to happen an awful lot sooner. It would have been a much easier job if so much money had not been ripped out of the health system and if the problems of access to health services had not been so exacerbated during this government's time in power.


I would not envy the commissioner's job because this coalition government, despite the rhetoric and despite the very nice visual appeal of this appointment, continues to run the health system into the ground. It is particularly hurting Australians in the bush. About one-third of our Australian population lives in regional, rural and remote areas and that comes in at around seven million people whose access to services is significantly impaired. That is at the heart of what this commissioner will be told he or she has the responsibility to clean up. 


Sadly, on average, rural, regional and remote Australians do not enjoy the same high standards of health and wellbeing as people living in cities, nor do they experience the same access to health services and health-related infrastructure. The truth is that health-care models that work in urban settings do not necessarily translate to rural or remote settings, where services are necessarily more fragmented and often more difficult to reach. We heard a great deal of evidence in the select committee of the last parliament about the simple cost of transport in getting to vital health services. 


One might have hoped that the NBN might have delivered a line of modern access to services away from where you live but, sadly, the NBN committee in this parliament is only hearing about the disastrous rollout of the NBN. People on Sky Muster and people on the border of Victoria describing very clearly their failure in accessing service in a reliable way. Many of them were asking for their ADSL back because the NBN is so bad. I do not mean the real NBN, but the dodgy, lemon version that we have had inflicted on us by the Abbott and Turnbull governments through their poor decision making.


Distances are clearly greater in the bush, and so attracting and retaining staff in the health sector is a major challenge. With the tearing apart of Medicare Locals, we heard story after story all around regional Australia of the incredible waste in human capital—how people had been recruited to the bush but were held up by this government's mismanagement week after week and month after month to the point where they had no certainty of paying their mortgages in regional or remote Australia and so they simply packed up and headed back to the cities. That is how badly this government, in both its Turnbull and Abbott iterations, has dealt with the challenges of getting great Australian health workers to the bush. They killed off the workforce in their mismanagement of the sector.


Some of the challenges that the rural health commissioner has before him or her include the larger proportions of social disadvantage, higher unemployment rates and reduced access to support services such as allied health, pathology, radiology and investigative disciplines. Those are a lived reality which has only become worse in recent years. Where I live on the Central Coast and in communities further away from our capital city communities have higher morbidity and mortality, and their health care costs are usually higher. That is why the Labor government, instead of putting in a commissioner for rural health, had a policy of putting in place 26 regional cancer centres.


I am very pleased to say that it was a federal Labor government that put in $29 million for Gosford regional cancer centre, with $10 million from the Keneally government in New South Wales, to make sure that people on the Central Coast could finally get public access to cancer treatment, to radiotherapy. That was a practical response to the needs of regional and rural Australia. It is very different from what we are seeing here—wreck it first then bring in a commissioner to clean up the mess that you have made or at least look like they are going to clean up the mess that has been made. Why is this so desperately needed?


If we look at children from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, the reality is right now they continue to be more at risk of death, with their mortality rate 2.3 times higher than non-Indigenous children. Clearly there is a great need for a changed response to access to services and management of that whole process. I sincerely hope that the commissioner can work the miracle of resurrecting access to services for Australians in the terrible context that they will find themselves in, given this government's former health decisions.


The National Rural Health Alliance points out that, despite the high health needs of our remote population, there is around 20 per cent less Medicare funded GP activity in remote Australia compared to the same population in the city. It is not because people are sicker; it is because the system is so sick, so broken. It is because access to people who can provide the health care that you need is so difficult to get that you just cannot get the treatment that you need. You just cannot get to see the people that you need. You cannot afford to travel. You cannot find the person to do the job because the speech pathologist that got recruited out to your area by Medicare Local got stuffed around so much they went back to the city, and now you cannot get that service anymore. That is everywhere across the country, and this government has to take responsibility for the brokenness that it has inflicted on workforce around the country.


That situation is not only bad because of the real life outcomes and impacts it has on ordinary Australians but it is terrible because it is leading to a very aberrant set of behaviours about cost-shifting, with the states having to pour more money into acute hospital care for people from rural and remote areas. Sadly, people with mental health issues from remote communities who are unable to access early intervention services are more frequently hospitalised than their fellow Australians in the city. These are the facts of how terrible things have become under the watch of this government through its series of ministers that it has pushed through the portfolio. Why is it like this?


The government deny many of the decisions they have made. I want to talk about one decision on perinatal depression. The federal government wrote to the nation's health ministers saying that they had just pulled up stumps and were not going to fund it anymore. The original $85 million agreement expired and then there was supposed to be a continuation of it. But that terrible budget in 2014 just saw the money disappear. The letter arrived from the federal health minister, according to the Minister for Health in Queensland. He said, 'I received a letter from the federal health minister, Sussan Ley, telling me they are abandoning this initiative.' That is the kind of public action that this government have taken around health that has led to the decay of services and the increasing need for people to have acute hospital care.


Why would this government bother about it? They do not care because it has shifted the cost onto the states so they can play games with their numbers. Playing games with their numbers is actually costing people their health. In its worst manifestations, it is costing lives, and people in the bush know this. They know that access has become harder to achieve and they know the quality of the services and their capacity to be able to get health care when they need it has decreased under this government.


I want to make some remarks about mental health, particularly. According the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 3,027 Australians died by suicide in 2015, and that is a 5.4 per cent increase on the previous year. By all reports, that continues to rise. Sadly, death by suicide continues to disproportionately affect remote and rural Australia, especially Indigenous communities and young men. 


I want to acknowledge in my remarks this evening that this week marks Men's Health Week, and I also made some remarks in the adjournment last night about infant mental health. This year's theme for men's health week—Healthy Body Healthy Mind: Keeping the Balance—explores the way men and boys can keep healthy, physically and emotionally, in a busy and challenging world.      


The challenges facing men and boys in rural and regional communities are very significant. There is considerable difficulty, as I said, in accessing services because of isolation, but also financial difficulties means that support services that are needed cannot be accessed in real times of need but are often delayed—delayed to the point where the need increases to the acute level and, in the worst instances, where, sadly, people feel that they simply cannot go on. Sadly, also, in the context of rural and regional Australia, people have more access to suicide means that are likely to result in immediate death. The commissioner and all levels of government need to focus on a holistic approach to suicide prevention. It is only through working together that we can hope to reduce the impact of suicide in our society. 


We have heard this government prattle on about how they really care about mental health. It is one of Mr Turnbull's signature phrases, but the reality is: he has not put it front and centre as he said he would, and there is a massive mess out there—a mess of his own making—that he has now decided this commissioner should come in and sort out. 


The health department revealed to Senate estimates back in October last year that at that time it was yet to provide any detailed evidence and advice to the government on the Turnbull government's commitment of $20 million to 10 new headspace centres. During the course of the election, Mr Turnbull says: 'Look. I'm going to be your man for mental health. I'm definitely going to be doing something good on mental health. Okay, what'll we do? Let's just come up with—10 headspace centres. How much? $20 million. Any advice from the department? Sorry? No, don't worry about that.' That is not evidence based policymaking but prejudiced policymaking; policymaking that is interested in votes, not people; policymaking that is on the run, not consultative; and policymaking that is made by members of this government in isolation without fair and proper consultation with the states with whom they are in deep partnership with regard to health and without proper consultation with the people in Australia in an open and honest way. 


The smoke and mirrors that this government has managed to manufacture—there is an unbelievable construction of myth around medical support. While I support the need for a commissioner to try and come and rectify some of the worst excesses of this government's decision-making in health, the job that they have created for him or her is enormous—absolutely enormous. 


It has been almost 12 months since the federal election. We have had a change of health minister. We have only got half the promises, half of the commitments, that were promised last year. Four of the five new headspace centres that have been announced have been—wait for it—in Liberal-held seats. In one of those cases, the member for Canning, Andrew Hastie, said that it was his collection of 3,000 signatures that tipped the scales—so much for evidence based decision-making.      


Communities are an important part of decision-making in the country, but that is not what this government said it was about. Yet we have got a member out there saying, 'It's thanks to the groundswell of community support that our efforts have been successful. Today's announcement shows that the federal government is listening and responding to the difficulties faced in the Peel region. I thank Minister Greg Hunt for being so receptive to our call for help.'


We have got a member out there campaigning for headspace, getting signatures from people who have experienced incredible grief and loss through the suicide of their children and their friends and their family playing some political game with this—eking out how long they can drip-feed into the Australian population these headspace centres, which are desperately, desperately needed—instead of a transparent announcement of: 'This is the needs analysis. This is the population data. This is what the health professionals are telling us, and we will get it out as quickly as we can.' No, we have got: 'Let's campaign on it. Let's drip feed it, and we won't tell anybody about our decision-making around this with any clarity.' It is wrong. It is exploitative, it is wrong and it is contemptuous.


According to the member for Hastie, Mr Hunt seems to operate using policy by petition. Until estimates questions are answered, this still remains a murky proposition. We are yet to get information from estimates about the criteria for these centres. The government is quick to maximise political capital, but it is very slow in responding to the urgent needs of vulnerable Australians, which it has exacerbated by bad policy-making in the area of health.


In the interests of the work of the Senate, I will restrict my remarks to those key areas this evening. I know that Senator Griff is going to make a contribution shortly. I simply close with the reality of this. In preparing my remarks this evening, I had a look at the explanatory memorandum. I thought, 'We've had a reprint of the explanatory memorandum', but it was not a reprint. There is one explanatory memorandum. Then there is another one entitled 'Revised explanatory memorandum'. And the final one, an additional page—it talks about the need for the commissioner to actually do something about the workforce—is entitled 'Supplementary explanatory memorandum'.


We do have a very big problem with workforce in rural and regional Australia. I have given some of the reasons why the practical decisions of this government have made that worse. But let us not forget that there was an organisation established under Labor, called Health Workforce Australia, and its job was to plan, to audit and to see that Australians got the support that they needed where they lived. Doctors certainly. The rural specialist program, which has come out of Queensland and is now being replicated around the country, is a great part of giving health care to Australians in the bush.


But this government, with three explanatory memoranda on the appointment of this commission, show that they are making it up as they go. That is because they are not governing with care. They are not governing in a way that explores and really uses the expertise of great Australians working in the health sector. They are using health as a political football and creating a mythology over the top of it to pretend that they actually care about Australians. And while the commissioner is a step in the right direction, I hope I have made clear to those listening this evening that they cannot trust this government on health. A commissioner charged with the scale of repair that is required after the coalition's wrecking of the health system is a piece of window dressing at worst. Please God, let an amazingly talented Australian come in who can do some genuine work to clean up the dog's breakfast of policy making that has been inflicted on the Australian population, particularly those most vulnerable in regional and rural Australia.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2017-06-14,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (18:33):  I rise to briefly speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017, which provides the appointment of a National Rural Health Commissioner. At the outset, I wish to commend the government for this most worthwhile initiative. With roughly one-third of Australians living outside metropolitan areas, the need for this bill speaks for itself. We know that those living in rural areas experience higher rates of chronic disease; have shorter life expectancy; face higher health risk factors such as smoking, drinking and obesity rates; have poorer access to medical and allied health services; and are, on average, older than their city counterparts.


The health needs of these Australians are, in many ways, unique. This bill recognises this and focuses on providing an agenda dedicated solely to addressing the needs of our regional communities. The commissioner will, as we know, be responsible for the development of a new national rural generalist pathway to increase access to training for doctors in regional, rural and remote Australia; for working with the government and the health sector to enhance policy and to promote opportunities for a career in rural health; and for developing options for increased access to training and appropriate remuneration for rural generalists.


I am pleased to see that the government has listened to some of the concerns raised—particularly by those members who represent rural electorates, including Rebecca Sharkey, the member for Mayo. The government's amendments are very much a good first step, but there is no doubt that we need to do much more in this space. In today's day and age, there is absolutely no justification for treating those Australians who live in regional areas as second-class citizens. There is absolutely no reason why they should not have access to the same levels of health care as people living in the metropolitan areas.


The member for Mayo highlighted very succinctly in the other place just how much electorates like hers have to gain from the implementation of this bill. It is not acceptable, for instance, that the Adelaide Hills does not offer its ageing population a renal dialysis service, or that around 1,500 trips have to be made to the city annually by patients so that they can receive that treatment. There are no Medicare rebate machines in the Adelaide Hills region, which means that patients are forced to foot massive medical bills that often they can ill afford. Again, this is another issue that is only in rural and regional Australia.


The Gumeracha Medical Practice, for example, has been forced to fight for funding that was arbitrarily axed because the practice was deemed to be located within 20 kilometres of a town with 50,000 people. This is despite the fact that the practice itself extends its services across a region with a catchment of almost 7,000 people and that it offers services far beyond what would be expected of a small country town GP clinic, including, importantly, providing training opportunities for 40 general practice registrars since 2003.


Another example is the Southern Fleurieu Family Practice, which is struggling to continue its services after having its after-hours services funding withdrawn. That practice is the only medical facility on the west coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula, which covers an area of approximately 450 square kilometres. It services a population of 4,700 people that swells in the summertime to over 16,000 people. If its services fold, patients will be left with no choice but to travel over 30 kilometres to the Victor Harbor hospital, or north more than 50 kilometres to the Noarlunga Hospital. It is not acceptable that all of the South Australian radiation facilities for patients with cancer are within 15 kilometres of the Adelaide CBD and that rural patients always have to travel to Adelaide for treatment.


We anticipate that the National Rural Health Commissioner will put a spotlight on all of these issues, and, importantly, help rural people get the health care that they deserve. These issues are certainly not unique to South Australia's regional areas. According to an ABC report the hundreds of kilometres of roads leading to larger places like Orange, Dubbo and Canberra are well-worn for many patients, who often have to wait weeks for even the most basic health services in their local district. There are very real fears that if basic medical facilities are not built and supported that some of these communities will slowly be wiped out.


Often, what we do not think about is that it is not as simple as hopping in the car and driving to the nearest metropolitan area for treatment. In many instances, partners are required to take time off work, alternative arrangements have to be made for the kids and sometimes it will mean an overnight stay and so accommodation will also be required. Seeking basic health care can significantly impact on a patient's ability to maintain a job, as a person from a rural area may need two to three days off work for something that a person from a metropolitan area can do in a morning or an afternoon. If these trips are required on a regular basis they can also have profound effects on the family unit, never mind the family budget.


The establishment of a rural commissioner is, as I said, a good first step. But we need to do all we can to ensure that the sorts of situations I just outlined are addressed—that a person living in regional Australia can visit the doctor during business hours or after hours without worrying about whether the consultation will eat into their weekly income and that they can visit a doctor without needing to travel 20, 30 or 50 kilometres for that consultation.


A good next step would also be allowing the use of Telehealth for GP-delivered mental health services. Suicide and mental health issues in particular are made even more significant by isolation and distance.


The fact that there will be a greater emphasis on training for doctors in regional areas and career opportunities in rural health is something that has been wanting for a very long time. As it is, so few doctors are electing to go into GP training. In the past decade, only one in 11 doctors in training have decided to become GPs—and that is a staggering number. The rest choose to go into specialist training, and this has been impacting on the availability of GPs for regional and rural areas significantly. In my home state of South Australia, the shortage of generalist doctors has, in recent times, seen doctors at breaking point, with many of them complaining that they have had to do 24-hour emergency department shifts to cope with staff shortages. National health workforce figures show that, in 2012, there was double the number of doctors for city residents compared to regional and remote areas—437 medical practitioners per 100,000 people in the major cities, compared with 262 for inner regional areas, 247 for outer regional areas and 274 for remote areas. Many regional and rural communities are now at crisis point and it is imperative that decisive action be taken to address these shortages. The development of a pathway to increase access to training and promote career opportunities in rural health is key to addressing this issue.


We will be watching closely to ensure that this bill results in real outcomes for Australian families in regional and rural areas, and we will be watching to ensure that this is the first instalment in a series of measures aimed at strengthening our regional communities even further. With those few words, I support the second reading of this bill.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2017-06-14,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:41):  It is a pleasure to deliver these summing-up remarks in relation to the Health Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017—indeed, particularly as I was the minister at the time who announced this. I place on record my congratulations to the member for Lyne, Dr Gillespie—the good Dr Dave—for the work he has done in making this a reality. He has done a tremendous job.


This bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 for the purpose of establishing Australia's first National Rural Health Commissioner. This government recognises the many challenges of delivery, access and provision of health services in rural, regional and remote Australia. The most pressing concern is a lack of access to training for doctors and health professionals who practice outside of our major cities. Establishing the National Rural Health Commissioner will ensure this issue is front and centre of the government's rural health agenda. The National Rural Health Commissioner will be an independent statutory office holder who will champion the cause of rural health, provide expert advice to government and report directly to the responsible minister for rural health. The first priority of the National Rural Health Commissioner will be to develop a national rural generalist pathway which will improve access to training for doctors in rural, regional and remote Australia and consider options for appropriate remuneration for rural generalists.


In recognition of the importance of the commissioner's role, the government has introduced its own amendments that will clarify the scope of the commissioner's role and review the role 12 months before cessation and, finally, an amendment that will direct the commissioner to consider the advice of the Rural Health Stakeholder Roundtable and the Distribution Working Group. The two other amendments of this bill are the repeal of sections 3GC and 19AD of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Repealing section 3GC of the act will remove the duplication of functions between the Medical Training Review Panel and the National Medical Training Advisory Network. It will also simplify legislation in the Health portfolio. Under section 19AD, a review was required every five years into the operation of the Medicare provider legislation in the Health Insurance Act 1973. These previous reviews have been costly, time consuming and resource intensive and have not provided any operational improvements to the application of the legislation.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all senators for their contributions to this bill. Appointing the National Rural Health Commissioner is an important step forward in the government's aim to improve the access and provision of health services for all Australians who live outside of our major cities. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the many rural health stakeholders and organisations around the nation, many of whom I have worked with, who have welcomed our decision to establish a National Rural Health Commissioner. We are looking forward to working closely with the commissioner, rural health stakeholders and organisations over the coming years to achieve our shared aim of delivering a quality standard of health care for our rural, regional and remote communities. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-06-14,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I am going to be fairly brief tonight, but I do want to take this opportunity—and I know that there will be a more formal opportunity next week—to congratulate you, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, on the incredible service you have had in this chamber and in this Senate. We were all shocked and saddened to see your decision to retire from politics, which I know you made for your reasons. I do not understand why anyone would ever want to leave this place! The idea that you would want to retire strikes me as very odd and strange behaviour. But apparently there is a world outside this place—hopefully, I will never have to experience it!


Tonight I briefly want to touch on something that is very hard for a Sydneysider like me to do, and that is to talk about another city. I want to talk about the City of Launceston, that I was privileged to be able to visit with Ross Hart, the local MP, and with Senator Helen Polley, who is the shadow assistant minister for ageing and the shadow assistant minister to the leader for Tasmania, a few Fridays ago.


The City of Launceston—it is very hard for us—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Dastyari, if I can assist you with your future in Tasmania, it is pronounced 'lonceston'.




Senator DASTYARI:
  That was the joke—there is an ongoing joke.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Right, thank you!




Senator Smith:
  Let's see if you get it right next time!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Senator Polley and I have an ongoing joke about this. We made a social media video  about it. It is on a thing called the internet—it is very new; it will catch up with you in Western Australia soon, Senator Smith. It will be about three hours late but it will catch up with you eventually!


It is very hard for those of us from Sydney to be able to praise another city, because when you live in perfection being somewhere else and seeing somewhere else is always a case of, 'What's wrong about this place?' The fact is that there you have city where the housing is affordable, the public transport is accessible, you do not have to spend three hours in a car to go seven kilometres, the air is clean and it is quite a beautiful place. I would have to say that—




Senator Smith:
  Will you talk about the unfair GST distribution?




Senator DASTYARI:
  Senator Smith makes the observation that it is all those things because of WA's money. I will leave that to him and to others.


I believe that places like Sydney have more to learn from these cities than these cities have to learn from Sydney. In one day we were able to have a look at some of the infrastructure projects that still need to be funded in that city, we were able to sit down and talk about the health of the Tamar River and we were able to spend some time with the editor of the local paper, talking about how it is that they could have a regional paper in a city like that surviving so well when large mastheads in places like Sydney are actually struggling to survive. How is it that these smaller papers are so profitable when something as large as The Sydney Morning Herald, with the base that it should have, is not actually commercially viable in its current printed form?


We were able to spend some time at the Saint John Craft Beer Bar, a local brewery. Again, if you look at the liquor industry in a place like Tasmania it is new and it is growing. It is fantastic. There is the big scotch industry, the gin industry and a craft beer industry, which are all growing. Frankly, I could spend all day there and be a very happy man!


After that we visited some students from Launceston College and spoke to them about their future and the decisions they are making to go to university. Finally, we looked at some of the infrastructure spending and opportunities that are there. And we spent time at Definium Technologies so I particularly want to thank Mike Cruse, who took us on a tour.


Ross Hart, the local member of parliament for that area, and Senator Polley were very keen to broaden some of my experiences. They had the view, and said in jest on several occasions, 'Sam, the whole world is not Sydney!' I think that was a lie! But if you want to understand opportunities and what can happen perhaps spending a bit more time outside Sydney and in regional Tasmania—not on a Bill Shorten bus!—is perhaps the more appropriate way to try to see things. I want to thank them for that opportunity. I was able to walk away from that experience with a much better understanding of not just regional Tasmania, but also how is it that a city like Sydney can actually benefit from learning from a city like theirs.


I do want to touch on one matter that I want to clarify. In the morning I did a radio interview with Brian Carlton from Tasmania Talks. It was a long, lengthy interview that covered a range of topics. During that interview, I spoke specifically around matters to do with fundraising and other matters, and I made some references to Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz contacted me afterwards and felt that, in the review of it that he was given, I had been unkind and made untoward remarks about him. Again, I think in the full context of the interview that certainly was not the intention, but Senator Abetz is right: having a look at a snippet of that would certainly leave you with that opinion. I have privately apologised to Senator Abetz for that. I want to take the opportunity, formally, in the chamber, to express those apologies. Look, Senator Abetz and I have had many arguments about policy in this place. He is a very distinguished senator. He was Leader of the Government in the Senate—an incredibly important position—and even though, from a policy perspective, he and I have always seen things very, very differently, he is a person of incredible personal integrity and I would never want to wrongfully leave an impression of anything other than that. I do not know what the formal language is, but I have apologised to Senator Abetz. You can never really withdraw comments you have made in the public arena, but you can apologise for them. So, Senator Abetz, I want to formally acknowledge the high regard that I hold you in.


That being said, again, it is a great city. It was a great experience. I learnt more about Sydney from being there than perhaps they learnt from me. Maybe that is what makes us Sydneysiders so proud, that we can even go to another city and still take more than we give. Thank you.
