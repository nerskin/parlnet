Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add:


""but the Senate calls on the Government to:


(a) appoint a National Vocational Education and Training Ombudsman who would have the power to investigate consumer complaints and order the refund of course fees where Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) have been found to act unscrupulously, either to the student directly or the Government, whichever is applicable, resulting in the student discharging any related VET FEE-HELP debt;


(b) support the call for the Auditor-General to conduct an audit on the use of VET-FEE-HELP;


(c) amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to impose caps on tuition fee amount similar to the student contribution caps for HECS-HELP;


(d) reduce the lifetime loan limit for VET FEE-HELP to half the current amount;


(e) ban or directly regulate brokers or marketing agents; and


(f) provide the Department and the Minister with the necessary statutory powers to suspend VET FEE-HELP payments to providers which are under investigation"".


This bill is grossly inadequate as a response to the crisis in Australia's vocational education and training sector. We have a litany of advice as to why that is the case—and we now have the government's acknowledgement of that. At a quarter past 12 today the government chose to brief the opposition—and they did not actually go to the right place to do that. They chose to advise the opposition, through Sharon Bird, that the government intends to move four additional amendments to its own legislation dealing with a series of matters highlighting just how deep the malaise is, which the government is now finally coming to understand. While the Labor Party does not oppose the provisions in themselves, we do think the government should have talked to us a little earlier than on the eve of the bill actually being put into this chamber for debate. It shows you the arrogance of some of the members of the House of Representatives that they treat this chamber in such a contemptuous way.


These are serious matters. A full Senate inquiry into these matters commenced last year. We have had denial from the government throughout this period. They have tried to find a scapegoat—that the problems were essentially down to the Labor Party, for measures first introduced in 2007. And now, of course, there is this minute-to-midnight series of amendments that the government wants us to consider. But they are not prepared to give us an undertaking in terms of what they have got to say about the opposition's amendments, which have been on the public record for some considerable time. I am concerned that the bill, as printed, tinkers at the edges of the problem and does not deal with the substance. And it appears that the government agrees with me, because it has chosen now to move this minute-to-midnight series of amendments, the details of which we have been briefed on but have not actually seen.


This bill relies on an assumption that we should just trust people. It does not turn off the tap for the money that has been flowing to the rorters who have brought such discredit to our vocational education system. It relies on the capacity of the Department of Education and ASQA to actually do the job. Well, I think that is a proposition that has been sorely tested. Both of these agencies have been found wanting, yet we are asked to trust in the capacity of agencies which have badly let the team down over the last two years. So the opposition is proposing amendments to give this legislation real teeth.


The gravity of the crisis should not be a surprise to anyone in this chamber given the cascade of media reports about dodgy private colleges, soaring debts and, of course, the extraordinary abuse of students that we have seen across the country. A systematic rorting of billions of dollars has been undertaken on this government's watch. These reports confirm the material presented to this chamber by the Senate inquiry into VET FEE-HELP loans. I know that, up until recently, it has been the view of the government that we should try to pretend these things are not happening. But the reports cannot be dismissed.


The collapse just this week of Vocation, one of the largest private providers, surely brings it home that the chickens are roosting. Vocation Ltd was the first listed training provider to call in the administrators. Yesterday, less than a week after the company was placed under voluntary administration, it ceased operations and closed up shop. The withdrawal of public funds after a quality review by the governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland meant that Vocation's colleges—and there were a whole series of them—were not able to be viable. The collapse has put 180 staff immediately out of work and leaves 12,000 students in limbo. These students no longer have a sure path to a qualification for the kind of employment that would allow them to actually repay their debt.


Vocation's problems began late last year when the Victorian regulator stripped the group of $20 million in funding because of the poor quality training provided at two of its businesses which were subsequently disbanded. That wiped 94 per cent, or $700 million, off the value of the company. The end of Vocation has raised disturbing questions. How many other private providers will follow Vocation into oblivion? How many more students, many of them lured by unscrupulous spruikers into signing up to massive debts to enrol in courses that lead nowhere, will have their hopes dashed? How many more bad debts will be left for the taxpayer to carry? 


Despite the Vocation subsidiaries being registered by ASQA, the Commonwealth regulator, the national regulator, that regulator appears not to have detected serious problems about these colleges. If it had, it shows no evidence of it. It certainly did not tell the Victorian authorities of what it knew. It would appear it did not even tell Commonwealth officials of what it knew, if it knew anything. Indeed, it was the Victoria government that had to lead—to take action—to bring this company to account. I congratulate the minister for training, Mr Steve Herbert, in the new Victorian Labor government, who took this issue on, directly. It has done extraordinary amounts to restore confidence in the vocational education system in Victoria. It was not just Vocation, it was a whole series of its subsidiaries. 


Why is it, if this department is so good, so capable and so professional, that on 29 May VET FEE-HELP status was extended to Vocation? What has happened to the $3.1 million in Commonwealth funds paid to this RTO in 2014, and how many of the 570 students enrolled have actually succeeded? The most disturbing question of all is: why does the Commonwealth continue to allow private education providers to operate on a business model that relies on public funds to deliver substandard course offerings? It appears to have no capacity to ensure that these colleges play by the rules. It has no capacity to stop them enrolling people who do not have a capacity to undertake the course. It has no capacity to ensure that they turn up. It has no capacity, it would appear, to ensure that the courses are offered. But it seems to have an extraordinary capacity to hand out the cheques.


Labor has been urging the government to act on these matters since 2014. The government's response to this emerging problem has been too little, too late. The origins of these problems go well back to the introduction of this scheme, in 2007, by John Howard. There were, and I acknowledge this, unintended consequences of the changes made by the Labor government with its Skills Reform agenda. But all of those were supported by the coalition. So it is not good enough to try to find a scapegoat in the former Labor government. None of that lets the government off the hook, today. It has been in office for two years. It has been aware of these problems, clearly, given the public have been aware of them since the government's election. We have seen the photos of the boot loads of laptops being hawked around disadvantaged communities in the last month. This is despite the claims the minister made in his tough talk in March of this year and further action that was taken in August. The measures have not worked.


Between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014, the number of students obtaining VET FEE-HELP loans grew by 103 per cent. At the same time, the Commonwealth VET FEE-HELP debt has increased by 151 per cent. The number of providers offering access to VET FEE-HELP loans increased by 44 per cent. The average loan amount per student has increased by 24 per cent. In the present financial year the cost to all student loans is budgeted to be $2.4 billion. By 2018-19 the amount would have blown out to $4.4 billion. That is all on this government's watch. This is a scale of increase that anybody involved in education would understand to be totally unsustainable.


A disproportionate amount of increase comes from the VET FEE-HELP loans. In the Grattan Institute's submission to the Senate inquiry, Dr Andrew Norton estimated that up to 40 per cent of VET FEE-HELP debt would become bad debt, because the career earnings of VET are typically lower than the earnings of higher-education students. The mounting debt crisis was not curtailed by the various ministers' tough talk and, I fear, it is unlikely to be seriously affected by these measures as the bill stands.


The bill introduced a two-day cooling-off period between enrolling and applying for a VET FEE-HELP loan. You could walk around this with a blindfold. It is easily circumvented if providers use forms with different signature dates for enrolment and the loan application. The bill goes on, in other ways, to make it easier for student debts to be cancelled if they have been signed up for a loan improperly, and for the government to recoup the cost from providers, but the protections for students are not nearly tough enough. That is why Labor will move to impose caps on tuition fees for courses offered for VET FEE-HELP and for a lower limit of $50,000 on student loans.


It is incredible that now, under this government, we have courses in VET colleges that are twice the price of courses at university. The most expensive university courses are only half the cost of some of these diplomas, many of which have very dubious connections to employment prospects. We want to move an amendment to require the Department of Education and Skills to advise intending students to write off the total debt and to tell them the amount of money they are taking on when they do this. Under our amendment, debt would be incurred until the student formally responded to the department's advice about accepting the amount of debt they are getting themselves into.


Our second reading amendment will urge the government to appoint an industry funded national VET ombudsman. It will call on the government to ban or severely curtail the activities of brokers. Labor is moving these amendments because the parliament must do what this government will not do. There must be firm and decisive action against the unscrupulous provider who is destroying public confidence in Australia's VET system. We must have a return to confidence—this is so important for the future skills development of this country and for the future aspirations of people who engage in these programs—and we must ensure that there is quality and integrity in this program so that students, employers and education providers appreciate what their responsibilities are. The government has not been prepared to do this so far. It has allowed an ideological preference for private provision in education to prevent it from ensuring that we have a genuine, robust regulatory framework in place.


The crisis in VET is not a matter of a few dodgy providers. There is a systematic problem here. It is not just about the odd one out; it is becoming far too common for that. The sharks and the shonks of the education market have been able to ignore the law while building their businesses. I find it incredible that it is the stock exchange that has forced continual disclosure when these companies have listed, rather than the regulatory authority of the Commonwealth ensuring that these companies do the right thing by people who are dealing with them. We have seen agents and brokers exploit, manipulate and abuse vulnerable people—people on low incomes, intellectually disabled people, Indigenous Australians—who have been offered inducements such as free laptops and the promise of great riches, resulting in huge debts and no prospect whatsoever to undertake the courses of study they are signing up for.


Fairfax newspapers' Michael Bachelard in particular has done a very good job in highlighting these issues—but it is not just him; there are many others. Bachelard reported on the plight of the Lutanichi family, who live in public housing in regional Queensland. All the adults in the family receive welfare payments. They have all been signed up for VET courses by agents from two Victorian based providers, the Ascet Institute of Technology and the Phoenix Institute. Phoenix Institute is a name that will be familiar to senators as the company, owned by Australian Careers Network, that is being prosecuted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In the Federal Court in November, just last month, the ACCC launched legal action against Phoenix Institute, alleging that it had tricked disadvantaged people into signing up for multiple courses—and this is the real trick here. It is not just that the courses for various diplomas are $18,000 each; they are often double diploma courses, so the students end up with debts of $36,000. The ACCC argued that the institute should repay $106 million to the Commonwealth. Sales agents for Phoenix have signed people up to multiple online diploma courses costing, as I say, $18,000 each. The Australian Skills Quality Authority has now proceeded to cancel Phoenix's registration, making it ineligible for further funding—but that is of little comfort to the people who have signed up to these bodgie arrangements. Five children of the family that I mentioned signed up for their free laptops and for VET FEE-HELP loans, which they will be obliged to repay if they ever reach the income threshold. If they do not, the debt will transfer to the Commonwealth.


Mr Bachelard witnessed the agent for Ascet telling the family:


You can choose four course options: project management, human resource management, business, and leadership management.


… you don't have to go to a college; you just stay home and spend maybe two or three hours [on the computer] during the week … Mostly people complete the course [in] … of six or eight months.


These obviously are lies. They are sham courses which lead nowhere. Genuine diplomas in the subjects that have been touted by Ascet agents would take at least two years of full-time study with serious educationalists; they are not a rort you can treat as some sort of video game. Reputable institutions—and understand there are many private providers in the VET sector that are genuinely reputable—are having their reputations absolutely shredded by these shonks and sharks. There are similar stories and, in the committee stage, I will be obliged to go to a number of other stories of that type.


We have seen a clear pattern of behaviour where minister after minister in this government, on their watch, has failed to acknowledge their responsibilities. We have seen a department that appears unable to deal with this situation. Despite the increased money given to ASQA, we have seen a regulator that does not seem fit for purpose and has failed to communicate with state authorities, let alone Commonwealth offices. This is clearly an untenable situation which has gone on too long. There is an opportunity here for this Senate to turn off the tap and make sure these providers go out of business. If we do not, tens of thousands of Australians are going to be ripped off; billions of dollars will be lost from the Commonwealth of Australia. (Time expired)

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2015-12-01,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (12:58):  The VET FEE-HELP system is broken and rotten to its core. What was originally designed as a model to expand access to training for Australians has now become an untameable beast that is ripping off students, ripping off taxpayers and corroding the integrity of our entire VET sector. Since the full transition to this demand driven entitlement, VET FEE-HELP has exploded in cost, rocketing from $300 million in $2012 to $650 million in 2013, and then almost tripling in 2014 to nearly $2 billion of taxpayers' money—$2 billion of taxpayers' money; $2 billion of student money. Current estimates put it at $3 billion to $4 billion for the year 2015. What a huge amount of money.


What do students and taxpayers get for this huge investment? What do they get? Well, they get a never-ending conga line of rip-offs and scandals and rorts. If you are in any doubt about that, Mr President, just pick up the newspapers and watch the news. This is a scandal. In fact, the Prime Minister himself has described it as a scandal. It seems everybody in this country recognises what a scandal this is and recognises that we need to take action.


Let me recount a few of the incidents that have been reported to the chamber. Only last week we found out that third-party brokers were posting fake job ads. When applicants inquired and applied for the job, they were told they would need a further qualification to be able to take up the role—a qualification which would handily be provided by the RTO employing the broker. Earlier this year, reports surfaced about brokers signing up some people with intellectual disabilities—signing them up to five-figure loans to study courses they did not understand they were enrolled in. They were signed up when they did not understand the terms of the agreement, the complexity of the HELP system and income contingent loans, or the expectations that students would have of their education providers.


Indeed, it has become clear that that is the business model of some of these unscrupulous operators—preying on people who do not understand the terms of the agreements, getting them to sign along the dotted line when they do not understand what they are signing or what the implications are. What disgusting and unethical behaviour! This is the kind of behaviour that has been fostered by the lack of regulation and the hands-off approach that the government has taken—but, of course, it was the Labor Party that set this system in motion. I am absolutely disgusted by this sort of behaviour and furious that this was ever allowed to occur within the VET model. Indeed, the Greens have been speaking out against this for some time.


In my home state of South Australia, the company iEducate has been going around to schools, particularly some of those in lower income areas, offering inducements to direct students to study their courses. A letter that my office obtained shows iEducate offering students money for signing up to their courses. Part of the letter reads: 


There is no limit to the number of students you may enrol, therefore we would pay your school a $5,000 grant should you successfully enrol ten students, provided they pass the census date.


'Provided they pass the census date, there is no limit to the number of people we will enrol—just sign up.' They also offered potential students free laptops.


This vulture-like behaviour is just another example of the unethical business model being practised by these huge providers—luring students away from school and saddling them with huge debts even before they turn the age of 18. How scandalous that is. There are further stories of students being drawn in by inducements like laptops and iPads, even after the government's latest round of reforms. I say 'reforms', but they fell pretty flat in terms of addressing the needs of the sector. While before the reforms students were told they were free, now they are told that the laptops and iPads are simply loans that the RTO would never attempt to recover. So it is kind of an unlimited loan: 'Here's a laptop—don't worry about paying it back.'


Hundreds of students have signed up to a class action against Evocca College for providing substandard courses and using unethical and non-transparent market practices. Students would be routinely told that degrees would cost half of what they would actually cost. Evocca had the gall, the hide, to say in their submission to the committee inquiry into this bill that students are intentionally misusing the system and that one way to fix it is to lower the repayment threshold. This is blaming the victim, of course. They do not take any responsibility for their unethical behaviour. Madam Acting Deputy President, can you imagine giving a $40,000 student loan to someone living on $30,000 a year—right on the margins of being able to make ends meet? What nonsense that is. That really is victim blaming at its absolute worst.


Despite the scandals and despite the rorts, what sorts of outcomes are we getting? If we put those things aside, what sorts of outcomes are we getting? We are seeing plummeting graduation rates, plummeting levels of skills training and exploding student debt, much of which will fall on the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer who is going to be carrying that burden.


Last month the National Centre for Vocational Education Research established that in the early days of the scheme only 21 per cent of students eligible for a VET FEE-HELP loan completed their courses—just 21 per cent. How embarrassing that is. For those doing full-time online courses in management or commerce, the graduation rate was just eight per cent. What an appalling indictment on our training system that is. What an embarrassment that is. But unfortunately these incredibly low graduation rates are just the beginning of this sordid tale. Such is the lack of confidence in the current VET sector that often the degrees are worth less than the paper they are written on. Businesses know students are not being equipped with the necessary skills to graduate, and students are then coming out and floundering around with huge debts, worthless degrees and job prospects that are being damaged rather than enhanced.


The collateral damage from this VET FEE-HELP experiment is enormous. The human cost is enormous. There is expected to be over $1 billion in dodgy loans that will be unrepayable and which will now be footed by the Australian taxpayer, and that is only for students who are expected to never earn enough to meet the income threshold. Those who are unlucky enough to earn over $54,000 per annum must now repay tens of thousands of dollars for their worthless qualifications—qualifications that have not even contributed to their skills or employability.


VET FEE-HELP has failed. The two national agreements which were part and parcel of the VET FEE-HELP rollout espoused the following aims. They said they would improve training accessibility, affordability and depth of skills. They said they would encourage responsiveness in training arrangements. They said they would assure the quality of training delivery and outcomes, with an emphasis on measures that give industry more confidence in the standard of training delivery and assessment. They said they would provide greater transparency through information to ensure consumers could make informed choices and governments could exercise accountability.


Well, how did they do? How did they meet these aims? Is training more affordable? No, not for the taxpayer, and certainly not for students, with the blow-out in unregulated course fees. Is training more responsive? It is responsive to the demands of the for-profit rent seekers perhaps—responsive to the needs of this for-profit industry—but certainly not responsive to the needs of the students and certainly not providing higher-quality education. The sector has never been held in greater disrepute. Even many in the private VET industry are now calling for further regulation and greater transparency so that consumers can make more informed choices. Even people in this sector—dodgy providers—are coming out and saying they want more accountability, because even they recognise that it is not working. How laughable.


The measures before the Senate today are like putting a new coat of paint on a car that has a cracked engine. The car is broken, and it does not matter how many racing stripes you paint on it; it will not do what is was designed to do—in fact, this car really is a bomb. The government needs to tear the system down, go back to the drawing board and start again. Labor's amendments are an improvement, but they will not fix a broken system. This is the result of a flawed incentive structure, where a demand driven entitlement is combined with lack of information and then a profit incentive. You can try to regulate it, you can try to provide more education, but the for-profit shonks will always find the gaps. If there is an incentive there, there is always an incentive for people to do the wrong thing. Neither Labor nor the coalition has their hands clean here. We need to stop playing politics with our students' future. We need to rethink how we supply skills training in this country. We need to put a stop to this broken system and start again.


The Greens are committed to seeing the end of the VET sector being used as a political football. We want to actually fix this broken system. While the Labor and Liberal parties have been scoring political points off each other over who is more to blame—Labor set it up while the Liberals have sat on their hands; we know all of this—at the end of the day it is students who are being caught in the crossfire; it is students who are being duped out of getting the quality education they thought they signed up for. They are not getting what they paid for. Many more have been lured into courses they never wanted or never needed, and even more are now straddled with debt and worthless degrees.


While we recognise that this bill will not come close to solving all the problems, we do believe that it will address some of these unethical practices, and we believe it is important that we give students some level of clarity heading into the new year. The system needs to be redesigned from the ground up, and hopefully this bill will provide the breathing space to allow that to happen. But the position of the Greens has always been that we do not want to see mere window dressing; we want to see substantial changes to this broken sector. That is why we have been calling for an end to public money going to for-profit providers. It is not accountable. The Australian taxpayer has no oversight over how the money is being spent, and we cannot control the education outcomes. That is a broken model. Once you start giving public money to for-profit providers to start rolling out education, you are really playing with fire. That is the position the Greens have been taking in this debate, and we are the only voice pushing that argument in this debate as the Labor and Liberal parties continue to clamour towards privatisation of our education system.


But we do welcome what the government has put forward in this legislative response. It is a move in the right direction in terms of reining in a broken sector, but we need to go much further than this. We need to end public money going to for-profit providers, and only if we do that will we achieve what Senator Carr has talked about: turning off the tap. We need to turn off the tap for the for-profit providers to ensure that we have a quality education system in this country.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-12-01,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (13:11):  The Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which I chair, yesterday tabled its report on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015. I am incredibly proud of Minister Birmingham's and Minister Hartsuyker's absolute determination to clean up the mess left by the poor regulatory environment that these providers operate under, which obviously was put in place under the previous government. When you open up systems to make them demand driven, you have to put some pretty serious regulation around how those system are going to operate. So, the ALP, in its wisdom, opened up not only the VET sector but also the higher-education sector to make them demand driven, which in both cases has resulted in significant cost to the Commonwealth. We have seen universities—which I might say, Senator Simms, are not-for-profit but whose classrooms are swelling with teaching graduates, with business graduates—seeking to take advantage of the demand driven system and to fund their operations. Similarly, when there is insufficient regulation around demand driven systems for government public money then you are going to end up with trouble.


So it is a pity that we are here once again fixing Labor's mess: surging enrolment, inadequate regulation. All year our government has been focused on fixing this. In the Senate inquiry into this issue we heard time and time again of the absolute unconscionable behaviour of providers in this space. I heard only yesterday of a provider who went to Palm Island and signed up many, many disadvantaged people for business diplomas just so that they could get the funding. I am confident that measures in this bill go a long way to addressing the issue and go much further than those that any minister in the Labor government who was responsible for this area of public spending ever went.


I would encourage the ALP and I would encourage the Greens to help us fix up this mess so that our vocational education and training sector, which is a key export earner and a key provider of skills and knowledge in our community, can regain its reputation and, once again, be able to be held in high esteem for those young people and older Australians who seek to develop their skills and knowledge, in particular in vocational spaces, because we are going to need them going forward.


I commend the bill. I also commend the report of the committee to the Senate. I hope that both the Greens and the ALP will work with us to start to fix up the mess and continue to build on the work that we have already done.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (13:18):  I rise to add my comments to the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015. We had a Senate inquiry which was really concerning in terms of the sorts of scams and shonks, and the horrific stories of students being left without an adequate qualification. The problem is that, whilst Labor is not suggesting that this is a huge problem in the sector—it is in terms of money—it is not the majority of providers. We have seen very good providers in the VET system, both public and private, but, of course, what gets into the media are the shocking rip-offs of students that we have seen from a number of private colleges, which have gone on completely unchecked by the Turnbull government.


It is time that the government really got tough on those that are seeking to flaunt the system. It is as bees to a honey pot. The VET FEE-HELP system has attracted its fair share of shonks and sharks, and those are the people that Labor wants to see dealt with in a very robust way. Once again, like the bill we had in here yesterday, this bill falls short. It misses an opportunity. It is the government, again, applying a light touch. They will tell us that it is robust but it is not robust enough. We have these sharks in the system preying on vulnerable students, students with disability, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who are very pleased to be given an opportunity yet are left high and dry from a system, which the government is administering, which clearly needs substantial reform and robust regulation.


The aim of the bill before us today is to do that kind of regulation. But Labor says: this is a bill which is playing catch-up. It is playing catch-up to put in place regulations to the operation of the VET FEE-HELP system. It is playing catch-up to try to retrospectively put in place regulations for the victims of the shonks and the shysters, who have been perpetrating a scam on students, on Australian voters and on Australian taxpayers.


Again, we have before us today another inadequate bill. It continues this government's practise of addressing the symptoms but not fixing the underlying problems. These problems plague the VET FEE-HELP system and vocational education across the country. This bill forms part of the government's hopelessly inadequate and flawed deregulation agenda and it makes the whole of the vocational education system look bad, when, in fact, it is not. There are significant amounts of money involved, but it is a few small operators that need to be taken out of the VET system. This bill, just like the bill yesterday on regulation and international students, is yet another missed opportunity.


The government has failed to take the opportunity to give the Commonwealth and the national regulator sufficient powers to act. This is what we want—sufficient powers for them to act decisively against providers who are suspected of misusing the VET FEE-HELP scheme and exploiting Australians. That is what is happening here: young Australians, in particular—but mature age students as well—are being manipulated and exploited. They leave school with the best of intentions to take up a vocational education course. Many of these shonksters and sharks, if you do a Google search, come right to the top, and you think that they are decent operators, and yet they are not. Clearly what we saw in Victoria last week with Phoenix is an example of where students are absolutely preyed on. They are absolutely run down by these shonky operators. And what for? For the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. They are not interested in providing quality education. 


As I said at the start of my response today, they make all colleges, whether they are public or private, get tarnished with the same brush. That is what Labor wants to see completely stamped out, for the benefit of young and older Australians—because we know that VET is particularly important for second and third careers, after a business has closed or people require retraining. Vocational education, including through TAFE, is the great provider of that. We want a system that is free of corruption, because students and potential students are the victims of these providers and the broker-led feeding frenzy that is going on.


We know that the government—and they did it in their majority report—like to blame Labor for this. But the reality is that, when Labor introduced the VET reforms, the government—the opposition as they were then—supported those reforms. So they cannot sheet home the blame of their failures to Labor. In his second reading speech, the government minister sought to play partisan politics with this bill, pinning the blame for this scheme on the former Labor government. Well, it is just not on, and it is not true.


Unfortunately for the government, the facts do not bear out what it says in its divisive policies and politics. In 2012—the last year of published figures before the current government was elected—there were just over 55,000 VET FEE-HELP assisted students. VET FEE-HELP loans totalled $235 million in that year, and the average loan was just under $6,000. In 2014 there were almost 203,000 students, a whopping increase of, wait for it, 367 per cent. VET FEE-HELP loans totalled almost $1.8 billion. And we know fees have shot up. As senators in this place, all of us, no matter which side of the political divide we are on, get those complaints from students about the great hikes in fees that have occurred. Fees have shot up to almost $9,000. Under Labor they were about $5,800. They are almost now at $10,000, a whopping increase of 147 per cent. None of that can be attributed to Labor. It is all because this government has got a runaway scheme that it tries to regulate all the time after the event.


Under this government we have had three ministers to date. Ministers Macfarlane and Birmingham both talked tough, but on the demonstrated outcomes they have failed. Even Senator Birmingham's cherished initiative of a transfer of VET powers from states and territories to the Commonwealth appears to have failed, largely because the territory and state ministers, quite rightly, doubt the capacity of the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training to manage a national VET system, given its incompetent administration to date of the VET FEE-HELP scheme.


Let us not forget that VET is vocational education. That is what it is: vocational education, ensuring that our young people about to start their careers can develop new skills to equip them to enter a modern workplace, that they can bring those new skills to the job. But all of that has been lost with the crisis and scandal that is going on across the VET scheme right now. Unfortunately, what it looks like now, looking from the outside in, is that the VET FEE-HELP system has become a business opportunity for shonks and shysters to rip off young people—particularly those who are vulnerable—to rip off Australian taxpayers, to rip off Australian voters. That is what the VET system is currently looking like.


Just last week it was reported that the Phoenix Institute of Australia took more than $100 million in government funding. As a former union official, I would be very proud; in fact, I would be amazed—they signed up 9,000 students in 10 months.




Senator Canavan:
  Standard practice for the unions, isn't it?




Senator LINES:
  I tell you what: as a good union official, I never, ever had stats that good. You know why? Because I could not offer incentives; I could not offer inducements; I could not take advantage of people. That is why. And that is exactly what is happening here. Nine thousand students in 10 months—that should have rung alarm bells somewhere, but it did not. And what was being offered? Can you imagine the pressure being applied to those young students? It must have been horrible: 'Sign up now. Sign up today. Sign here. Sign on the dotted line.' Nine thousand students in 10 months should have rung alarm bells somewhere, but it did not. 


What were those shonky salespeople of Phoenix saying to those potential students? What on earth was going on? We know from media reports that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has started court proceedings against the private training college Phoenix in the Federal Court. The allegation is of misleading and deceptive behaviour, so what on earth were they promising? What were they saying to those 9,000 students that was misleading and deceptive? One can only imagine.


The ACCC went on to say that there are clearly problems with the federal government's billion-dollar VET FEE-HELP system. I think that, when one government regulator criticises another, we should all sit up and take note. So here we have the ACCC calling into question the VET FEE-HELP system. The ACCC said that it is going to go after the $100 million that Phoenix took from those students—the $100 million of taxpayers' money, the $100 million snatched away from reputable companies that want to offer good, quality training that has now gone.


We know that Phoenix targeted people with intellectual disabilities and, it seems, it targeted people who did not have computer skills with its online courses. What kind of shonky operation is that? We know through our Senate inquiry that online courses are preferred by the shonks and the sharks. They told us that at the Senate inquiry. Why? Because there is much more profit. There are no overheads. You do not have to front up with a teacher and a classroom and a physical presence; you just offer it online. We also know that the parent company of Phoenix, Australian Careers Network, has halted its trading since these reports emerged. It has been halted on the stock exchange for three months. Of course, despite the ACCC saying that it was going to go after Phoenix for that $100 million, Australian Careers Network has said that it will contest that.


In the business pages of our newspapers we hear about one shonky operator fighting with the ACCC, when what is at the heart of this is young people and mature-age students trying to improve their skills. All of that is lost, as the business papers report day in and day out about these shonky operators when really it is about educational opportunities for our young people. So let's get rid of these shonks and these sharks. It is a disastrous outcome that ACN, Australian Careers Network, has halted its trading. What kind of company is that? This is clearly not about vocational education and training; this is about private companies seeking to rip off Australian taxpayers through the VET FEE-HELP scheme. This is fraudulent behaviour that must be stamped out so that we get the quality and the reputation back in the vocational education system. We need a robust system that will stop these rorts starting—not a new bill seeking to rein in rorts once they have started. This is the wrong place to start.


It is not just the shonks, the shysters and the sharks; we know that VET FEE-HELP is accumulating a substantial amount of bad debt. The Grattan Institute told the Senate inquiry that almost half of the VET FEE-HELP debt has become bad debt. The figure they gave was 40 per cent. Forty per cent has become bad debt. What kind of system are we running? It is just throwing good money after bad. It seems that the Turnbull government thinks there is an endless drip of money, a bottomless pit of money. First we had 9,000 students enrolled by a shonky operator in nine months. That did not ring alarm bells anywhere. Then we had a figure of 40 per cent bad debt and that does not ring alarm bells anywhere. That tells me the government has lost the plot. The government is too busy trying to impose a big, fat new GST on everyone to worry about what is happening in education. It is too busy—with its deregulation agenda to let private colleges and other shonks run the system—to notice what is going on here. A 40 per cent debt is a massive debt and it is bad debt, so that means it will not be recovered. That is what we are really talking about here: debt that will never be recovered. 


This is not the government's first attempt to fix the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Amendments were made to the act last year and new national standards came into effect on 1 April this year, but they have not stemmed the tide of abuse and exploitation. The system is in crisis on the watch of the Turnbull government. That is what is happening. Senator Birmingham will wax lyrical about everything they are doing, but you cannot talk the talk and not walk the walk. Last week we had the Phoenix Institute in the Federal Court with the ACCC accusing them of fraudulent behaviour, of misleading and deceptive behaviour. That is a pretty strong charge to level at a company. 


For months we have heard the government say that its previous changes, the most notable being new national standards that came into effect on 1 April 2015 this year, would fix the problem. They have not fixed the problem. The problem continues. On 1 April—April Fool's Day, it would seem—the then assistant minister for education and training said in a media release, 'The time is up for dodgy marketing agents offering inducements like laptops, meals, vouchers and prizes so that people sign up for VET courses they don't need and incur a debt they cannot repay.' Nine thousand students have been ripped off by Phoenix since 1 April, so what on earth were these standards supposed to do? They certainly did not stop Phoenix. 


Since that media release on April Fool's Day, the reports of exploitation have continued. The Age reported on 4 April that brokers were targeting elderly and disabled public housing tenants in Melbourne suburbs and were giving them iPads. Fifteen private colleges were reported to be under investigation for flouting the new standards by offering inducements like laptop scholarships, according to The Age of 16 May. ASQA was forced to defend its conduct in June 2015. 


The Senate inquiry was told that brokers were continuing to flout the national standards. That evidence was given to us by the Redfern Legal Centre. The Australian College of Broadway was accused of enrolling a woman for a $28,000 course after convincing her it was free. That was reported in The Australian on 5 August. The Fairfax media continued to report that Careers Australia had enrolled almost 3,000 students using VET FEE-HELP but only 300 had graduated.


These are the shonks and the shysters. These are the people we want to stamp out with the amendments that we have put forward. The government has laughed off the sorts of recommendations that our Senate inquiry put forward, but we believe they are required as part of a robust system. We will continue to have students in this country left without a qualification if the government does not act decisively on this matter once and for all.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:38):  I thank Senator Lines for her contribution on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015—and the shonks, the shysters and the sharks. We need to deal with this as a matter of some urgency. But, at the outset, I wish to express my disappointment in the manner in which this bill has been brought on today. The original Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015, while modest in the reforms it was trying to implement, had at least been subject to scrutiny through the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. The committee's report was tabled in the Senate only yesterday.


The Senate committee system is what makes the Senate unique in the sense that we look at legislation thoroughly, we try to check the excesses of the executive arm of government and, fundamentally, in a very collegiate way, we look to see if there could be any unintended consequences, whether the legislation could be improved and we actually analyse the impact of a particular piece of legislation. The opposition, in their additional comments to the Senate committee's report, expressed their general support for the bill and foreshadowed some amendments. The detail of the amendments were revealed this morning, but I am sure I am not the only who feels that we have not had sufficient time to analyse them.


But at least we had some warning. This morning we awoke to the news that the government had new amendments to its own bill. These were not foreshadowed. We have had less than a few hours to consider what are significant proposed changes to vocational education regulation. For example, the government is proposing to freeze the total loan limit for existing VET FEE-HELP training providers to 2015 levels. In effect, this will mean that, if providers continue to offer courses at 2015 prices, they will not be able to accept a new student unless a current student leaves the school. Of course private providers will have the opportunity to review their pricing structure if they wish to take on more students, but this is not necessarily desirable.


I will go into some of these amendments in a moment, but I think it is good to pause and maybe sum up where we are at. Sometimes it is useful to use a piece from a good journalist that sums up the changes and encapsulates what is going on. On a fair-minded basis, I think Natasha Bita's analysis in The Australian on 26 November does sum this up. I will just read some excerpts from that article, which I think gives a good snapshot of what we are facing here. She refers to the current system of vocational training as a 'broken system' that 'is bleeding billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as lax regulation combined with a flawed funding model lets private colleges reap fat profits at public expense.'


My view of that is that there are a number of very good private colleges but, as you outlined in your contribution, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, there are a number of colleges that are absolute shockers, where there is rorting and some disgusting behaviour going on—which I will speak to briefly. The article continues:


Colleges can now charge full tuition fees upfront. When a student borrows through VET FEE-HELP, the federal Education Department pays the full fee directly to the college. Students can borrow up to $97,728 and never have to pay it back until they earn more than $54,000 a year.


With this bill, the government plans to split payments into three separate instalments. This will be based on census dates to prove a student is still actively studying. Natasha Bita talks about the history of this, and I think it needs to be borne in mind. 


I know that the Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, Mr Luke Hartsuyker MP, is looking at tighter controls with these amendments—which we have had very little notice of—and that he wants to confine this to courses that have an economic benefit and that have a focus on issues such as health care, aged care, child care, computing and trades. This was also summed up in Natasha Bita's article. The opposition wants the education department to be a middleman for VET FEE-HELP, so that the loan is applied for through the department—which seems to be a sensible amendment—and to reduce the lifetime borrowing limit of $97,728. Natasha Bita makes the point:


Labor’s amendments are sensible, but beg the question as to why the Rudd/Gillard governments failed to adequately regulate vocational training in the first place.


I think that is a very fair question. She continues:


The Howard government introduced legislation in 2007 to let vocational training students borrow their tuition fees, putting them on the same footing as university students. The Coalition legislation had an in-built quality control. Training colleges could only offer student loans for diplomas if they had an arrangement with a university to credit the qualification towards a degree.


But in 2009, the Rudd government … scrapped the crucial pathway-to-uni requirement for all diploma courses subsidised by the Victorian government. Then, in 2013, it removed the 'credit transfer'’ requirement nationally.


I think that gives a fair summary of what has occurred. We do have problems. They need to be dealt with, and I understand the urgency on the part of the government in that we need to deal with this in good conscious and good faith before 1 January. We cannot go for another year with these systemic problems in relation to this.


Looking at these amendments, another of the government's amendments would see the government moving to payment in arrears for certain providers where there are concerns about the provider's performance. That is welcome but it begs the question: what the hell were the bureaucrats, who were ticking off some of these colleges that got approval, doing in the first place? Where was their duty of care to the taxpayers of Australia, and to the students of these courses, to ensure that people were not getting ripped-off—either taxpayers or the students who often became victims of these dodgy colleges?


The amendments proposed by the opposition and by the government are significant. It is completely unsatisfactory that the Senate is being asked to debate these amendments today. I understand the imperative that we must get this legislation through at the end of this sitting week because this must be dealt with one way or the other by 1 January; otherwise we will have another year of courses being offered and of dodgy providers out there not being dealt with adequately.


With those concerns aside, I now turn to vocational education regulation generally. The ability to access higher education is a cornerstone of a healthy and productive society. Many now consider it to be a right, not a privilege. It should not be a privilege; it ought to be a right. It is fair to say that there has been a higher education boom in Australia over the past few years. As I indicated earlier, in 2007 the Howard government allowed vocational education students to borrow their tuition fees in the same way university students did. However, restrictions were placed on this borrowing as a student required an arrangement with a university to credit their qualification towards a degree. This pathway-to-uni requirement was ditched by the Gillard government in 2013, which led to an explosion in the number of training providers as well as an explosion in the uptake of VET FEE-HELP loans. Unfortunately a lot of shonks, shysters and sharks got involved.


Statistics released by the Department of Education and Training reveal that the number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP loans increased by around 103 per cent between 2013 and 2014, from just over 100 students to nearly 202,800. The total value of VET FEE-HELP loans accessed by students more than doubled between 2013 and 2014 going from $699 million to—wait for it—$1.75 billion. We are talking about a jump of 250 per cent. It was a massive jump, more than a doubling. In 2014, 96 per cent of all tuition fees charged to eligible students were paid for using a VET FEE-HELP loan. On the face of it, these statistics told a positive story. More students were accessing higher education than ever before and that had to be a good thing. You would think it should be a good thing. Well, not necessarily because, since the FEE-HELP loan arrangements were extended to vocational education and training courses, more students have taken up these courses.


What happened as well was we saw a reduction in the TAFE education system. The problem of too radical a change here was that we debased, in a sense, those TAFE training colleges that, I think, served Australia well. Public institutions have had their funding cut, particularly in the 2014 budget, and that, combined with the explosion of private colleges, meant they were in effect squeezed out. So more students are taking up courses, but more students than ever are falling into debt for courses that, quite frankly, they should never have signed up to in the first place.


Hardly a week goes by when we do not hear about an education provider that has gone belly up or who has been caught out offering inducements so that students sign up for their courses. Last week, the ACCC launched legal action against the Phoenix Institute, a Victorian based college, following allegations that the college had tricked disadvantaged people into signing up for courses they could not afford. It has been alleged that spruikers for the college signed up intellectually disabled people to an $18,000 online diploma course despite the fact many of these people did not have access to a computer. If that is the case, these people are low-lifes to take advantage of disadvantaged and intellectually disabled people—that was a an absolute disgrace. The Phoenix Institute also offered early childhood and community services courses to students. A compulsory element of this particular course is a work placement. Despite being aware no work placements were available, the college signed up nearly 4,300 students to this course—that too is a disgrace. According to ACCC documents, the Phoenix Institute received $106 million in VET FEE-HELP loans. I am sorry that I did not have the time, but I would have liked to name and shame those individuals involved. Let's hope that the courts deal with that appropriately. I am looking forward to the outcome of the court case instituted by the ACCC.


Unfortunately, the Phoenix Institute is not a single rotten apple. The ACCC is also pursuing Unique International College for $57 million in VET FEE-HELP loans after it was revealed that the college was paying students $2,000 to sign documents they could not read in order to sign up for $25,000 diploma courses. The Australian Skills and Quality Authority has threatened to deregister the Institute of Professional Education following complaints the college had signed students up for courses and debts without their knowledge or permission.


While the loosening of the VET FEE-HELP scheme may have started with good intentions, it has become apparent to all that this industry needs to be reined in. We need to get rid of those shonks. This bill is a step in the right direction in reforming the vocational training sector. The measures in this bill are sensible and much needed but, of course, we now have a whole swag of amendments that we need to go through. Can I gently and respectfully suggest to the government that if you are fair dinkum about getting this bill through in the next two or three days, I would suggest it will involve sitting down with the opposition, with the Australian Greens and with the crossbenchers so that we can thrash something out, because I think the intent of the bill is laudable. We need to deal with this sooner rather than later but there ought to be some consensus to deal with the rorts that clearly must be dealt with.


The measures in this bill are needed. In exchange for the additional $18.2 million required in order to enforce the compliance provisions of this bill, the government hopes to achieve $350.9 million in savings over the forward estimates. I wonder whether those savings could be even more significant if we got rid of all the shonks in the sector and ensured that those good operators were able to flourish without being tainted by the operation of those shonks.


The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to require VET FEE-HELP approved training providers to develop and apply appropriate student entry procedure requirements. The explanatory memorandum explains these procedures could include measures to assess a student's academic suitability, including literacy and numeracy ability, before signing students up to courses they will need a loan to pay for. I think that is an essential requirement but, if we are going to bring in these measures, for goodness sake, let us make sure we enforce them because this is costing taxpayers billions of dollars and is breaking the hearts of students who are being ripped off, and we are unjustly enriching a number of shonks out there. This is an important safeguard which was suggested in terms of being able to assess a student's academic suitability, particularly in light of data from the Department of Education and Training which reveals that nine per cent of all VET FEE-HELP loans were accessed by people from backgrounds where there is a question as to whether they knew what they were signing up for, people who had literacy and numeracy disadvantage. 


The bill also requires students or people under the age of 18 to obtain their parents' approval before signing up for a VET FEE-HELP loan. In this submission to the Senate Education and Employment Committee's inquiry to this bill, Open Universities Australia supports this move noting that young people 'are particularly influenced by both strong marketing strategies and peer pressure', and dare I say, getting a $2,000 inducement or getting a free computer. The circumstances under which a student can seek a re-credit of their VET-FEE HELP loan debt balance towards another course will be expanded. So too will the circumstances under which a student can apply for remission of a VET FEE-HELP loan debt. 


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed support for this measure, arguing it will help to improve confidence in the sector by allowing students to recover fees if the course they participated in was substandard. That is a very valuable move. While I support this measure, I also acknowledge the concerns expressed by the Consumer Action Law Centre in their submission to the Senate inquiry, where they said:


It remains unclear exactly how a student is to access these new measures. It also appears from the bill—specifically item 14, proposed section 46(A)—that the bases upon which an individual can seek remission is limited. 


It basically says that the Consumer Action Law Centre says that there needs to be more information. They say they are concerned that this process will not consider border consumer law rights, particularly rights pursuant to the Australian consumer law. I urge the government to release draft guidelines as soon as possible in order to receive feedback from industry as to their effectiveness and from consumers in relation to the intent of this particular aspect of the bill. 


There are a range of other matters which we dealt with. I believe this bill needs to go to the committee. I support the second reading stages of this bill but the government has advised that the Department of Education and Training will be using data analytics in order to identify which providers are underperforming. This is in order to pinpoint the providers for whom the department may freeze payments or issue other conditions on the provider's operations. However, we are yet to see any detail of how the data analytics will work or the kinds of performance criteria training providers will be assessed against. I agree there is an urgent need of reform in the VET FEE-HELP sector. I agree that we must deal with this by the end of this sitting week; otherwise, we will have another year of catastrophes of taxpayers being ripped off and students being ripped off as well.


This is not a good way to deal with legislation, to be thrown a series of amendments by the government, particularly at the last minute. It is not satisfactory. I, however, will do my best to work in good faith and diligently with the government and the opposition and my crossbench colleagues in order to ensure that we do have a bill which does what it is meant to do—that is, to get rid of the shonks, the shysters and the sharks in this sector. I look forward to a robust committee stage of this bill and I encourage the government to sit down with nongovernment senators so that we can get a breakthrough in relation to this bill.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (13:56):  I rise to make a contribution in the short time allocated to me before question time today on this outrageous claim by the government that they are about to fix the problem. We have seen the fixer in action in the House of Representatives and the fixer in action is well and truly alive in the legislation that this government is seeking to inflict on this sector. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, as a fellow participant in the Education and Employment Committee in the Senate, you and I have had the unhappy experience of listening to commentary after commentary, testimony after testimony of how this government has failed to listen to the sector, has ignored every single warning sign of danger in this area. For two years they have been in government and they have not been watching carefully what has been going on. And now here they are in the last week of the year bringing in legislation and a series of amendments which have just landed on the table in the Senate in the last hour. That is how good the fixer is fixing things for education in this country. 


What is going on today is a mad rush by an incompetent government who do not have any heart for education. They have taken $30 billion out of education in their first budget.




Senator Polley:
  How much?




Senator O'NEILL:
  $30 billion, impacting the future education of every young people in Australia, and now they are talking about putting a GST of 15 per cent on all things to do with education. This government hates education. This government gets in the way at every step in terms of fair and equitable access to a decent education and this hastily cobbled together piece of legislation—a poor piece of legislation, which is now having last minute amendments made to it in some sort of tokenistic concession—is exactly what Senator Xenophon described it to be. I think he critiqued it as a cobbled together piece of legislation that is failing to respond to the reality that confronts us. And what is the reality?


The reality is that in 2012 and shortly after, when this government came into being, there were 55,000 students engaged in vocational education and training. This is a powerful part of enabling young people and people who seek to retrain the opportunity to change careers and to build careers, and to learn in ways that make a whole lot more sense than when they went to school. So the VET sector has great appeal. $235 million were being spent in 2012 on 55,000 young people predominantly but on mature wage earners as well. The average debt they had at that time was between $5,800 to $6,000. While the government has been pulling the nation apart with divisive policies and a devastatingly bad budget in 2014, we saw that they did not keep an eye on this at all. They did not have an eye to education.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator O'Neill. It being 2 pm, we now proceed to questions without notice.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:38):  I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add:


""but the Senate calls on the Government to:


(a) appoint a National Vocational Education and Training Ombudsman who would have the power to investigate consumer complaints and order the refund of course fees where Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) have been found to act unscrupulously, either to the student directly or the Government, whichever is applicable, resulting in the student discharging any related VET FEE-HELP debt;


(b) support the call for the Auditor-General to conduct an audit on the use of VET-FEE-HELP;


(c) amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to impose caps on tuition fee amount similar to the student contribution caps for HECS-HELP;


(d) reduce the lifetime loan limit for VET FEE-HELP to half the current amount;


(e) ban or directly regulate brokers or marketing agents; and


(f) provide the Department and the Minister with the necessary statutory powers to suspend VET FEE-HELP payments to providers which are under investigation"".


This bill is grossly inadequate as a response to the crisis in Australia's vocational education and training sector. We have a litany of advice as to why that is the case—and we now have the government's acknowledgement of that. At a quarter past 12 today the government chose to brief the opposition—and they did not actually go to the right place to do that. They chose to advise the opposition, through Sharon Bird, that the government intends to move four additional amendments to its own legislation dealing with a series of matters highlighting just how deep the malaise is, which the government is now finally coming to understand. While the Labor Party does not oppose the provisions in themselves, we do think the government should have talked to us a little earlier than on the eve of the bill actually being put into this chamber for debate. It shows you the arrogance of some of the members of the House of Representatives that they treat this chamber in such a contemptuous way.


These are serious matters. A full Senate inquiry into these matters commenced last year. We have had denial from the government throughout this period. They have tried to find a scapegoat—that the problems were essentially down to the Labor Party, for measures first introduced in 2007. And now, of course, there is this minute-to-midnight series of amendments that the government wants us to consider. But they are not prepared to give us an undertaking in terms of what they have got to say about the opposition's amendments, which have been on the public record for some considerable time. I am concerned that the bill, as printed, tinkers at the edges of the problem and does not deal with the substance. And it appears that the government agrees with me, because it has chosen now to move this minute-to-midnight series of amendments, the details of which we have been briefed on but have not actually seen.


This bill relies on an assumption that we should just trust people. It does not turn off the tap for the money that has been flowing to the rorters who have brought such discredit to our vocational education system. It relies on the capacity of the Department of Education and ASQA to actually do the job. Well, I think that is a proposition that has been sorely tested. Both of these agencies have been found wanting, yet we are asked to trust in the capacity of agencies which have badly let the team down over the last two years. So the opposition is proposing amendments to give this legislation real teeth.


The gravity of the crisis should not be a surprise to anyone in this chamber given the cascade of media reports about dodgy private colleges, soaring debts and, of course, the extraordinary abuse of students that we have seen across the country. A systematic rorting of billions of dollars has been undertaken on this government's watch. These reports confirm the material presented to this chamber by the Senate inquiry into VET FEE-HELP loans. I know that, up until recently, it has been the view of the government that we should try to pretend these things are not happening. But the reports cannot be dismissed.


The collapse just this week of Vocation, one of the largest private providers, surely brings it home that the chickens are roosting. Vocation Ltd was the first listed training provider to call in the administrators. Yesterday, less than a week after the company was placed under voluntary administration, it ceased operations and closed up shop. The withdrawal of public funds after a quality review by the governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland meant that Vocation's colleges—and there were a whole series of them—were not able to be viable. The collapse has put 180 staff immediately out of work and leaves 12,000 students in limbo. These students no longer have a sure path to a qualification for the kind of employment that would allow them to actually repay their debt.


Vocation's problems began late last year when the Victorian regulator stripped the group of $20 million in funding because of the poor quality training provided at two of its businesses which were subsequently disbanded. That wiped 94 per cent, or $700 million, off the value of the company. The end of Vocation has raised disturbing questions. How many other private providers will follow Vocation into oblivion? How many more students, many of them lured by unscrupulous spruikers into signing up to massive debts to enrol in courses that lead nowhere, will have their hopes dashed? How many more bad debts will be left for the taxpayer to carry? 


Despite the Vocation subsidiaries being registered by ASQA, the Commonwealth regulator, the national regulator, that regulator appears not to have detected serious problems about these colleges. If it had, it shows no evidence of it. It certainly did not tell the Victorian authorities of what it knew. It would appear it did not even tell Commonwealth officials of what it knew, if it knew anything. Indeed, it was the Victoria government that had to lead—to take action—to bring this company to account. I congratulate the minister for training, Mr Steve Herbert, in the new Victorian Labor government, who took this issue on, directly. It has done extraordinary amounts to restore confidence in the vocational education system in Victoria. It was not just Vocation, it was a whole series of its subsidiaries. 


Why is it, if this department is so good, so capable and so professional, that on 29 May VET FEE-HELP status was extended to Vocation? What has happened to the $3.1 million in Commonwealth funds paid to this RTO in 2014, and how many of the 570 students enrolled have actually succeeded? The most disturbing question of all is: why does the Commonwealth continue to allow private education providers to operate on a business model that relies on public funds to deliver substandard course offerings? It appears to have no capacity to ensure that these colleges play by the rules. It has no capacity to stop them enrolling people who do not have a capacity to undertake the course. It has no capacity to ensure that they turn up. It has no capacity, it would appear, to ensure that the courses are offered. But it seems to have an extraordinary capacity to hand out the cheques.


Labor has been urging the government to act on these matters since 2014. The government's response to this emerging problem has been too little, too late. The origins of these problems go well back to the introduction of this scheme, in 2007, by John Howard. There were, and I acknowledge this, unintended consequences of the changes made by the Labor government with its Skills Reform agenda. But all of those were supported by the coalition. So it is not good enough to try to find a scapegoat in the former Labor government. None of that lets the government off the hook, today. It has been in office for two years. It has been aware of these problems, clearly, given the public have been aware of them since the government's election. We have seen the photos of the boot loads of laptops being hawked around disadvantaged communities in the last month. This is despite the claims the minister made in his tough talk in March of this year and further action that was taken in August. The measures have not worked.


Between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014, the number of students obtaining VET FEE-HELP loans grew by 103 per cent. At the same time, the Commonwealth VET FEE-HELP debt has increased by 151 per cent. The number of providers offering access to VET FEE-HELP loans increased by 44 per cent. The average loan amount per student has increased by 24 per cent. In the present financial year the cost to all student loans is budgeted to be $2.4 billion. By 2018-19 the amount would have blown out to $4.4 billion. That is all on this government's watch. This is a scale of increase that anybody involved in education would understand to be totally unsustainable.


A disproportionate amount of increase comes from the VET FEE-HELP loans. In the Grattan Institute's submission to the Senate inquiry, Dr Andrew Norton estimated that up to 40 per cent of VET FEE-HELP debt would become bad debt, because the career earnings of VET are typically lower than the earnings of higher-education students. The mounting debt crisis was not curtailed by the various ministers' tough talk and, I fear, it is unlikely to be seriously affected by these measures as the bill stands.


The bill introduced a two-day cooling-off period between enrolling and applying for a VET FEE-HELP loan. You could walk around this with a blindfold. It is easily circumvented if providers use forms with different signature dates for enrolment and the loan application. The bill goes on, in other ways, to make it easier for student debts to be cancelled if they have been signed up for a loan improperly, and for the government to recoup the cost from providers, but the protections for students are not nearly tough enough. That is why Labor will move to impose caps on tuition fees for courses offered for VET FEE-HELP and for a lower limit of $50,000 on student loans.


It is incredible that now, under this government, we have courses in VET colleges that are twice the price of courses at university. The most expensive university courses are only half the cost of some of these diplomas, many of which have very dubious connections to employment prospects. We want to move an amendment to require the Department of Education and Skills to advise intending students to write off the total debt and to tell them the amount of money they are taking on when they do this. Under our amendment, debt would be incurred until the student formally responded to the department's advice about accepting the amount of debt they are getting themselves into.


Our second reading amendment will urge the government to appoint an industry funded national VET ombudsman. It will call on the government to ban or severely curtail the activities of brokers. Labor is moving these amendments because the parliament must do what this government will not do. There must be firm and decisive action against the unscrupulous provider who is destroying public confidence in Australia's VET system. We must have a return to confidence—this is so important for the future skills development of this country and for the future aspirations of people who engage in these programs—and we must ensure that there is quality and integrity in this program so that students, employers and education providers appreciate what their responsibilities are. The government has not been prepared to do this so far. It has allowed an ideological preference for private provision in education to prevent it from ensuring that we have a genuine, robust regulatory framework in place.


The crisis in VET is not a matter of a few dodgy providers. There is a systematic problem here. It is not just about the odd one out; it is becoming far too common for that. The sharks and the shonks of the education market have been able to ignore the law while building their businesses. I find it incredible that it is the stock exchange that has forced continual disclosure when these companies have listed, rather than the regulatory authority of the Commonwealth ensuring that these companies do the right thing by people who are dealing with them. We have seen agents and brokers exploit, manipulate and abuse vulnerable people—people on low incomes, intellectually disabled people, Indigenous Australians—who have been offered inducements such as free laptops and the promise of great riches, resulting in huge debts and no prospect whatsoever to undertake the courses of study they are signing up for.


Fairfax newspapers' Michael Bachelard in particular has done a very good job in highlighting these issues—but it is not just him; there are many others. Bachelard reported on the plight of the Lutanichi family, who live in public housing in regional Queensland. All the adults in the family receive welfare payments. They have all been signed up for VET courses by agents from two Victorian based providers, the Ascet Institute of Technology and the Phoenix Institute. Phoenix Institute is a name that will be familiar to senators as the company, owned by Australian Careers Network, that is being prosecuted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In the Federal Court in November, just last month, the ACCC launched legal action against Phoenix Institute, alleging that it had tricked disadvantaged people into signing up for multiple courses—and this is the real trick here. It is not just that the courses for various diplomas are $18,000 each; they are often double diploma courses, so the students end up with debts of $36,000. The ACCC argued that the institute should repay $106 million to the Commonwealth. Sales agents for Phoenix have signed people up to multiple online diploma courses costing, as I say, $18,000 each. The Australian Skills Quality Authority has now proceeded to cancel Phoenix's registration, making it ineligible for further funding—but that is of little comfort to the people who have signed up to these bodgie arrangements. Five children of the family that I mentioned signed up for their free laptops and for VET FEE-HELP loans, which they will be obliged to repay if they ever reach the income threshold. If they do not, the debt will transfer to the Commonwealth.


Mr Bachelard witnessed the agent for Ascet telling the family:


You can choose four course options: project management, human resource management, business, and leadership management.


… you don't have to go to a college; you just stay home and spend maybe two or three hours [on the computer] during the week … Mostly people complete the course [in] … of six or eight months.


These obviously are lies. They are sham courses which lead nowhere. Genuine diplomas in the subjects that have been touted by Ascet agents would take at least two years of full-time study with serious educationalists; they are not a rort you can treat as some sort of video game. Reputable institutions—and understand there are many private providers in the VET sector that are genuinely reputable—are having their reputations absolutely shredded by these shonks and sharks. There are similar stories and, in the committee stage, I will be obliged to go to a number of other stories of that type.


We have seen a clear pattern of behaviour where minister after minister in this government, on their watch, has failed to acknowledge their responsibilities. We have seen a department that appears unable to deal with this situation. Despite the increased money given to ASQA, we have seen a regulator that does not seem fit for purpose and has failed to communicate with state authorities, let alone Commonwealth offices. This is clearly an untenable situation which has gone on too long. There is an opportunity here for this Senate to turn off the tap and make sure these providers go out of business. If we do not, tens of thousands of Australians are going to be ripped off; billions of dollars will be lost from the Commonwealth of Australia. (Time expired)

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2015-12-01,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (12:58):  The VET FEE-HELP system is broken and rotten to its core. What was originally designed as a model to expand access to training for Australians has now become an untameable beast that is ripping off students, ripping off taxpayers and corroding the integrity of our entire VET sector. Since the full transition to this demand driven entitlement, VET FEE-HELP has exploded in cost, rocketing from $300 million in $2012 to $650 million in 2013, and then almost tripling in 2014 to nearly $2 billion of taxpayers' money—$2 billion of taxpayers' money; $2 billion of student money. Current estimates put it at $3 billion to $4 billion for the year 2015. What a huge amount of money.


What do students and taxpayers get for this huge investment? What do they get? Well, they get a never-ending conga line of rip-offs and scandals and rorts. If you are in any doubt about that, Mr President, just pick up the newspapers and watch the news. This is a scandal. In fact, the Prime Minister himself has described it as a scandal. It seems everybody in this country recognises what a scandal this is and recognises that we need to take action.


Let me recount a few of the incidents that have been reported to the chamber. Only last week we found out that third-party brokers were posting fake job ads. When applicants inquired and applied for the job, they were told they would need a further qualification to be able to take up the role—a qualification which would handily be provided by the RTO employing the broker. Earlier this year, reports surfaced about brokers signing up some people with intellectual disabilities—signing them up to five-figure loans to study courses they did not understand they were enrolled in. They were signed up when they did not understand the terms of the agreement, the complexity of the HELP system and income contingent loans, or the expectations that students would have of their education providers.


Indeed, it has become clear that that is the business model of some of these unscrupulous operators—preying on people who do not understand the terms of the agreements, getting them to sign along the dotted line when they do not understand what they are signing or what the implications are. What disgusting and unethical behaviour! This is the kind of behaviour that has been fostered by the lack of regulation and the hands-off approach that the government has taken—but, of course, it was the Labor Party that set this system in motion. I am absolutely disgusted by this sort of behaviour and furious that this was ever allowed to occur within the VET model. Indeed, the Greens have been speaking out against this for some time.


In my home state of South Australia, the company iEducate has been going around to schools, particularly some of those in lower income areas, offering inducements to direct students to study their courses. A letter that my office obtained shows iEducate offering students money for signing up to their courses. Part of the letter reads: 


There is no limit to the number of students you may enrol, therefore we would pay your school a $5,000 grant should you successfully enrol ten students, provided they pass the census date.


'Provided they pass the census date, there is no limit to the number of people we will enrol—just sign up.' They also offered potential students free laptops.


This vulture-like behaviour is just another example of the unethical business model being practised by these huge providers—luring students away from school and saddling them with huge debts even before they turn the age of 18. How scandalous that is. There are further stories of students being drawn in by inducements like laptops and iPads, even after the government's latest round of reforms. I say 'reforms', but they fell pretty flat in terms of addressing the needs of the sector. While before the reforms students were told they were free, now they are told that the laptops and iPads are simply loans that the RTO would never attempt to recover. So it is kind of an unlimited loan: 'Here's a laptop—don't worry about paying it back.'


Hundreds of students have signed up to a class action against Evocca College for providing substandard courses and using unethical and non-transparent market practices. Students would be routinely told that degrees would cost half of what they would actually cost. Evocca had the gall, the hide, to say in their submission to the committee inquiry into this bill that students are intentionally misusing the system and that one way to fix it is to lower the repayment threshold. This is blaming the victim, of course. They do not take any responsibility for their unethical behaviour. Madam Acting Deputy President, can you imagine giving a $40,000 student loan to someone living on $30,000 a year—right on the margins of being able to make ends meet? What nonsense that is. That really is victim blaming at its absolute worst.


Despite the scandals and despite the rorts, what sorts of outcomes are we getting? If we put those things aside, what sorts of outcomes are we getting? We are seeing plummeting graduation rates, plummeting levels of skills training and exploding student debt, much of which will fall on the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer who is going to be carrying that burden.


Last month the National Centre for Vocational Education Research established that in the early days of the scheme only 21 per cent of students eligible for a VET FEE-HELP loan completed their courses—just 21 per cent. How embarrassing that is. For those doing full-time online courses in management or commerce, the graduation rate was just eight per cent. What an appalling indictment on our training system that is. What an embarrassment that is. But unfortunately these incredibly low graduation rates are just the beginning of this sordid tale. Such is the lack of confidence in the current VET sector that often the degrees are worth less than the paper they are written on. Businesses know students are not being equipped with the necessary skills to graduate, and students are then coming out and floundering around with huge debts, worthless degrees and job prospects that are being damaged rather than enhanced.


The collateral damage from this VET FEE-HELP experiment is enormous. The human cost is enormous. There is expected to be over $1 billion in dodgy loans that will be unrepayable and which will now be footed by the Australian taxpayer, and that is only for students who are expected to never earn enough to meet the income threshold. Those who are unlucky enough to earn over $54,000 per annum must now repay tens of thousands of dollars for their worthless qualifications—qualifications that have not even contributed to their skills or employability.


VET FEE-HELP has failed. The two national agreements which were part and parcel of the VET FEE-HELP rollout espoused the following aims. They said they would improve training accessibility, affordability and depth of skills. They said they would encourage responsiveness in training arrangements. They said they would assure the quality of training delivery and outcomes, with an emphasis on measures that give industry more confidence in the standard of training delivery and assessment. They said they would provide greater transparency through information to ensure consumers could make informed choices and governments could exercise accountability.


Well, how did they do? How did they meet these aims? Is training more affordable? No, not for the taxpayer, and certainly not for students, with the blow-out in unregulated course fees. Is training more responsive? It is responsive to the demands of the for-profit rent seekers perhaps—responsive to the needs of this for-profit industry—but certainly not responsive to the needs of the students and certainly not providing higher-quality education. The sector has never been held in greater disrepute. Even many in the private VET industry are now calling for further regulation and greater transparency so that consumers can make more informed choices. Even people in this sector—dodgy providers—are coming out and saying they want more accountability, because even they recognise that it is not working. How laughable.


The measures before the Senate today are like putting a new coat of paint on a car that has a cracked engine. The car is broken, and it does not matter how many racing stripes you paint on it; it will not do what is was designed to do—in fact, this car really is a bomb. The government needs to tear the system down, go back to the drawing board and start again. Labor's amendments are an improvement, but they will not fix a broken system. This is the result of a flawed incentive structure, where a demand driven entitlement is combined with lack of information and then a profit incentive. You can try to regulate it, you can try to provide more education, but the for-profit shonks will always find the gaps. If there is an incentive there, there is always an incentive for people to do the wrong thing. Neither Labor nor the coalition has their hands clean here. We need to stop playing politics with our students' future. We need to rethink how we supply skills training in this country. We need to put a stop to this broken system and start again.


The Greens are committed to seeing the end of the VET sector being used as a political football. We want to actually fix this broken system. While the Labor and Liberal parties have been scoring political points off each other over who is more to blame—Labor set it up while the Liberals have sat on their hands; we know all of this—at the end of the day it is students who are being caught in the crossfire; it is students who are being duped out of getting the quality education they thought they signed up for. They are not getting what they paid for. Many more have been lured into courses they never wanted or never needed, and even more are now straddled with debt and worthless degrees.


While we recognise that this bill will not come close to solving all the problems, we do believe that it will address some of these unethical practices, and we believe it is important that we give students some level of clarity heading into the new year. The system needs to be redesigned from the ground up, and hopefully this bill will provide the breathing space to allow that to happen. But the position of the Greens has always been that we do not want to see mere window dressing; we want to see substantial changes to this broken sector. That is why we have been calling for an end to public money going to for-profit providers. It is not accountable. The Australian taxpayer has no oversight over how the money is being spent, and we cannot control the education outcomes. That is a broken model. Once you start giving public money to for-profit providers to start rolling out education, you are really playing with fire. That is the position the Greens have been taking in this debate, and we are the only voice pushing that argument in this debate as the Labor and Liberal parties continue to clamour towards privatisation of our education system.


But we do welcome what the government has put forward in this legislative response. It is a move in the right direction in terms of reining in a broken sector, but we need to go much further than this. We need to end public money going to for-profit providers, and only if we do that will we achieve what Senator Carr has talked about: turning off the tap. We need to turn off the tap for the for-profit providers to ensure that we have a quality education system in this country.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-12-01,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (13:11):  The Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which I chair, yesterday tabled its report on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015. I am incredibly proud of Minister Birmingham's and Minister Hartsuyker's absolute determination to clean up the mess left by the poor regulatory environment that these providers operate under, which obviously was put in place under the previous government. When you open up systems to make them demand driven, you have to put some pretty serious regulation around how those system are going to operate. So, the ALP, in its wisdom, opened up not only the VET sector but also the higher-education sector to make them demand driven, which in both cases has resulted in significant cost to the Commonwealth. We have seen universities—which I might say, Senator Simms, are not-for-profit but whose classrooms are swelling with teaching graduates, with business graduates—seeking to take advantage of the demand driven system and to fund their operations. Similarly, when there is insufficient regulation around demand driven systems for government public money then you are going to end up with trouble.


So it is a pity that we are here once again fixing Labor's mess: surging enrolment, inadequate regulation. All year our government has been focused on fixing this. In the Senate inquiry into this issue we heard time and time again of the absolute unconscionable behaviour of providers in this space. I heard only yesterday of a provider who went to Palm Island and signed up many, many disadvantaged people for business diplomas just so that they could get the funding. I am confident that measures in this bill go a long way to addressing the issue and go much further than those that any minister in the Labor government who was responsible for this area of public spending ever went.


I would encourage the ALP and I would encourage the Greens to help us fix up this mess so that our vocational education and training sector, which is a key export earner and a key provider of skills and knowledge in our community, can regain its reputation and, once again, be able to be held in high esteem for those young people and older Australians who seek to develop their skills and knowledge, in particular in vocational spaces, because we are going to need them going forward.


I commend the bill. I also commend the report of the committee to the Senate. I hope that both the Greens and the ALP will work with us to start to fix up the mess and continue to build on the work that we have already done.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (13:18):  I rise to add my comments to the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015. We had a Senate inquiry which was really concerning in terms of the sorts of scams and shonks, and the horrific stories of students being left without an adequate qualification. The problem is that, whilst Labor is not suggesting that this is a huge problem in the sector—it is in terms of money—it is not the majority of providers. We have seen very good providers in the VET system, both public and private, but, of course, what gets into the media are the shocking rip-offs of students that we have seen from a number of private colleges, which have gone on completely unchecked by the Turnbull government.


It is time that the government really got tough on those that are seeking to flaunt the system. It is as bees to a honey pot. The VET FEE-HELP system has attracted its fair share of shonks and sharks, and those are the people that Labor wants to see dealt with in a very robust way. Once again, like the bill we had in here yesterday, this bill falls short. It misses an opportunity. It is the government, again, applying a light touch. They will tell us that it is robust but it is not robust enough. We have these sharks in the system preying on vulnerable students, students with disability, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who are very pleased to be given an opportunity yet are left high and dry from a system, which the government is administering, which clearly needs substantial reform and robust regulation.


The aim of the bill before us today is to do that kind of regulation. But Labor says: this is a bill which is playing catch-up. It is playing catch-up to put in place regulations to the operation of the VET FEE-HELP system. It is playing catch-up to try to retrospectively put in place regulations for the victims of the shonks and the shysters, who have been perpetrating a scam on students, on Australian voters and on Australian taxpayers.


Again, we have before us today another inadequate bill. It continues this government's practise of addressing the symptoms but not fixing the underlying problems. These problems plague the VET FEE-HELP system and vocational education across the country. This bill forms part of the government's hopelessly inadequate and flawed deregulation agenda and it makes the whole of the vocational education system look bad, when, in fact, it is not. There are significant amounts of money involved, but it is a few small operators that need to be taken out of the VET system. This bill, just like the bill yesterday on regulation and international students, is yet another missed opportunity.


The government has failed to take the opportunity to give the Commonwealth and the national regulator sufficient powers to act. This is what we want—sufficient powers for them to act decisively against providers who are suspected of misusing the VET FEE-HELP scheme and exploiting Australians. That is what is happening here: young Australians, in particular—but mature age students as well—are being manipulated and exploited. They leave school with the best of intentions to take up a vocational education course. Many of these shonksters and sharks, if you do a Google search, come right to the top, and you think that they are decent operators, and yet they are not. Clearly what we saw in Victoria last week with Phoenix is an example of where students are absolutely preyed on. They are absolutely run down by these shonky operators. And what for? For the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. They are not interested in providing quality education. 


As I said at the start of my response today, they make all colleges, whether they are public or private, get tarnished with the same brush. That is what Labor wants to see completely stamped out, for the benefit of young and older Australians—because we know that VET is particularly important for second and third careers, after a business has closed or people require retraining. Vocational education, including through TAFE, is the great provider of that. We want a system that is free of corruption, because students and potential students are the victims of these providers and the broker-led feeding frenzy that is going on.


We know that the government—and they did it in their majority report—like to blame Labor for this. But the reality is that, when Labor introduced the VET reforms, the government—the opposition as they were then—supported those reforms. So they cannot sheet home the blame of their failures to Labor. In his second reading speech, the government minister sought to play partisan politics with this bill, pinning the blame for this scheme on the former Labor government. Well, it is just not on, and it is not true.


Unfortunately for the government, the facts do not bear out what it says in its divisive policies and politics. In 2012—the last year of published figures before the current government was elected—there were just over 55,000 VET FEE-HELP assisted students. VET FEE-HELP loans totalled $235 million in that year, and the average loan was just under $6,000. In 2014 there were almost 203,000 students, a whopping increase of, wait for it, 367 per cent. VET FEE-HELP loans totalled almost $1.8 billion. And we know fees have shot up. As senators in this place, all of us, no matter which side of the political divide we are on, get those complaints from students about the great hikes in fees that have occurred. Fees have shot up to almost $9,000. Under Labor they were about $5,800. They are almost now at $10,000, a whopping increase of 147 per cent. None of that can be attributed to Labor. It is all because this government has got a runaway scheme that it tries to regulate all the time after the event.


Under this government we have had three ministers to date. Ministers Macfarlane and Birmingham both talked tough, but on the demonstrated outcomes they have failed. Even Senator Birmingham's cherished initiative of a transfer of VET powers from states and territories to the Commonwealth appears to have failed, largely because the territory and state ministers, quite rightly, doubt the capacity of the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training to manage a national VET system, given its incompetent administration to date of the VET FEE-HELP scheme.


Let us not forget that VET is vocational education. That is what it is: vocational education, ensuring that our young people about to start their careers can develop new skills to equip them to enter a modern workplace, that they can bring those new skills to the job. But all of that has been lost with the crisis and scandal that is going on across the VET scheme right now. Unfortunately, what it looks like now, looking from the outside in, is that the VET FEE-HELP system has become a business opportunity for shonks and shysters to rip off young people—particularly those who are vulnerable—to rip off Australian taxpayers, to rip off Australian voters. That is what the VET system is currently looking like.


Just last week it was reported that the Phoenix Institute of Australia took more than $100 million in government funding. As a former union official, I would be very proud; in fact, I would be amazed—they signed up 9,000 students in 10 months.




Senator Canavan:
  Standard practice for the unions, isn't it?




Senator LINES:
  I tell you what: as a good union official, I never, ever had stats that good. You know why? Because I could not offer incentives; I could not offer inducements; I could not take advantage of people. That is why. And that is exactly what is happening here. Nine thousand students in 10 months—that should have rung alarm bells somewhere, but it did not. And what was being offered? Can you imagine the pressure being applied to those young students? It must have been horrible: 'Sign up now. Sign up today. Sign here. Sign on the dotted line.' Nine thousand students in 10 months should have rung alarm bells somewhere, but it did not. 


What were those shonky salespeople of Phoenix saying to those potential students? What on earth was going on? We know from media reports that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has started court proceedings against the private training college Phoenix in the Federal Court. The allegation is of misleading and deceptive behaviour, so what on earth were they promising? What were they saying to those 9,000 students that was misleading and deceptive? One can only imagine.


The ACCC went on to say that there are clearly problems with the federal government's billion-dollar VET FEE-HELP system. I think that, when one government regulator criticises another, we should all sit up and take note. So here we have the ACCC calling into question the VET FEE-HELP system. The ACCC said that it is going to go after the $100 million that Phoenix took from those students—the $100 million of taxpayers' money, the $100 million snatched away from reputable companies that want to offer good, quality training that has now gone.


We know that Phoenix targeted people with intellectual disabilities and, it seems, it targeted people who did not have computer skills with its online courses. What kind of shonky operation is that? We know through our Senate inquiry that online courses are preferred by the shonks and the sharks. They told us that at the Senate inquiry. Why? Because there is much more profit. There are no overheads. You do not have to front up with a teacher and a classroom and a physical presence; you just offer it online. We also know that the parent company of Phoenix, Australian Careers Network, has halted its trading since these reports emerged. It has been halted on the stock exchange for three months. Of course, despite the ACCC saying that it was going to go after Phoenix for that $100 million, Australian Careers Network has said that it will contest that.


In the business pages of our newspapers we hear about one shonky operator fighting with the ACCC, when what is at the heart of this is young people and mature-age students trying to improve their skills. All of that is lost, as the business papers report day in and day out about these shonky operators when really it is about educational opportunities for our young people. So let's get rid of these shonks and these sharks. It is a disastrous outcome that ACN, Australian Careers Network, has halted its trading. What kind of company is that? This is clearly not about vocational education and training; this is about private companies seeking to rip off Australian taxpayers through the VET FEE-HELP scheme. This is fraudulent behaviour that must be stamped out so that we get the quality and the reputation back in the vocational education system. We need a robust system that will stop these rorts starting—not a new bill seeking to rein in rorts once they have started. This is the wrong place to start.


It is not just the shonks, the shysters and the sharks; we know that VET FEE-HELP is accumulating a substantial amount of bad debt. The Grattan Institute told the Senate inquiry that almost half of the VET FEE-HELP debt has become bad debt. The figure they gave was 40 per cent. Forty per cent has become bad debt. What kind of system are we running? It is just throwing good money after bad. It seems that the Turnbull government thinks there is an endless drip of money, a bottomless pit of money. First we had 9,000 students enrolled by a shonky operator in nine months. That did not ring alarm bells anywhere. Then we had a figure of 40 per cent bad debt and that does not ring alarm bells anywhere. That tells me the government has lost the plot. The government is too busy trying to impose a big, fat new GST on everyone to worry about what is happening in education. It is too busy—with its deregulation agenda to let private colleges and other shonks run the system—to notice what is going on here. A 40 per cent debt is a massive debt and it is bad debt, so that means it will not be recovered. That is what we are really talking about here: debt that will never be recovered. 


This is not the government's first attempt to fix the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Amendments were made to the act last year and new national standards came into effect on 1 April this year, but they have not stemmed the tide of abuse and exploitation. The system is in crisis on the watch of the Turnbull government. That is what is happening. Senator Birmingham will wax lyrical about everything they are doing, but you cannot talk the talk and not walk the walk. Last week we had the Phoenix Institute in the Federal Court with the ACCC accusing them of fraudulent behaviour, of misleading and deceptive behaviour. That is a pretty strong charge to level at a company. 


For months we have heard the government say that its previous changes, the most notable being new national standards that came into effect on 1 April 2015 this year, would fix the problem. They have not fixed the problem. The problem continues. On 1 April—April Fool's Day, it would seem—the then assistant minister for education and training said in a media release, 'The time is up for dodgy marketing agents offering inducements like laptops, meals, vouchers and prizes so that people sign up for VET courses they don't need and incur a debt they cannot repay.' Nine thousand students have been ripped off by Phoenix since 1 April, so what on earth were these standards supposed to do? They certainly did not stop Phoenix. 


Since that media release on April Fool's Day, the reports of exploitation have continued. The Age reported on 4 April that brokers were targeting elderly and disabled public housing tenants in Melbourne suburbs and were giving them iPads. Fifteen private colleges were reported to be under investigation for flouting the new standards by offering inducements like laptop scholarships, according to The Age of 16 May. ASQA was forced to defend its conduct in June 2015. 


The Senate inquiry was told that brokers were continuing to flout the national standards. That evidence was given to us by the Redfern Legal Centre. The Australian College of Broadway was accused of enrolling a woman for a $28,000 course after convincing her it was free. That was reported in The Australian on 5 August. The Fairfax media continued to report that Careers Australia had enrolled almost 3,000 students using VET FEE-HELP but only 300 had graduated.


These are the shonks and the shysters. These are the people we want to stamp out with the amendments that we have put forward. The government has laughed off the sorts of recommendations that our Senate inquiry put forward, but we believe they are required as part of a robust system. We will continue to have students in this country left without a qualification if the government does not act decisively on this matter once and for all.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:38):  I thank Senator Lines for her contribution on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015—and the shonks, the shysters and the sharks. We need to deal with this as a matter of some urgency. But, at the outset, I wish to express my disappointment in the manner in which this bill has been brought on today. The original Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Bill 2015, while modest in the reforms it was trying to implement, had at least been subject to scrutiny through the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. The committee's report was tabled in the Senate only yesterday.


The Senate committee system is what makes the Senate unique in the sense that we look at legislation thoroughly, we try to check the excesses of the executive arm of government and, fundamentally, in a very collegiate way, we look to see if there could be any unintended consequences, whether the legislation could be improved and we actually analyse the impact of a particular piece of legislation. The opposition, in their additional comments to the Senate committee's report, expressed their general support for the bill and foreshadowed some amendments. The detail of the amendments were revealed this morning, but I am sure I am not the only who feels that we have not had sufficient time to analyse them.


But at least we had some warning. This morning we awoke to the news that the government had new amendments to its own bill. These were not foreshadowed. We have had less than a few hours to consider what are significant proposed changes to vocational education regulation. For example, the government is proposing to freeze the total loan limit for existing VET FEE-HELP training providers to 2015 levels. In effect, this will mean that, if providers continue to offer courses at 2015 prices, they will not be able to accept a new student unless a current student leaves the school. Of course private providers will have the opportunity to review their pricing structure if they wish to take on more students, but this is not necessarily desirable.


I will go into some of these amendments in a moment, but I think it is good to pause and maybe sum up where we are at. Sometimes it is useful to use a piece from a good journalist that sums up the changes and encapsulates what is going on. On a fair-minded basis, I think Natasha Bita's analysis in The Australian on 26 November does sum this up. I will just read some excerpts from that article, which I think gives a good snapshot of what we are facing here. She refers to the current system of vocational training as a 'broken system' that 'is bleeding billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as lax regulation combined with a flawed funding model lets private colleges reap fat profits at public expense.'


My view of that is that there are a number of very good private colleges but, as you outlined in your contribution, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, there are a number of colleges that are absolute shockers, where there is rorting and some disgusting behaviour going on—which I will speak to briefly. The article continues:


Colleges can now charge full tuition fees upfront. When a student borrows through VET FEE-HELP, the federal Education Department pays the full fee directly to the college. Students can borrow up to $97,728 and never have to pay it back until they earn more than $54,000 a year.


With this bill, the government plans to split payments into three separate instalments. This will be based on census dates to prove a student is still actively studying. Natasha Bita talks about the history of this, and I think it needs to be borne in mind. 


I know that the Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, Mr Luke Hartsuyker MP, is looking at tighter controls with these amendments—which we have had very little notice of—and that he wants to confine this to courses that have an economic benefit and that have a focus on issues such as health care, aged care, child care, computing and trades. This was also summed up in Natasha Bita's article. The opposition wants the education department to be a middleman for VET FEE-HELP, so that the loan is applied for through the department—which seems to be a sensible amendment—and to reduce the lifetime borrowing limit of $97,728. Natasha Bita makes the point:


Labor’s amendments are sensible, but beg the question as to why the Rudd/Gillard governments failed to adequately regulate vocational training in the first place.


I think that is a very fair question. She continues:


The Howard government introduced legislation in 2007 to let vocational training students borrow their tuition fees, putting them on the same footing as university students. The Coalition legislation had an in-built quality control. Training colleges could only offer student loans for diplomas if they had an arrangement with a university to credit the qualification towards a degree.


But in 2009, the Rudd government … scrapped the crucial pathway-to-uni requirement for all diploma courses subsidised by the Victorian government. Then, in 2013, it removed the 'credit transfer'’ requirement nationally.


I think that gives a fair summary of what has occurred. We do have problems. They need to be dealt with, and I understand the urgency on the part of the government in that we need to deal with this in good conscious and good faith before 1 January. We cannot go for another year with these systemic problems in relation to this.


Looking at these amendments, another of the government's amendments would see the government moving to payment in arrears for certain providers where there are concerns about the provider's performance. That is welcome but it begs the question: what the hell were the bureaucrats, who were ticking off some of these colleges that got approval, doing in the first place? Where was their duty of care to the taxpayers of Australia, and to the students of these courses, to ensure that people were not getting ripped-off—either taxpayers or the students who often became victims of these dodgy colleges?


The amendments proposed by the opposition and by the government are significant. It is completely unsatisfactory that the Senate is being asked to debate these amendments today. I understand the imperative that we must get this legislation through at the end of this sitting week because this must be dealt with one way or the other by 1 January; otherwise we will have another year of courses being offered and of dodgy providers out there not being dealt with adequately.


With those concerns aside, I now turn to vocational education regulation generally. The ability to access higher education is a cornerstone of a healthy and productive society. Many now consider it to be a right, not a privilege. It should not be a privilege; it ought to be a right. It is fair to say that there has been a higher education boom in Australia over the past few years. As I indicated earlier, in 2007 the Howard government allowed vocational education students to borrow their tuition fees in the same way university students did. However, restrictions were placed on this borrowing as a student required an arrangement with a university to credit their qualification towards a degree. This pathway-to-uni requirement was ditched by the Gillard government in 2013, which led to an explosion in the number of training providers as well as an explosion in the uptake of VET FEE-HELP loans. Unfortunately a lot of shonks, shysters and sharks got involved.


Statistics released by the Department of Education and Training reveal that the number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP loans increased by around 103 per cent between 2013 and 2014, from just over 100 students to nearly 202,800. The total value of VET FEE-HELP loans accessed by students more than doubled between 2013 and 2014 going from $699 million to—wait for it—$1.75 billion. We are talking about a jump of 250 per cent. It was a massive jump, more than a doubling. In 2014, 96 per cent of all tuition fees charged to eligible students were paid for using a VET FEE-HELP loan. On the face of it, these statistics told a positive story. More students were accessing higher education than ever before and that had to be a good thing. You would think it should be a good thing. Well, not necessarily because, since the FEE-HELP loan arrangements were extended to vocational education and training courses, more students have taken up these courses.


What happened as well was we saw a reduction in the TAFE education system. The problem of too radical a change here was that we debased, in a sense, those TAFE training colleges that, I think, served Australia well. Public institutions have had their funding cut, particularly in the 2014 budget, and that, combined with the explosion of private colleges, meant they were in effect squeezed out. So more students are taking up courses, but more students than ever are falling into debt for courses that, quite frankly, they should never have signed up to in the first place.


Hardly a week goes by when we do not hear about an education provider that has gone belly up or who has been caught out offering inducements so that students sign up for their courses. Last week, the ACCC launched legal action against the Phoenix Institute, a Victorian based college, following allegations that the college had tricked disadvantaged people into signing up for courses they could not afford. It has been alleged that spruikers for the college signed up intellectually disabled people to an $18,000 online diploma course despite the fact many of these people did not have access to a computer. If that is the case, these people are low-lifes to take advantage of disadvantaged and intellectually disabled people—that was a an absolute disgrace. The Phoenix Institute also offered early childhood and community services courses to students. A compulsory element of this particular course is a work placement. Despite being aware no work placements were available, the college signed up nearly 4,300 students to this course—that too is a disgrace. According to ACCC documents, the Phoenix Institute received $106 million in VET FEE-HELP loans. I am sorry that I did not have the time, but I would have liked to name and shame those individuals involved. Let's hope that the courts deal with that appropriately. I am looking forward to the outcome of the court case instituted by the ACCC.


Unfortunately, the Phoenix Institute is not a single rotten apple. The ACCC is also pursuing Unique International College for $57 million in VET FEE-HELP loans after it was revealed that the college was paying students $2,000 to sign documents they could not read in order to sign up for $25,000 diploma courses. The Australian Skills and Quality Authority has threatened to deregister the Institute of Professional Education following complaints the college had signed students up for courses and debts without their knowledge or permission.


While the loosening of the VET FEE-HELP scheme may have started with good intentions, it has become apparent to all that this industry needs to be reined in. We need to get rid of those shonks. This bill is a step in the right direction in reforming the vocational training sector. The measures in this bill are sensible and much needed but, of course, we now have a whole swag of amendments that we need to go through. Can I gently and respectfully suggest to the government that if you are fair dinkum about getting this bill through in the next two or three days, I would suggest it will involve sitting down with the opposition, with the Australian Greens and with the crossbenchers so that we can thrash something out, because I think the intent of the bill is laudable. We need to deal with this sooner rather than later but there ought to be some consensus to deal with the rorts that clearly must be dealt with.


The measures in this bill are needed. In exchange for the additional $18.2 million required in order to enforce the compliance provisions of this bill, the government hopes to achieve $350.9 million in savings over the forward estimates. I wonder whether those savings could be even more significant if we got rid of all the shonks in the sector and ensured that those good operators were able to flourish without being tainted by the operation of those shonks.


The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to require VET FEE-HELP approved training providers to develop and apply appropriate student entry procedure requirements. The explanatory memorandum explains these procedures could include measures to assess a student's academic suitability, including literacy and numeracy ability, before signing students up to courses they will need a loan to pay for. I think that is an essential requirement but, if we are going to bring in these measures, for goodness sake, let us make sure we enforce them because this is costing taxpayers billions of dollars and is breaking the hearts of students who are being ripped off, and we are unjustly enriching a number of shonks out there. This is an important safeguard which was suggested in terms of being able to assess a student's academic suitability, particularly in light of data from the Department of Education and Training which reveals that nine per cent of all VET FEE-HELP loans were accessed by people from backgrounds where there is a question as to whether they knew what they were signing up for, people who had literacy and numeracy disadvantage. 


The bill also requires students or people under the age of 18 to obtain their parents' approval before signing up for a VET FEE-HELP loan. In this submission to the Senate Education and Employment Committee's inquiry to this bill, Open Universities Australia supports this move noting that young people 'are particularly influenced by both strong marketing strategies and peer pressure', and dare I say, getting a $2,000 inducement or getting a free computer. The circumstances under which a student can seek a re-credit of their VET-FEE HELP loan debt balance towards another course will be expanded. So too will the circumstances under which a student can apply for remission of a VET FEE-HELP loan debt. 


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed support for this measure, arguing it will help to improve confidence in the sector by allowing students to recover fees if the course they participated in was substandard. That is a very valuable move. While I support this measure, I also acknowledge the concerns expressed by the Consumer Action Law Centre in their submission to the Senate inquiry, where they said:


It remains unclear exactly how a student is to access these new measures. It also appears from the bill—specifically item 14, proposed section 46(A)—that the bases upon which an individual can seek remission is limited. 


It basically says that the Consumer Action Law Centre says that there needs to be more information. They say they are concerned that this process will not consider border consumer law rights, particularly rights pursuant to the Australian consumer law. I urge the government to release draft guidelines as soon as possible in order to receive feedback from industry as to their effectiveness and from consumers in relation to the intent of this particular aspect of the bill. 


There are a range of other matters which we dealt with. I believe this bill needs to go to the committee. I support the second reading stages of this bill but the government has advised that the Department of Education and Training will be using data analytics in order to identify which providers are underperforming. This is in order to pinpoint the providers for whom the department may freeze payments or issue other conditions on the provider's operations. However, we are yet to see any detail of how the data analytics will work or the kinds of performance criteria training providers will be assessed against. I agree there is an urgent need of reform in the VET FEE-HELP sector. I agree that we must deal with this by the end of this sitting week; otherwise, we will have another year of catastrophes of taxpayers being ripped off and students being ripped off as well.


This is not a good way to deal with legislation, to be thrown a series of amendments by the government, particularly at the last minute. It is not satisfactory. I, however, will do my best to work in good faith and diligently with the government and the opposition and my crossbench colleagues in order to ensure that we do have a bill which does what it is meant to do—that is, to get rid of the shonks, the shysters and the sharks in this sector. I look forward to a robust committee stage of this bill and I encourage the government to sit down with nongovernment senators so that we can get a breakthrough in relation to this bill.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (13:56):  I rise to make a contribution in the short time allocated to me before question time today on this outrageous claim by the government that they are about to fix the problem. We have seen the fixer in action in the House of Representatives and the fixer in action is well and truly alive in the legislation that this government is seeking to inflict on this sector. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, as a fellow participant in the Education and Employment Committee in the Senate, you and I have had the unhappy experience of listening to commentary after commentary, testimony after testimony of how this government has failed to listen to the sector, has ignored every single warning sign of danger in this area. For two years they have been in government and they have not been watching carefully what has been going on. And now here they are in the last week of the year bringing in legislation and a series of amendments which have just landed on the table in the Senate in the last hour. That is how good the fixer is fixing things for education in this country. 


What is going on today is a mad rush by an incompetent government who do not have any heart for education. They have taken $30 billion out of education in their first budget.




Senator Polley:
  How much?




Senator O'NEILL:
  $30 billion, impacting the future education of every young people in Australia, and now they are talking about putting a GST of 15 per cent on all things to do with education. This government hates education. This government gets in the way at every step in terms of fair and equitable access to a decent education and this hastily cobbled together piece of legislation—a poor piece of legislation, which is now having last minute amendments made to it in some sort of tokenistic concession—is exactly what Senator Xenophon described it to be. I think he critiqued it as a cobbled together piece of legislation that is failing to respond to the reality that confronts us. And what is the reality?


The reality is that in 2012 and shortly after, when this government came into being, there were 55,000 students engaged in vocational education and training. This is a powerful part of enabling young people and people who seek to retrain the opportunity to change careers and to build careers, and to learn in ways that make a whole lot more sense than when they went to school. So the VET sector has great appeal. $235 million were being spent in 2012 on 55,000 young people predominantly but on mature wage earners as well. The average debt they had at that time was between $5,800 to $6,000. While the government has been pulling the nation apart with divisive policies and a devastatingly bad budget in 2014, we saw that they did not keep an eye on this at all. They did not have an eye to education.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment) (14:00):  I thank Senator Urquhart for the question. I do not think there is actually any conflict between what is being said. In fact, the only proposal that I am immediately aware of for an increase in the GST comes from the Premier of South Australia. If the Prime Minister is asking for people to put a proposal on the table, that is fine. I think that is his purview. What I said quite clearly last week was that the government has no proposal on the table for an increase in the GST. The only person that I know that has a proposal on the table for an increase in the GST is the Premier of South Australia. There has been discussion from the Premier of New South Wales about changes to the GST; other state premiers have said that they do not want to see an increase in the GST, including our Tasmanian Premier, Will Hodgman.


I do not actually see that there is any conflict between what I said last week when I said the government does not have any proposal on the table for a change to the GST, because we do not; we actually do not. If the Prime Minister wants to say that there should be proposals on the table—and there are proposals on the table put on there by the Premier of South Australia—we have a process where we are prepared to consider everything being on the table. We are not shying away from that. We did not do what the Labor Party did in opposition, when they had a root and branch review of the tax system but they forgot the trunk. We are prepared to say we are looking at the entire tax system. We are not squibbing it, like the Labor Party did. We are actually prepared to consider, properly, the tax system—how it might be improved so that we have an economy that continues to grow strongly, an economy that is sound and is fair for all Australians. I do not see that there is any conflict in what I said or in what the Prime Minister said at all.

If the Labor Party wants to try and run a scare campaign, I think—and I said this last week—that is for them to do. I notice that they are not talking about GST or a 15 per cent GST rate anymore, because they do not want to mention the term '15 per cent' anymore. I cannot for any reason understand why they would be afraid of '15 per cent'! But the government has no proposal on the table to increase the level of the GST. My answer from last week remains in exactly the same way that it does this week. So the Labor Party seem to be proposing they might go through the entire economy proposing different numbers or suggestions. (Time expired)

The only proposal on the table to increase the GST comes from the South Australian Labor Premier, who wants a 15 per cent GST; that was Premier Weatherill's suggestion. So we have no proposals on the table to increase the GST on anything. So, to save the Labor Party from this endless roll through the economy of what might be or what might not be, depending on whatever scare campaign they want to run at a particular point in time: the government has no proposal on the table to increase the GST.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-12-01,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:06):  I thank Senator Ronaldson for that question. Labor's latest thought bubble—coming up with a proposal to increase our emissions reduction target to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030—if implemented, would damage the economy and cost jobs. Labor know this, because they actually conducted modelling while in government which shows exactly that.


It would take about $600 billion out of the economy in just 15 years. So Labor's plan, so to speak, would shrink the economy by $600 billion over the next 15 years. I am not [inaudible]. When we came into government, we had a carbon tax which was heading towards $30 a tonne and rising beyond. Under Bill Shorten, we have the $209 CST—the Bill Shorten carbon supertax. This is a great big new tax on everything that Labor want to bring back. Never mind $30 a tonne; a $209 CST. A $209 carbon supertax is what Australians would get under Labor.


What it would do is cut people's wages by about $4,900 a year by 2030. It would push up the cost of electricity by about 78 per cent by 2030. And, of course, this is not everything. What it would actually do, like the Labor Green carbon tax of old—the one when it was just heading to $30 a tonne—is shift jobs and emissions overseas. It would actually not help to reduce emissions in the world. It might reduce emissions in Australia, because Labor would be shrinking the economy, but it would just shift those emissions and those jobs to other parts of the world where there would be higher emissions for the same amount of economic output.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:09):  The Shorten carbon supertax would be a tax on jobs; it would be a tax on families. It would of course lead to fewer jobs in Australia and more jobs overseas, where our competitors would be able to take market share away from us. But of course families across Australia would have to pay about 78 per cent more for electricity prices. Do not take my word for it; that is actually what Labor's own modelling in government showed.


As the Minerals Council of Australia quite rightly said, 'The 45 per cent target is not based on detailed economic analysis of its impact on growth, living standards and energy costs'—a very, very accurate observation. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, 'Labor's newly announced proposal to double cuts to emissions to 45 per cent by 2030 with a long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050 was not backed by a credible plan that protects economic growth.'

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tourism and International Education (Senator Colbeck) and the Minister for Rural Health (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Urquhart and Polley today relating to the Goods and Services Tax.


Today we saw again in this Senate a pathetic attempt to try to dismiss what we know the government has planned, and that is the increase of the GST to 15 per cent. When it came out into the public domain report that the GST will be added to everything—including fresh food, vegetables and fruit—the representative of the Minister for Health in this place said that she does not want to intervene in this debate. The Minister for Health has the responsibility to provide decent policy and to ensure that we have the best possible health system in this country. 


The health system is only what we created when we were in government, because the Abbott-Turnbull government has actually cut $60 billion out of health. Senator Nash, you represent the Nationals in this place and you are the representative of the Minister for Health. If you are not concerned about $60 billion being cut out of the health budget, then who on your side would be? Obviously the Nationals are the doormat for this government, but we on this side will always stand up for struggling families. We will always oppose any increase to the GST to 15 per cent, because it will impact on every Australian family and every individual in this country. It does not matter whether you are going to the grocery store or whether you are going to the greengrocer; you are going to be hit. Every time you buy new school uniforms, your family will have to pay 15 per cent on all those items. Every single day when parents and carers around this country pack a child's lunch to go to school, they will have 15 per cent imposed on the cost of the apple that is put into that lunch. These are the real, everyday effects that this government's GST increase will bring to Australian families.


We have Senator Nash crying 'foul', accusing us on this side of scaremongering. This Turnbull-Abbott government are world-renowned for their scare campaigns. The former Prime Minister, the one who was rolled by those opposite, was a master of the three-word slogan, but those opposite are now finding that they may have changed their leader, he may wear better suits, he may be able to put more than three words together, but he is still defending the cuts that were made in last year's budget and this year's budget. They still have the same policies, except now they say, 'We want to have a mature debate about the taxation system in this country'. All we have done today in question time has been to ask questions about what the impact will be of a 15 per cent impost on medical services, medical appliances and everything that Australian families need around health. We already know that they have tried to undermine Medicare; we know because it is in their DNA to destroy Medicare. But when it comes to families being able to manage their budgets, coming up with that extra 15 per cent on everything across the board—everything that affects their household—this government is so unfair. It is a heartless government that has no idea how difficult it is for Australian families to meet their weekly budgets. 


We know that people who live on a pension and low-income families are often forced during the cold winter months to go to bed with their electric blanket because they cannot afford electricity prices. What we will see is a greater impact and cost burden and another new big tax by this government on electricity, on gas, on groceries, on health care and on education, and all other bills will go up and they will keep going up.


A 15 per cent GST will have an enormous impact on Australian families and, in my home state of Tasmania, they can least afford it. We have the most challenges when it comes to people who are unemployed. We have a lot of trouble when it comes to people having the opportunity to go on to tertiary education. So, on top of the plan by this government to erode those opportunities for everyday Tasmanians, the government now wants to increase the GST to 15 per cent.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:07):  I thank Senator Macdonald for the words of advice. I will indeed follow his wise counsel.




Senator Conroy:
  I would not follow 'Wacka' anywhere.




Senator SESELJA:
  I would follow 'Wacka', but I was actually talking about Senator Macdonald. I am grateful for the advice from Senator Macdonald, as the father of the Senate, and I am grateful for Senator 'Wacka' Williams' advice as well. I am glad that I was able to take 30 seconds responding to Senator Conroy's interjections—




Senator Conroy:
  Because you've got nothing to say.




Senator SESELJA:
  This attack from the Labor Party is getting somewhat boring.




Senator Conroy:
  Would you like me to fill in another few minutes for you?




Senator SESELJA:
  You are right, Senator Conroy, it is hard to fill up five minutes again responding to the same ridiculous question time tactics that we have seen from the Labor Party. Which strategic genius in the Labor Party came up with the 'devastating' attack in question time that we saw today? Those in the Press Gallery are still reeling from the absolute brilliance that we saw in Labor's question time attack! They are in meltdown up there—in absolute meltdown—over this extraordinary surprise attack on the GST, led by Senator Wong and now followed up by Senator Polley. We never could have seen that coming, and it has left those on this side absolutely reeling! It is an extraordinary attack, and I think whoever thought of it should be congratulated.


Let us talk about what we are dealing with in this country when it comes to tax reform and discussion around tax reform. We are talking about a mature and sensible debate that many are engaging in, except the federal Labor opposition. The federal Labor opposition, through their 'devastating' attacks in question time, are choosing to exclude themselves from that discussion. That is well and good. That is their choice, and they will go to the voters with that kind of a plan and that kind of a record. But the coalition government has a fundamental focus, and the fundamental focus is on growing jobs and growing the economy. That is absolutely what we want to do, and we will do it in difficult times and with global challenges. If we had a serious alternative government, they would have been asking questions about jobs and the economy, because that is the most important thing a government can be doing. Senator Cash talked about something like 290,000 jobs that have been created since the changed Senate.


We came into government with a plan to get rid of the carbon tax, get rid of the mining tax, sign up free trade agreements so that we can grow the economy, and cut red tape for small business. Of course, a number of these things were frustrated for some time by the old Senate. But then we did see the carbon tax removed, we did see the mining tax removed and we have also seen the wonderful work on free trade agreements. We are starting to see the dividends of many of those policies. There are also our small business policies, which are not only about cutting red tape but also giving small business a tax cut and giving them a recent asset write-off. That is starting to flow through the economy. And, as I said, something like 290,000 jobs have been created. I think it is over 200,000 this year. I think that is something the Treasurer has said. That is something that we should be proud of, and it is something that we want to build on.


Some state premiers are engaging in serious discussions about tax reform, and the Commonwealth government is very open to this. Unlike the Labor Party, we don't just want to increase taxes; we are open to the question of tax reform. But it needs to be about—and it will be about—creating jobs and growing the economy. There is nothing better a government can do than create jobs—many jobs and high-paying jobs—for people in our economy, because that is the way people can get ahead and live the most dignified lives. That is what we in this place should be fighting for. The rubbish that the opposition go on with reflects very poorly on them. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  We know that this government has a huge table piled with stuff, but those opposite cannot seem to agree on exactly what that stuff is. Our Prime Minister is unshakeable from the assertion that everything is on the table—and this includes a hit to the cost of living for every single Australian through a GST hike. In fact, in a recent interview with 5AA in Adelaide, the Prime Minister was very clear that the GST holds a prominent place in his planned changes to our taxation system. On this issue, Prime Minister Turnbull said:


I know Stephen very much shares my view which is that changes to the GST should be on the table.


But last week in this place, my Tasmanian colleague Senator Colbeck seemed blissfully unaware of his leader's intentions when he told question time last week that there was no proposal on the table from the government. Perhaps Senator Colbeck knows exactly what his leader is really planning but he is trying to distance himself from it. He knows, like I do, that a GST hike would be bad for Tasmania. It would be bad for Tasmanian workers, bad for Tasmanian pensioners, bad for those seeking work and bad for all Tasmanian families. It would also be bad for Tasmanian businesses—businesses like our salmon and apple producers, who would suffer the double hit of trying to sell their goods at a higher price to Australians who will have less money.


I am particularly concerned that those opposite are planning to slug the GST charge on the price of fresh food, which is currently exempt. We know that many fresh foods are already more expensive than some far less nutritious offerings on the supermarket shelves. We know that grocery bills are already forcing Australians to make difficult decisions when their need for a healthy diet comes into direct conflict with the money that they have in their wallets. If the GST were applied to fresh food, it would be inevitable that financial realities would lead many Australians to forgo fresh food in favour of cheaper junk food and inevitably our health outcomes would suffer, but those opposite do not seem to care about that. We need to be encouraging Australians to eat more of our amazing fresh produce—like Tasmanian salmon and apples—not putting it out of their reach.


The obvious discrepancy between our Prime Minister and our tourism minister is not the only inconsistency in the ranks of our government when it comes to the GST. On one hand we have the Prime Minister talking in soothing words about fairness. He assures us that poor Australians will not be worse off and he tells us that there will be compensation packages to make up for the hike in the cost of living for those on low incomes. Then on the other hand we have his Treasurer, Mr Scott Morrison, saying that, 'Any change to the GST would not result in a greater tax take from the federal government.' He tells us that if a GST were brought in it would be counterbalanced by tax cuts in other areas. It does not take an economist to work out these two statements are mutually incompatible.



Let us be clear, the GST is a regressive tax. It is the basic reality that the less you earn the more you have to shell out as a proportion of your income on the GST. If you are going to hike the GST but cut income tax without increasing the overall tax take, you are just replacing a progressive tax with a regressive one and that, by definition, will hit the poorest people in the country. Who do you think is going to benefit out of this? The richest in the country. The most wealthy in our society. This is a government that jumps and shouts about a plan to cut down on smoking but will not reject a tax hike on fresh fruit and vegetables—talk about twisted priorities. Swapping a progressive tax for a regressive one is not about reform. It is a lazy swipe at low-income Australians. Hiking the cost of living for everyday working Australians with no net budgetary benefit is not good economic management; it is just a cheap attack on the most vulnerable people in our society. Adding a GST burden to the cost of fresh food is not a choice that is in the national interest. It is a recipe for a health disaster. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  I find it amazing that Senator Urquhart is talking about the cost of living and—




Senator Conroy:
  The GST's main man.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We have got Senator Conroy interjecting again—dear oh dear. We will just disregard the interjections. I will talk to you, Deputy President. They want to go into the next election with this huge carbon tax, this huge price on carbon because that is not going to affect the price of electricity. As Senator Polley said, people have to go to bed in their electric blankets to keep warm. Those opposite would tax our electric blankets; that is their plan. Haven't they learnt? Who is running their tactics? It is probably Senator Conroy running the tactics for the opposition, hence the pathetic attack and the scaremongering they are going on with.


Senator Polley talked about these huge cuts on health spending by the government. It is quite amazing that when the opposition were in government and they knew they were going to lose the election, they made this enormous promise about all this spending on health and education knowing full well they were going to lose the election. They brought back Kevin Rudd to try and save the furniture when they sacked Prime Minister Julia Gillard. They went into this huge promise knowing full well they would never have to budget for it and never have to deliver it.


I am on a health inquiry with Senator Deb O'Neill at the moment. I was in Sydney last week. We just gave a 12.7 per cent increase this financial year to New South Wales for hospital spending. With 7.5 per cent next year, that is over 20 per cent in two years, and those opposite are saying we are cutting the spending in health. It is quite amazing that we are actually delivering it.


When you talk about the scaremongering of raising the GST, there is only one person in Australia who has said we should raise the GST and that is Mr Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia. The Labor Premier of South Australia said, 'Let's raise it to 15 per cent.'



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I say to those opposite—when I can get a word in from Senator Conroy—if only you understood business. This is what happens in business: if you are running a business and you have got a debt, the best way to pay for that debt or decrease it is to grow your business.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  You would not understand about business, Senator Conroy, because you have probably just been around the union movement most of your life like all your colleagues over there. They are all out of the union movement. The only thing you ever sold in your life was a union ticket.




Senator Conroy:
  No wonder you hate unions.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I do not hate unions.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, ignore the interjections as I am also trying to.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will do my best but it is very difficult to ignore them. I do not hate unions. I was once a member of the Australian Workers' Union, when I was shearing in 1978 in the Flinders Ranges. I had a choice: buy a union ticket or get out of the shed. They held a gun at my head—buy a union ticket or get out of the shed or you will lose your job. Those opposite, if only you had some business experience. When you have a debt, you grow your business and that is what we are aiming to do.


Those opposite should stand up and say, 'Our tax system is perfect. We have the most perfect tax system in the world. No need to look at it. No need to adjust it. No need to discuss it with the Australian people or with the business sector or with the various interest parties throughout our nation. Don't talk about it; it is perfect.' You are saying our tax system is perfect. I will tell you what is wrong with our tax system. The states have a payroll tax and I think it is a disgusting tax. As John Laws always says, 'The more you tax something the less you have of it.' What do we say when a business grows from, say, the threshold in New South Wales of around 14 to 15 employees? We say, 'We are going to tax you.' For what reason? You naughty business—you grew and you employed people. What a terrible thing to do. This is why we say, 'Don't have the discussion.'


I talk to businesses as I travel around and the payroll tax costs them, but let's not discuss that because the tax system is perfect. Ask those union reps on the other side. They have never run a business. They know all about growing business and handling tax—with no experience! They just do what the unions tell them to do. That is all they do. All they are worried about is who writes their cheques—the CFMEU. They just do as they are told by the union movement. It is amazing that they simply do not understand that we must grow our businesses.


When they were in government they had the best terms of trade our country has ever seen and record prices for iron ore, coal and all the exports. Of course, those prices have collapsed dramatically now, which is a terrible shame for those businesses and for the country as a whole. So they had all this money coming in and of course they just blew it. Now they are experts on taxation.  Let us have the discussion. Let us see what we can do better to make our economy stronger, to employ more people, to grow businesses and to help to get Labor's debt under control. You just cannot believe how quickly they could have grown such debt and wasted so much money.  (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:23):  If I was confused at the end of question time about the government's position on the GST, I am afraid I am no more enlightened at this point because I have heard from the other side that there are no plans. I have also heard that everything is on the table. I have heard that perhaps the GST should be on the table. I have heard from Senator Nash that what is required is a balanced, mature, sensible and responsible conversation about tax and I have heard perhaps similar sentiments from others, as they move to have an entirely unbalanced, entirely silly conversation about the sensible measures proposed by the Labor Party to reasonably deal with the very real threat of climate change and the sensible measures proposed by us to rein in smoking rates and to start to address the very horrible costs, both personnel and economic, that smoking inflicts on families in this nation.


The only thing that senators opposite do not want to talk about is the GST because we all know that the GST is on the table. The Prime Minister has told us that everything is on the table, that the GST should be on the table, and we know that people opposite do not want to talk about it because an increase in the GST is not in any way in the interests of Australian people. The Australian people do not want GST extended to fresh fruit and vegetables and to products like Tasmanian apples and Tasmanian salmon. The Australian people do not want and nor is it in their interests for the GST to be extended to health services or to education services. Nor is it in the interests of the Australian people for the GST to be increased from the current 10 per cent to 15 per cent. All of these things are on the table because, despite the denials from those opposite or sometimes the endorsement that everything is on the table, it is very clear that at the heart of the government's agenda on taxation is a reduction in corporate tax at the expense of ordinary people by increasing the GST they currently pay. For those people that will mean that every single time they walk into a supermarket, every time they walk into a shop to get the gear ready for a return to school, every time you go shopping for Christmas presents, every time they go to see a medical officer, changes to the GST of the kind imagined and hoped for by those opposite will be very bad news for Australian families. We can understand it at that visceral level. We can imagine what it means to households but, thanks to ACOSS, we also have the modelling which tells us what it will mean at a national level. The ACOSS modelling tells us that, even in its current form, the GST is regressive, raising almost twice the share of GST from the lowest 20 per cent of household incomes compared to the top 20 per cent. Although high-income earners pay more in dollar terms, the GST has a much bigger impact on low-income households because they have much less income to spend. 


So what would happen if we changed the GST along the lines advocated by those opposite? Extending the GST to fresh food would cost an additional two per cent of income for the lowest 20 per cent of households but only the 0.6 per cent of income for those with the highest income. How shameful! This is a measure which absolutely targets the living standards of the lowest 20 per cent of households.




Senator Conroy:
  That is the plan, though.




Senator McALLISTER:
  What would happen, Senator Conroy, if we extended the GST to health? It would cost an additional 1.6 per cent of income for the lowest 20 per cent of households but only 0.6 per cent for the highest 20 per cent. And what would happen overall if all these changes were put into place? We would see the lowest 20 per cent paying 4.6 per cent more of their income in tax compared to just 1.7 per cent for the top 20 per cent. This tells us that this is deliberately designed to increase inequality in this country. It is a tax that reaches into the families who people on this side of the chamber will never ever abandoned because we did not come here to increase inequality, we did not come here to punish low-income families and middle-income families and we did not come here to support the GST. So people on the other side of the chamber can vacillate about whether it is on or off the table, but we know that, if it comes before this chamber, senators on this side will be voting against it.

The speech read as follows—



The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Advocacy) Bill 2015 seeks to clarify the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) mandate in its role as a public broadcaster.


In particular, the Bill implements guiding principles, reporting requirements and practical mechanisms for the Corporation to be able uphold this mandate.


The ABC is a public broadcaster and in turn, is expected to provide services to certain areas and to certain community groups with reference to community service and local relevance. To be more explicit, as a public broadcaster, it is expected to pay greater attention to market-failure principles and serve the areas and demographics where commercial companies would fear to tread.


As ABC Managing Director, Mark Scott, noted in late November this year, ""the key to success in the digital era is to be true to your audience."" Sadly, regional Australia is losing its ABC voice and the ABC is not looking to project regional ideas, culture or journalism.


Over the course of many years, we have witnessed a systemic de-resourcing of our regional services and our regional communities and the art of journalism itself is suffering as a result. These include communities where the ABC is the only comprehensive provider of news, weather forecasts and entertainment.


We are told that cuts mean they have to pick on the regions first, whilst Ultimo balloons to over one thousand staff. It is perplexing that the digital age is not exponentially improving regional media services, but that management choices are focusing on an already competitive format in the form 24 hour news and also iview. Wonderful ventures in their own rights, but whose launches collectively required the plucking of $20 million from other ABC endeavours. This is about priorities.


Not only do regional communities feel short-changed with the consolidation of resources toward east coast capitals, but regional journalists, producers and other media staff cannot comprehend why the ABC has chosen to centralise in this way. In the digital age this simply does not have to be the case.


In the context of the ABC being trusted and polling well, Australians have responded overwhelmingly in Newspoll after Newspoll (recently 84%) that the ABC performs a valuable role in society.


However, the overall trust and respect the ABC enjoys with regional residents cannot be taken for granted, particularly when there are fewer local media providers to begin with in the bush. Rural and regional Australians want media services that add value to their daily lives and which assure them of their connectedness with their local communities, weather forecasts and greater surrounds.


What many people have noticed is that the ABC's funding is being used to help it compete in commercial territory. Territory that once entered and conquered could help the ABC generate its own existence on its own two feet. Is this what we expect of a public broadcaster? No. We expect that a public broadcaster will go where no commercial broadcaster would see a business case, simply to ensure that those communities receive vital social and public benefits.


This Bill seeks to provide the ABC Board with the appropriate tools to govern the organisation in a manner which reflects the expectation the community has of public broadcasters. This Bill seeks to call the ABC to account and states in unambiguous terms what the ABC needs to aspire to when servicing our regions. This includes a physical presence and embeddedness that allows journalists to facilitate discussion and well-connected and informed rural and regional communities.


Mr Scott also recently said, ""there's no commercial model that could sustain a Radio National, or that would make the kinds of investments in dramas that we are doing, or have the regional footprint full of local voices and local news the way we invest."" Well, Mr Scott, regional and rural Australians would beg to differ on your claims of investment in their backyards.


We see the reduction of bulletins under the guise of allowing journalists more time to gather local stories. However, with two-thirds fewer bulletins within which to fit all that supposed extra content and the plan to broadcast them only in the early morning, of course regional Australians are suspicious and disappointed. Regional journalists affected by the changes were asking for more resources to cover the news, not more time to find it and dramatically less time to broadcast it.


Rural and regional Australians have an expectation of regular and relevant news. Not yesterday's news. Stories break, local emergencies occur – local content is more than just telling stories. The ABC is the organisation that provides rural and regional families, businesses and communities with the information they need and trust.


Given the diminished physical footprint of the ABC in regional Australia in recent years, this Bill will provide the Board with a clear mandate and impetus to direct greater investment towards rural and regional Australia. This investment would facilitate the local physical presence, training and knowledge required to support and sustain a regional media culture that is reflective of and enriching to its audience.


This Bill removes ambiguity as to ABC's mandate in regional Australia and reinforces the expectation that as a public broadcaster, its mandate is not to compete for breakfast news ratings, but rather to prioritise service to our regions with a civic purpose in mind, not a commercial one. As a public broadcaster, no economic rationalist need be brought to the table when arguing about the provision of basic services to our regions. The digital age should be expanding horizons and narrative choice, not creating local media black spots.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I find it remarkable that formality would be denied on a motion that simply notes that this is the 54th anniversary of the raising of the Morning Star flag, that celebrates the long overdue release of a political prisoner, namely, Filep Karma, and that calls on the Australian government to engage in constructive dialogue with its Indonesian counterparts to call for an amnesty of further political prisoners. We are not asking for much here; we are just asking for some transparency to grant access to foreign journalists and human rights monitors as well as foreign researchers to West Papua. 


It must be remembered that the suffering of the West Papuan people is seldom reported, we have an Indonesian government that has banned journalists and other human rights monitors, and here we have a new Indonesian head. We now have the opportunity, through our negotiations with Indonesia, to ensure that the plight of the West Papuan people is brought to light. (Time expired)

  The Australian government unreservedly recognises Indonesia's sovereignty over the Papua provinces as underlined by the 2006 Lombok treaty between Australia and Indonesia. This is a bipartisan position in Australia. Indonesian sovereignty over the Papua provinces is also widely recognised by the international community. The Australian government's assessment is that the human rights situation in the Papua provinces has improved in recent years. However, we recognise there are still challenges to be addressed. We condemn all violence in the Papua provinces affecting civilians and security personnel alike. Our consistent position has been that the rights of all citizens in Indonesia, including those in the Papua provinces, should be upheld and that credible allegations of human rights abuses should be investigated. The Australian government welcomes President Widodo's decision o9 May this year to grant clemency and release five Papuan prisoners and the release of Mr Filep Karma on 19 November this year.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:07):  At the request of the Chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, I present the report Future of Australia's automotive industry together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I would like to say a few words about this report. Australia's automotive industry is undergoing fundamental transformation, and I use the word 'transformation' deliberately. I am not one of the doomsayers who believe that the industry will die when the last locally produced car rolls off the production line at the end of 2017. Labor remains confident that with the right policy settings Australia can attract new automotive manufacturing investment and, beyond manufacturing, the automotive industry involves much more than the production of passenger cars. These other activities will include the aftermarket manufacturing; engineering and design; the manufacture and adaption of large trucks and other heavy vehicles; retailing, servicing and smash repairs; sales support; automotive dealerships; and training.


There is no doubt that beyond 2017 the automotive industry will continue and will include manufacturing in some form. The real question is what will be the scope and the extent of manufacturing activity, and the answer to that question will depend upon government policy. That is why 12 months ago the Senate referred this matter to the Economics References Committee. The committee's interim report, tabled in August, made recommendations intended to support the component manufacturers, the section of the industry most vulnerable to the departure of car markers. It is vital that the industry capabilities they possess are maintained.


The automotive industry has always been the great repository of skills and knowledge in advanced manufacturing in Australia, and preserving those skills will be the key to attracting new investment. It will be the people that attract the investment. We have got to have the right trained people to maintain the capacities to attract that investment.


The main recommendations of the interim report concern the provision of co-investment through the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The inquiry called on the government to maintain funding under the scheme through to 2021 as the ATS Act provides. The inquiry also recommended that eligibility for ATS be broadened and that it be reconfigured as an advanced manufacturing, engineering and design scheme. It would still be automotive related but it would be able to assist supply chain firms in diversification and entering new markets.


The final report expressed the committee's conviction that the government should set in place policies that encourage diversification, growth and innovation in automotive manufacturing in Australia. It calls for a whole-of-government approach, with the allocation of resources from a range of departments to ensure that the processes of transformation continue. To facilitate this and to develop a coordinated national framework for automotive policy, the committee calls on the government to establish an automotive industry task force. The task force, with representatives from industry, from unions and from governments, would build on the work of the AutoCRC and the Automotive Australia 2020 road map project. This was an integral part of the New Car Plan, which, of course, provided for the opportunities to be identified for future investment and future growth in the automotive industry in this country.


The final report also makes recommendations intended to avoid a social and economic catastrophe in the regions most directly affected by the shutdown in car-making, particularly in Victoria and in South Australia. I might add that there is not a state in the Commonwealth that will not be directly affected with massive job losses as a consequence of the government's actions in driving General Motors and Toyota out of Australia. No-one pretends that the impact will be anything other than severe.


This should be seen not just as a time of challenge but as a time of new opportunities. If we develop policy wisely and we preserve our skills and knowledge base, the automotive industry will survive—and not just survive; it will flourish. There are international precedents for this kind of revival. At the end of the 1980s, the United Kingdom automotive industry was predicted to die in much the same way as some of the smarties in this town have suggested about the Australian automotive industry. Of course, that was a direct result of the devastation of Margaret Thatcher.


But in the United Kingdom the automotive industry did not die.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  No, the automotive manufacturer Holden was driven out of this country by the actions of Mr Hockey and the acting Prime Minister at the time, who goaded General Motors to leave, and now we have a consequence where it will cost considerably more—I mean many, many times more—in social security payments and other disaster relief as a consequence of the actions of this government than will ever be spent in terms of co-investment for this industry.


I put to you that in the United Kingdom a similar experience was seen to happen but both sides in politics came to realise how important the automotive industry was to the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom now the Conservative government is investing heavily in co-investment so that the British automotive industry is amongst the most prosperous in the world. The United Kingdom probably has the largest export sector in Europe and it has come a long way from the devastation of Margaret Thatcher. The United Kingdom automotive industry is now a world leader and that is because it has become a bipartisan issue, yet again, as support for the automotive industry once was in this country.


There is no reason in my mind why this could not happen here. The two reports of this inquiry show the necessary policy work has already begun. But what is really needed here is political will. I urge senators on all sides of the chamber to study the committee's report carefully, to adopt its recommendations and to help build the future of the Australian automotive industry.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-12-01,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:15):  I do not question Senator Carr's commitment to see a strong automotive sector in this country and I do not question his prognosis either that there is a bright future still there for the automotive sector in this country. I do, however, take some issue with Senator Carr's proposed remedy because he is proposing to continue doing what we have been doing for years. Colours of both political sides have, for years, been investing in this sector through the Strategic Investment Program, through the Automotive Transformation Scheme but, of course, none of that investment has been able to maintain the commitments of major international car manufacturers like Ford, Holden or Toyota to this nation. Indeed, Senator Carr likes to mention General Motors Holden but he also likes to ignore the fact that Ford made a decision to leave this nation under the former Labor government.


I do not attribute blame to a particular government for that decision. Those decisions have been made due to trends affecting the entire globe. But to think that more investment, more government money, more spending on this industry is going to massively transform the underlying economics simply defies the history here because that is what the history has been over the last decade. It cannot stop that transition. What we need to do is support our automotive sector into a different type of manufacturing. I agree with Senator Carr that there is a bright future for those manufacturers who can do that. It will be a different industry than what we had in the past, but it is a different world today from what it was in the past.


That is why the government is continuing to support the automotive supply chain through the Automotive Diversification Program. I note this committee has suggested that there needs to be more support for automotive manufacturers to diversify and find new markets. The government already has a program for that. It has already announced $12.4 million in funding for that. I am keen to ensure that that program continues and keen to monitor it over time if there is a need for more investment in that way, but we should let that program work first.


Of course, not all areas of the automotive supply chain will stay in that business. That is why we have a $60 million Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Program—to provide some leverage or some support for those manufacturers, those businesses that would seek to diversify into non-automotive manufacturing sectors. Again, already 11 Victorian companies have shared in $27.4 million of support, which is expected to leverage $75 million in total investment. In South Australia, 15 businesses have received $28.3 million in government support—hoping to end up with a total private and public sector investment of $72.5 million.


Of course, the government has also signed three new free-trade agreements and, recently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which will provide greater access for our component manufacturing sector, in particular, to overseas markets. Those agreements will play an integral role in seeing a brighter future for our automotive sector, because that future probably will not involve the end-to-end manufacture of complete vehicles. But there certainly can be a role for our sector to be part of supply chains in our region and to be part of those supply chains they need market access.


I also note the report makes some comment on the vibrancy of our truck manufacturing sector, a sector which, traditionally, has not received substantial government support, which confirms coalition senators' overall view on these matters—that we do not need a government teat to help wean a strong automotive sector in this country. We have a strong automotive sector in truck manufacturing. It has not received substantial government support but it has done that by being competitive, by being innovative and by serving domestic needs in a very professional way.


I note that the committee's majority report has recommended that there be some changes to the fuel tax credit system for trucks manufactured before 1996. The report recommends that older trucks no longer be able to claim fuel tax credits. We disagree with that particular recommendation. We feel it would be particularly harmful to owner-operators in our country, who often rely on using older trucks—my father-in-law being one—and we do not see any real policy rationale for denying fuel tax credits to certain operators simply because of the age of their truck. Obviously, trucks—




Senator Kim Carr:
  The pollution level of their truck!




Senator CANAVAN:
  need to meet pollution levels, Senator Carr, and they obviously need to meet those standards. They obviously need to meet safety standards on roads as well. Providing that they can do that and are updated in a way commensurate with those obligations, there seems no real reason to deny them fuel tax credits, which is an integral part of the way we pay for road investment in this country.


I note that there are some other recommendations from the committee.




Senator Heffernan:
  And tractors!




Senator CANAVAN:
  Yes, Senator Heffernan, we are actually speaking about fuel tax credits. You are right to raise the importance of a fuel tax rebate as well but that is a slightly different issue than what is before the chair. The committee has made a number of other recommendations, which, I think, the government could usefully examine, particularly with regard to: the franchising code of conduct; the service and smash repair industries, which have been under review for some years; training and re-employment initiatives; specialist and enthusiast vehicles; and regulatory arrangements for aftermarket modifications.


I do want to credit the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for its work in this area. Again, I recognise Senator Carr's passion and that of some of my coalition members. We did have extensive hearings on this particular issue. As with most committees, it is a bit like the curate's egg: there are some very good parts of this report, some we disagree with, but it is still a very useful exercise to investigate and inquire into an extremely important industry in our nation and one that I hope and believe will continue to be so.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-12-01,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:22):  The Australian Greens recognise that there are significant challenges facing the industries and the workforces of Australia's automotive manufacturing sector. This Senate inquiry into the future of the automotive industry has brought to light very important evidence demonstrating how these challenges are impacting the various businesses, workers and communities engaged with automotive manufacturing currently in Australia. There are so many people and businesses who stand to be directly and significantly impacted by the changes ahead in our auto industry. There are a lot of people who are worried about what lies ahead.


The committee report provides a set of strong recommendations following the inquiry into the issues faced by the automotive industry. The Greens support these recommendations, but we submitted additional comments because we want to highlight a number of areas where the majority report fails to emphasise timely action in order to insulate against the collapse of key industries.


We need to move fast. The automotive components industry is in crisis and, without prompt action, there is a real prospect that most of the components industry will not survive the transition. Successive governments' lack of action to support transition in the industry could see the components sector collapse and the big car makers leave even earlier than they are intending to, with potentially devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families.


Electric mobility is the future. There is such potential to join the shift to electric and alternative fuel vehicles, which will enable us to reap enormous benefits in both the economy and the environment. Electric vehicles are cleaner and can be powered by renewable energy. They can contribute to electricity demand management by providing battery storage to the grid. Over the coming decades, electric vehicles are going to join the internet, mobile communications and distributed energy in transforming our economy and society. It is clear that the government can play a role in creating a domestic market for electric vehicles.


We agree with the majority recommendation in the report tabled today, which is to redefine the Automotive Transformation Scheme into a broader automotive related advanced manufacturing, engineering and design program that is intended to maintain skills and industrial capabilities and to stop the loss of jobs by supporting supply chain diversification, new manufacturing investment and jobs growth. But, critically, we believe there should be a time frame placed on this recommendation to ensure this occurs as a matter of urgency, given the imminent exit of the big three car manufacturers.


Opportunities are going to be missed if a new plan is not put in place soon. Ford's planned exit in 2016, together with shrinking forward orders in the components sector, frees up what is estimated to be $800 million in savings in the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which can be redirected and spent on a longer term jobs plan. We support the recommendation to broaden the object of the Automotive Transformation Scheme to drive diversification and transformation activities. We think that electric or alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy technologies should be priorities for this transformed scheme.


We note the majority recommendation for government to urgently develop and implement a coordinated strategy to avoid a social and economic catastrophe associated with the closure of vehicle manufacturing. But we would like to see some meat on the bones of this recommendation in order to ensure that such a strategy has a level of guidance based on the evidence that was presented to our committee. For example, we would see value in highlighting issues such as skills and job transitions, community support and services and appropriately targeted industry investment.


We also note the recommendation in the majority report to conduct a review of the Voluntary Code of Practice for Access to Service and Repair Information for Motor Vehicles. We believe that the voluntary nature of this code, as it is at the moment, should be a central aspect of that review, because the committee heard compelling evidence that so far this code has had very poor take-up and impact in its first year. We believe there is a very strong case that this review should be short and sharp and be undertaken as soon as possible and that there is a very strong case that the code should be mandatory.


We have only seen one of the car brands fully meeting the requirements of the code. That is one out of 68 car brands supplying to the Australian market. This means that car owners are being dudded, because they do not have real choice of car repairer. They are forced to go to the specialist dealerships because small businesses and independent car repairers are being locked out and cannot get the info they need about repairing specific systems brand by brand. That means that independent car repairers do not have the ability to see whether cars are being tuned properly and minimising their pollution, and it allows scandals like the VW emissions fraud to happen again and again, because there is no independent tailpipe testing of emissions, which could happen when cars are being serviced.


The United States has got mandatory sharing of information, so there is no reason why we should not have that here. And it is urgent that this occur, because independent family-owned businesses are going to the wall while it does not occur. This is such an important thing—to support small businesses and to give people choice of who should repair their cars. Every month we delay is a month of businesses struggling to survive and of more polluting cars.


In summary, the Greens do not oppose the intent of the recommendations in the committee's report but we believe they are not sufficiently forward thinking. We recommend adopting the recommendations but modifying them to incorporate stronger recommendations to drive change sooner. Our additional recommendations put forward a concrete way forward. We recommend that the ATS and its governing legislation be amended to continue support to currently eligible ATS recipients and to redirect the estimated $800 million ATS underspend towards a green and electric car scheme. We want to broaden the eligibility for new entrants to the scheme and promote the car technologies of the future.


Amongst other key issues, we want to focus assistance on auto parts makers that are seeking to be part of the local or global supply chain for electric vehicles or vehicles not powered by fossil fuels. We have also put forward a recommendation to support incentives and infrastructure support to encourage the purchase and rollout of electric vehicles in Australia. We want to see this on COAG's agenda, because we should be developing a policy framework for electric and alternative fuel vehicles and committing to a near-term target for the take-up of electric vehicles in Australia.


There is such potential in the auto industry in Australia, and it is just going to require some vision, some political will from government, to take up that potential and really transform our car industry into a growth industry and an industry that will be supporting a clean environment and supporting jobs in advanced manufacturing.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:30):  The report of the Senate Economics References Committee on Australia's automotive industry is an important report and it has a clear message: we cannot give up on automotive manufacturing in this nation. The recommendations in the report are clear and unambiguous. They set out a template to save many of the jobs that potentially will be lost as a result of Ford, Holden and Toyota leaving at the end of 2017. In fact, Ford is due to leave in less than 12 months as a car maker in this country. Let me put this in perspective. It will involve up to 200,000 jobs being lost, according the Bracks review on the auto sector and according to work carried out by the University of Adelaide. It will involve a massive $29 billion hit to our GDP. It will mean that, as far as manufacturing as a percentage of GDP, Australia will slip behind countries like Botswana and Rwanda. Currently manufacturing has slipped to something like 6.8 per cent of GDP—compared with Rwanda at five per cent and Botswana at six per cent. We will go below those countries. Compare this with Germany, which has an active program of encouraging advanced manufacturing and of encouraging its auto sector. Twenty-two per cent of Germany's GDP is based on manufacturing. 


We must do everything we can to arrest the tsunami of job losses we are facing as a result of the departure of these three car makers from our shores. I think we need to take the attitude that we must not give up on auto manufacturing in this country. Senator Bernardi is shaking his head. I am not sure whether he is agreeing or disagreeing. 




Senator Bernardi:
  I'm agreeing with you. It is a big hole to be filled.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is a big hole to be filled, but I believe that it is a massive challenge and we are up to it. With political will and working together with industry, we can do this because the consequence of not doing this will be massive to our economy around the country, as Senator Carr indicated.


Let us say that 100,000 jobs will be lost in net terms. I think it will be worse than that because we are looking at 200,000 jobs. The welfare bill alone would be in the order of $2 billion a year, and yet we have an automotive diversification program in the tens of millions—about $60 million—which is hopelessly oversubscribed. It is not enough. The government is holding back on the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and that is something that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. 


The reason we need to deal with this urgently is that we are running out of time. The next six months will be critical for the future of this industry and the future of jobs in this sector. Ethan Automotive has already spent, as I understand it, several million dollars drawing up plans, seeking designers from around the world and getting the supply chain in order for their proposal to build a locally-made, Australian owned car. Punch Group is looking at building a car here in Australia by taking over the General Motors plant. That will, of course, involve negotiations with Holden locally and with the Detroit head office but it will also see the government being involved in a positive and proactive way. If that plant can be taken over by Punch Group or any other entity that has the capacity to do so, it will save those jobs. It will save supply chain jobs.


We also need to be very active in terms of working with the aftermarket sector that Senator Muir has been a champion of. Stuart Charity and his team, and the Motor Trades Association with Richard Dudley as CEO are doing a great job. We need to look at that as well. We need to have a relationship between the automotive sector, advanced manufacturing and our defence sectors so that there can be a transition there. But I do not believe we should give up on the automotive sector in this country in terms of the capacity, the ability and the potential to build cars in this country. After all, if we look at just 10 per cent of the 1.1 million cars that are sold in this country every year, that will be enough to keep the supply chain going. 


I want to commend the work that Senator Carr has done on this. Indeed, I commend the work of all committee members but in particular Senator Carr. I also commend Senator Muir for his interest and Senator Madigan for his longstanding and passionate interest in automotive manufacturing and manufacturing generally.


I want to finish with a quote from Thomas Edison. He hit the nail on the head when he said, 'Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.' I believe we need to try just one more time to revive automotive manufacturing in this country because there are serious players with a real interest in reviving it. If that does not succeed, then we ought to look at the supply chain, at diversification and at a whole range of measures to stem the tsunami of job losses we are facing as a nation if we do not get this right.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:35):  I would like to speak on the report of Senate Economics References Committee on Australia's automotive industry. I acknowledge the work of the economics committee and say that this government has a profound level of support for the Automotive Transformation Scheme—ever since Mitsubishi left Adelaide in 2007, and then Ford and Holden subsequently decided at the 2013 election that they would leave. The fact is that over 1.1 million vehicles are sold in this country and, sadly, only 130,000 of those are manufactured in this country, and it is declining. 


This government did not shut down the automotive industry, as those opposite would try to frame it—in the same way that we could say that they closed Mitsubishi in 2007 on their watch. It is simply not the case. It is world economics. It is the way things happen. The industry has been supported and will draw down another $175 million from the automotive transformation package that the government has on offer—and we will not resile from that. I have been working with industries in South Australia, and one company, Cutler Brands, has been awarded over $1 million to transition to other industries. This government shall not and will not resile from trying to protect the jobs in this space.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-12-01,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (16:37):  I am pleased to be standing here to speak on the tabling of this report. As many of my colleagues before me have said, it is an important report. My colleagues have covered a lot of what could be said about this report and have done a very good job in summing up this report.


The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party was formed to represent the views of the motoring enthusiast culture. This is a vast culture with many different aspects and is deeply entrenched in Australian history. It does not matter what your sex, race, religion or social background is, there is always somebody in just about any crowd who can relate to being an enthusiast in some way or another. Further, there are whole industries that are supported by the automotive sector and by motoring enthusiasts.


There is a perception at the moment that the whole sector could well be in trouble. As vehicle manufacturing scales down in Australia, we need to prepare ourselves to find ways to soak up the job losses—which, as Senator Xenophon said, are predicted to be up to 200,000—within the automotive sector and the flow-on industries that could well become redundant. What better option than to create more jobs in the auto sector or similar industries to utilise the skills set that many people currently working in the industry have? They are already thoroughly trained and have great experience and relevant qualifications. So it makes sense to try to utilise the skills which are already current in the automotive sector in jobs of a similar nature.


There is a lot of talk about the auto industry being dead, but that is far from the truth. Automotive manufacturing makes up 20 per cent of jobs in the auto sector. The other 80 per cent is still here and there is a lot of room for improvement. One of the recommendations that the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party suggested in our additional notes to the report is that a PR campaign be undertaken for automotive vocations to encourage careers in the automotive sector. It is not a very attractive prospective career path if your political leaders are running around preaching that the industry is dead. It is not dead; the other 80 per cent is still here and it can still grow.


I am delighted that the interim report, tabled some time back, had a strong focus on the Automotive Transformation Scheme—which has been spoken about by colleagues before me. I do believe there is a need to change the eligibility criteria, so that the scope of the scheme will not die a natural death in 2017 when automotive manufacturing ceases. Having a legislated scheme with dedicated funds available only to eligible manufacturers of components for locally built new vehicles makes no sense once manufacturing ceases. It also makes no sense to take the legislated funds from that scheme instead of using them to assist the other 80 per cent of the industry grow and diversify. Witnesses who appeared before the inquiry spoke about diversifying into new areas—for example, renewable technology. People are looking into different areas to utilise the skills they have.


The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party generally agrees with the report of the inquiry and is very happy with many aspects of it. I really do congratulate the committee staff and everybody involved with this very important report. The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party has, however, provided additional notes in areas where we think there could be a bit of improvement.


I agree with Senator Xenophon when he said that the Automotive Diversification Fund is heavily oversubscribed. It is not only oversubscribed but also underfunded. That is definitely an issue, and that is why I think changing the eligibility criteria for the Automotive Transformation Scheme is so important. There is about a half-a-billion underspend there which could be utilised to help industries—for example, the after-market industries or tier 2 or 3 parts manufacturers—diversify into different areas. Having said that, recommendation 7 of the report is that the 'government support the establishment of an automotive industry task force, with representatives from industry, unions and governments'. I completely agree with this. This is a brilliant idea. What better way to help the industry move forward than have the industry involved? So I strongly support that recommendation. In question time today I asked a question in relation to service data and independent repairers and having the right to choose repairers, and there was a bit of talk afterwards about competition. In my additional notes I have noted that the review of the agreement needs to be immediate—it needs to happen now.


I thank everyone who put in a submission to the committee. I will just pinpoint a couple: the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, Tomcar Australia and Applidyne Australia. Tomcar Australia is actually manufacturing vehicles here in Australia, and Applidyne is trying to manufacture vehicles here in Australia. That is proof that there is scope for manufacturing to continue here in Australia. I thank the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Motoring Advisory Council and Auto Services Group. 


Auto Services Group actually focuses on imports—and that seems to be a dirty word in this place. But we are about to lose manufacturing, and I just mentioned competition in relation to service data, and I think this is something that could well apply a bit of pressure on the manufacturers as there will not be many Australian manufacturers after 2017. There have been a lot of scare campaigns in relation to proper policy around the importation of vehicles, whether it be under the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme or just parallel imports altogether. I will not go into great detail about it. Again, it is in my additional notes. I really do encourage the government to consider this and I would love to continue conversations. I could speak a lot about the rest of the submissions but I will not go into it.


I would like to go a little bit further to thank the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party for their support in the background and thank them for encouraging people to put submissions into the inquiry because it is very important that that happens. I have already thanked the committee staff but I will do that again because I am really bad at getting back to emails on time. They did a really good job dealing with me. I commend all the work done from everybody else in the background. This is an important report. I hope the government takes it seriously and I look forward to seeing some results.

Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (16:45):  I also briefly want to comment on this report and, as a South Australian, put on the record my support for ensuring that we do what we can to support our automotive industry during this period of transition. In my home state of South Australia, we face an economy that is experiencing transition at the moment, transitioning away from coal and carbon within the economy more broadly, but we are also seeing the decline of the manufacturing industry. In that context, it is really critical that we do all that we can to harness the skills of our manufacturing industry and to create new green jobs for the future.


In South Australia, we have Holden due to close from 2017. That is going to have an enormous impact on jobs in South Australia, so we need to ensure that we have a plan in place to move people from employment within existing manufacturing industries into new jobs of the future. Members would be aware Senator Rice and myself have introduced a bill looking at green cars and how we can provide support for that transition in South Australia and in Victoria. I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate to progress that agenda.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-12-01,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:07):  At the request of the Chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, I present the report Future of Australia's automotive industry together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I would like to say a few words about this report. Australia's automotive industry is undergoing fundamental transformation, and I use the word 'transformation' deliberately. I am not one of the doomsayers who believe that the industry will die when the last locally produced car rolls off the production line at the end of 2017. Labor remains confident that with the right policy settings Australia can attract new automotive manufacturing investment and, beyond manufacturing, the automotive industry involves much more than the production of passenger cars. These other activities will include the aftermarket manufacturing; engineering and design; the manufacture and adaption of large trucks and other heavy vehicles; retailing, servicing and smash repairs; sales support; automotive dealerships; and training.


There is no doubt that beyond 2017 the automotive industry will continue and will include manufacturing in some form. The real question is what will be the scope and the extent of manufacturing activity, and the answer to that question will depend upon government policy. That is why 12 months ago the Senate referred this matter to the Economics References Committee. The committee's interim report, tabled in August, made recommendations intended to support the component manufacturers, the section of the industry most vulnerable to the departure of car markers. It is vital that the industry capabilities they possess are maintained.


The automotive industry has always been the great repository of skills and knowledge in advanced manufacturing in Australia, and preserving those skills will be the key to attracting new investment. It will be the people that attract the investment. We have got to have the right trained people to maintain the capacities to attract that investment.


The main recommendations of the interim report concern the provision of co-investment through the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The inquiry called on the government to maintain funding under the scheme through to 2021 as the ATS Act provides. The inquiry also recommended that eligibility for ATS be broadened and that it be reconfigured as an advanced manufacturing, engineering and design scheme. It would still be automotive related but it would be able to assist supply chain firms in diversification and entering new markets.


The final report expressed the committee's conviction that the government should set in place policies that encourage diversification, growth and innovation in automotive manufacturing in Australia. It calls for a whole-of-government approach, with the allocation of resources from a range of departments to ensure that the processes of transformation continue. To facilitate this and to develop a coordinated national framework for automotive policy, the committee calls on the government to establish an automotive industry task force. The task force, with representatives from industry, from unions and from governments, would build on the work of the AutoCRC and the Automotive Australia 2020 road map project. This was an integral part of the New Car Plan, which, of course, provided for the opportunities to be identified for future investment and future growth in the automotive industry in this country.


The final report also makes recommendations intended to avoid a social and economic catastrophe in the regions most directly affected by the shutdown in car-making, particularly in Victoria and in South Australia. I might add that there is not a state in the Commonwealth that will not be directly affected with massive job losses as a consequence of the government's actions in driving General Motors and Toyota out of Australia. No-one pretends that the impact will be anything other than severe.


This should be seen not just as a time of challenge but as a time of new opportunities. If we develop policy wisely and we preserve our skills and knowledge base, the automotive industry will survive—and not just survive; it will flourish. There are international precedents for this kind of revival. At the end of the 1980s, the United Kingdom automotive industry was predicted to die in much the same way as some of the smarties in this town have suggested about the Australian automotive industry. Of course, that was a direct result of the devastation of Margaret Thatcher.


But in the United Kingdom the automotive industry did not die.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  No, the automotive manufacturer Holden was driven out of this country by the actions of Mr Hockey and the acting Prime Minister at the time, who goaded General Motors to leave, and now we have a consequence where it will cost considerably more—I mean many, many times more—in social security payments and other disaster relief as a consequence of the actions of this government than will ever be spent in terms of co-investment for this industry.


I put to you that in the United Kingdom a similar experience was seen to happen but both sides in politics came to realise how important the automotive industry was to the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom now the Conservative government is investing heavily in co-investment so that the British automotive industry is amongst the most prosperous in the world. The United Kingdom probably has the largest export sector in Europe and it has come a long way from the devastation of Margaret Thatcher. The United Kingdom automotive industry is now a world leader and that is because it has become a bipartisan issue, yet again, as support for the automotive industry once was in this country.


There is no reason in my mind why this could not happen here. The two reports of this inquiry show the necessary policy work has already begun. But what is really needed here is political will. I urge senators on all sides of the chamber to study the committee's report carefully, to adopt its recommendations and to help build the future of the Australian automotive industry.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-12-01,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:15):  I do not question Senator Carr's commitment to see a strong automotive sector in this country and I do not question his prognosis either that there is a bright future still there for the automotive sector in this country. I do, however, take some issue with Senator Carr's proposed remedy because he is proposing to continue doing what we have been doing for years. Colours of both political sides have, for years, been investing in this sector through the Strategic Investment Program, through the Automotive Transformation Scheme but, of course, none of that investment has been able to maintain the commitments of major international car manufacturers like Ford, Holden or Toyota to this nation. Indeed, Senator Carr likes to mention General Motors Holden but he also likes to ignore the fact that Ford made a decision to leave this nation under the former Labor government.


I do not attribute blame to a particular government for that decision. Those decisions have been made due to trends affecting the entire globe. But to think that more investment, more government money, more spending on this industry is going to massively transform the underlying economics simply defies the history here because that is what the history has been over the last decade. It cannot stop that transition. What we need to do is support our automotive sector into a different type of manufacturing. I agree with Senator Carr that there is a bright future for those manufacturers who can do that. It will be a different industry than what we had in the past, but it is a different world today from what it was in the past.


That is why the government is continuing to support the automotive supply chain through the Automotive Diversification Program. I note this committee has suggested that there needs to be more support for automotive manufacturers to diversify and find new markets. The government already has a program for that. It has already announced $12.4 million in funding for that. I am keen to ensure that that program continues and keen to monitor it over time if there is a need for more investment in that way, but we should let that program work first.


Of course, not all areas of the automotive supply chain will stay in that business. That is why we have a $60 million Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Program—to provide some leverage or some support for those manufacturers, those businesses that would seek to diversify into non-automotive manufacturing sectors. Again, already 11 Victorian companies have shared in $27.4 million of support, which is expected to leverage $75 million in total investment. In South Australia, 15 businesses have received $28.3 million in government support—hoping to end up with a total private and public sector investment of $72.5 million.


Of course, the government has also signed three new free-trade agreements and, recently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which will provide greater access for our component manufacturing sector, in particular, to overseas markets. Those agreements will play an integral role in seeing a brighter future for our automotive sector, because that future probably will not involve the end-to-end manufacture of complete vehicles. But there certainly can be a role for our sector to be part of supply chains in our region and to be part of those supply chains they need market access.


I also note the report makes some comment on the vibrancy of our truck manufacturing sector, a sector which, traditionally, has not received substantial government support, which confirms coalition senators' overall view on these matters—that we do not need a government teat to help wean a strong automotive sector in this country. We have a strong automotive sector in truck manufacturing. It has not received substantial government support but it has done that by being competitive, by being innovative and by serving domestic needs in a very professional way.


I note that the committee's majority report has recommended that there be some changes to the fuel tax credit system for trucks manufactured before 1996. The report recommends that older trucks no longer be able to claim fuel tax credits. We disagree with that particular recommendation. We feel it would be particularly harmful to owner-operators in our country, who often rely on using older trucks—my father-in-law being one—and we do not see any real policy rationale for denying fuel tax credits to certain operators simply because of the age of their truck. Obviously, trucks—




Senator Kim Carr:
  The pollution level of their truck!




Senator CANAVAN:
  need to meet pollution levels, Senator Carr, and they obviously need to meet those standards. They obviously need to meet safety standards on roads as well. Providing that they can do that and are updated in a way commensurate with those obligations, there seems no real reason to deny them fuel tax credits, which is an integral part of the way we pay for road investment in this country.


I note that there are some other recommendations from the committee.




Senator Heffernan:
  And tractors!




Senator CANAVAN:
  Yes, Senator Heffernan, we are actually speaking about fuel tax credits. You are right to raise the importance of a fuel tax rebate as well but that is a slightly different issue than what is before the chair. The committee has made a number of other recommendations, which, I think, the government could usefully examine, particularly with regard to: the franchising code of conduct; the service and smash repair industries, which have been under review for some years; training and re-employment initiatives; specialist and enthusiast vehicles; and regulatory arrangements for aftermarket modifications.


I do want to credit the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for its work in this area. Again, I recognise Senator Carr's passion and that of some of my coalition members. We did have extensive hearings on this particular issue. As with most committees, it is a bit like the curate's egg: there are some very good parts of this report, some we disagree with, but it is still a very useful exercise to investigate and inquire into an extremely important industry in our nation and one that I hope and believe will continue to be so.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-12-01,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:22):  The Australian Greens recognise that there are significant challenges facing the industries and the workforces of Australia's automotive manufacturing sector. This Senate inquiry into the future of the automotive industry has brought to light very important evidence demonstrating how these challenges are impacting the various businesses, workers and communities engaged with automotive manufacturing currently in Australia. There are so many people and businesses who stand to be directly and significantly impacted by the changes ahead in our auto industry. There are a lot of people who are worried about what lies ahead.


The committee report provides a set of strong recommendations following the inquiry into the issues faced by the automotive industry. The Greens support these recommendations, but we submitted additional comments because we want to highlight a number of areas where the majority report fails to emphasise timely action in order to insulate against the collapse of key industries.


We need to move fast. The automotive components industry is in crisis and, without prompt action, there is a real prospect that most of the components industry will not survive the transition. Successive governments' lack of action to support transition in the industry could see the components sector collapse and the big car makers leave even earlier than they are intending to, with potentially devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families.


Electric mobility is the future. There is such potential to join the shift to electric and alternative fuel vehicles, which will enable us to reap enormous benefits in both the economy and the environment. Electric vehicles are cleaner and can be powered by renewable energy. They can contribute to electricity demand management by providing battery storage to the grid. Over the coming decades, electric vehicles are going to join the internet, mobile communications and distributed energy in transforming our economy and society. It is clear that the government can play a role in creating a domestic market for electric vehicles.


We agree with the majority recommendation in the report tabled today, which is to redefine the Automotive Transformation Scheme into a broader automotive related advanced manufacturing, engineering and design program that is intended to maintain skills and industrial capabilities and to stop the loss of jobs by supporting supply chain diversification, new manufacturing investment and jobs growth. But, critically, we believe there should be a time frame placed on this recommendation to ensure this occurs as a matter of urgency, given the imminent exit of the big three car manufacturers.


Opportunities are going to be missed if a new plan is not put in place soon. Ford's planned exit in 2016, together with shrinking forward orders in the components sector, frees up what is estimated to be $800 million in savings in the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which can be redirected and spent on a longer term jobs plan. We support the recommendation to broaden the object of the Automotive Transformation Scheme to drive diversification and transformation activities. We think that electric or alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy technologies should be priorities for this transformed scheme.


We note the majority recommendation for government to urgently develop and implement a coordinated strategy to avoid a social and economic catastrophe associated with the closure of vehicle manufacturing. But we would like to see some meat on the bones of this recommendation in order to ensure that such a strategy has a level of guidance based on the evidence that was presented to our committee. For example, we would see value in highlighting issues such as skills and job transitions, community support and services and appropriately targeted industry investment.


We also note the recommendation in the majority report to conduct a review of the Voluntary Code of Practice for Access to Service and Repair Information for Motor Vehicles. We believe that the voluntary nature of this code, as it is at the moment, should be a central aspect of that review, because the committee heard compelling evidence that so far this code has had very poor take-up and impact in its first year. We believe there is a very strong case that this review should be short and sharp and be undertaken as soon as possible and that there is a very strong case that the code should be mandatory.


We have only seen one of the car brands fully meeting the requirements of the code. That is one out of 68 car brands supplying to the Australian market. This means that car owners are being dudded, because they do not have real choice of car repairer. They are forced to go to the specialist dealerships because small businesses and independent car repairers are being locked out and cannot get the info they need about repairing specific systems brand by brand. That means that independent car repairers do not have the ability to see whether cars are being tuned properly and minimising their pollution, and it allows scandals like the VW emissions fraud to happen again and again, because there is no independent tailpipe testing of emissions, which could happen when cars are being serviced.


The United States has got mandatory sharing of information, so there is no reason why we should not have that here. And it is urgent that this occur, because independent family-owned businesses are going to the wall while it does not occur. This is such an important thing—to support small businesses and to give people choice of who should repair their cars. Every month we delay is a month of businesses struggling to survive and of more polluting cars.


In summary, the Greens do not oppose the intent of the recommendations in the committee's report but we believe they are not sufficiently forward thinking. We recommend adopting the recommendations but modifying them to incorporate stronger recommendations to drive change sooner. Our additional recommendations put forward a concrete way forward. We recommend that the ATS and its governing legislation be amended to continue support to currently eligible ATS recipients and to redirect the estimated $800 million ATS underspend towards a green and electric car scheme. We want to broaden the eligibility for new entrants to the scheme and promote the car technologies of the future.


Amongst other key issues, we want to focus assistance on auto parts makers that are seeking to be part of the local or global supply chain for electric vehicles or vehicles not powered by fossil fuels. We have also put forward a recommendation to support incentives and infrastructure support to encourage the purchase and rollout of electric vehicles in Australia. We want to see this on COAG's agenda, because we should be developing a policy framework for electric and alternative fuel vehicles and committing to a near-term target for the take-up of electric vehicles in Australia.


There is such potential in the auto industry in Australia, and it is just going to require some vision, some political will from government, to take up that potential and really transform our car industry into a growth industry and an industry that will be supporting a clean environment and supporting jobs in advanced manufacturing.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-01,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:30):  The report of the Senate Economics References Committee on Australia's automotive industry is an important report and it has a clear message: we cannot give up on automotive manufacturing in this nation. The recommendations in the report are clear and unambiguous. They set out a template to save many of the jobs that potentially will be lost as a result of Ford, Holden and Toyota leaving at the end of 2017. In fact, Ford is due to leave in less than 12 months as a car maker in this country. Let me put this in perspective. It will involve up to 200,000 jobs being lost, according the Bracks review on the auto sector and according to work carried out by the University of Adelaide. It will involve a massive $29 billion hit to our GDP. It will mean that, as far as manufacturing as a percentage of GDP, Australia will slip behind countries like Botswana and Rwanda. Currently manufacturing has slipped to something like 6.8 per cent of GDP—compared with Rwanda at five per cent and Botswana at six per cent. We will go below those countries. Compare this with Germany, which has an active program of encouraging advanced manufacturing and of encouraging its auto sector. Twenty-two per cent of Germany's GDP is based on manufacturing. 


We must do everything we can to arrest the tsunami of job losses we are facing as a result of the departure of these three car makers from our shores. I think we need to take the attitude that we must not give up on auto manufacturing in this country. Senator Bernardi is shaking his head. I am not sure whether he is agreeing or disagreeing. 




Senator Bernardi:
  I'm agreeing with you. It is a big hole to be filled.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is a big hole to be filled, but I believe that it is a massive challenge and we are up to it. With political will and working together with industry, we can do this because the consequence of not doing this will be massive to our economy around the country, as Senator Carr indicated.


Let us say that 100,000 jobs will be lost in net terms. I think it will be worse than that because we are looking at 200,000 jobs. The welfare bill alone would be in the order of $2 billion a year, and yet we have an automotive diversification program in the tens of millions—about $60 million—which is hopelessly oversubscribed. It is not enough. The government is holding back on the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and that is something that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. 


The reason we need to deal with this urgently is that we are running out of time. The next six months will be critical for the future of this industry and the future of jobs in this sector. Ethan Automotive has already spent, as I understand it, several million dollars drawing up plans, seeking designers from around the world and getting the supply chain in order for their proposal to build a locally-made, Australian owned car. Punch Group is looking at building a car here in Australia by taking over the General Motors plant. That will, of course, involve negotiations with Holden locally and with the Detroit head office but it will also see the government being involved in a positive and proactive way. If that plant can be taken over by Punch Group or any other entity that has the capacity to do so, it will save those jobs. It will save supply chain jobs.


We also need to be very active in terms of working with the aftermarket sector that Senator Muir has been a champion of. Stuart Charity and his team, and the Motor Trades Association with Richard Dudley as CEO are doing a great job. We need to look at that as well. We need to have a relationship between the automotive sector, advanced manufacturing and our defence sectors so that there can be a transition there. But I do not believe we should give up on the automotive sector in this country in terms of the capacity, the ability and the potential to build cars in this country. After all, if we look at just 10 per cent of the 1.1 million cars that are sold in this country every year, that will be enough to keep the supply chain going. 


I want to commend the work that Senator Carr has done on this. Indeed, I commend the work of all committee members but in particular Senator Carr. I also commend Senator Muir for his interest and Senator Madigan for his longstanding and passionate interest in automotive manufacturing and manufacturing generally.


I want to finish with a quote from Thomas Edison. He hit the nail on the head when he said, 'Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.' I believe we need to try just one more time to revive automotive manufacturing in this country because there are serious players with a real interest in reviving it. If that does not succeed, then we ought to look at the supply chain, at diversification and at a whole range of measures to stem the tsunami of job losses we are facing as a nation if we do not get this right.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:35):  I would like to speak on the report of Senate Economics References Committee on Australia's automotive industry. I acknowledge the work of the economics committee and say that this government has a profound level of support for the Automotive Transformation Scheme—ever since Mitsubishi left Adelaide in 2007, and then Ford and Holden subsequently decided at the 2013 election that they would leave. The fact is that over 1.1 million vehicles are sold in this country and, sadly, only 130,000 of those are manufactured in this country, and it is declining. 


This government did not shut down the automotive industry, as those opposite would try to frame it—in the same way that we could say that they closed Mitsubishi in 2007 on their watch. It is simply not the case. It is world economics. It is the way things happen. The industry has been supported and will draw down another $175 million from the automotive transformation package that the government has on offer—and we will not resile from that. I have been working with industries in South Australia, and one company, Cutler Brands, has been awarded over $1 million to transition to other industries. This government shall not and will not resile from trying to protect the jobs in this space.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-12-01,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (16:37):  I am pleased to be standing here to speak on the tabling of this report. As many of my colleagues before me have said, it is an important report. My colleagues have covered a lot of what could be said about this report and have done a very good job in summing up this report.


The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party was formed to represent the views of the motoring enthusiast culture. This is a vast culture with many different aspects and is deeply entrenched in Australian history. It does not matter what your sex, race, religion or social background is, there is always somebody in just about any crowd who can relate to being an enthusiast in some way or another. Further, there are whole industries that are supported by the automotive sector and by motoring enthusiasts.


There is a perception at the moment that the whole sector could well be in trouble. As vehicle manufacturing scales down in Australia, we need to prepare ourselves to find ways to soak up the job losses—which, as Senator Xenophon said, are predicted to be up to 200,000—within the automotive sector and the flow-on industries that could well become redundant. What better option than to create more jobs in the auto sector or similar industries to utilise the skills set that many people currently working in the industry have? They are already thoroughly trained and have great experience and relevant qualifications. So it makes sense to try to utilise the skills which are already current in the automotive sector in jobs of a similar nature.


There is a lot of talk about the auto industry being dead, but that is far from the truth. Automotive manufacturing makes up 20 per cent of jobs in the auto sector. The other 80 per cent is still here and there is a lot of room for improvement. One of the recommendations that the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party suggested in our additional notes to the report is that a PR campaign be undertaken for automotive vocations to encourage careers in the automotive sector. It is not a very attractive prospective career path if your political leaders are running around preaching that the industry is dead. It is not dead; the other 80 per cent is still here and it can still grow.


I am delighted that the interim report, tabled some time back, had a strong focus on the Automotive Transformation Scheme—which has been spoken about by colleagues before me. I do believe there is a need to change the eligibility criteria, so that the scope of the scheme will not die a natural death in 2017 when automotive manufacturing ceases. Having a legislated scheme with dedicated funds available only to eligible manufacturers of components for locally built new vehicles makes no sense once manufacturing ceases. It also makes no sense to take the legislated funds from that scheme instead of using them to assist the other 80 per cent of the industry grow and diversify. Witnesses who appeared before the inquiry spoke about diversifying into new areas—for example, renewable technology. People are looking into different areas to utilise the skills they have.


The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party generally agrees with the report of the inquiry and is very happy with many aspects of it. I really do congratulate the committee staff and everybody involved with this very important report. The Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party has, however, provided additional notes in areas where we think there could be a bit of improvement.


I agree with Senator Xenophon when he said that the Automotive Diversification Fund is heavily oversubscribed. It is not only oversubscribed but also underfunded. That is definitely an issue, and that is why I think changing the eligibility criteria for the Automotive Transformation Scheme is so important. There is about a half-a-billion underspend there which could be utilised to help industries—for example, the after-market industries or tier 2 or 3 parts manufacturers—diversify into different areas. Having said that, recommendation 7 of the report is that the 'government support the establishment of an automotive industry task force, with representatives from industry, unions and governments'. I completely agree with this. This is a brilliant idea. What better way to help the industry move forward than have the industry involved? So I strongly support that recommendation. In question time today I asked a question in relation to service data and independent repairers and having the right to choose repairers, and there was a bit of talk afterwards about competition. In my additional notes I have noted that the review of the agreement needs to be immediate—it needs to happen now.


I thank everyone who put in a submission to the committee. I will just pinpoint a couple: the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, Tomcar Australia and Applidyne Australia. Tomcar Australia is actually manufacturing vehicles here in Australia, and Applidyne is trying to manufacture vehicles here in Australia. That is proof that there is scope for manufacturing to continue here in Australia. I thank the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Motoring Advisory Council and Auto Services Group. 


Auto Services Group actually focuses on imports—and that seems to be a dirty word in this place. But we are about to lose manufacturing, and I just mentioned competition in relation to service data, and I think this is something that could well apply a bit of pressure on the manufacturers as there will not be many Australian manufacturers after 2017. There have been a lot of scare campaigns in relation to proper policy around the importation of vehicles, whether it be under the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme or just parallel imports altogether. I will not go into great detail about it. Again, it is in my additional notes. I really do encourage the government to consider this and I would love to continue conversations. I could speak a lot about the rest of the submissions but I will not go into it.


I would like to go a little bit further to thank the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party for their support in the background and thank them for encouraging people to put submissions into the inquiry because it is very important that that happens. I have already thanked the committee staff but I will do that again because I am really bad at getting back to emails on time. They did a really good job dealing with me. I commend all the work done from everybody else in the background. This is an important report. I hope the government takes it seriously and I look forward to seeing some results.

In my home state of South Australia, we face an economy that is experiencing transition at the moment, transitioning away from coal and carbon within the economy more broadly, but we are also seeing the decline of the manufacturing industry. In that context, it is really critical that we do all that we can to harness the skills of our manufacturing industry and to create new green jobs for the future.


In South Australia, we have Holden due to close from 2017. That is going to have an enormous impact on jobs in South Australia, so we need to ensure that we have a plan in place to move people from employment within existing manufacturing industries into new jobs of the future. Members would be aware Senator Rice and myself have introduced a bill looking at green cars and how we can provide support for that transition in South Australia and in Victoria. I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate to progress that agenda.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to respond to the ministerial statement tabled on behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Stuart Robert, and to reiterate the sentiment expressed by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the Hon. David Feeney in the other place. I also take this opportunity to formally congratulate Mr Robert on his appointment to the role as Minister for Veterans' Affairs.


The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is always an important role but in 2015, 100 years after the dawn landings at Gallipoli, it is even more significant. It is this hundredth year that we, as Australians, can reflect on the Anzac values, described most aptly by World War I historian Charles Bean in his book, Anzac to Amiens, of resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance—values that have become an enduring part of the Australian psyche. Although the Anzac Day dawn service in Gallipoli this year was central to the commemorative events, there will be many important days to commemorate over the four-year period of the centenary. 


For Australia, the great war was tragic, profound and transformational. For a nation of some four million to five million, over 400,000 Australians volunteered for that war and more than 330,000 of them served overseas. Of those, more than 60,000 never came home. To echo the point made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the other place, one of the most redeeming qualities of our commemoration of Gallipoli, in particular, is the tribute we pay to the bravery of troops who fought on both sides of the struggle. During the Anzac Centenary, we have the opportunity to honour the service and sacrifice of those Australians who permanently linked those values and qualities with the name Anzac. The Centenary of Anzac national program to date has achieved just that. The service and sacrifice by Australian service men and women in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia has participated, and continues to participate, have been commemorated this year. 


This is also a good time to think of the men and women of the ADF currently serving overseas and their families at home supporting them. These personnel are working in places like the Middle East, Africa and the Indian Ocean on behalf of us. The best qualities of our military and community are demonstrated by these people. They operate under challenging circumstances with dignity, compassion and professionalism. As they uphold the honourable values that we associate with the Anzac spirit, their families at home bear the heavy burden of an absent loved one.


In conclusion, the centenary is one of the most significant periods of commemoration in our nation's history. It is a time to reflect on the Anzac values of mateship, courage, sacrifice, loyalty and resilience, and on how these values are upheld by Australian service men and women today. It is a time to reflect upon the impact that these struggles and conflicts, these failures and successes, have had in shaping modern Australia. I thank the minister for his update and reaffirm Labor's strong bipartisan support for the Centenary of Anzac national problem.

The speech read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER STUDIES AMENDMENT BILL 2015


Today I introduce the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Amendment Bill 2015.


The Bill will allow for amendments to be made to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989.  These amendments will strengthen the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies' (AIATSIS) governance arrangements and refocus it on its core activities of collection and preservation of Indigenous culture and heritage.


AIATSIS' work involves curating, researching and preserving our internationally significant collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage.


AIATSIS holds over a million items of historical and cultural significance.  According to a recent independent analysis, AIATSIS holds the most extensive and best contextualized collection of Indigenous Australia in the world.


These items come in all manner of media and formats, some of which cannot be replaced. The national collection includes more than 175,680 titles of printed material, 5000 manuscripts, 2600 rare books, and 650,000 photographs relating to Indigenous Australia dating from the late 1800s. 


It also includes the Australian Indigenous Languages Collection, which contains over 4300 titles, and more than 40,000 hours of audio. 


The language collection is of such international significance that it is now part of the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register.


AIATSIS is proud that its collection grows at a rate of some 1400 items per year. Importantly, or perhaps sadly, AIATSIS holds audio visual recordings of some Indigenous communities and languages which no longer exist.


Maintaining a collection of such breadth, cultural significance and value is not without enormous challenges.  


This Bill is part of a reform agenda that will assist AIATSIS to position itself for the future so that this is achievable.  


It is an agenda that has been developed through consensus – that recognises the national importance of AIATSIS and acknowledges there must be change to ensure its sustainability.


In addition, in May this year, the former Minister for Education and Training, the Hon Christopher Pyne, worked with the AIATSIS Council on the establishment of the AIATSIS Foundation. The Governor-General, His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC, launched it. 


The AIATSIS Foundation will make it possible for the broader community and philanthropists to support and contribute to the critical work of AIATSIS. 


This follows steps taken in the 2014–15 and 2015–16 Budgets, when $8.3 million in additional funding was provided over those two years, so that the most immediate risks to the preservation of the national collection of Indigenous cultural materials could be addressed. 


This Bill now takes important steps to reform the appointment process for the AIATSIS Council and refocus the functions of AIATSIS towards the purposes it is uniquely placed to achieve.


This includes that the national collection is maintained as a major research resource and the largest of its kind in the world.  


More and more of this information is being used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to reconnect with their culture. It is also increasingly being used to enable cultural revival, including access to lost languages. 


The amendments in the Bill reflect the contemporary environment for the heritage and culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It affirms AIATSIS' national leadership role in preserving, understanding and communicating this heritage and culture for future generations.


The Bill will refresh the appointment process for the AIATSIS Council. 


In making appointments in the future, consideration will need to be given to the overall skill set of the Council so that effective and contemporary governance practices guides the work of AIATSIS. The principle of diversity will be embedded, and importantly so will the requirement to maintain an Indigenous majority on the Council. 


In the future, the Council will be refreshed on a rolling basis by limiting membership to a maximum of two consecutive terms. 


These changes will provide AIATSIS with a dynamic and strategic Council to oversee and guide the activities of the Institute into the future. 


AIATSIS currently has a wide range of legislated responsibilities which include: promoting, publishing and undertaking relevant research; assisting in training people, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as research workers in relevant fields; establishing and maintaining a cultural resource collection; and encouraging understanding, in the general community, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage.


Streamlining the number of legislated functions that AIATSIS is required to undertake, from eight to five, will better target available resources to ensure that maximum effort is directed towards preserving the national collection. 


Since the AIATSIS Act was enacted in 1989, the landscape for preserving, understanding, communicating and developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage has changed and grown, with many more academic, cultural and community organisations and institutions involved.  


AIATSIS will be better positioned to focus on preserving, maintaining and reviving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge, languages, cultures and histories and traditions passed on from one generation to another, now and into the future. 


This Bill is an important next step in ensuring the preservation of this important national collection.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-12-01,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (21:30):  I rise tonight to talk about a business in my local town, Bindaree Beef. In the mid-1990s, the town of Inverell in northern New South Wales was facing a bleak future. North West Exports abattoirs, owned by the Smorgan family, closed down throwing hundreds of people out of work. The abattoir was the district's largest employer but, from time to time, was affected by strikes and also poor water supply. The busiest place in town after the closure was the Commonwealth Employment Service, as men and women of all ages registered for jobs that did not exist in the town, which, at that time, had a population of around 10,000. The processing plant was old and in much need of refurbishment so it seemed a forlorn hope that it would ever be reopened.


Then, thankfully, along came the McDonald family, more particularly John McDonald, or J.R. as everyone knows him. J.R. admits he was warned not to touch Inverell; there were too many problems. But if there is one thing I have learnt in the years I have known J.R. McDonald, it is that he has never walked away from the tough decisions or challenges, and so the name 'Bindaree Beef' suddenly became part of Inverell's business life. The abattoir reopened and people were invited to apply for jobs. It was made clear to all and sundry that, if you wanted a job, you had to be drug and alcohol free, the work was hard and it was all about teamwork.


That was 20 years ago, and there have been plenty of times since then when J.R. and his family must have wondered whether it was all worth it. The plant was old, finance to modernise the plant was hard to get, and costs were crippling. But they never gave up. Today, Bindaree Beef employs in excess of 800 people—I think, around 850—and that is not taking into account all the people who depend on their existence: cattle producers, stock agents, trucking companies, even job agencies. In those 20 years, Bindaree Beef has processed 5.2 million cattle, employed over 7,000 people and paid over $750 million in wages and salaries—that is, three-quarters of a billion dollars. Returns to cattle producers have topped $5 billion, there have been 225,000 truck movements in and out of the meatworks, and beef is exported to 70 countries. J.R. McDonald, from day one, has been a strong advocate for the cattle producer. Countless times he has said that his business would not exist if beef producers did not make money and therefore stay in business. He also has been a regular contributor to parliamentary inquiries, giving his view as to where the red meat industry could do better.


The company is undertaking a major development with the building of its biodigester plant at its Inverell site. It will be a highly effective waste-treatment system that will produce biogas and liquid fertilizer, generating power and steam for on-site use. The biodigester will use less electricity and steam.


In recent months, Bindaree Beef has made some exciting announcements. In July, Bindaree merged with meat marketing and distribution company, Sanger, closely followed by the $25 million purchase of Myola feedlot at North Star, which is to the north of Warialda. The merger with Sanger allows processing integration with sales, and the acquisition of the feedlot gives them a level of control over their beef supply. In October, Bindaree was delighted to announce that a Chinese partner had been found to inject $140 million into the business, which is a 45 per cent stake. The $140 million will be mostly spent at the Inverell plant on technology changes in freezing, chilling and boning. This opens up a whole new world for Bindaree Beef.


Bindaree's Chief Financial Officer, James Roger, credited the Australian government's determination to open up market access in China as playing a valuable role in the Bindaree-Shandong Delisi Food Company alliance. He said Bindaree had been involved in a number of trade delegations led by ministers Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Robb, and, along with the free-trade agreement, this had led to a better understanding of the Chinese market.


Last Saturday night, we had a function celebrating 20 years of Bindaree Beef and about 250 people attended. I would like to congratulate the McDonald family for the magnificent job they have done in establishing the meatworks over 20 years. They have certainly been through some dry gullies. I congratulate J.R. McDonald and his wife, Norma; their son, Andrew; and also their daughter, Kerri Newton, and her husband, John. They have done a magnificent job competing in a very tough industry against the multinationals—JBS Swift, Teys Cargill, Nippon. This family-owned meatworks has just been so tremendous for our town—850 people employed. They are bidding on the stock market, putting money into the farmers' and beef producers' products. I commend them for the magnificent job they have done. I hope they keep it going.
