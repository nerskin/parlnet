"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-10-08,"—I rise to speak on this legislation in my capacity as the Australian Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson. The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003, as senators would know, has significant implications for the conduct of Australia's foreign affairs. Some of the measures that it contains will influence our relationships with other countries and, of course, our relationships with international organisations such as the United Nations. The bill is about the extraterritorial application of Australian law outside our sovereign borders. It heralds an important and significant change for the government on this issue.
It is interesting to consider this bill in the light of some of the previous comments by this government in relation to extraterritorial operations of Australian law. In particular, I note that this government was strongly opposed to the Australian Democrats private member's bill, our Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 [2002], which was originally introduced in the year 2000 by my colleague former Senator Vicki Bourne. That remains on the Senate Notice Paper, and it is a bill to which I am strongly committed and on which I have continued to seek advice and consultation from others. The Corporate Code of Conduct Bill seeks to regulate the activities of Australian companies operating overseas in relation to human rights, the environment, labour standards and occupational health and safety standards. The international regulatory environment has failed to keep pace with the rapid globalisation of business. The nature of today's corporations means that traditional national legal structures do not apply to a company whose head office is in one country but which says its operations are in another. Australian companies carrying out their functions in foreign countries should conduct themselves decently and in a manner that does good and, of course, not harm for the people living there. The Australian community has made it clear that it believes that corporations carry not only social but environmental obligations in addition to their economic objectives.
The St James Ethics Centre recently published results from a global poll that was sponsored by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The results of that poll showed that 92 per cent of Australians think that the role of large companies is to go beyond the minimum definition of their role in society, which is to employ people and make profits. They believe they should also contribute to setting higher ethical standards and help build a better society for all. The same study showed that one in five respondents actually avoid purchasing products from a particular company if they perceive that that company is in some way not socially responsible. In addition, six out of 10 consumers form their impression of a company based on its labour practices, business ethics, and its responsibility to the community and society at large—or, indeed, its environmental impacts.
So there is an increasingly consumer-driven incentive for corporations to conduct their business in accordance with international human rights, environmental and labour standards, and it is encouraging to see a number of companies in our country rising to this particular challenge. Unfortunately, there are many others that continue to lag behind. For example, the reputation 100 survey published in October 2000 indicated that 95 of the top 100 companies in Australia do not even have a policy commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many Australian companies, unfortunately, have shown a similar disregard for environmental standards. 
I take this opportunity to highlight just one example from the Oxfam Community Aid Abroad's Mining Ombudsman's report. It relates to a mine in Papua New Guinea, the Tolukuma mine, which is operated by DRD. In 2000, during transportation to the mine, a helicopter dropped 1,000 kilograms of cyanide in the Yaloge River valley. DRD failed to take appropriate measures to clean up the spill and, consequently, as many senators would know, members of that local community became ill. They had symptoms such as yellow feet, swollen stomachs and open sores. The community attributes more than 30 deaths to regular exposure to the cyanide in the river. Community members are now afraid to use that river water for basic uses such as washing or for drinking. This poses a number of difficulties, particularly in the dry season when other water sources dry up, and the members of the community are becoming malnourished due to a lack of accessible, healthy water. The spill also resulted in substantial environmental degradation, including a loss of vegetation and fruit trees and a reduction in fish, prawn and eel populations.
Examples such as this illustrate why a corporate code of conduct is required and, of course, the Democrats are not alone in advocating for this. There is now an overwhelming body of academic discourse advocating for national and international mechanisms to promote corporate responsibility. Moreover, in the time since the Democrats bill was initially introduced, we have seen corporate responsibility bills introduced in a number of other parliaments throughout the world. The Democrats hope that this will persuade at least one party in this chamber, the Australian Labor Party, to change their previous view that the `time has not yet come' for prescriptive corporate code of conduct legislation.
Following its introduction into the Senate, the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill was the subject of an inquiry by the then parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The report released by the government members of that committee was very critical of the fact that the bill sought to apply Australian law extraterritorially. In fact, the government's report described this as the `most problematic feature' of the bill. It focused on those submissions that argued the bill was imperialistic, arrogant, patronising and paternalistic and concluded that the legislation, if enacted, would be detrimental to Australia's reputation. Ironically, in the context of the current debate, the government is now advocating in favour of the very aspects of the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill—namely, its extraterritorial operation—which it previously criticised so fiercely. The inconsistency—indeed, one might say the hypocrisy—is startling.
Of course, there was a compelling argument against the government's accusations of paternalism in relation to the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill. The purpose of that bill was not to apply Australian law extraterritorially; it was to ensure that Australian corporations complied with internationally recognised standards. Contrary to the government's claims about the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill being detrimental to Australia's reputation, the bill, if passed—and I hope one day it will be—will encourage Australian corporations to become world leaders in relation to environmental protection and the provision of a safe working environment for employees. While the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill is founded on international standards, the bill before us seeks to apply Australian criminal law outside our country's borders. It could be argued that, as a result of legislation passed in recent years, there are aspects of Australia's criminal law which now lag well behind international standards. 
Some of the more draconian aspects of the government's antiterrorism measures come to mind in that regard. For example, it is now a criminal offence for innocent Australians who are not suspected of any involvement in terrorism to refuse to answer the questions of ASIO agents regarding the activities of their neighbours, colleagues, pupils or clients. With offences like this on the statute books, it is clear that there are plenty of countries whose laws would provide greater protection for the rights of Australian citizens than our own would. Of course, there are also jurisdictions which do not share Australia's common law tradition and whose laws fall even shorter of international standards than our own do—for example, the recent case involving Amina Lawal. Senators may recall she was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted on a charge of adultery under one of the Nigerian state sharia laws. As one of a number of people in this chamber—Senator Peter Cook is another—who have consistently advocated for Ms Lawal's conviction to be overturned, many of us were very relieved to hear of her recent acquittal.
When there are countries whose laws contravene the most fundamental human rights, there is a need to ensure that Australian citizens are afforded the appropriate protections. But, rather than just protecting the rights of Australians, why doesn't the government take a more proactive role in raising the profile of human rights at an international level? The government seems to forget that the very foundation of human rights is that they apply equally to every human being, regardless of race, colour or creed. Yet, when it comes to applying Australian law outside our borders to protect Australians or to exclude asylum seekers from the rights enjoyed by other Australians within our borders, the government seems to mistake human rights for Australian rights.
I have spoken in this chamber on numerous occasions about the government's declining commitment to human rights—a trend that has been confirmed by a number of independent reports. Whether it is the massive cuts in funding to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission over the three terms of the Howard government or the government's refusal—and other governments', I might add—to enact a bill of rights, the government's record on human rights is embarrassing. However, we are debating legislation that has been rushed in by the government to retrospectively—and that is a key part of this legislation, as my colleague Senator Greig made clear in his remarks—protect the rights of Australian citizens, yet the government refuses to commit to important international agreements that would increase protection for the rights of all human beings.
If the government can be so astute in signing agreements to secure immunity for Australians working overseas, why can't it sign the optional protocol to CEDAW or the optional protocol to the convention against torture? The consistent pattern that we see emerging is that the government is prepared to apply Australian law extraterritorially when it comes to rights but not when it comes to responsibilities. It wants to extend the benefits of Australian law but not necessarily the obligations.
I was interested to note—and I wonder to what extent the government has considered the implications of this—that the Corporations Law applies within the Jervis Bay territory and that it includes criminal offences attaching to the conduct of individuals. In other words, it appears that this bill will facilitate the extraterritorial application of those directors' duties that attract criminal penalties. I trust that the government will clarify this for the benefit of senators during the committee stage but, if this is in fact the case, then the government will be hard-pressed to object to the extraterritorial application of additional corporate standards. 
I take this opportunity to announce that I will shortly introduce an amended version of the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill, which addresses a number of the issues that were brought up in the inquiry. It also takes into account some of the feedback we have had from a number of community, legal, academic and other organisations that have sought to feed into this process of debate. I hope that the government's changing attitude towards extraterritorial legislation is an indication that it will now come on board and support our bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES (OVERSEAS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-10-08,"—by leave—I wish to continue my comments of yesterday in relation to the delay with the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003. I mentioned then that the delay had been caused by the status of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 because, of course, that had to become clear before this bill could continue. The Intelligence Services Act 2001 commenced on 29 October 2001 and, early in 2002, the bill implementing the recommendations of the committee was drafted. Events then proceeded in Iraq early in 2003 and re-examination of the bill was required. In June this year the government agreed that the bill should be extended to cover retrospectively Australian civilians deployed to Iraq and to the Solomon Islands. This required reconsideration of the bill and further extensive consultation with other departments. Events themselves caused this bill to be re-examined out of necessity and it was dependent on the clarification of the Intelligence Services Act 2001. So, although this legislation had its genesis in a report by a joint committee in 1999, events beyond the control of the government required the bill to be re-examined. We have to get it right because it is a very important bill. That is the reason for the effluxion of time in relation to this issue. The government rejects any criticism about the delay. It was a period of time which, regrettably, occurred because of other events and because of the bill being amended to meet those events.
In relation to a comment that this bill was being rushed in its introduction, that is inconsistent with the criticism about the delay. This bill is technical and has involved significant consultation between departments and, as I have indicated, there has been a substantial period of time in which it has had to be re-examined. The government does not believe the bill is being rushed in any manner or form. It is a very important bill, one that I commend to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-08,"—My recollection is that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003 was stood over until today to enable the ALP and Senator Murray to consider the form of an amendment. We now have one, which I have only just been able to have a look at. There are still some problems with the way in which it is framed. It would still have the effect that some 200-odd organisations that are currently specifically named as DGRs will lose that entitlement. 
 (Senator Hutchins)—Minister, you may wish talk about this in the Committee of the Whole rather than at this point.
—If that will be of some assistance, I am happy to do that. My initial impression of this amendment is that it still will not meet the mark and will need some further attention.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-08,"—The Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003 gives additional powers to the Australian Protective Service to deal proactively with suspicious activity in the heightened security environment that we now face. Since the bill was first introduced, the government has circulated amendments that would confer these same powers on Australian Federal Police officers operating alongside the APS officers at places where those APS officers are providing protective security service. It is designed to operate in tandem.
It is worth while talking for a short while about the APS. It provides a high level of security service at Parliament House, the offices and residences of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, sensitive Defence establishments, foreign embassies and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. Importantly, the APS provides counter-terrorism first response at security designated airports around Australia—and I am sure the public have had the opportunity to see those people—which has been upgraded to advanced first response level. APS officers fly covertly on domestic commercial flights, which the public may not have seen.
To place the bill in context, I will first address briefly the existing powers exercised by APS officers. Under the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, the APS currently have the power in respect of specified Commonwealth offences to arrest a person without a warrant and to search the personal property of an arrested person for weapons or evidence. The arrest power may be used where the APS officer has reasonable grounds for believing that specified offences have been or are being committed in relation to persons, places or things where the APS is performing its function. The APS officer must also have reasonable grounds for believing that arrest is necessary to ensure a person's appearance in court, to prevent the offence continuing or another offence being committed, to prevent the destruction or loss of evidence or to preserve the person's safety or welfare and that proceeding by way of summons would not achieve the same end.
The APS may currently search and arrest a person if they have reasonable grounds for believing it is necessary to ascertain whether they have a weapon or other instrument that could inflict bodily injury or facilitate escape or to prevent the concealment or loss of evidence relating to the offence. Such a search must be conducted by an APS officer of the same sex as the arrested person or, if such an officer is not available, by any other person who is of the same sex as the person and is requested to conduct the search. The APS may then seize such weapons or evidence found in the search. In that instance, the APS must forthwith deliver the arrested person and any seized items into the custody of police officers, to be dealt with according to law.
These powers under the APS Act apply to specified Commonwealth offences. Among these are offences under the Crimes Act 1914, including crimes such as sabotage, escaping from custody and trespassing on Commonwealth land; offences under the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, including hijacking and acts of violence committed on board aircraft; and terrorist bombing offences and terrorist act offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995. APS officers also possess certain powers under other legislation, including—and relevantly—a power under section 89 of the Crimes Act 1914 to require a person found on prohibited Commonwealth land to provide their name and address. Prohibited Commonwealth land is land belonging to or occupied by the Commonwealth on which notice is posted that trespassing on the land is prohibited. Failure to comply with such a request has a penalty under that act. This power, under section 89, is also conferred on AFP officers. In addition, AFP officers possess a broader power under section 3V of the Crimes Act to require a person to provide their name and address if, on reasonable grounds, the officer believes that the person may be able to assist with inquiries in relation to an indictable offence that the officer has reason to believe has been or may have been committed. Failure to comply also carries a penalty. 
The APS has embarked on a new role as well. Since September 11, the APS has found itself very much on the frontline of efforts to protect the public from terrorist threats at critical sites, including security designated places such as airports and domestic commercial aircraft. We have full confidence in the capacity of the APS to continue to discharge its counter-terrorism responsibilities with diligence and professionalism; however we recognise that to perform this role effectively it is important that APS officers be empowered to deal proactively with suspicious activity.
Also since September 11 the APS has become an operational division of the Australian Federal Police, with the Commissioner of the AFP replacing the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department as agency head. So we effectively now have the Australian Federal Police acting as the body to which the APS now belongs. Whilst the APS generally provides protective security and custodial services and the AFP primarily has an investigative and policing role, the AFP officers can be involved in providing protective services alongside the APS and will be involved in training APS officers. The government has foreshadowed additional legislation to further integrate the two agencies, which I think is more commonly known as `One act, one agency'. But that is not being dealt with here today; it is a matter that the government has simply foreshadowed will be dealt with in the future. In fact, I think it is on the forward planning and, hopefully, the bill is in an advanced stage of drafting.
This bill, if passed, will give the APS additional powers to require a person to provide information and to stop, search and seize items likely to cause substantial damage, death or serious harm. These are important powers that will assist the APS officers and the AFP officers who operate alongside them at protective security sites such as airports to discharge their responsibilities, in particular their counter-terrorism responsibilities, more effectively. It is worth adding at this juncture that, whilst APS personnel are not police as such, they do in fact provide a high level of counter-terrorism response. These people, whom you might see at airports, are well trained to deal with those issues.
In addition, APS officers will now have the power to require information. If the bill is passed it will, firstly, empower an officer to require a person to provide their name, residential address, reasons for being in a place and evidence of their identity. To exercise this power the officer must suspect on reasonable grounds that the person has just committed, might be committing or might be about to commit one of the Commonwealth offences currently specified under the APS Act. The person must also be in the vicinity of a place where the APS officer is performing functions under the APS Act. The officer must display their identification number if they are in uniform, or their identity card if out of uniform, and inform the person of their authority to make the request and that it may be an offence not to comply with the request. Failing to provide information or providing false information without reasonable excuse is, of course, an offence and does carry a fine. 
The bill will empower an officer to stop and search a person, including their vehicle, who is suspected on reasonable grounds of having a weapon or other thing that is likely to cause substantial damage, death or serious harm in a place where the APS officer is performing functions under the APS Act. So we can see that, although it is a substantive power, it is designed to operate within the context of the power provided to them in the place in which they are operating. As occurs at present with searches of arrested persons, any search must be conducted by a person who is of the same sex as the person being searched. If an Australian Protective Service officer, an Australian Federal Police officer or a Customs officer of the same sex is unavailable, another person of the same sex can be authorised to conduct the search. The person conducting the search must not use more force or subject a person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in order to conduct the search, and must not damage the thing by forcing it open unless they have given the owner an opportunity to open the thing first. The search is limited to an ordinary and frisk search, which is defined consistently within other Commonwealth legislation.
If the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the thing is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage, the officer may seize it and must deliver it as soon as possible into the custody of a police officer. So there are certain checks and balances contained within the bill on the use of the power proposed. The police officer must within seven days serve a seizure notice on the person, identifying the thing and stating the date on which it was seized, the grounds on which it was seized and stating that, if the owner does not request the thing within 90 days, the thing will be forfeited to the Commonwealth. If the person requests the return of the thing, the police officer must return it unless they suspect on reasonable grounds that it is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage.
If after 95 days the thing still has not been returned, the police officer must either return the thing or apply to a magistrate for an order relating to the thing. It is strange to be using the term `thing', but it applies to a variety of matters and it is a short legislative way of saying that it does really depend on the officer identifying the thing to determine whether it will, or is likely to, cause serious harm, substantial damage or death. The magistrate must give the owner of the thing an opportunity to be heard. So there are a significant number of checks within the system to ensure that the person who is the owner of the thing can be heard by the magistrate. If satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the thing is likely to be used to cause death, serious harm or substantial damage, the magistrate may make an order that the thing be retained by the police or a specified person, be forfeited to the Commonwealth, be sold and the proceeds given to the owner or be otherwise sold or disposed of. If the magistrate is not satisfied of those things, the owner gets the thing back. 
By way of comparison, a number of states and territories have recently passed legislation conferring equivalent powers on state police officers to respond rapidly to imminent terrorist attacks, in particular the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002 in New South Wales, the Terrorism (Emergency Powers) Act 2003 in the Northern Territory and the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 in Queensland. I note, however, that the powers conferred on AFP officers by this legislation cannot be used `at large'; rather, they are to be used in places where AFP officers happen to be providing protective security functions alongside APS officers. So there is still that second safeguard, if you will, whereby the powers are confined to an area in which the APS would normally operate.
Both the original amendments to the act and the amendments which included the AFP officers were subject to a Senate committee. As I have said, these are important powers that will help APS officers, and AFP officers operating alongside them, to protect the Australian public, in particular the travelling public, from security and terrorist threats, and they are integrated appropriately with the existing powers of search and arrest. Recent security breaches at Australian airports have highlighted the importance of tightening the security net to prevent more serious breaches in future, with the potential to cause harm or loss of life.
The bill, as I said, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on 26 June 2003 and the committee's report was tabled on 18 August. The committee unanimously recommended that the bill be supported with one minor amendment—that the search power be amended to include vessels as well as vehicles. This followed concerns expressed by the CPSU in relation to Sydney airport, where the security restricted area adjoins waterways. The CPSU reported that there had been occasions where small vessels had moored at the rock walls of the runway, requiring a response by APS officers. I acknowledge that the government has proposed an amendment to implement the committee's recommendation in this regard.
Following notification of the government's amendments relating to AFP officers, the bill was referred back to the committee on 10 September. The committee's second report was tabled on 7 October and recommended that the amendments be supported. A key concern identified during the committee's inquiry was the effect of these amendments on the process of further integrating the APS and the AFP. Mr Evan Hall, who is Secretary of the Border Protection and International Affairs Division of the CPSU, told the committee that APS officers were concerned that the government's amend-ments could pave the way for the abolition of the APS without that intention having been disclosed up front.
However, Mr Geoff McDonald, who is Assistant Secretary of the Criminal Law Branch in the Attorney-General's Department, said this in response:
... I would like to reassure earlier witnesses that this legislation is only what it is expressed to be—that is, about ensuring that there is protective security. There is no agenda to use this as a mechanism to have integration. We have been working on an integration bill and we expect that bill to be ready before long ... I would just like to reassure everyone here that there is no other agenda with these amendments. The amendments are about ensuring that things go operationally smoothly in the protective security environment.
Federal Agent Steve Jackson from the AFP said this to the committee: 
My comment is, unequivocally, the same as Mr McDonald's. The intent of the amendments is not to, in a secretive way, give effect to one act, one agency; it is ... to reinforce the protective security strategies that we need to have to provide the best possible response to safeguard Australia's national interest.
It must be observed that these concerns could have been allayed had the government consulted on these amendments with the organisation representing APS officers. However, the opposition notes these commitments given by the Attorney-General's Department and the AFP and records its expectation that any industrial matters arising from the proposed further integration will be dealt with openly, in good faith and in full consultation with all relevant parties.
The opposition will be moving an amendment to the second reading motion to highlight a number of further matters. Firstly, the amendment calls on the government to establish a complaints mechanism for the Australian Protective Service comparable to that established by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. While this bill does not involve a dramatic extension of APS powers, the more visible role of the APS in public places such as airports means that a strengthened mechanism for dealing with complaints is called for. We understand that this will be addressed as part of the integration legislation. We certainly expect it to be.
Secondly, the amendment calls on the government to ensure APS and AFP officers are provided with appropriate training. This matter was raised before the Senate committee and we do expect the government to ensure that the APS and AFP jointly have sufficient training to ensure that they can work together and work well on the projects that they are required to deal with.
Thirdly, the amendment calls on the government to upgrade security at regional airports, including putting in place adequate passenger screening facilities. The opposition has called on the government to use what is expected to be a sizeable windfall from the Ansett ticket levy for this purpose.
Lastly, the amendment requests that the government ensure that the risk management culture at privatised airports results in security services that are the best and not simply the cheapest. The lack of adequate training for private security services is a matter that has been constantly raised with this government, in particular by the relevant union, the LHMU, the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, among whose members are employees of private security firms.
In conclusion, the opposition support this bill, which will give APS officers, and AFP officers operating alongside them, the powers they need to protect Australians from security and terrorist threats at key locations, in particular airports and commercial aircraft. I foreshadow that the opposition will be moving two amendments at the committee stage. While we support the bill, we see these amendments as providing appropriate reassurance to the public that the legislation is not intended to impact unduly on the activities that form part of the Australian way of life. We understand that the government will, if all goes according to plan, accept one of the amendments, and we acknowledge the constructive discussions we have had with the minister's office, the department and the Australian Federal Police about these matters. We were particularly helped by the Australian Protective Service and its officers at the committee that I participated in. I particularly want to thank the Attorney-General for undertaking to provide a more consultative approach in future in respect of legislation that is developed. I am sure that the department will, through Mr McDonald, undertake to do that. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“But the Senate calls on the Govern-ment to:
	(a)	establish a complaints mechanism for the Australian Protective Service comparable to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981;
	(b)	provide Australian Protective Service officers with appropriate training to exercise the powers under the proposed legislation;
	(c)	upgrade security at regional airports; and
	(d)	ensure that the risk management culture at privatised airports results in security services that are the best and not simply the cheapest”.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-08,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003 on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We Democrats are generally supportive of the measures contained within this bill, although we do have some outstanding concerns which I will address in a moment. We recognise that in the wake of the terrorist attacks of the past few years there is a need for heightened security measures in and around Australian airports and Commonwealth buildings.
The approach the Democrats have consistently taken, when considering the government's antiterrorism proposals, has been to assess whether there is a demonstrated need for new powers and to ensure that any infringement of rights and liberties is minimised and is vital and necessary to protect the safety of Australians. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the government's antiterrorism measures have been excessive and have involved serious infringements of rights and liberties. The government has often failed to demonstrate any deficiency in current arrangements, and therefore the need for new powers has been questionable. For these reasons, we Democrats have found the bulk of the government antiterrorism agenda unacceptable. However, in this case we do think the government has got the balance right.
The bill invests Australian Protective Service officers with three new powers designed to ensure that they are sufficiently equipped to respond to potential security threats. Firstly, APS officers will be given the power to request that a person provide their name, residential address, reason for being at a particular location and evidence of their identity. This power may be exercised only if the APS officer concerned reasonably suspects that the person has just committed, might be committing or might be about to commit an offence under the APS Act. Offences under the act include terrorism offences, offences relating to the possession of nuclear material or interfering with devices used to contain nuclear material, offences relating to Commonwealth property, offences such as sabotage, escaping from custody, hijacking and acts of violence on aircraft, and offences under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 such as participating in `assemblies' involving violence.
For we Democrats, the most important aspect of this new power is that it can be exercised only upon the reasonable suspicion an APS officer has that a person has committed, might be committing or might be about to commit an offence. This means, therefore, that the APS cannot simply go up to anyone at an airport or on Commonwealth property and request their details. Moreover, the requirement that the suspicion be reasonable imports an objective element into the exercise of these powers, and that is an important safeguard.
The second new power to be given to APS officers is the power to stop and detain a person for the purpose of conducting an ordinary or frisk search of the person. This power can be exercised only if an APS officer suspects, on reasonable grounds, that the person has something that is likely to cause, or likely to be used to cause, substantial damage to a place or thing, or death or serious harm to a person. The bill specifies that ordinary and frisk searches must be carried out by a person of the same sex. If the APS officer is not of the same sex as a person, then he or she can ask another APS officer who is of the same sex as the person to conduct that search. If there is no APS officer of the same sex as the person, a police officer or Customs officer of the same sex may conduct the search; otherwise, the APS may ask anyone of the same sex as the person to conduct the search. Any person who conducts a search under these provisions must not use more force, or subject a person to more indignity, than is reasonable and necessary. 
The Democrats have some concerns about the exercise of this power by people other than APS officials, police and Customs officers. While we believe it is fundamentally important that such searches be conducted by persons of the same sex, we believe that the bill requires some additional safeguards to ensure that any person who is asked to conduct a search is fully aware of what is required of them and is expressly informed of their obligation not to use more force than is reasonably necessary. We will be moving amendments to this effect during the committee stage.
The third power which the bill gives to APS officers is the power to seize items found as a result of searching a person if the items are likely to cause, or be used to cause, harm or damage involving the commission of an offence under the APS Act. A seized item must be given to a police officer as soon as practicable. It will become the property of the Commonwealth unless the owner of the item requests its return within 90 days. If such a request is made, the item must be returned to the owner, unless a magistrate has made an order on application by the police officer that the item be retained, forfeited to the Commonwealth, sold or disposed of. A magistrate can make such an order only if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that, if the thing is returned to the owner, it is likely to be used to cause substantial damage to a place or thing in respect of which the APS is performing functions, or death or serious harm to a person in respect of whom the APS is performing functions, in circumstances that would be likely to involve the commission of an offence under the APS Act.
The government has recently introduced amendments to extend each of these three powers to members of the Australian Federal Police where they are performing functions in relation to a place or person with respect to which the APS has functions. The Democrats are generally supportive of the proposed amalgamation of the APS and the AFP but are disappointed that the government has been somewhat tardy in finalising this process. More than a year after the initial legislation was passed, the government still has not introduced the legislation to fully implement the amalgamation.
With the proposed amalgamation in mind, we Democrats do not oppose the amendments to extend the powers in this bill to the AFP. As the supplementary explanatory memorandum notes, the APS is already an operating division of the AFP and there are situations in which APS and AFP officers work alongside each other in responding to security threats. For these reasons, the Democrats agree that it makes sense to extend the powers in this bill to AFP personnel. We note the issues raised during the recent inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee into the amendments. In particular, we have carefully considered the concern raised by the Community and Public Sector Union that enabling the AFP to exercise these powers in circumstances where the APS has functions, rather than where the APS is performing functions, could potentially sideline the APS. However, we were persuaded by the AFP's response to this concern and its explanation as to why concurrent powers would be important where APS personnel might not be immediately present. 
There are two outstanding concerns which the Democrats have in relation to the bill and which we will be seeking to address by way of amendment. Our first concern is that the power to require a person to provide a reason for being in a particular place abrogates their right to silence. The question is whether such an abrogation is vital and necessary to protect the safety of Australians. We Democrats believe this power is probably justified in the circumstances. However, we are concerned by the indication in the explanatory memorandum that this power should be construed as the first step in a graduated response to security threats. The explanatory memorandum also states that the new powers will:
... provide protective service officers with greater flexibility in suspicious circumstances where the exercise of the arrest power is not immediately necessary ...
However, it is clear that an APS or an AFP officer can proceed with arresting a person after exercising these powers. While the Democrats recognise that there is a need to obtain information urgently where there is an immediate security threat, we are concerned by the potential for officers to compulsorily require information from a person who may ultimately be arrested prior to that person's right to silence kicking in. The Democrats believe that information obtained compulsorily under this power should not be able to be used in criminal proceedings against the person, and we will be moving an amendment to that effect. Clearly, the powers in this bill are directed at facilitating a rapid response to security threats. As Senator Ian Campbell said in his second reading speech:
The powers are proactive, rather than reactive or investigative. 
He went on to say: 
The powers are intermediary and are designed to be preventative. They do not confer police investigatory powers on protective service officers.
It appears therefore to be entirely consistent with the intention of the government to place a limitation on how information obtained pursuant to proposed section 18A can be used. This will not in any way affect the ability of APS and AFP officers to provide a rapid response to security threats. Moreover, we would argue that preventing the use of information obtained pursuant to the new powers will not seriously hinder criminal proceedings against a person. The information which can be requested pursuant to proposed section 18A is basic information which could be obtained through other avenues of investigation, including formal questioning of the person following their arrest. If information acquired pursuant to proposed section 18A cannot be used in criminal proceedings against the person, then there is effectively no abrogation of the right to silence, since the right is one which applies specifically in a criminal context and is tied to the privilege against self-incrimination and the presumption of innocence. So it is accurate to say that the Democrat amendment will not in any way hinder the ability of the APS and the AFP to respond rapidly to imminent security threats, nor is it likely to hinder the prosecution of offences under the APS Act, but it will ensure that the right to silence is not abrogated by proposed section 18A of the bill.
The second concern that the Democrats have relates to the potential for three new powers to be used in the context of public order offences. The bill has been characterised by the government as essentially an antiterrorism measure. The explanatory memorandum makes reference to the current security environment. In his second reading speech, Senator Ian Campbell described the bill as `a significant step in the government's commitment to the protection of all Australians and the fight against terrorism'. Yet the APS and the AFP will be able to exercise their powers in circumstances where there is no serious threat to security. 
In particular, we Democrats are concerned by the potential use of this power for offences under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971. Offences under that act include participating in assemblies involving an apprehension of violence, unlawful property damage, causing unreasonable obstruction while participating in an assembly or behaving in an offensive or disorderly manner on Commonwealth premises.
The issue for us here is that an APS or an AFP officer can require information from a person if he or she suspects the person has committed, might be committing or might be about to commit one of these offences. It is not the case that the APS or the AFP need to suspect that a person might commit an act of terrorism while participating in a political protest. It would be sufficient for them to suspect that a person might be about to participate in an assembly which will involve violence, whether or not the person is directly responsible for that violence. It would also be sufficient for them to suspect that a person might be about to behave in a disorderly manner on Commonwealth premises.
We Democrats believe that the current security environment does not warrant the extension of new powers to public order offences such as these. For this reason, we will be moving an amendment to exclude offences under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act from the scope of this bill. As I have said, with the exception of those general concerns, the Democrats are supportive of the principles and the measures contained within this bill. They represent one of the more sensible attempts by the government to respond appropriately to the current security environment.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-10-08,"—I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on this important bill, the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003. The amendments continue the government's efforts towards protecting all Australians from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligation under international law to protect foreign diplomatic and consular officials and their premises. That is extremely important.
The additional powers contained in this bill will ensure the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police can provide effective security measures at airports, diplomatic and consular missions, defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. Australian Protective Service and Australian Federal Police officers will now have the power to act quickly in circumstances that give rise to security concerns in the course of providing protective security services at those locations where the exercise of the arrest power is not immediately necessary. These additional powers are preventative and proactive. They take personal privacy considerations into account and achieve a balance between what we believe law enforcement should have and protecting the rights and freedoms of Australian citizens.
I believe the new legislation provides for effective security without being overly intrusive or disruptive of people trying to do business in protected areas. The challenge has been to confront terrorism with a reasonable and effective response. As I mentioned, we have achieved a balance between the rights and freedoms of Australians going about their business—and, of course, visitors to this country because we are talking about international and domestic airports. We also have to remember to do this in an efficient and effective manner, without being disruptive to the free-flowing movement of people which is required at our busy airports. The same applies to guarding our installations and particularly diplomatic posts and diplomatic and consular officials.  
There is always a challenge for government to achieve effective security, to ensure that people are safe and secure without being overly intrusive. We believe that the proposed amendments do just that. As I said, this legislation deals with situations where the arrest power is not immediately necessary. You need the power to inquire. You need the power to search. The Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police need the power to ask questions, to detain a person if they are acting in a suspicious manner. Initially the amendments related to the Australian Protective Service and it had been proposed that we would deal with amendments for the Australian Federal Police in other legislation, but later it was thought best to bring it together in this one bill. Now that the Australian Protective Service is an operating division of the Australian Federal Police, it is necessary that both have the same powers. This is a very important bill. It provides increased safeguards for those areas I mentioned, particularly for people travelling through our domestic and international airports. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-10-08,"—I stand to speak about the importance of the Meander dam and the most recent revelation regarding the actions of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and the green lobby in Tasmania to appeal the recent decision by the Howard government to give that dam project the go-ahead. The Howard government's go-ahead for the Meander dam is subject to strict environmental conditions. The decision genuinely boosts protection of the Meander Valley environment while giving a large boost to our rural economy. The federal conditions are so strict that, when they were announced, the conservation movement was moved to question whether the state government could meet the strict criteria. I can think of no better endorsement of the conditions stipulated by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp, and his department, Environment Australia. On behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, I would like to congratulate Environment and Heritage Minister Dr David Kemp and his department, Environment Australia, for a sound, historic and unimpeachable decision that protects the environment as well as providing a boost for our rural economy. This has been through a thorough approval process involving the most stringent assessment by the government's Environment Australia. The strength of the conditions placed on this approval for the dam is testimony to that.
The Tasmanian Conservation Trust, in that regard, have won an important victory by ensuring that the two governments, the federal government and the state government in Tasmania, have in place a regime that makes sure the dam does not unduly harm the environment. But today I am making public some information I have received that confirms that the Tasmanian Conservation Trust is now fundraising to help pay for an appeal against the decision by Environment and Heritage Minister Dr David Kemp. In my view, this action is futile and a misuse of public donations. The Tasmanian Conservation Trust, in their efforts to raise these funds for the appeal, say that these donations will be tax deductible. On behalf of the many Tasmanians that I represent, and on behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, I will be objecting to the wrongful use of these donations for such a purpose.
The Tasmanian Conservation Trust have a right to pursue such action, but I believe it is politically immoral. They are considering a Federal Court appeal based on the process and based on their reading of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and their reading of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. They have every right to request—and it is my understanding that they have requested—the statement of reasons for the decision, as have I. They are an interested third party and they are entitled to that statement of reasons. That will be made available on 18 October. As an interested party and as a senator for Tasmania I have also requested that statement of reasons and will be considering it carefully. I have no doubt that it will be consistent with the decision made by Dr David Kemp and with the outline of his reasons that he expressed in my office when he made the decision some weeks ago, setting out the environmental conditions and the strictness of those conditions before the Tasmanian and the Australian public. 
The Tasmanian Conservation Trust will then have approximately 28 days under the act to appeal and, as I say, they are now raising funds to pursue that appeal. I have requested publicly and privately that they desist from such an appeal. There are a number of reasons why I caution the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and request that they publicly state they will not proceed. The reasons are: the decision is a great outcome because the dam has received the go-ahead but in a way that preserves our environment, especially the spotted-tailed quoll and the Epacris, which is a heath plant, which may have been threatened. However, I want to caution the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, and for that matter the Australian Democrats, if they plan to launch an appeal against the Meander dam decision or to oppose other similar water projects. I do so because I believe there is a fine line between the legitimate scrutiny of land use decisions and playing destructive politics for purely political objectives.
It disturbs me to discover that the trust is starting to raise funds for an appeal against the Meander dam decision. I understand that effort is now well under way. I reiterate that I will be opposing most strongly their efforts to use that money and to make it tax deductible for those people who wish to provide donations. The Australian government's approval process was a tortuous and thorough challenge for the Tasmanian government, and it involved a stringent assessment. The spotted-tailed quoll and the Epacris will now receive even stronger and better protection as a result. I am confident there is no basis for any appeal, and I am happy to provide a copy of Dr Kemp's decision to anyone who would like it. It is also available on my web site at www.guybarnett.com. As I said, I understand the statement of reasons for the decision will be available from 18 October, and that will indeed be made public.
I call on the Tasmanian Conservation Trust to now consider their position very carefully, given the damage to the Tasmanian economy that land use debates have caused in the past. From 1973 Tasmanians have been politically divided over resource and land use issues, starting with the flooding of Lake Pedder, then the Franklin River, then Tasmanian forestry operations—shamelessly straight after the Franklin dam saga—and even value-added projects such as the giant Wesley Vale pulp mill project in 1988-89.
The Tasmanian forest debate has involved a High Court battle between the federal and Tasmanian governments in 1983 and indeed in 1987, numerous inquiries, and in 1997 the regional forest agreement resulting from the work of both federal and state Liberal governments at the time, and federal and state Labor at the time and since in terms of support for that agreement. I acknowledge that and thank those who have supported those agreements.
Despite the much-heralded RFA process, the forests in Tasmania continue to be misused as the environmental battleground for votes and political supremacy in both the Tasmanian and Australian parliaments. I am not saying that all environmental scrutiny is bad. In fact, some of it has been good for the environment. However, since the early 1980s Tasmania has been used by both Labor governments and minor parties at a federal level as a battleground for the hearts and minds of voters in the bigger states who are not directly affected in any adverse way because the battles are not in their backyards. This has been disastrous for Tasmania. Just ask Tasmanian Premier, Jim Bacon. I have heard him lamenting the damage done to Tasmania's investment reputation and credibility because of environmental-cum-political campaigns.  
You now have 40 per cent of Tasmania locked up in reserves, national parks or World Heritage areas, but still the environment remains one of the key battlegrounds between political parties and interest groups in Tasmania. We have a chance to change the politics of the environment with the Meander dam decision, because, thanks to Environment and Heritage Minister Dr David Kemp and his department, Environment Australia, we have a sound and unimpeachable decision which is good not only for the farmers and the rural community but also for the environment in the Meander Valley. Unlike previous years, when investors took one look at environmental politics in Tasmania and took their business elsewhere, the Meander dam project stands out as a beacon for the resolution of environmental conflict. Dr Kemp's approval will add $53 million per year to the Tasmanian economy and 150 more full-time jobs, with an extra $5.5 million in wages each year, primarily in the Meander Valley region.
The Australian government decision will: ensure protection for endangered or threatened species in the area; provide a reliable water supply for industrial and domestic irrigation; improve the health of the river, especially its lower reaches; reduce the risk and damage of flooding and drought; and provide a new source of clean and renewable hydroelectricity—in fact, enough electricity to power a town the size of Deloraine, which is in the heart of the Meander Valley. It will also boost farm exports and accelerate value adding. It is these things that we have been pushing for for many years. Finally, it will provide scope for new and improved recreational activities. As a keen trout fisherman, I am looking forward to the opportunity.
The state government's second and last submission to Dr Kemp was far superior to its submission to the tribunal last year. These efforts can be acknowledged, and so can the scrutiny by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. I make no apologies for having joined the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team to lobby hard for the dam, because my family farmed on the banks of the Meander River for 40 years, and therefore I know of the floods in the winter and the lack of water in the summer. I support carefully planned development, when it has been subjected to stringent economic and environmental scrutiny. I believe the Australian and Tasmanian governments have done everything humanly possible to secure a project that is both economically viable and compatible with the environment. As I said earlier, environmental conditions imposed by Dr Kemp will in fact strengthen the protection for the Epacris and the spotted-tailed quoll.
I am sure that a legal campaign by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, the Democrats or anyone else in the green lobby would fail, but their actions would, in my view, be economically disastrous for our state. It would be purely a case of playing environmental politics for the sake of votes and blocking a project, with no regard for Tasmanians, the environment in the Meander Valley and the benefit to the Meander River itself. The conservation movement will not endure and broaden its support base in Tasmania while it misuses legitimate land use issues for pure political gain. Scrutiny of the Meander dam by governments, by the legal sector and by the community has been beyond reproach.

Given the nature of Senator Vanstone's response, I suspect it would be more appropriate, if Senator Allison did wish to speak, for her to seek leave to do so for a brief amount of time. But it is not competent for Senator Allison, at the time when we are to take note of answers to questions without notice, to just get up and speak. I do not think you should have recognised her.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-08,"—I apologise for not moving that way in the first place. I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation. 
I make the point again that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs did make a commitment yesterday to provide this answer, and I remind her again that 21 July was a very long time ago. I know there were a number of questions within that question but many weeks have passed since the question was asked. They are critical questions; they go to the Prime Minister's promise that alternative accommodation would be found particularly for families who are currently held in detention. They are straightforward questions that the government ought to be able to answer easily. I refrained from making a speech yesterday because the minister did commit to getting the answer to my office by late yesterday. I did make some attempt to find out from the minister when it did not appear yesterday; we called today and were just stonewalled.
I give the minister notice that there will indeed be a debate tomorrow if the minister does not meet the commitment that she has just made. I do not want to hold up the chamber and the work that needs to be done today, but the fact of the matter is that this government is just ignoring questions that are put on notice. Minister Hill has not answered a question of mine that is now 161 days old. This is not good enough. The government is simply treating the Senate with disdain, effectively saying, `We'll answer questions when we jolly well feel like it!' I would again say to Minister Vanstone that I will accept her explanation and expect to see the answer provided. Otherwise, I will be forced to waste time in this place by debating why the answer has not been given and speaking on this issue when it is not necessary to do so.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-08,"—Today is day 65 of the Cormo Express fiasco. Each day the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, permits this fiasco to drag on, the more damage he does to Australia's export reputation and to our international animal welfare standing. If the minister had had any credibility when it began, the fiasco would have been swept away long ago. The MV Cormo Express fiasco is the latest in a long series of disasters to hit the live export industry while Mr Truss has been the minister. A live export disaster invariably means an animal welfare disaster. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian people have had enough. It is time the live export industry was cleaned up. Those responsible for unacceptable animal mortality—the rogues of the live trade—need to be driven from the industry.
Consistent with the current co-regulatory regime, Labor believes the minister responsible for the industry, Mr Truss, should also be held accountable for his record—not just of animal welfare disasters but of a failure to institute reforms to prevent their reoccurrence. Labor recognises the contribution of the live export sector to the economic viability of Australia's sheep and cattle industries. The export income it generates and the 9,000 rural jobs it sustains cannot be dismissed out of hand or simply washed away—or wished away, for that matter. The government's administration of the industry cannot continue in its current form. The Howard government put the current unsatisfactory model in place and has failed to act when the manifest inadequacy of its model has been exposed again and again. 
In July this year Labor released a live export plan to deliver improved animal welfare standards, a more accountable industry and a more accountable minister. I again recommend it to the minister, not in an act of political one-upmanship but in the interests of the live export industry, Australia's livestock producers and animal welfare.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would appear that misbehaviour is not an issue in the MV Cormo Express fiasco. The livestock carrier left Fremantle on 5 August this year laden with more than 57,000 Western Australian sheep. Upon arrival at the Saudi port of Jeddah on 21 August, raw mortality was 544. This was less than one per cent of the shipment and well below the two per cent mortality benchmark for live sheep exports. The sheep did not get off the vessel, because a Saudi Ministry of Agriculture official claimed that six per cent of the sheep were afflicted with scabby mouth. I understand that one official claimed that 30 per cent of the sheep were displaying symptoms of this disease, but this assessment was reduced to six per cent—just one per cent over the acceptable level mandated by the administrative order governing our live trade with the Saudis. The assessment was immediately rejected by the AQIS accredited veterinarian accompanying the ship. 
Following the Saudi assessment, the ship was directed to the Jordanian port of al Aqaba, where it arrived on 23 August. It was not allowed to berth, let alone unload its cargo. At that time there was a delegation of Australian officials in Riyadh for the discussions with Saudi officials about animal import protocols, amongst other issues. A senior officer from Mr Truss's department, Mr Greg Read, led the delegation. I understand that Mr Truss instructed Mr Read and his team to seek a further veterinarian inspection by the Saudis to facilitate the off-loading of the sheep at Jeddah. I understand that the negotiations were positive, and the vessel arrived back in Jeddah on 26 August in anticipation of this further inspection. The Australian delegation then waited for advice on the reinspection of the ship.
Late on 27 August, Saudi officials contacted the Australian ambassador to advise that the offer to reinspect the sheep had been withdrawn. However, the Saudis advised that the sheep could be reinspected if the vessel sailed for seven to eight days on the Red Sea and returned to Jeddah. Mr Truss said that seven days was unacceptable on animal welfare grounds but would accept two days sailing. I am advised that the Saudis insisted on seven days, and negotiations foundered at that point. The fact that the sheep have now spent more than 40 additional days at sea suggests that Mr Truss must now be ruing his rejection of the original Saudi offer.
The breakdown of these negotiations resulted in the Australian suspension of live exports to Saudi Arabia. On behalf of the federal opposition I supported the minister's decision to suspend that trade. I did so because it made sense to prevent the departure of additional shipments before the impasse over the MV Cormo Express was sorted out. I also assumed that Mr Truss had a plan to deal with the 57,000 sheep sitting in the port of Jeddah. Clearly, my confidence in the minister was wildly misplaced.
On 28 August the MV Cormo Express set sail for the United Arab Emirates port of Umm al Qaywayn, where it was, mercifully, permitted to berth. On 5 September Dr Nigel Brown from Meat and Livestock Australia organised an independent examination of the sheep by Dr Ghazi Yehia, regional manager for the international animal disease organisation OIE. I am advised that Dr Yehia gave the sheep a clean bill of health. UAE officials then boarded the ship and tested the sheep. I understand that they told Australian officials that the sheep could be off-loaded in the UAE, but before paperwork could be completed the advice changed and the sheep were formally rejected. The ship was then forced out of port.
One of the problems Mr Truss has sought to conceal throughout this saga is the pressing matter of fodder supply. After sailing aimlessly for a few days, the MV Cormo Express was back off the UAE coast by 11 September. It needed additional fodder and the situation was becoming urgent. I am advised that the UAE initially refused permission for the vessel to berth, permitting it only to enter the port of Al Fujairah. It took a firm commitment not to return to the UAE before the local authorities finally agreed to let the MV Cormo Express berth. The vessel was permitted to load a small supply of fodder before it was required to leave the port. 
On 18 September fodder was running low again, and again access was sought to the UAE. This time permission to berth was denied, and the MV Cormo Express was forced to drift eight miles off the coast of Al Fujairah and load bag fodder from barges. On 13 September Mr Truss said that negotiations for the sale of the sheep were at a delicate stage and were being handled by a Saudi importer. The following day, Mr Truss's spokesman announced that the owner of the sheep had decided to give them away. He said, `There has been an offer made by the owner of the sheep for them to be given away.'
If the owner was locked in delicate negotiations to sell the sheep on 13 September, you might wonder why the minister would suggest 24 hours later that they were being given away. It is clear that the minister's announcement that the sheep were distressed goods—so distressed that they were free—destroyed any commercial options available to the owner of the sheep. The minister's announcement also heightened fears in the region that the sheep were, in fact, diseased. In the face of Mr Truss's bumbling and his insistence that the sheep were not his responsibility, it is obvious that the Saudi importer and the crew aboard the ship were doing everything possible to keep the sheep alive. In addition to the burden of caring for more than 50,000 sheep, the owner would have faced a bill exceeding $60,000 a day.
It is noteworthy that just a few days after Mr Truss's original offer of free sheep his office told a potential receiver of the distressed cargo that the offer was off the table. By 19 September key rural industries had lost patience with Mr Truss and his inept handling of the growing crisis. Senior producer representatives met with the Prime Minister's office in an attempt to get the matter taken out of Mr Truss's hands. On the same day the Cattle Council of Australia wrote to the Prime Minister expressing deep concern about the administration of the live export industry and urging him to reregulate it until industry standards are improved.
On 24 September agreement was reached to transfer ownership of the sheep to the Australian live export industry at a cost of $4.5 million. On that day Mr Truss did a doorstop in Canberra. He continued to run the line that the importer owned the sheep when agreement had already been reached to transfer control of the sheep to the Australian industry. He said:
The sheep are actually owned by a Saudi importing company.
The following day, 25 September, Mr Truss issued a media release repeating the claim that the sheep were the property of the Saudi importer. These claims were at best seriously misleading. The minister in fact conceded this point at his media briefing last Tuesday when he told journalists that the sheep had changed hands on 24 September. The transfer agreement on 24 September was predicated on the expectation that the sheep would be quickly off-loaded in Iraq as food aid.
I understand that on 26 September Meat and Livestock Australia finalised arrangements to off-load the sheep at the port of Basra. The unloading was to commence at midday Australian time on 27 September and the ship was relocated to an area just off the Kuwaiti coast. Despite this, Mr Truss issued a misleading statement on 26 September denying any plan to unload the sheep in Iraq. I understand problems with the plan did not in fact emerge until around mid-evening on 26 September. I am given to understand that British military concern about the logistics of off-loading the sheep and distributing them as food aid overwhelmed prior arrangements. 
At his media briefing on 30 September Mr Truss told journalists he was considering bringing the sheep back to Australia. He said he already had an import risk assessment to deal with any risks `that might be associated from a quarantine perspective'. I asked Mr Truss to reveal any consideration of this matter on 24 September and reaffirmed my demand following his statement on 30 September. I wrote to him on 1 October seeking the full disclosure of the relevant import risk assessment. I was not the only one concerned about the minister's plan, I must say. On 3 October Dr Bill Gee, the former chief veterinarian, wrote an open letter expressing alarm at the prospect of the sheep being returned to Australia. He said the return of the sheep would pose an unacceptable quarantine threat to Australia and called on the government to rule out this option. 
It is now clear that the prospect of the sheep being off-loaded for slaughter in the Middle East is becoming a forlorn hope. While renewed consideration is being given to transporting the sheep to Afghanistan via land transport through Iran, this option remains deeply problematic not least from an animal welfare perspective. The MV Cormo Express berthed at a Kuwaiti port for resupply last week. That resupply is almost complete and a final decision on the fate of the sheep now looms. It appears that just two options remain: slaughter at sea, or return to Australia. Both, I might say, are most unattractive but remain on the table because Mr Truss has systematically destroyed all reasonable alternatives.
One of the government's key failures in this matter was its failure to recognise the serious consequences for animal welfare arising from the adverse Saudi veterinary assessment on 21 August. The minister should have been aware that the Gulf States have a formal agreement that prevents a shipment rejected by one state on quarantine grounds from off-loading in another. The minister should have known from the outset that high-level diplomacy was the key to resolving the crisis. In the event that Mr Truss did not understand these facts, more senior ministers should have stepped in and taken the matter out of his hands. He should not have been permitted to bumble along while Australia's export reputation and animal welfare standing suffered so grievously. 
Rather than resolve the crisis, Mr Truss adopted a strategy of denial and obfuscation. From the outset he has provided no information or incomplete information or deliberately misleading information. More mortality details have been provided to the Australian public by the ship's owner, Vroon BV, than by the Australian government. Mr Truss himself has provided more information to foreign governments than to the Australian parliament. Until 30 September Mr Truss refused to disclose almost any detail about the MV Cormo Express due to commercial and diplomatic sensitivities. But on that day he held a media briefing and provided considerable detail about negotiations, including those then under way. That briefing exposed Mr Truss's earlier refusal to provide details as no more than a sham.
The fact is that if Mr Truss had kept the media and the public properly informed about this matter, damaging national and international coverage could have been considerably reduced. That coverage is damaging our animal welfare reputation and causing collateral damage to our carcass trade in key markets. The chair of the Western Australian Meat Marketing Cooperative, Mr Dawson Bradford, has told the ABC that his company is getting negative feedback from the United Kingdom about our animal welfare reputation and that this may have a negative impact on demand for Australian lamb in the UK market. I fear other key markets for Australian meat are also being damaged by this long-running fiasco, with serious long-term trade and regional employment implications. The announcement that repatriation of the sheep is a live option has consolidated exporters' fears. The failure to release an import risk assessment has escalated the fears of livestock producers and other primary producers who trade on Australia's excellent quarantine status. 
In addition to demanding the release of the completed quarantine analysis, Labor has laid out a five-part plan for the immediate future of the industry. The first step must be the removal of Mr Truss from portfolio responsibility for the industry. Secondly, the government must commission a high-level independent review of the operation of the live industry co-regulatory regime including accreditation, auditing, mortality reporting and the operation of the third party veterinarian scheme. Thirdly, the government must order AQIS to assume direct control of live export industry standards, including accreditation and auditing pending the outcome of the independent industry review. Fourthly, the government should establish protocols to govern the resolution of commercial, quarantine and diplomatic disputes affecting the welfare of live exports. Fifthly, the government should immediately develop and, as soon as possible, implement an industry plan to promote an enhanced carcass trade in existing live export markets.
It is clear that the fate of the sheep aboard the MV Cormo Express will be determined in the coming hours. Whatever the eventual outcome, Australia's export reputation and animal welfare standing will remain damaged by this shocking affair. The government is seriously damaged as well. Last week, Alan Jones told his radio listeners:
... you can talk about budget surplus and interest rates and the state of the economy and all the rest of it, but the public will gather their perception of a government and what kind of government it is by the way in which simple issues like this are handled.
The way Mr Truss has handled this fiasco says a lot about his competence, or lack thereof. If he survives this fiasco as the minister with responsibility for live exports, the damage to Australia's international reputation will be permanent, I fear.
With regard to the opposition's position, I did hear one government senator suggest that the opposition wanted these animals killed. I remind that senator and others in the government that the fact is that the animals were being sent to the Middle East to be slaughtered for consumption. If they are returned to Australia they will be slaughtered for some purpose, and if there is another course of action in the middle, the animals will indeed be slaughtered. The opposition did not set out with the purpose of having these animals slaughtered; that was the purpose of their export and that is the consequence of the calamity they are now in, in any case.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Matters of Public Importance,23,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2003-10-08,"—The only slaughter that will occur today is through the disgrace of the Labor Party making this a political issue when it is a national interest issue. You come in here and say, `We'd have swept this away.' That was what you said in your opening statement, Senator O'Brien, then you spent 20 minutes outlining a diary of recent events, with no solutions. Well done, Jack! It is just the detail with no solutions. So what is this about? This is a national interest issue because it is an attempt, for reasons unknown—and you certainly did not provide any—to play Australia on a break. Some sort of secret Saudi men's business is what I suggest to you we are on about here. The initial allegation was that 30 per cent of the sheep had scabby mouth—sure, someone did put that up but they quickly reduced that to six per cent, conveniently, as you say, over the five per cent mark, even though every other vet on the planet who has had a look says the figure is less than 0.3 percent. 
The thing that you did not mention, Senator O'Brien, is that, conveniently—also just above the five per cent figure—there were no trucks booked. There was no attempt to get rid of the sheep from the port, so there was no intention to unload them, it seems. There may be an explanation which someone else can provide but certainly this was not about mismanagement by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry or by Australia; this was about some secret men's deal over there by persons unknown, probably a bunch of carpetbaggers on the other side. As you would know, Senator O'Brien, the vaccine for scabby mouth is an easy one to proceed with. I have personally vaccinated thousands of sheep—it takes just a simple scratch under the leg and you have got it. So scabby mouth is not the issue; let us put that away. 
But what is the issue? The issue is that, for reasons unknown to any person who has stood in any public position, the gulf customs alliance—that is, the Gulf Cooperation Council which includes, for people who do not know, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar—decided that because one has gone they are all gone. No-one is interested in them. As a consequence of a flow-on, paddling under the water by people unknown to Australia, there have been 38 rejections of these sheep, and the folklore has built that there is something wrong with the sheep. As senators know, in recent days an independent vet has looked at these sheep and has said that they are okay.
Where does that leave us? Dear old Wally Curran's mob are still at it. Dear old Wally Curran and the AMIEU want to get rid of this trade. I hope, Senator O'Brien, that the Labor Party resists this temptation, because you have spoken eloquently about what a great and important trade it is for Australia. In your own document, Labor's reform agenda for the live export industry, you say:
Labor recognises the potential benefits of converting a portion—
a portion unknown—
of the live export trade to chilled and frozen carcass exports.
I know a lot of people who would agree with that but, Senator O'Brien, you forget that, back on the farm, farmers need as much competition in the marketplace as they can get. If you take the live export trade out of it, there will be fewer jobs left on the farm. You go on to say:
The Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (AMIEU) has been at the forefront of the campaign to curb live exports based on the impact of the trade on the domestic meat-processing sector. The union represents many thousands of workers in this sector and has long made the case that the closure of smallstock killing centres [should be prevented with the] overall decline in processing jobs ...
This would be to the detriment of the people who produce the stock. So Wally Curran is still at it. It defies the fact that the customer is right. I am sorry, but your mob over on that side come out of the trade union movement; obviously, I come off a farm and I put that on the record. I am authentic in this area.
The customer is always right and, as you may care to hear and learn, the demand of the market over there is for stock on the hoof. That is what they want and that is what we are trying to provide. We have a lot of farmers in Australia who are prepared to go to the trouble to provide the market, despite what Wally Curran wants, with thousands and thousands of ram lambs, or whole sheep as they call them, in the paddock—and they are a bloody nuisance to manage, I can tell you. If this trade falls over I do not know what we are going to do with 200,000 or 300,000 ram lambs because, as you would be aware, Australians do not have an acquired taste for ram lamb except, of course, if it is a saltbush ram lamb and then it is a beautiful sheep. The value to Australia in 2002 of this export, and I would remind Wally Curran of this— 
—He's not here.
—I know; Wally Curran's ghost, then—was $409 million. Are you listening, Wally? You never know! Saudi took 1.8 million sheep last year and to Australia's farmers this was worth $127 million or 31 per cent of the total exports of $409 million. So it is valuable. Also, we have to protect the flow-on effects to the northern cattle live export market. Twenty years ago, when you were just a boy, Senator O'Brien, the foundation of the creation of an agricultural frontier that was very successful in northern Australia was built around live exports for cattle. Twenty years ago, if you went to the Territory, you could buy a place for the value of about $120 per head of stock on it and you got the land for nothing. But, because we have developed a very successful live export trade for cattle, the land up there has set the foundation stone, as the Senate would know, for a new agricultural frontier. I hope it will eventually allow us to escape from the 75 per cent of Australia's water farming that occurs in the Murray-Darling Basin, where the sums will never add up, with 6.2 per cent of the run-off. I hope that we create a new agricultural frontier in northern Australia where 45 per cent of Australia's run-off happens to occur.
To say that we have mismanaged live exports is an absolute joke because, in the meantime, while this particular one-off, secret Saudi men's business has been going on, we have successfully exported several shipments which have landed in Saudi. In fact, the Al Shuwaikh unloaded 24,000 sheep on 23 August. There have been three shipments of over 150,000; there has been a shipment of 8,100 cattle to Aqaba; 2,000 cattle and 67,000 sheep on one boat have gone over there with no incident. So there has been plenty of successful exporting in the meantime. There is no impact, except the embarrassment of this particular incident for which there is no explanation, and certainly no explanation from the Labor Party today.
The current situation is that the vessel is reprovisioning, as you have said, in Kuwait and a small fire and some mechanical breakdowns in the loading episode have meant that the reprovisioning is going to take a bit longer than expected. Given no further delays, perhaps tomorrow the ship may be ready to leave. Arrangements are being made for an AQIS veterinarian and two experienced stockmen—I might volunteer for the job—to board the vessel. While in port an independent veterinary inspection was conducted by an OIE officer and he reported that the sheep are fit and healthy. Despite all the drama and the colour and movement out there, the sheep are in fine order, free from disease and suitable for admission to any country in the region for slaughter and human consumption.
The OIE is the equivalent of the animals' version of the World Health Organisation and, despite that certification, there has been an attempt to discredit this report by the people who are involved in this secret men's business. In the last couple of days, there has been some attempt to discredit that report. Other ships that have been sent to the region since this has occurred continue to be unloaded without incident. I am pleased to report that there is no evidence to suggest that the circumstances surrounding this ship have in any way affected other elements of the trade or the attitude of other countries in that region towards accepting Australian sheep. Two large shipments, as I said, have unloaded in Kuwait without incident. 
We should never lose sight of the fact that what we have to do today is to make sure that we make a statement to Australia that we are here to protect the long-term interests of Australia's cattle and sheep graziers, to protect the interests and welfare of the sheep and to get the trade right. We have to overcome whatever this unknown secret men's business deal over there is and in no way will we overcome that by standing in this place and alleging that somehow the government has mismanaged this proposition, because we have not. Today, the opposition have provided no answers as to what they would have done. We are confident that within the next few days we will have a solution.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2003-10-08,"—Senator Heffernan has summed it up very well. This issue really is about protecting the long-term interests of Australian primary producers and particularly those involved in the livestock industry. In a parallel sense to that, it is also about protecting the interests of Australia's reputation as having one of the finest processes of managing animal welfare at sea and on our farms within Australia. The rejection of 57,000 sheep when they landed at Jeddah has been, as indicated earlier, a great disappointment. It has been a disappointment in a number of ways. It has been a disappointment because it has not actually been recognised as being completely anomalous to the successful export of literally millions of sheep in dozens and dozens of very successful exports by ship to these areas.
I am somewhat miffed that this matter of public importance alleges that somehow through mismanagement the government has brought into disrepute not only our industry but, apparently, our animal welfare issues. I will take the opportunity to run through what I consider to be one of the most comprehensive management regimes in terms of livestock trade. Livestock trade has changed in a global sense. Everybody recognises that something that was out of sight and out of mind had to change. The media played a very important role some five years ago in exposing not only to the Australian public but in a global sense that we needed to change the way things were done in order to ensure that this trade was sustainable.
So what happened to the ship before it left? The sheep were loaded, they were tested before departure and they met the full ambit of export certification that was needed.
—By AQIS, no less.
—Indeed, by AQIS, and in fact they actually passed the livestock export assurance program that was written and had input from people like RSPCA and other animal welfare groups. We know that with the LEAP process we will be protected.
We make sure that livestock are absolutely fit for a voyage. We made sure that these animals were going to have the very lowest mortality rates, as was evidenced by a mortality rate of under one per cent—less than 50 per cent of the trigger that is normally used, which is two per cent, for an investigation into mortality. We made sure that the livestock were prepared in accordance with overseas requirements, so we knew that we needed to ensure that scabby mouth was in fact in a proportion that was less than five per cent—0.03 per cent, which is well and truly within the limits. We met that requirement. 
We made sure that the travel arrangements were adequate. So it was not only that the right ventilation was met but that the feed was the right sort and the right amount for the journey, and there was a certain amount of potable water, plus a contingency. And just as well we had that contingency or we would have been in a much worse situation than we are in now. They were all met. I can say that, in terms of the travel arrangements, often people would perhaps be smirking and saying: `What's Scullion doing standing up in this place? He doesn't have any sheep in the Northern Territory.' That is quite right. During the loading of other livestock—and this is an issue about livestock, not about sheep—particularly camels, some 18 months ago in the Northern Territory, we had to unload the camels because the head space for the camels was insufficient. It did not meet the primary requirement that travel arrangements need to be adequate for that particular piece of transportation and for that particular voyage.
When they arrived in Jeddah, the sheep were rejected for reasons that are still unknown to all of us. We can only surmise, though I do not think it is particularly useful. But we know for sure that the reasons they were rejected are in fact not the right reasons. Our senior veterinary officer, Dr Gardner Murray, boarded the vessel and made an inspection himself, and, as we have heard, Dr Ghazi Yehia from the World Animal Health Organisation also inspected the sheep. He not only found that they were healthy but also that there was absolutely no evidence of any infectious or contagious disease to suggest that the consignment would be unsuitable for admission to any country, including Saudi Arabia. There was no evidence to suggest that there had been a significant outbreak of scabby mouth aboard the vessel at any time during the voyage. There was absolutely clear evidence that it was in fact a successful voyage that was managed extremely well under a very rigorous framework that does not deserve any criticism from anyone in this place or from any Australian.
It is really important to recognise that the trade for Australia just into Saudi Arabia is worth $195 million. It is well over 1.5 million sheep. It has a lot of prospects in terms of live export from other commodity items. It also has a lot of prospects because in this industry it is not about how many sheep over the gunwale or how many actual dollars. It is about the 9,000 jobs in Australia that this industry sustains. But, despite that, we made the tough management decision. You cannot manage sheep that do not belong to you on a boat that you do not own on the other side of the world. What did the Australian government do? Despite the rhetoric from the other side of this place, they made a tough decision: `We will buy those sheep; we will regain control, because then we can manage the perception that animal welfare issues are not correct and that the way we go about managing this business is not right and efficacious.' It was a tough decision and, again, a good management decision that runs at cross-purposes with the concept that somehow the Australian government have mismanaged this issue. It is absolute rubbish.
Of course, people have alluded that we have not tried particularly hard to resolve this issue. People, I think, play down the very great difficulty that this one anomalous trip was caused from some mischief on the other side of the world. We are not really sure what it is, but we have already tried to involve parties such as Iraq, Kuwait, the UAE, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan, Libya, Cyprus, Tanzania, Eritrea, Qatar, Italy, Poland, Israel, Ukraine, Argentina, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia—the list just goes on and on. Efforts have been made by this government to place these sheep in a safe manner that meets the requirements of the animal welfare issues that we are bound to. 
It does not end there. There is a whole range of other countries we could have got the sheep to. As bad luck would have it, they would have had to pass through the Suez. It just happens that, at this moment in time—something that has been conveniently ignored—there is an outbreak of rift valley fever. So if they pass through the Suez Canal, it means that all those new markets that we could have put those sheep into are suddenly not open to us. I have to say that the sorts of comments that were made by the opposition spokesman on this matter with regard to the British Army not being able to take them were absolutely outrageous. They said, `They had some other prior arrangements.' The `prior arrangements' were ensuring security in Iraq. I think it is a pretty cute statement to say `some prior arrangements'. That is why the British Army could not distracted by the distribution of these sheep.
The import risk assessment process involves far more consultation and is far longer than can possibly be done. There has, quite rightly, been a management process to ensure that an assessment is made so that if these sheep are brought back to Australia, it is all about contingency planning and that they will be brought back in a way that ensures that Australia's great quarantine barriers are protected in perpetuity.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Matters of Public Importance,23,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-10-08,"—I, too, want to contribute to this important debate. I noted with interest Senator Scullion's remarks. I know he is a strong advocate of the live export trade, but I am not too sure he understands that in fact the RSPCA has not and does not endorse the live export accreditation program managed by Livecorp. On that issue, either he is misinformed or he misunderstands the RSPCA's position.
Senator Heffernan described the issue as `secret Saudi men's business'. It would be useful if that were the case, but in fact we are seeing the mishandling of the Cormo Express situation by Minister Truss and we know that it is adversely affecting Australia's live export trade, our domestic livestock producers and Australia's international animal welfare reputation. We know that is the case because we are reading about it in the media every day. There is international alarm about Mr Truss's handling of the crisis, and we know that too because it continues to be reported in the media and we are seeing petitions and protestations all around the country about the issue. We know that our reputation as a country with a high animal welfare standard is under threat, and that concern is in the international media commentary. There are even protests in foreign capitals, not just here in Australia, and that is beginning to impact on our processed meat exports.
Domestically, there is also significant and building pressure on the whole actual live trade, not just on the sheep trade but also on the cattle trade. As well as that, the prospect of the ship being returned to Australia is causing very serious alarm on quarantine grounds amongst our domestic livestock industries and trading partners. The introduction of exotic diseases into Australia via the return of these sheep should be a matter of concern to every senator in this chamber. Exotic diseases would not just hit the red meat sector but also other industries, including the future of Australia's wool industry. I am very happy to declare a personal interest in the Australian wool industry and in the impacts that this would have on that industry, and that is the matter that I want to discuss in this debate.
My colleague Senator O'Brien has been calling on Mr Truss to release the import risk assessment related to the return of these sheep. We know that the import risk assessment exists, because Mr Truss himself has told us so, but so far he has refused to release it. If Mr Truss adopts the position taken by the Prime Minister and allows the sheep to return to Australia, he must first provide wool growers with a guarantee that exotic diseases will not accompany them and that any quarantine risk can be fully contained. Mr Truss must assure the wool growers in my state of New South Wales that these sheep will not, for example, introduce sheep pox. This is a serious disease that is endemic in the Middle East. Perhaps senators might not understand that sheep pox is a particularly hardy virus that can survive for up to three months on the skin of animals—and even longer in a cool, dark environment. This virus could also be carried on board the Cormo Express in the fodder that is being loaded at the moment to relieve the animals' distress or by the equipment being used to load that fodder. An outbreak of sheep pox in the fine-wool regions of New South Wales would have a devastating impact on growers. 
There is also great concern about the possible introduction of screw-worm fly, which is also endemic in the Middle East. Even first-year vet science students know that there is the potential on the Cormo Express for screw-worm fly strikes to go undetected, because the maggots fall off and burrow into the dung layer on the decks. Picture for a moment, if you can, what the conditions must actually be like on this vessel—sheep covered in manure and standing in inches of sloppy dung. The ammonia fumes must be overwhelming, with the temperature providing a breeding ground for these exotic diseases. Ordinarily, the best way to manage that risk would be to remove the sheep from the ship and clean it down. Clearly, that is a difficult control measure to implement and a logistical nightmare in the current circumstances. Even if it were possible, I am not convinced that it would reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Again, the wool producers of New South Wales would be utterly devastated by an outbreak of screw-worm fly. To eradicate an infestation like that would have an extraordinary impact on the national flock for years, take time and be extremely expensive.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-08,"—This is a matter of public importance and it is also a matter of public interest and public concern. I think all politicians would acknowledge that the level of public concern and outrage about the situation involving the sheep on the Cormo Express is one of the most significant issues occupying the public mind at the moment. It is showing up significantly in letters to the editor and in calls to radio and also, I am sure, in emails to all senators. That frustration and anger from the Australian community are borne from a greater realisation of the immense cruelty involved in this trade.
It is no secret that the Australian Democrats have long had a policy of abolishing the live sheep and cattle trade. I accept that others in this chamber have different policies, but the bottom line is that the justification repeatedly used by successive governments—Labor and coalition—has been that industry standards are such that animal welfare issues can be properly addressed. That has been the repeated pledge time after time from governments—Labor and Liberal—and from the industry, yet each time they make that pledge another incident involving horrendous cruelty occurs. The bottom line is that the government and the industry cannot guarantee that proper animal welfare standards will be met in this industry.
That being the case, I believe it is absolutely essential for the government to accept that extreme cruelty is inevitably a part of this industry and that they must work to develop the alternatives. It is not true to say that the banning or phasing out of this industry would result in the complete disappearance of jobs and money as though there was no other alternative, because there is an alternative. It is worth emphasising that the alternative of the processed meat trade, the packaged, refrigerated carcass trade, is actually four to five times greater in value than the live animal trade—and that is with very little government effort in trying to promote that trade, compared with the repeated efforts to expand the live animal trade. That not only means that money goes through the live animal trade rather than through the processed trade but it also means that value adding opportunities here in Australia are reduced. There have already been clear statements from some abattoirs and meat processing plants in Australia that they would happily slaughter these sheep—obviously, if quarantine issues were addressed—and that they have the capacity. Indeed, in Rockhampton in my own state of Queensland there was the issue a week ago of an abattoir not being able to operate consistently because it could not get enough stock, and yet we are continuing to send the live animal, the unprocessed animal, offshore. 
As senators would know, being a fairly strong advocate of vegetarianism myself I am not normally prone to advocating the expansion of the slaughter of cattle and sheep for meat in Australia. But the reality that obviously has to be faced is that there is a demand and, whilst I might have views, I am not trying to unilaterally impose them on everyone else. It is far better to get maximum economic value for Australia out of that industry and it is also far better to have minimum impacts in terms of animal welfare issues. We do have a reasonable code of practice in Australia for the slaughter of animals. I can assure senators that those standards do not apply at all in the Middle East.
I refer the Senate to a speech I gave in this place a couple of months ago drawing attention to an article in the Australian Veterinary Association magazine detailing just some of the practices that occur in slaughtering the very animals that are exported from Australia. Those processes are absolutely unbelievably shockingly cruel. Footage of some of them—certainly not the worst of them—was shown on 60 Minutes some time back and produced, quite appropriately, an outraged response from the public. I think the public is not aware of many aspects of the reality of this trade—what the animals endure all the way through. It is not just a situation such as is on the Cormo Express where they are stuck at sea—that is obviously an extreme outcome and an appalling outcome from an animal welfare point of view. The everyday occurrences with this industry, even when things go well, are not good. It is not just the conditions on the ship during the voyage, and they are uncomfortable enough, but the offloading at those ports is often done extremely inappropriately and further transportation is often done in inappropriate vehicles often without cover in full sunlight and blistering heat. As I have just mentioned, the slaughtering practices at the end of that are simply unbelievable in their level of cruelty.
This is an Australian trade involving Australian animals and the government cannot say, `It is not our responsibility once they leave our shores.' If we are going to allow and license a trade involving animals we have to have responsibility for ensuring the humane treatment of those animals at all stages of that process. That is not done and I would suggest that it simply cannot be done. There is no way that proper humane treatment can be guaranteed. Therefore I believe that ethically we have to explore the alternatives. I am not immune to the reality of the economic and employment consequences to some people who rely on this industry. As with any industry when there is the need for a significant shift, appropriate assistance needs to be given. As I have stated, I believe there is significant opportunity for expansion in the processed meat trade and that a lot of the money and employment can be transferred across. 
It is an area, as with many others, where we have seen significant secrecy from this government and from the industry body, LiveCorp. This body has refused to release reports in the past and the government has refused to comply with Senate returns to order about reports on previous voyages where things have gone wrong, saying that they are documents provided to LiveCorp and that it is a private organisation and it is up to it as to whether it releases anything. It is very difficult for the public to get to the bottom of what is actually happening or what the reports are showing about the conditions that animals endure on these voyages as a matter of course.
We have also had repeated statements from a number of government ministers, not just Minister Truss in recent times, that say there is no alternative to the live trade because cultural practices in the Middle East mean that the animals have to be slaughtered there. That is simply wrong. There is a halal authorised slaughtering process in Australia. There is a halal meat export industry—a significant industry that exports tens of thousands of tonnes of meat each year, including to the Middle East. There is plenty of scope for that to be expanded and if that was given assistance and promotion then that would certainly grow.
Similarly, whilst I acknowledge there are issues with refrigeration and storage of processed meat or preslaughtered meat in some countries in the Middle East, I would suggest that that would be far easier to resolve by industry assistance to the region than what is happening at the moment where there have been a few derisory attempts by the industry to provide assistance with better offloading and slaughtering facilities. There is clearly an alternative. If there is going to be an impact on people as that shift occurs then clearly appropriate assistance needs to be given. In my view and the view of the Democrats, there is a clear principle here. Firstly, there is an alternative—an alternative that is actually worth significantly more money. Secondly, it cannot be guaranteed or come close to being guaranteed that this industry can operate in a basically humane way in relation to the animals. If statements by government ministers and the Prime Minister himself are to be believed—that they do have concern for the welfare of animals, that they do want to ensure that decent standards apply—then they have to be measured by their own statements. There is simply no way that they can back up those statements with the outcome. If they are concerned about these matters then they should acknowledge the reality and the views of the Australian people and seek to wind down this cruel industry and move across to alternatives.
A petition of over 21,000 signatures—nearly 22,000—was tabled in this place yesterday. That is the highest number of signatures on a petition to be tabled so far in the Senate this year. Previous years have seen petitions with tens of thousands of signatures around the same issue, also amongst the biggest petitions that the Senate has received. Animal welfare is not a fringe issue; people do not like unnecessary suffering—whether it is animals or human beings. We should seek to avoid it. The industry has had enough chances. The government have had enough chances—they have had 20 years or more to get this right. They cannot do it. They have run out of chances and run out of time. We need to now explore the alternatives. This latest farce is simply the latest in a long line and we should not be having more of them in the future.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-10-08,"—I would like to support the remarks of Senator Heffernan and Senator Scullion in this debate. I commence my response to what is a very worrying approach by Senator O'Brien and the opposition to this matter by drawing a picture of what this industry really means to Australia. In 2002, six million sheep at a value of $414 million, one million cattle at a value of $613 million and 130,000 feral goats—largely from my state of Western Australia—at a value of $10 million were exported live. The industry is the eighth top agricultural export earner. Four per cent of the total agricultural trade is livestock from the live export industry and this industry sustains 9,000 jobs throughout Australia. In short, and obviously to anybody who has the national interest at heart, this industry is far too important to be the butt of cheap political points.
The Saudis rejected the MV Cormo Express cargo because of scabby mouth allegedly affecting six per cent of the total cargo of 57,000 sheep. Within four days an Australian veterinarian assessed the number of scabby mouth affected sheep on that ship to be 0.35 per cent. That differential should send a message to Senator O'Brien that there is more to this than meets the eye. The value of the export industry to Saudi Arabia last year was $195 million. Of course, the Saudis are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council of states, which includes Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE and Qatar. Those states have agreed that, if one state rejects a shipment for veterinary or quarantine reasons, each of the other states would similarly maintain such a negative stance towards the importation of that stock. 
This is a nationally important export industry, particularly to the Middle East. It is attended by a unique degree of political sensitivity and should be viewed solely in the national interest. Indeed, that is not what Senator O'Brien's matter of public importance brings to the parliament. In fact, Senator O'Brien simply does not care about such important matters as agricultural exports into the Middle East. They only want to make some political mileage out of this. I say that because there is not one hint of a solution in anything he or Senator Stephens have had to say. As we heard in question time, a couple of members in the opposition leaned back in their comfortable chairs and shouted, `Fix it!' One could not envisage a more arrogant, simplistic and plainly ignorant approach. They say, `Just fix it!' It is typical of an opposition simply going through the motions. Not once for one second today have we heard any hint of a solution. What is worse is that we have not heard any evidence of the mishandling. How has the minister mishandled this matter? The fact is that he has not mishandled it. He has been put in an absolutely invidious position with respect to this for the reasons that I have explained. The Saudis have rejected the shipment in the most confusing and perverse of circumstances and the vessel has not been able to find a home for those sheep in Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE or Qatar, or I think in many other countries throughout that region, for reasons known only to the Saudis.
When one looks at the opposition's particular plight in this—because it is a plight—one sees that they are seeking to seize upon the embarrassment of having this shipment rejected when there is patently nothing that obviously springs to mind other than to bring the sheep home. There has been no constructive contribution from this opposition, just the finger of blame pointed at an industry of national importance in relation to which they should be supporting the government. Of course, Labor have an alternative agenda relating to their reform agenda for the live export industry. That alternative agenda is about giving more power to the union movement. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union wants to slaughter more sheep, beef and goats onshore. That is what this is about—simply a shameful get-on-board approach and opportunism in attacking this minister in the hope that they will score some brownie points with respect to their union mates. 
Over the past three years, the mortality rates for live sheep and animal exports have been between 1.14 and 1.31 per cent, which is a remarkably low figure. The mortality rate for cattle has declined over the last three years from 0.2 per cent to 0.15 per cent. These are outstanding figures and something that this industry can be very proud of. The industry has an oversight by the independent reference group comprising Dr Gardner Murray, the Commonwealth's chief veterinary officer; Dr Hugh Wirth, President of the RSPCA; Professor Ivan Caple, Chair of the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare; and Mr Malcolm Foster, former Chair of the Red Meat Advisory Council. The Livestock Export Accreditation Program, the quality assurance program and the licensing process for this industry comprise one of the most rigorous agricultural export licensing processes in the country.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-08,"—by leave—As senators will be aware, section 57 of the Australian Constitution provides for joint sittings, following a double dissolution, where the Senate has twice rejected or failed to pass a proposed law passed by the House of Representatives, or passed it with amendments to which the House will not agree.
The discussion paper I am tabling today considers two additional options for resolving deadlocks. The first option would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses without the need for an election. The second option would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses after an ordinary general election.
The government wishes to encourage community debate on these options, and invites members of the public to make submissions in response to the paper by 31 December 2003. The Prime Minister has announced that if, at the end of that time, there is a reasonable prospect of community support for a change, the government will consider holding a referendum on this issue in conjunction with the next general election. Of course, the Senate would have the normal opportunity for comprehensive debate on any bill for the conduct of such a referendum.

 (Senator Kirk)—Senator Faulkner, I understand that informal arrangements have been made for you to be able to speak for an unlimited time.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-08,"—For Mr Howard, constitutional reform is a new-found interest; for Labor, constitutional reform is a long held conviction—reform not solely about the moment or about advantaging the government in power. Unlike Mr Howard and the Liberal Party, Labor has been committed to restricting the powers of the Senate since Federation. In 1974 and 1984 it put proposals, including for simultaneous elections, to referendum. In 1988 the Labor Party put forward four proposals for constitutional change, including four-year terms for the House of Representatives and the Senate. In 1999 the Labor Party supported the republic referendum. These referenda were opposed either formally by the Liberal and National parties themselves or by sections of those parties. It seems that constitutional reform is desirable only when the Liberals are in government.
Regardless of the Liberals' double standards and opportunism, I welcome the fact that Mr Howard wants to look anew at constitutional reform. I question, however, why his exclusive focus is Senate powers. The Prime Minister has not always been a critic of the Senate. In fact, during his years in opposition Mr Howard was a fervent supporter of the Senate. He staunchly opposed all Senate reform proposals. As opposition leader in 1987, Mr Howard was responsible for responding on behalf of the Liberal Party to the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission. I note that those recommendations were very similar to Mr Howard's own recent proposal about the deadlock provisions. This is what he said then: 
... we find utterly untenable the proposition that the existing powers of the Australian Senate ought to be destroyed. I say to the Government: get off your 1975 kick. Do not maintain the rage over this proposal.
Even in his early days as Prime Minister, Mr Howard told Alan Jones that the reality of his job was to cooperate with and work with the minor parties in the Senate—to talk and listen to them and inevitably, at times, disagree with them in order to try and get his program through. But just like his predecessor Paul Keating, who once famously described the Senate as `unrepresentative swill', these days Mr Howard has become a trenchant critic of the Senate. In June this year the Prime Minister claimed that the Senate was no longer a states' house or a house of review but a `house of obstruction'. He even made the outrageous claim that Senate obstructionism has occurred only since 1996.
The Senate today is by no means obstructionist. The statistics say it all. During the period of Mr Howard's prime ministership, 1,269 bills have been passed by the Senate, with or without amendment. Only 25 bills have been negatived in the Senate, and seven negatived twice. Eleven have been laid aside by the government, and four laid aside twice. Since 1996 the management of the Senate has become much easier. The opposition has granted the government extra sitting hours, extra days, extra weeks and exemptions to allow early consideration of urgent legislation. Labor has ensured more time is devoted to government business. One wonders if the present-day Liberals ever ponder on the intransigence of their predecessors with regard to these issues. The bottom line is that 98 per cent of the Howard government agenda has gone through the Senate. The government's claim that the Labor Party in the Senate is obstructionist is absolute nonsense, and Labor will not tolerate such falsehoods to be used by the government in any debate on Senate reform.
There is only one time, really, when you could argue that the Senate was a house of obstruction, and that was during the years of the Whitlam government. From 1972 to 1975, the then opposition rejected a record 93 government bills—25 more than the total number of rejections in the first 71 years of the Senate's history. I want to quote Gough Whitlam from his book The Whitlam Government, in which he says: 
It is true that, throughout our three years, the Opposition in the Senate used first its inherited and then its accidental majority to obstruct, delay and reject legislation in a way never experienced before or since.
In April 1974 the then Liberal Party opposition blocked the supply bills in the Senate. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam sought a double dissolution election and was returned to government. The Liberal Party, still in opposition in October 1975, again refused to pass supply in the Senate until the government agreed to submit itself to the judgment of the people. The Liberal controlled Senate plunged Australia into a constitutional crisis. In Gough Whitlam's time, the Liberals, with their usual born to rule ruthlessness—aided and abetted by the irrelevant members of the National Party, then the Country Party—just manipulated the make-up of the Senate. 
Fred Chaney, who was the opposition Liberal whip in 1975 in this chamber, wrote a few years ago that he:
... saw at close quarters the ultimate exercise of Senate authority when it denied the Whitlam government supply. It did this on the basis of a fiddled majority produced by the shenanigans of the state governments in NSW and Queensland. Nevertheless, this did not deter the conservative forces from the view that the Senate had a right not only to amend government legislation but to bring a government down.
They are Liberal Fred Chaney's words about the approach the Liberal Party took during the period of the Whitlam government. At that time, the newly elected member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, supported the decision of the coalition to block supply in the Senate. More recently, of course, Mr Howard has indicated he now thinks the decision to block supply was a mistake—not because it was an inappropriate use of Senate powers but because Malcolm Fraser would, in Mr Howard's words, `not have got so tentative' when he came to office. Mr Howard declared in parliament in 1987:
... I will defend to my last breath the action taken by the Liberal and National parties in 1975.
I say to Mr Howard today: if you truly believe that the legislative agenda of an elected government should not be obstructed by the Senate then forthwith renounce the actions of your own party in 1975. That is something that Mr Howard can do today if he wants to show he is fair dinkum about this particular issue.
Back in 1993, many in the chamber would recall, the same Liberal Party, again in opposition but this time with the support of the Greens and Democrats senators, gutted the Dawkins budget by refusing to pass six budget bills. What did shadow finance minister Peter Costello say about this? He defended the Liberals' actions. He said:
The Australian electorate didn't vote for any of this. They don't want it; it's not going to help them; it's not going to give them jobs. How do you expect us to vote for it?
The truth is that both sides of politics have taken advantage of the Senate's power to amend and negative bills. Both sides have done it, but only one side, only the Liberals, have blocked supply. Since the 1970s—
—I know you are ashamed of it, Senator Brandis, and I know your hypocrisy is exposed on this issue, but only the Liberals have blocked supply. Since the 1970s the minor parties in the Senate—first the DLP, now the Australian Democrats and the Greens—have exerted leverage over legislation. Much of the law that has passed the Australian parliament over the last 30 years has been as a result of tortuous negotiation, debate and compromise until the Senate is satisfied. This is a frustrating process for governments. But by assiduously pursuing its proper role as a house of review, the Senate can ensure that Australians benefit from better and more rigorously tested laws.
I would like in this contribution to quote Alfred Deakin, who, as I know Senator Brandis would agree, was Australia's greatest non-Labor prime minister. In 1897 Deakin made this prescient observation at the Constitutional Convention:
... it is possible that a more conservative party in the House of Representatives would be confronted by a more radical party in the Senate. In both cases the result after a dissolution would be the same. The men returned as radicals would vote as radicals; the men returned as conservatives would vote as conservatives. The contest will not be, never has been, and cannot be, between states and states ... it is certain that once this constitution is framed, it will be followed by the creation of two great national parties.
Deakin was right. The Senate never divided along state lines. The notion of the Senate as a states house was stillborn. Nevertheless, the Senate has evolved into an effective and respected house of review.  
But it was not always so. Initially the Senate lacked legitimacy. Polls in 1950, 1953 and 1958 found that more Australians wanted to abolish the Senate than keep it. That opinion, of course, gradually waned. One reason was the growing acceptance of senators elected under the proportional representation voting system that was introduced in 1948. By 1979, 62 per cent of Australians supported retaining the Senate as a house of review and a check on executive power. More recently, a survey found that only 34 per cent wanted the Senate to be government controlled, while 44 per cent said it was better if it was not government controlled. Proportional representation has made it more difficult for governments to gain a majority in the Senate. It has thus led to more conflicts between the executive and the Senate. In 1984, when state representation in the Senate was increased from 10 senators to 12 senators, the chance of the government achieving a Senate majority became even more remote because of the even number of Senate seats—six—to be contested in a half Senate election.
As the Senate's role has evolved since Federation, so has the Labor Party's attitude towards the Senate. In 1919, Labor introduced abolition of the Senate into its platform. That was after the first Senate election was held using the new method of preferential voting. In that election, the ALP got 42 per cent of the vote but won only one Senate seat. The Nationalists, who got 45 per cent of the vote, won 17 of the 18 Senate seats. Abolition of the Senate remained a plank of Labor's platform until 1979, but no Labor government from 1919 to 1979 moved to abolish the Senate. Abolition was a bridge too far.
In the early 1970s, Labor Senator Lionel Murphy was the driving force behind extending the Senate's activities into scrutinising legislation and examining government spending. Murphy worked to increase the relevance of the Senate at a time when his party's platform still proposed abolition. As a result of his efforts, the Senate now boasts a comprehensive Senate committee system, which I believe provides the most effective accountability mechanism that we have in this parliament. Today the Senate's key role is scrutiny. Its powers of scrutiny are important tools for enhancing Australian democracy and they deserve to be defended by all those with political interests and by all sides of Australian politics.
I would also like to briefly address some proposals to reform the Senate through the electoral system. This was a bit of courageous work on the part of Senator Coonan, who proposed changes to the ways senators are elected. This is a Liberal Party scam. The idea was to make it harder for the minor parties to pick up seats. Senator Coonan suggested that we impose a formal threshold which a candidate must achieve—that is, a specified percentage of a quota of overall primary votes—before qualifying for distribution of preferences, arguing that such a change to the electoral system would offer a solution to the rule of minorities that has so characterised the Senate in recent years.
Of course, Labor opposed Senator Coonan's plan. We do not believe in manipulating the electoral system or in those sorts of rorts that Senator Coonan proposed. We do not believe it is appropriate to rort the electoral system to the advantage of the major parties, be they Labor or non-Labor. We continue to argue that the way to reform the Senate is to address the Senate's powers. I am very pleased that Mr Howard also has totally debunked that nonsense from Senator Coonan in that humiliating speech about Senator Coonan's proposals that he made at the Liberal Party National Convention. However late it was for Mr Howard to embrace the same broad approach as the Labor Party—to deal with the Senate's powers and not to rort the electoral system—and to agree with us, he is right. 
Of course, the Prime Minister has been absolutely scathing about Senator Coonan's proposal. In his address to the Liberal Party National Convention in June this year, Mr Howard indicated that the suggestion of `some people'—you know who the some people are—to alter the voting system for senators thereby making it harder for minor parties to win seats in the Senate was `unfair' and `undemocratic'. But I would like to be fair to Mr Howard, as I always am, and quote him directly to the Senate. This is what he said about this absolute nonsense that has been peddled around the traps by Senator Coonan. Mr Howard said:
... the innate sense of fair play of most Australians would react to the big boys as they would describe them ganging up on the smaller parties. 
The truth is that in the less tribal Australian political state in which we now exist people want the option, whether we like it or not in a major party, of voting for smaller parties in the Senate. 
And if we look as though we are kicking against that choice instead of going on persuading them as to the unwisdom of that choice then I think deservedly we will suffer.
That is the end of what Mr Howard said in totally debunking that absolute claptrap—those rort proposals—that Senator Coonan had been peddling around for years.
—But at least he had the good sense to start talking about Senate powers, Senator Murray, and at least he had the good sense to leave Senator Coonan high and dry. So congratulations to him on that point, because it is something he has got right. Australians will not wear rorting the electoral system.
Mr Howard's discussion paper proposes two options for reforming section 57 of the Constitution. The first option would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses to consider a bill that has been blocked by the Senate twice during the life of parliament with the required three-month interval. The 1959 Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review originally recommended this proposal, along with others such as simultaneous elections and breaking the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. This mechanism, if passed at a referendum, would certainly mean a weakening of Senate powers. Even the Prime Minister has admitted as much in the discussion paper tabled today. In it he said:
It might be argued that this option limits the effectiveness of the Senate as a house of review.
I have always been concerned that such a mechanism could be abused by an unscrupulous government. For example, how could we guarantee that a conservative government would not reintroduce malapportionment into our electoral system? Could we guarantee a government would not destroy the powers of the Auditor-General, as Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, tried to do in that state? How could we guarantee a joint sitting would not diminish the scrutiny powers of the Senate? I suppose we could be assured that the appallingly drafted and draconian ASIO legislation of last year would have passed in its original, wholly unacceptable form after just a three-month delay! The efforts of Senator Brandis and his ilk in the Liberal Party room would have been no good under those circumstances. The Prime Minister even admits there could be the potential for abuse with this new power. He suggests that additional safeguards could be introduced to ensure amendments to certain legislation, such as legislation that promotes government accountability be excluded from consideration at this type of joint sitting. But although the Prime Minister's discussion paper canvases excluding legislation from a joint sitting that promotes government accountability, it completely refuses to propose different mechanisms for dealing with deadlocks over money bills. 
The second option—the so-called Lavarch model—would allow the Prime Minister to ask the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting following an election to consider a bill that has been blocked by the Senate twice in the previous parliament and is blocked again in the new parliament. Labor will certainly consider this option, which we believe would have more chance of success in a referendum than Mr Howard's first option. Mr Howard admits in his discussion paper that, if a deadlock were to arise early in the life of a government, the resulting election might therefore need to be for the House of Representatives only, which would put `elections for the House and the Senate out of kilter and add to the cost of the proposal'.
Of course, there is a way to ensure that this does not occur, which is fixed four-year terms for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Labor has consistently made it clear that while we are serious about Senate reform, we do not think that the deadlock provisions in section 57 should be addressed in isolation. Other important issues like the removal of the Senate's power to block supply and fixed four-year terms for both houses also need to be addressed. We believe there is a fundamental problem with the Senate having the power to deny financial sustenance to a government and we remain resolutely committed to constitutional reform to prevent the Senate from rejecting, deferring or blocking appropriation bills. If the Prime Minister is serious about Senate reform, then he must address the power the Senate has to block supply. As I said before, a very good starting point would be to renounce what his party did in 1975. That would be an excellent starting point. Just say he got it absolutely wrong. What a good way to kick off this debate.
It is now time I think for the Prime Minister to consider Labor's proposal for fixed four-year terms for both the House of Representatives and the Senate. After all, a major argument used against four-year terms was that they gave minorities in the Senate too much power. The lower quota in a full Senate election makes it easier for minor parties or Independent senators to be elected. Surely, if the powers of the Senate are curtailed, four-year terms become more acceptable. Australians will need to consider if wider representation in the Senate should be balanced by the sacrifice of some powers.
Australia has three-year parliamentary terms in name only. According to a Parliamentary Library paper, it is calculated that the Australian parliament in the last 25 years has only lasted on average 28.5 months. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in 2001 recommended four-year terms on the ground that they would facilitate better long-term planning for government and ensure consistency with state jurisdictions and cost savings. The committee also argued four-year terms were a logical topic for examination in any future discussion on constitutional reforms.
Election dates should also be fixed. Such a reform would address some of the uncertainties and limitations of our current political system. Fixed terms would be good for our democracy and would improve the quality of our government. It is encouraging that the Australian Democrats also support fixed four-year terms and will support a proposal to remove the Senate's power to block supply. Mr Howard has also indicated his preference for four-year terms over three-year terms. With bipartisan support we have the opportunity to address this issue. However, Mr Howard is opposed to fixed terms. Last Sunday the Prime Minister floated a potential compromise to fixed terms, citing the Victorian system whereby there is a fixed three-year term and a maximum term of four years. While this proposal is very far from ideal, it would be I suppose at least a small step in the right direction. 
The Prime Minister has made it clear also that he will not go ahead with a referendum without the support of the Labor Party. However, it is clear that a successful referendum on Senate reform will require more than just the backing of the two major parties. Even if the coalition and the Labor Party agree, there is no guarantee of success at the ballot box. I remind the Senate of the important 1967 referendum to break the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The referendum was supported by the two major parties. It was unsuccessful because of the opposition to the proposal from the DLP, a handful of dissenting senators from the government, and two Independent senators who vocally opposed the referendum and ran the official no campaign. Their slogan `no more politicians' was simple and effective. The referendum failed, with only one state obtaining a majority of votes. This referendum of course was held in tandem with the resoundingly successful referendum to include Aboriginal people in national censuses, which produced the largest yes vote on record and passed in all six states. 
Since June the Greens and the Australian Democrats have voiced opposition to Mr Howard's Senate reform proposals, and Mr Howard will need to work hard to broaden political party and community support on any referendum proposal. The history of referendum success is bleak. We know it is very difficult to carry any referendum, and a referendum to change the deadlock provisions of the Constitution will be no exception. If the only the coalition had supported our efforts in 1974 to change section 128 of the Constitution so that referendums would require a majority of voters in at least half the states, three, rather than the existing requirement of a majority of the states, four. If only they had supported that referendum. If it had been passed the 1977 simultaneous elections referendum would also have been carried. As Scott Bennett from the Parliamentary Library has said, the Australian public `need a lot of convincing to tamper with the work of the Constitution founders'. History has shown Australians `will not alter aspects of the federal system of government if they perceive its basic structure to be under threat, nor will they seek to weaken the position of the Senate in any way'.
The Senate has evolved into an effective house of review and there is wide community support for its role. Since 1996 Labor has been careful not to abuse the Senate's powers. We have used the Senate—I believe much more effectively than the government did when it was in opposition—to hold the government accountable and to scrutinise this government's actions and behaviour. Our challenge remains the need to balance the capacity of a government to deliver on key aspects of its electoral program with a strengthening of the oversight and scrutiny role of the Senate. As I have said before, if we succeed in that task we certainly will improve our democracy, we will improve our government and we will improve our parliament. I seek leave to table the policy discussion paper on constitutional reform and the resolution of the parliamentary deadlock that stands in the name of the Hon. Simon Crean MP, Leader of the Opposition, and Robert McClelland MP, shadow Attorney-General. I understand the paper has been tabled in the House of Representatives.
Leave granted.  ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-08,"—This is an incredibly important debate on constitutional reform and it is one that the Democrats welcome. The Democrats have evolved over 26 years into a very Senate focused and Senate specialist party. I believe the fact that the public has continued to re-elect the Democrats in a balance of power role in the Senate ever since 1980 demonstrates that the public is comfortable with having a party in a balance of power role that will use that role responsibly and effectively.
The government's discussion paper is a narrow one. It specifically talks only about section 57 of the Constitution, which is a very narrow base from which to start what should be a very important debate. It is also, in my view, a failure as a really serious attempt to generate debate. It is filled with inaccuracies; it is filled with partisan rhetoric that is part of the government's ongoing campaign to create a completely false perception about the role and impact of the Senate and to build on this myth that the Senate is somehow a major obstacle and impediment to good government. The facts simply do not show that up and this paper makes an incredibly poor effort to build any sort of case about the need for change. That is unfortunate in a way because the Democrats have certainly always acknowledged that there are improvements we can make to our Constitution. There are improvements that we can make to our political and parliamentary system, and we welcome the opportunity to have a genuine public debate about ways to do that.
It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has kicked off that debate with such a poorly written, misleading, shabby and shoddy piece of work. It cannot be looked at in isolation from all the statements by this government that have gone before. It is not unusual for governments to be frustrated with the Senate and to attack the Senate. The previous Labor government was just as robust—probably more robust in some ways—in their repeated attacks on the Senate. But the reality is that the public wants the Senate to do the job that it does; it supports the Senate playing the role it does; it wants there to be a safeguard against absolute power for the government of the day; it wants the Senate to prevent bad legislation from going through.
The Prime Minister is starting from the wrong point. He is starting with the presumption that there is a problem with the way the Senate is behaving when there is not, and he is starting with the presumption that somehow or other the public's will is being frustrated by the way the Senate behaves, when I would gladly bet significant amounts that the public is far more happy with the way the Senate is behaving in preventing some bad legislation from going through and significantly improving many other pieces of legislation than they would be to simply allow the government to get away with doing whatever it wants. The Prime Minister is starting from the wrong point. He is trying to deal with a problem that does not exist—and he knows it does not exist. As is the wont of governments, not surprisingly, they like to look for opportunities to get themselves more power.
The Prime Minister, once again, is misleading the Australian people with what is in both this document and the statement he made when tabling it in the other place earlier today. He stated that these proposals are not an attack on the power of the Senate and that they do not extend the powers of the government or the Prime Minister of the day. That is simply wrong. There is absolutely no doubt that these proposals, particularly option 1, dramatically weaken the power of the Senate and massively increase the ability and the power of prime ministers to do whatever they want. That is something the Australian people will never support. It is well worth re-emphasising what other speakers have said, that even if a referendum proposal has support of both major parties there is no guarantee that it would get through, no guarantee that the Australian people would support it. I am very confident that even if there are proposals that have the support of both major parties, if they take away the power of the parliament and of the Senate and give it to the Prime Minister those referendum proposals will not get up. 
The Democrats are not scared of this debate; we are not defensive about it. We will certainly strongly defend the effectiveness of the Senate, the importance of the Senate and the role of the Senate but we will also seek to take the Prime Minister at his word—which is always a bit of a dangerous thing to do. If he is genuine about having a public debate to look at ways to improve our political system and our parliamentary system, we will engage in that. Tomorrow the Democrats will release a range of proposals that we believe would significantly improve the effectiveness of our parliamentary system. That is not done by giving more power to the Prime Minister, I can assure people of that. It is done by trying to give more power to the people and by trying to make both the government and the parliament more accountable and able to perform their roles more effectively on behalf of the people. This should not be seen as a debate about political parties defending their turf or exploring what is in their interests. We should remember that all of the political process is about what is best for the people of Australia and what delivers the best outcome for the people of Australia.
As I said, this paper cannot be considered in isolation. It has to and will be seen as part of the broader context of the government's approach and, indeed, previous governments' approaches and comments about the Senate. Senator Faulkner mentioned some of the quite bizarre changes to the voting system that Senator Coonan put up a few years ago. She was not alone in that. There has been a consistent stream of coalition members in recent years putting up different proposals, all with the underlying theme that somehow or other the Senate is a problem. That has been continued with the ongoing statements of the Prime Minister and other ministers about the powers of the Senate and about the Senate frustrating the will of the government of the day. But it is simply misleading—a specialty which unfortunately this government is becoming very adept at—to put forward the idea that somehow the Senate is not working or that we have a major problem. The Senate is working; that does not mean we cannot make it work better and it does not mean we cannot make the parliament work better. The Democrats are keen to explore that debate and to explore that opportunity.
If I turn more specifically to the discussion paper that the Prime Minister released, in the executive summary on the case for change—I have to say that I have never seen a weaker case made on any argument in a long time—there is continual repetition of this furphy that somehow or other having six instead of five senators elected at a time has prevented the government from having control of the Senate. The reason the government of the day do not get control of the Senate is that they do not get enough votes. In a proportional system, you have to get 50 per cent of the primary vote to get 50 per cent of the seats and no government has come within a bull's roar of 50 per cent of the primary vote for a long period of time. 
Not surprisingly, coinciding with the formation and the rise of the Australian Democrats, people saw the opportunity for the Senate to operate more effectively as a house of review and as a house of accountability. It is no accident that the Democrats, of all political parties, consistently get significantly more votes in the Senate than in the House of Representatives. It is because people see the specific role that we play and they support us in having that specific role in the balance of power. The issue of blocking supply that Labor speakers have referred to is a significant component of that. We saw the very damaging controversy of 1975 when the Liberal Party blocked supply in this chamber. From our inception, the Democrats have always pledged that we will not vote to block supply under any circumstances. We have held to that promise consistently and that is why we have not had the problem of Senate obstructionism since 1975. In that year, the Liberal-dominated Senate rejected 27 per cent of the government's legislation and they prevented supply from getting through as well. That is obstructive. Since then the consistent average has been around two to three per cent of government legislation and that is whether you have had a Labor Party government or a coalition government. That, I suggest, is the Senate doing its job. 
On top of that, we have had significant improvements to legislation through amendments. Senator Faulkner pointed to the significant improvements to the ASIO bill—the Democrats still did not support it at the end—but there is no doubt that it was far improved on what it was initially. That is as a direct result of not just the Senate's voting power but the whole ability of the Senate to provide an avenue for scrutiny and public input. There was a lot of public input into those bills that we drew out through committee inquiries that highlighted so many of its flaws and where it needed to be changed.
We could draw on the recent example of the newly sworn-in health minister's change in approach on health and Medicare issues. We have still to see what he is changing it to, but we certainly know he is changing it. Everybody knows he would not have changed a thing if there were not the requirement for the government to get that legislation through the Senate. That was not the Senate—and people around the country clearly know this—being obstructive or partisan or just playing politics for the sake of it or for political advantage. It was because we knew it was bad policy and we were being told, through our Senate committee inquiry, that it was policy that was not supported across the community, the political spectrum and all aspects of the medical arena.
We were able to use the Senate processes, including the committee inquiries, to highlight many flaws in that package and we are still doing that. That was through public input. The Senate would have been grossly irresponsible if we had ignored all those criticisms and simply said, `The government is elected to govern; we will let them do what they want.' So even that most recent change—and whether it is a change for the better we will have to see, but certainly the early signs are positive—only occurred because of that Senate ability. These changes, particularly the first option, would prevent any of that leverage, and the government could just sit on its hands for three months and then do whatever it wanted.
This paper also has this outrageous statement:
In practice, the minority has assumed a permanent and absolute veto over the majority.
The Prime Minister has been around for a long time. I cannot believe that he does not know the basics of democracy and of political parliamentary systems. This idea that somehow there is a minority in the Senate that is preventing this vast majority from being able to do what they want is a farce. I only wish that I had had a bit more power to stop some of the things the government did do in relation to refugees in particular. The Democrats or the crossbenchers more broadly cannot do anything on our own if there is agreement between the two larger parties. We have to get a majority of people to agree with us and that is just the way democracy works: if you want to get support for something, you have to get a majority of people to agree with you. This idea that there is some minority holding this vast majority of people hostage is simply false, but it is repeated time and time again. 
We even have a whole chapter of this paper called `A Minority-Led Senate'. I like the idea that I might be the leader of the Senate as the largest minority party but, unfortunately from my perspective anyway, I am not the leader of the Senate. I do not lead the Senate and this whole chapter entitled `A Minority-Led Senate' is simply a farce. It continues to perpetrate the falsehood that somehow a small number of people are holding everybody else to ransom and that is simply not the case. That chapter has the bizarre statement:
... parties in the Senate will now with damaging regularity, delay, amend ... important elements of a government's legislative programme ...
How terrible is that, that we regularly amend things? It is horrendous. And that is the sort of mentality that is percolating through this document from start to finish.
Despite the Prime Minister's speech today being quite a measured, sort of diplomatic one, he cannot hide the underpinnings that are going all the way through this document, continuing to create that false perception. That so-called `damaging regularity' whether it is delaying or ultimately vetoing important elements of the government program again does not match the figures. Less than three per cent of legislation is held up. If you look at the six latest bills that are in the current double dissolution pile, you will see that most of them would hardly qualify as major elements of the government's program.
This government kicked and screamed like you would not believe about us destroying their entire budgetary intention when we prevented medicines from becoming more expensive and people from being more likely to be kicked off disability pensions—neither policy, I might add, that the government went to the electorate with. Yet, what do we find? We find at the end of that year a $7½ billion surplus. It would have been an $8 billion surplus if we had let those things through and we would have had more poor people and more poor sick people as well. That is hardly a thing to build the surplus on the back of, yet that was portrayed by the government as outrageous economic vandalism.
Leaving aside the argument, this document continues to repeat the government's line about the unfair dismissal legislation that will supposedly help create thousands of new jobs. As that debate has occurred many times in this chamber before, I will not go into it in detail, but suffice to say that, at the least, it is very strongly contested by plenty of people, including the Democrats. There is no evidence to back up that assertion.
The suggestion repeated time and again in here that the Senate has been a pattern of frustration is simply misleading, as is the suggestion—I find it extraordinary—at the end of the executive summary that the will of the electorate remains subject to a veto, as though somehow what the Senate is doing is non-democratic or against the wishes of the people. We are elected to the Senate—and by a fair electoral system, I might add. The solution, according to the Prime Minister's document, is to develop a model which more faithfully reflects the will of the people. I think the Prime Minister sees himself as the walking embodiment of the will of the people, but I have to say that I do not think the people see it that way. I think that the suggestion that somehow just having an election and being able to hold a sitting afterwards to pass legislation as though that election were a giant referendum on all of those bills is pretty dodgy. 
Again in the conclusion we have the statement that what this paper and the government does not accept is that there should be a permanent and absolute veto for minority interests. That is fine, because there is not one. So the problem is solved; we do not have to worry. I should say, as I have said before, that we welcome the debate. It has opened up with a very poor document, but nonetheless it has opened up, and the idea of Australian people contributing their ideas to making our system work better is welcomed by the Democrats, and we will participate constructively in that. That is why we will release ideas ourselves.
—Have you got an open mind?
—As I said, we will participate constructively in that with an open mind. That does not mean that we are going to just accept any of the flimsy rhetoric the government puts forward, but we do support positive change and, if there is an opportunity to get that, we will certainly develop it. As I said, tomorrow we will be releasing some of the proposals that the Democrats will put forward as ideas.
Let me say, in conclusion, that it is something that both sides, for the larger parties, have repeatedly done when they have been in government. Whilst the Liberal Party have been the only one to block supply—and I certainly condemn that occurrence—I do believe there were quite clear statements on the record by a former Labor senator and minister, Lionel Murphy, when he was in opposition, urging the blocking of supply. He did not have the numbers so he was unable to do it, but it certainly was very strongly threatened. In terms of attacks on the Senate, whilst this government is about it in various ways I do not think that anybody can go past some of the excesses of the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating. The famous, although grossly incorrect, line about `unrepresentative swill' has gone down in Australian political history, ignoring the fact that the House of Representatives is far less representative than the Senate.
Back in 1994, Mr Keating said to one of my predecessors, Senator Kernot:
We can get rid of you lot, that little tin-pot show you run over there.
Thankfully the former Prime Minister's desire to get rid of the Senate, to gut its powers and destroy its electoral system never got up—again because of the role of parties like the Democrats in our balance of power role. So we have form on both sides of politics with this. I am very confident that at any referendum the Australian people will have the final say on this issue. They will not support anything that gives more power to the Prime Minister of the day or to the larger parties, and I think that has to be a starting point for all of us when we are considering this issue.
I conclude by thoroughly recommending to the Prime Minister and everybody else to read a book that has just been published called Platypus and Parliament: the Australian Senate in Theory and Practice, by Stanley Barch, who is from the US and therefore gives as objective an assessment as you could get. I think you will get a much more realistic assessment of the facts in terms of how the Senate operates than you would get from listening to the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and some of the quite outrageous false insinuations in his discussion paper.
It is a discussion we need to have, and I certainly encourage the Australian people to be part of it. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister's committee consists of two former members of the executive and former members of the House of Representatives—rather than anybody with Senate experience—and an academic who has previously put forward a paper that advocates virtually the same model as the Prime Minister has put forward. (Time expired). ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-10-08,"—This paper is barely three hours old and already we have seen the debate degenerate into a discussion of who obstructed the most when in opposition. We have even gone back 30 years ago to the days when supply was blocked.
—It should never be forgotten.
—I do not think it should ever be forgotten either. I remember those days only too well. In fact, if you take an overhead view of what happened in those days, you will see that the schism that was driven straight down through the political system in Australia invoked so much passion on either side of politics that it actually renewed the whole political system. I was a political agnostic at that particular time. I went down and ticked the Liberal box.
—The Liberal box?
—Yes, there was no National Party where I lived, at that stage. The passions were so high at the time that people chose either side. Many people came into politics. I understand that the Labor Party was renewed by people who thought the system was terribly unfair, and people on our side of politics were so opposed to the Prime Minister that they became politically aware and went out and joined respective political parties, whether they were Liberal or National parties. A lot of people came into politics because of that.
I can remember a government being so extraordinarily bad and so reprehensible that, although we can all say that it was a terrible thing to do at the time, when people were trying to flog off Australia to people like Khemlani the people accepted that supply should be blocked and overwhelmingly supported the opposition that then became the government. It was not the Governor-General who formed the Fraser government; overwhelmingly, it was the people—and they could not get there fast enough to do it. Let us look at that: if we get a government from either side of politics that is so reprehensible and so bad then I believe the Senate, the last form of defence, should have the right to block supply, and I do not think we would surrender that right.
I have not discussed this with my party. I do not know what the Liberal Party feel. This is a positional paper that we will all have to take back to our respective parties and no doubt debate through the political system of our branch meetings and the other meetings that we have throughout the year. We then come to another proviso that the Labor Party have put on this bill going through, and that is four-year terms. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition, and the Labor Party have made it quite clear that, to get bipartisan support on this, we would have to depend on two provisos, basically. There are probably a lot more that would have to be discussed into the future, but the two provisos that the Labor Party have put on this are not blocking supply and introducing a fixed four-year term.
The Prime Minister is not of a mind to follow that, although in the spirit of compromise he has looked at a four-year term with the ability to go to an election anywhere between the third year and the fourth year. So it seems that, if everyone holds their ground, this positional paper is not going to have bipartisan support. Even if it did have bipartisan support, it does not guarantee that it will get up. There are many people in Australia who just vote no on any referendum. One of my party members said that if they were offering me free beer I would still vote no, and I think that is the sort of thinking out there in the electorate in some places. 
When I first came into parliament the Senate could, and often did, get a majority in the parliament. I do not want to discuss the rights or wrongs of this, but it was proposed that the 20 per cent tolerance that the National Party enjoyed be taken away and that would have extended the seats beyond the capacity to service those seats. There was disagreement on that. The parliament then decided to increase the number of seats in parliament. The result of that was that it was almost impossible—I suppose nothing is impossible in politics, but as near to impossible as you can get—to get a majority. Then we had a convention in the parliament that if a bill was part of budget legislation then you could get up and condemn it and you could move what we called `pious' amendments—you could do all sorts of things to it—but you let that bill go through.
—My learned friend Senator Brandis said that that was accepted. We did accept that and it put us under tremendous difficulties. The Democrats then had the balance of power, and if we did not vote against something that was seen to be harming our electorate because of a budget bill or because of a convention that we would support anything that was a budget bill then our electorate erupted. They could not understand the ministrations of the Senate. They thought it if was good for them you should vote for it; if it was bad for them you should vote against it. It was very difficult. I can remember trying to explain to our party members that one day the wheel would change and we would be in government and we would not be able to get our legislation through. But, in the event, it became impossible to honour this convention, because if we continued to do it then we would continue to lose votes.
So that convention went down the chute, and now we have legislation that goes through this chamber that is often designed like a horse and ends up like a camel and bears no resemblance to the form in which it should have gone through. Our people cannot understand it. They say: `You're in government. We elected you, you fix it,' and it is very difficult for them to understand that there is a group in the middle that basically vote with the Labor Party many more times than they vote with us. So frustration creeps in. They say: `We elected you, we voted for you. We want to do our farming. We are not interested in politics. All we want you to do when we vote for you and we give you that political responsibility is for you to go in and fix it,' and the frustration creeps in when you do not. We have had this debate on unfair dismissals so many times that I do not even have to look it up anymore; I can do it off the top of my head.
There is no doubt in my mind, being a former employer, that you will not put anyone on if it is going to cost you $10,000 to remove them if they do not come up to scratch or do not prove that they are worth their money. As a result you do not put anyone on. You subcontract out—get someone to do your photocopying, someone to do this and someone to do that. You use every method that is within your capacity as an employer to not employ anyone. That seems to me to be the most sensible thing to do when you artificially stop people from dismissing someone they employ when those employees are not doing the right thing or do not supply value for the employer. You can artificially prevent it, as you have done, but once you artificially prevent anything and work against the market the market will find its own level. So the level is: do not employ anyone, or employ the least number of people you can, subcontract out what you can and let the family do as much as they can. I would have thought that was completely obvious to everyone. It is not even hard to understand it. It is very basic. 
That has been defeated about 20 times. The small business people say to you, `Why don't you fix it?' You say, `I can't fix it because the Democrats will not allow it to be fixed.' You get that frustration creeping through. Is a government elected to govern? If it is not elected to govern then you should have the ability to throw it out. That is the background behind the paper. I listened to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition very closely on the television when they were making their points in the House and, unfortunately, it seems to me that this has gone down at the first hurdle, so to speak.
In this house we have degenerated to, `You did it worse than us,' and `We did it better than you,' and `You were worse because you took the ultimate blocking of supply 30 years ago.' I say to the Labor Party: you have to get over it; you really do have to get over this. It happened 30 years ago. Probably, if the election had been held a month later you would have lost another 15 or 20 seats, if that was possible. We did you a favour if you really look at what we did do to you. The people spoke; you were dismissed. I was so outraged. I can remember the day, the very place where I was and the time I was there when the news came over that supply had been blocked. I will tell you where it was because you may be interested. It was at Myer's on the Gold Coast. A cheer erupted right around Myer's. We were not in Myer's at Bellevue Hill but everyone cheered.
Let us get back to the debate about what we can do. How do we stop the frustration of the people? How do we have a parliament that works? We have the first proposal, which does not seem to have any support at all from the Labor Party, so we move to the Lavarch proposal. We debate that but there is a proviso—unless someone shifts—that four-year terms are locked in concrete and no blocking of supply is locked in concrete. I think the people out there want a safeguard. They want to know, if we do move to the Lavarch proposal where you go to two knock-backs, two rejections, an election and then another rejection and you are powering up the lower house, that there is a brake. They will want something that provides a brake if a government is so reprehensible, if it is so bad. I am not talking about the Labor government; I am talking about government of any persuasion. We could get a One Nation government or something like that.
—Heaven forbid!
—Goodness help us! But say we did get one through various circumstances. You can laugh but there were quite a considerable number—18 or 19—people elected to the state house in Queensland. People want a final say if a government is so bad. They want a brake or some sort of safeguard if a reprehensible government either from the Left or the Right is elected. If you went to the people and said, `We're going to take that safeguard, that insurance policy, away from you,' I am sure that even if it did have bipartisan support—I am not sure of anything in politics; you cannot be sure of anything—people would reject the proposal.
Unless we are prepared to look at this in a bipartisan way the frustration of the electorate will continue. As I said before, there are reasons the Senate was expanded. Some people say it was the wrong thing to do. I do not want to open this debate again but, with their rejection of the 20 per cent tolerance, one seat of ours was going to run from the cape of Queensland down to Toowoomba. That was just completely unserviceable and the Senate was increased for those reasons. The result of that is that you cannot then get a majority. So, even if you have a large majority in the lower house, you will not get one up here.  
The second phase was that, when it was a budget bill, there was an overall position that we would not vote against it. I must say that we supported most of the reforms that the Labor Party wanted to get through. We saw them as being in the best interest of Australia. A lot of them were not endorsed by the people that voted for us but we saw them and we voted for them. That is not now being reciprocated by the Labor Party. I suppose that, if we are not prepared to look at this openly, the frustration will continue. You will get back into government one day and you will be frustrated. We will be frustrated now and the people will be frustrated because they elected a government that cannot govern. That will be the result of not looking at this paper with a bipartisan approach. I commend the paper and I hope that we can give it some very serious thought.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-08,"—The Australian parliament is in need of reform but the Prime Minister's recently released discussion paper, which is entitled Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Constitution, does not offer the best options to achieve that reform whilst maintaining the important role of the Senate in Australian governance. The reform debate has focused on claims that the Senate is obstructionist and unrepresentative. Indeed, in releasing the discussion paper, the Prime Minister said today that the Senate was:
... a permanent veto on the legislative agenda of the government of the day.
That claim just does not stand up. Despite the government's difficulty getting a number of high-profile bills through the Senate, the fact remains that the Senate has passed over 95 per cent of government bills since the last election. The Senate gives a voice to the people of the smaller states, helping to balance their relative lack of representation in the House of Representatives. The system of proportional representation used to elect the Senate also accurately reflects people's votes, giving those who vote for Independents and minor parties a voice. They have great difficulty getting that voice through the House of Representatives. 
I think that there are opportunities to improve the constitutional arrangements of our parliament without damaging the Senate. The aim of any constitutional reform or change—and sometimes they are not the same—should be to achieve better decision making following a predictable and orderly system. There is a need for us to have a more realistic mechanism to resolve deadlocks between the Senate and the House of Representatives, but that does not mean that the government should get its own way.
The Prime Minister's discussion paper offers a couple of options for reform of the parliament. They are a joint sitting without an election or a joint sitting following an ordinary election. The first is an option from the recommendations of the 1956-59 Constitutional Review Committee and is clearly unacceptable. This option says that, if a bill is rejected twice by the Senate, the government could then call a joint sitting of parliament without an election. Of course, such a system would effectively end the Senate's power to reject unacceptable legislation as the government would generally be able to pass controversial legislation through a joint sitting. It would eliminate the need for governments to negotiate with the Senate to pass legislation and it would alter the balance between the parliament and the executive. Under this option, the Senate would join the House of Representatives as a rubber stamp to the legislative agenda of the executive. The second option in the discussion paper, the joint sitting following an ordinary election, is similar to the option put forward by former Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch. The Lavarch option is better. It proposes a joint sitting after a general election so that people can have their say on deadlocked legislation. 
The system that I propose would have fixed three-year terms for the House of Representatives, with half Senate elections every election. A government could hold a joint sitting of parliament after a fixed term election to vote on legislation which has (1) originally been detailed in the government's election manifesto, (2) subsequently been introduced to the parliament within the first year of the government's three-year term, (3) been rejected twice under the current requirements for the trigger and (4) been put to the people again at the next election.
This is an option which provides minimal changes to our parliamentary system but has a number of advantages. It extends the average length of time between elections, giving governments more time to implement their programs. Over my 28 years in the Senate there have been elections approximately every 2½ years. This option will also remove some of the uncertainty surrounding one of the most fundamental questions of the political process: when will we have an election? It will also introduce a measure of stability by having senators who are not too closely focused on the short-term imperatives of their re-election. It will allow a broader perspective to be brought to issues in the house of review rather than a focus on the more immediate parliamentary cycle. 
It is also important to maintain the nexus between the numbers of parliamentarians in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where the Senate always has half the number of the House. Without this safeguard there would be a temptation to increase House of Representatives numbers without reference to Senate numbers. The government's numbers in the House of Representatives would then be even more likely to overwhelm the Senate in a joint sitting vote. The focus of most comment in the lead-up to the release of the Prime Minister's discussion paper has been on the Senate as the problem. But the real problem is deadlocks. Deadlocks are not caused by the Senate but by irreconcilable differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate and, more particularly, between the major political parties in parliament. 
The Prime Minister's preferred option and the Lavarch option both involve substantial changes to the way parliament operates, but my option provides minimal changes to our parliamentary system yet offers governments a predictable system by which deadlocks can be resolved. It is generally agreed that bipartisan support is needed to pass a constitutional amendment. But this would need more than just the agreement of the coalition and the Australian Labor Party; it would also need the agreement of the Democrats, the Greens, and the Independents, for example. This is a difficult but not impossible task, and it is essential in achieving constitutional change. Obviously, if the government parties and the Labor Party vote for the constitutional referendum legislation, it will pass both houses of parliament. But the question is: will it pass a referendum?
I have served as an independent senator during the terms of four prime ministers. With each government I have found myself, at one time or another, in the position of holding the deciding vote on particular legislation. For example, in the last term of the Fraser government, my vote was sometimes the decider. In the first term of the Hawke government I had the deciding vote on the occasions when the Democrats split their votes three to two. And of course in the term of the Howard government I have held the deciding vote on issues like the GST and native title. The debate on the question of native title was the longest debate over a measure in the Senate since Federation—a grand total of 56 hours and eight minutes—and the number of amendments finally agreed to was 164. That outcome prevented a damaging race based election in this country.  
There are obvious benefits to me, and to my constituents in Tasmania, in my holding the balance of power and having such an influence over the outcome of legislation. But I have to admit it is not the best way to decide on national issues. One senator, with limited but excellent staff, can give adequate consideration to a limited number of bills, but one senator cannot possibly give proper consideration to the full legislative agenda. Of course, I rely substantially on opinions and contacts—and I suppose if you have been here for 28 years you have got a few—and I also rely on the committees and so on. Clearly, having a balance of power position is not something that I determined. It was the outcome of a combination of events, including the votes of the Australian people and the decisions of the various parties in the Senate to oppose each other outright on particular legislation and not to negotiate. That position is likely to occur again.
Unfortunately, I cannot see an easier way around the problem inherent in any voting system that relies on majority votes. The solution may remain with the major parties and their willingness to engage in consensus rather than adversarial politics. There is an opportunity to reform the Australian parliament, but the reform needs to be balanced. The aim of reform should be to improve the decision making process and the accountability of parliament, not to force the passage of all government legislation.
I rarely invoke this, but I stand here after having been 28 years in this place and as the longest serving independent member of the Senate since Federation. I have given this matter thorough consideration. I believe—and I do hope—that the proposals that I have put forward in summary in this address are given due consideration. I believe that they will uphold the Senate's right but overcome, in an orderly, understandable fashion, the deadlocks between the Senate and the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-10-08,"—Senate and constitutional reform is a very important issue. It is an issue that has been a key concern of the Labor Party over a long period. Since Federation, Labor has been a constant advocate of change to renew our Constitution so as to ensure that it delivers to the Australian people. Despite the fact that we have occupied the government benches for only one-third of the period since Federation, we have proposed 60 per cent of the referenda to amend the Constitution. More often than not, our efforts have been frustrated by our conservative opponents, who have cynically and opportunistically run scare campaigns preying upon the fear of change. Who can forget that Peter Reith made his name as a politician by opposing one vote, one value? Who can forget what a pathetic and disgraceful campaign he ran? To be fair to him, it made him as a politician. He carried that mantle to the end.
Labor welcomes the fact that the Prime Minister has today released a discussion paper canvassing constitutional reform. We have constructively participated in this debate, and will continue to do so. Unlike John Howard's opposition in 1988, we will not take the easy option of opposing change in pursuit of cheap political points. It must be said, however, that John Howard's vision for constitutional change is far too narrow. The changes required to the Australian Constitution go well beyond the provisions governing double dissolutions in section 57. 
Just as John Howard's opposition to constitutional change in the past was driven by political expediency, so too is his embrace of reform today. The Senate should be in no doubt that we are having this debate today because the government is frustrated that the Senate refuses to act as a rubber stamp for John Howard's legislative agenda. The Senate has refused to accept unfair amendments that would drive up the cost of pharmaceuticals. It has rejected cruel measures that would send people with significant disabilities onto the nation's dole queues. It has opposed changes to our media laws which would have led to the sector being dominated by two or three players, an environment in which media diversity would disappear. The Senate has also stood against measures that would make it easier for business to sack employees without having to be concerned with the unfair dismissal provisions. These are the sorts of measures that the government would like to ram through the parliament.
The government argues that in some way the actions of the Senate are illegitimate, that popular will is being frustrated. We heard Senator Boswell on this matter just a short time ago. But an analysis of the voting results at the last election does not support this contention. At the last election the coalition received a primary vote of 43 per cent—that is, 57 per cent of voters supported non-government candidates. It is impossible to view this division of votes as an expression of popular will that the government should have its agenda implemented without the scrutiny of the Senate. If the people of Australia had wanted that outcome, they would have given the coalition a majority in the Senate. They clearly did not do so. The Senate is intended to be a house of review, and that is how it is functioning. It may be frustrating for governments to have to negotiate legislation through the parliament, but that is no reason to water down the capacity of the Senate to do its job of reviewing and improving legislation.
It must also be remembered that the coalition parties come to the debate on Senate power dripping with hypocrisy. Since the coalition was elected, 1,269 government bills have been passed. The Senate has negatived less than two per cent of the government's legislation. That is right—a mere 25 bills have been negatived. Only seven of those have been negatived twice, fulfilling the requirements of section 57 for a double dissolution. In contrast, in the three years of the Whitlam government, the opposition parties rejected an astounding 93 bills. In 1975, supported by the young John Howard, the coalition committed the greatest act of Senate obstructionism in Australian history. Unable to accept the fact that the Australian people had relegated them to the opposition benches, the born-to-rules, the coalition parties, blocked supply to the twice democratically elected Labor government.
—Get over it, Stephen.
—I am willing to bet, Senator Brandis, that back then you were probably on our side of that debate. I am willing to bet that you had a conscience when you were younger. I am willing to bet that you would have been a sympathiser and aghast, because I know you are a decent man, Senator Brandis, and I know that you care about constitutionality and what is fair and decent. So I am willing to bet that if we could go back in time to 1975, to that young firebrand Mr Brandis, his views would be a little different to the ones he is going to be expressing today. But time does move on. As Senator Cherry has proved, you can be in the Labor Party and be a supporter and still end up on the other side of the benches here. So I do not think that you want to dig too deeply, Senator Brandis, into your past on this one. As I said, aided by a compliant Governor-General, the coalition forced an election 18 months early. Senator Brandis does not even get invited to his own faction meetings anymore; it is quite outrageous. He has had the right denied. He is not even a member of the Black Hand anymore. 
—We don't have factions in the Liberal Party.
—You do not get invited to their dinners, that is for sure. The power of the Senate to veto the budget effectively gives it a power to decide how long a government which has the confidence of the House of Representatives shall remain in office, when an election should be called. These powers are not necessary for it to function properly as a house of review. So we have got the real test today. Hopefully, Senator Brandis, you will address this one. You want to be able to change the powers of the Senate, but you do not want to give up the ultimate power to block supply. How hypocritical. How seriously can you take a proposition that says, `We want you to be able to block nothing, but we want to keep the power to block supply'? You are not fair dinkum, Senator Brandis, unless you are going to deal with that issue.
In Labor's view any Senate reform will be incomplete if it does not include the removal of the Senate capacity to block supply. If John Howard is really concerned about the ability of the Senate to undermine an elected government's agenda, he will repudiate the actions of his party in 1975 and commit the government to supporting a constitutional amendment to ensure that the events of 1975 can never happen again. There should be no crocodile tears from Senator Brandis, no crocodile tears from the Prime Minister and no crocodile tears from the other side of the chamber. They should just stand up and say, `It's time to move on. We were wrong. Now we want to do the right thing and support some constitutional change.'
Recently Senator Coonan, another one who back in 1975—these Liberal-Labor lawyers, I love them!—was barracking for the Labor Party, remarked:
... Australians are asking is `who is running the country?'—
back in 1975 that is not what she was saying—
Is it the coalition, which won a majority in the last election, or is it those who lost the last election but control the Senate?
I would be interested, as I said, to hear her views from 1975. You may well blush, Senate Brandis, but Senator Coonan will be blushing more. The events of 1975 demonstrate that section 57 is not designed to deal with the most potent form of Senate obstructionism: the power to block supply.
Professor of constitutional law Colin Howard has described the problem in the following terms:
Section 57 does not deal with the most important potential conflict between the Houses, which is a refusal on the part of the Senate to pass supply or appropriation Bills.
The section does not in terms exclude deadlocks of this kind.
It is general in its wording and gives no indication that any form of deadlock is outside its scope.
The argument that the section nevertheless does not cover such a deadlock is practical rather than legal. 
The speed and urgency with which the money supply needs to be renewed when it is running out leaves no time for the prolonged procedures of section 57 to be complied with.
The effective result is that in such a case there is no alternative to bringing on a general election for the House of Representatives.
Amending section 57 without changing the ability of the Senate to block supply would leave the cause of our greatest constitutional crisis unresolved. That is your challenge today, Senator Brandis; deal with that one. A proposal for amending section 57 which does not address this issue could not be regarded as a genuinely serious proposal. Unlike our conservative opponents, who only advocate change when they perceive it to be in their narrow self-interest, the changes that Labor will support will be those that improve the operation of the Australian Constitution in the interests of the Australian people—not simply those that will advantage the executive government.
A major reform that has been championed by Labor for some time is fixed four-year terms for both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Australia is a rarity in the international community in having a maximum parliamentary term of three years. Of the 148 member countries in the International Parliamentary Union, only 13 have three-year terms. The vast majority of countries have decided that terms of at least four years are required to give government the time to implement and be judged on their policies. In 2000 the Queensland Constitutional Review Commission described the problem of three-year terms in the following way:
It has been said that under a three-year term, the first budget is devoted to paying off the promises made at the previous election and the third budget in anticipating the promises to be made at the forthcoming election. Consequently, only one budget out of three, the second, is likely to address important, long term policies without the contamination of short-term political considerations.
That is a compelling argument. The analysis is probably too optimistic for this government, though, which has seemed to be constantly talking up the prospects of an early election.
A four-year term would enable a government to implement a reform agenda in the knowledge that the success of its program will be assessed at the end of a reasonable period of time. Necessary reform may often involve short-term pain but over the long period be seen to be to the benefit of the community. A four-year term will encourage government to undertake such reforms. With the exception of Queensland and the ACT, Australian states and territories have opted for four-year terms. Given the additional national responsibilities of the Commonwealth, it is anomalous that the federal parliament has only a three-year term. The Prime Minister is on the record as supporting four-year terms. In April 2002 he stated:
There's no doubt in government, if you knew you had four years, there are some additional things you would do which you know would be unpopular in the short term but will produce a long term dividend. There's no doubt about that.
Labor will use the debate on constitutional reform to ask the Prime Minister to have the courage of his convictions and put this issue to the Australian people. Labor also supports the notion of a fixed term. In the last 25 years, the average term of a parliament has been 27.5 months. The frequency of elections imposes unnecessary imposts on the Australian community. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, the cost of an election is around $95 million. There are also other costs imposed which may be more difficult to quantify. Frequent elections create a climate of uncertainty for business which may hamper investment. They can also contribute to a lack of focus by government on key policy issues, as ministers are almost constantly in campaign mode. New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT have adopted a form of fixed term parliament. Labor believes that it is now time for this option to be promoted in the federal arena. 
Another area where Labor believes that constitutional reform is required is that of Commonwealth and state cooperation. We have recently had—and I know Senator Brandis has studied this—the Hughes case, which threw doubt on our capacity to properly deal with a whole range of critical Commonwealth powers, such as the ACCC's ability to enforce. They have all been thrown into question. These are issues which we need to address; they are very important and critical issues. They should not be subject to political point scoring in this debate.
In conclusion, Labor is willing to work with the government on the reform process, but we will only support a package of measures that improves the operation of Australia's democracy. We will not be party to reform which simply strengthens the ability of the Prime Minister to ram through measures that are not supported by the Australian people. It is not easy to achieve constitutional change in Australia. Of the 46 referenda put to the people, only eight have passed. History demonstrates that bipartisan support is essential if a referendum is to have any chance of success. So let us be fair dinkum. Let us not make this a grab for power. Let us sit down and try and work something out that will improve Australian democracy. It is a brave challenge thrown up by the Prime Minister. Does he have the courage to match his words with actions? That is the challenge and we look forward to the debate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,31,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-08,"—I only have about three minutes to make my contribution. I have been in the unfortunate situation of not being able to listen to the debate because of ministerial duties, but I did want to speak—ever so briefly, as it turns out—to indicate my support for a wide-ranging debate on reform, particularly of the Senate. For a number of reasons which the Prime Minister mentioned in his address earlier on, and which I assume other senators and other speakers in the debate so far have mentioned, it is now virtually impossible for a government to obtain a majority in the upper house, no matter how large its majority may be in the lower house. 
People elect a lower house to elect a government and to elect a Prime Minister. We have seen many examples, even in the time I have been in the parliament, of the elected majority government not being able to get through the program upon which it was elected to govern. People have mentioned the GST and said, `You Liberals got the GST through,' but we got it through in a form which we really did not want. We had to make compromises, and I think history has shown that those compromises have meant that it has not worked as effectively as perhaps it could have. I do not have time to go into that.
I am disappointed that, from Mr Crean down, the Labor Party seems to have used our Prime Minister's initiative in opening the debate as an opportunity for personal political attacks on him and on the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister and those of us on this side of the parliament want to open this up for debate to make sure that the public understand over a period of time all of the issues and how important reform of our parliamentary system could be. If that involves—as Senator Conroy has suggested—looking at four-year terms then I am certainly, on a personal basis, very happy to do so. 
I am very happy to have a look at the issue of blocking supply. I know there are a lot of arguments on that. I simply point out for the record that, when supply was blocked at the following election, in 1975, the government of Mr Malcolm Fraser was returned with an all-time record majority. That clearly indicated what the people thought of that action at that time. Nevertheless, it is an appropriate time to talk about and debate those issues. I am very pleased that the issue has been raised by the Prime Minister and that the parliament, and indeed the wider public, has the opportunity of fully debating these important reforms.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to take note of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' annual report for 2002-03. I do so mainly to keep it on the Notice Paper, but also to make a comment that, in the short time that I have had an opportunity today to look through this annual report, I have been disappointed that there is nothing in it that suggests that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is in any way actively pursuing a review of its collection of data—particularly census data and particularly as it relates to Indigenous Australians. 
I say at the outset that the Australian Bureau of Statistics do some great work. Many of us rely on their figures. I note that in the last 12 months they have conducted a survey of social status and a national health survey in relation to Indigenous people. But those of us who have been following the debate as to whether the Northern Territory should or should not retain two seats in the House of Representatives will, of course, be across the debate we have had about the adequacy or otherwise of the collection of census material of Indigenous Australians. I am still baffled as to why it is in this day and age we cannot accurately keep statistics on Indigenous people. For example, why is it that we cannot be satisfied that for each and every Indigenous person in remote Australia, if they did not get to complete a census form because of either literacy problems or oral comprehension problems, there was not an effort made on a one-to-one basis to ensure that each and every Indigenous person in this country was counted?
We know that the Australian Bureau of Statistics sent a team of people into rural and remote Australia. I am yet to get answers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics about which outstations in the Northern Territory were visited and on what days, and those answers have been outstanding now for many months. I am also yet to understand why it is we have quite a number of statutory declarations from people who live in the Barkly region who have sworn that they completed a census form that was never collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. There is a serious problem in the way in which they collect data in remote Australia, and I am talking about very remote Australia here—outstations of only 20 or 30 Indigenous people right in the heart, for example, of Kakadu in north-east Arnhem Land or in the Central and Western deserts. As I said, I fail to grasp why it is in this day and age we cannot as accurately as possible say how many Indigenous people we have living in those parts of this country.
The same goes for the Department of Health and Ageing, who still fail to tell me how many Indigenous people there are in this country who suffer with trachoma. Trachoma is an eye disease that has been totally eradicated in the Third World countries, but Indigenous people in this country still suffer from that eye disease and we do not know how many sufferers are out there. It is quite unbelievable, given the technology we have these days and given the ability we have to transmit and record that data, that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as far as I can see in their annual report, have not recognised that there is a problem and have not given anybody an undertaking in this annual report that they are doing something about it. One would hope that by next year's annual report, and certainly by the next census collection date, we have a revised and improved method of collecting statistics for Indigenous people in this country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. 
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Bureau of Statistics</title>,Documents,32,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-10-08,"—I rise tonight to report on the Australian government's commitment to after-hours primary medical care in my local area of the Hunter. Seven years ago, when we came to government, general practitioners in the Hunter region identified what they termed `a rapid disintegration' in the services available to help people who required urgent medical attention out of hours. There was mounting pressure on hospital emergency rooms, by cases that could have been attended to by a GP. To tackle the issue, the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice began to work towards achieving an improved system of after-hours care for patients who lived in the Hunter region. 
The Hunter Urban Division of General Practice is an organisation that was set up to assist in ensuring that the quality of care provided by general practitioners meets the needs of their patients and the community at large. Over the last seven years, it has developed a model for after-hours care for patients, comprising an after-hours telephone service, where people can call for advice on medical complaints; GP clinics situated throughout the Hunter, including John Hunter Hospital, Maitland Hospital, Toronto Polyclinic, Newcastle Community Health Centre and Belmont Hospital; a local taxi provider to help patients with transport difficulties access the clinics; and a home visit service for medical care to anyone who is deemed necessary. 
Most of all, the service is provided free of charge to patients who are in need of emergency care. In particular, I want to cover the achievements of this after-hours service and the way in which it was piloted, first of all in the Maitland district, with funding provided by the Australian government. What is exciting about the success of such an approach after seven years is that in other regions it could be used as a template for after-hours services that integrate care from GPs into the public hospital system.
As part of Australian government funding, a package was developed in 1998 for the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice to begin a pilot program in Maitland for an after-hours service to address the needs of that district. The aim of the service was to increase quality and accessibility of after-hours care while reducing pressure on emergency rooms. The trial was a great success and extension of the program has seen after-hours GP services extended to other areas of the Hunter.
The Hunter after-hours GP service pools all funds from federal and state governments and uses them from within existing infrastructure to ensure a sustainable, high-quality medical service. The Maitland after-hours GP service has secured region-wide funding which allows the service to grow across the Hunter Valley well into 2005. This is an excellent development for the people of the region, who will be able to access high quality, comprehensive after-hours medical services.
In the time between 1 March and 30 June 2003, 4,045 patients were attended to by the clinic. These are cases that would likely have placed pressure on emergency resources if they had not been attended to by the after-hours GP service. Demand for the after-hours service is building, with the number of triage categories 4 and 5 patients being seen at the Maitland after-hours GP service, for example, increasing steadily in each four-month reporting period. Patient waiting times are also being addressed by this service. A benchmark waiting time of 30 minutes was met for 87 per cent of patients on weekdays and 89 per cent of patients on Saturdays. There is less pressure on the GP and the patient due to stringent monitoring of waiting times and ensuring that cases are dealt with in an efficient manner.
Between March and June this year, there was a 1.4 per cent increase in the number of calls made to the telephone triage service on the previous four-month period. The telephone triage service is a call centre operation stationed by nurses between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. to dispense medical advice over the phone. This allows access to medical advice for people who require assistance but are in a remote location or for people who are able to treat themselves at home. The advice line took 3,199 calls, and five home visits were required between March and June this year.
Training of GPs in the new MedTech system has commenced and other staff have been trained in child protection and medical emergencies. Particular attention has been placed on GP work force support in the after-hours service, and nurses are employed extensively. For every GP stationed at an after-hours clinic, there is a nurse on site, as well as a nurse on the advice line. 
Dr Arn Sprogis, Chief Executive Officer of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, has commended the GPs who are involved in the after-hours scheme in the Hunter. He said:
It is not going too far to say that history is being made by those GPs who are going to work in the ... clinics across our region.
I have yet to find anyone who can give me a similar example of a regional mobilisation of a GP workforce, for the benefit of an entire community on this scale, since WW2.
This view is clearly shared by the wider community, as the feedback cards received by the after-hours service from patients indicate a very positive response. The community advisory group that works in conjunction with the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice to ensure quality is also reported to be pleased with the progress of the Maitland After-Hours GP Service. News of the expansion of the after-hours service right across the region, with funding from the federal government, has been met with excitement from the local community. The Great Lakes area has also recently opened an after-hours GP facility with a grant from the Australian government.
More people are becoming aware that the after-hours service exists, and this is now leading to a need to upgrade the telephone system to increase the number of lines and technical features. After an upgrade, more data on call activity, details of call content and outcome of each call will be recorded. All of these developments show what a community can achieve by pooling resources and using existing infrastructure to its best potential. Dr Sprogis stated:
I am acutely aware of the stresses and pressures in daytime general practice in our region and yet, despite this, almost 200 GPs have said they will work at the most difficult time of the day.
This commitment will earn all GPs in our region the gratitude and support of our entire community ...
Already Dr Sprogis has reported talks between the NSW Minister for Health and the new federal Minister for Health and Ageing in initiating a similar program in the Sydney metropolitan area. Dr Sprogis says that the key is to utilise funds in the best and most economic way, within the existing infrastructure, to deliver the best outcomes for the communities and the medical staff that serve them. The after-hours GP service is a clear example of how the medical community can work together for the higher good, to provide services for the whole community and work with governments to deliver a better medical service.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Hunter Region: After-Hours Medical    Services</title>,Adjournment,33,1
