"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-31,—My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. At least 15 submissions written and oral to the Senate legislation inquiry into the Child Care Payments Bill drew attention to the administrative difficulties the government was forcing on the industry. Why did the government ignore those views and go ahead with its changes to the system of payments of child-care assistance? Why did the government cause chaos in the child-care industry and cause chaos for parents by pushing through changes which it has now reversed and which it has now decided it can delay for a further 30 months?,SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-31,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Senator Herron, I do not think you even listened to the question. You read out a brief that your department had prepared in anticipation of a question about Catherine Cusack which did not come. What I asked you is why you changed the system of payment of child-care assistance last November with the Child Care Payments Bill when you are now reversing this with your Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill causing chaos in the industry. In the estimates hearing you said that you were changing your mind because of what parents and child-care centres had told you. Why did you not listen before you introduced the new system, not afterwards when you created chaos?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-31,"—I thank Senator Neal for the question. Here we go again, Madam President, beating up an issue that is false—
—She nailed you.
—She has not nailed me at all, Senator Cook; she has nailed herself. I accept that interjection and point out to Senator Cook that Senator Neal has nailed herself because she has come up with an untrue premise. There have been submissions to the Senate inquiry—even recent media articles covering submissions to the Senate inquiry—that suggested only that dramatic increases in child-care fees and community centres are forcing parents, especially women, to change their work patterns. The Labor Party created an unsustainable child-care system whilst in government, and that is why I say Senator Neal has nailed herself because the system that the Labor Party brought into existence was unsustainable. Irresponsibly, it allowed centres to set up where they liked with no regard to need, creating an oversupply and problems of undersupply as well.
The Howard government has allocated more money to child care than any previous 
 government. There has been an 18 per cent increase in this year alone from the last year of the Labor government. This government is about targeting assistance to low and middle income families, in particular the battlers, not those like Senator Neal—and I can understand why she is concerned—but those who need it most, in providing equity and choice in child care. Before the removal of the operational subsidy to community based centres who provide child care for approximately 1.5 per cent of Australian children, some 70,000 families received the benefit of around $20 a week no matter what their income, while 210,000 families around Australia in private centres did not. Why should someone on $75,000—as Senator Neal—or $100,000 income receive the same assistance from government as someone who is on, say, $28,000?
To demonstrate the government's commitment to helping families in the work force, child-care assistance will now be provided to families using outside school hours care services from 27 April. Fifty-one thousand low and middle income families will receive financial assistance for the first time, and 19,000 families will receive improved assistance. The government has provided substantial assistance, over $8 million, to community based centres to assist them restructure. Child-care fees are set by service providers. Those community based centres choosing to increase their fees do so in consultation with families and management. Many are choosing not to keep their fees at reasonable levels.
Private sector fees are now on average $10 a week less than community sector fees—$152 a week compared to $162 a week. Accreditation standards are identical in both sectors. Ninety per cent of private centres and ninety-two per cent of community based centres achieved accreditation. Finally, assertions that parents are withdrawing from the labour force due to fee increases are not supported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics' data.
—They are!
—They are not supported by the data, but do not let the facts intrude on your own argument where you are trying 
 to boost something up. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' data on women with dependent children show that their participation rates have remained stable, at around 59 per cent over the last two years. They are incontrovertible facts. As I said, facts do not worry the Labor Party. If they want to beat up an issue, they will do so regardless of the facts.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-31,"—We always listen to everybody who puts forward submissions to the government, unlike the ideologues on the other side who have their own philosophical basis which does not allow them to listen to people. We went out and sought advice from child-care providers, from parents and from the industry itself, and we have acted on that. That upsets the Labor Party because we have actually done something. We fixed the problems that they created. We listened to the people who put forward submissions, and we have adjusted them as we are supposed to do. That is what good government does. We will always do that when we listen to the constituents and do what is best for the constituency, not those high fliers who are on high incomes like Senator Neal, who finds it incompatible with her own position.
—That is outrageous.
—Senator Cook might not like that, but they are the facts of the matter. We listen to the battlers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-31,"—In accordance with the order of the Senate of 9 March 1998, I table today two documents relating to the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment. The first is a draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) as at 13 February 1998. The second is Australia's latest revised schedule of preliminary reservations dated October 1997. I also seek leave to incorporate a short statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT
I table today two documents relating to the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). The first is the draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), as at 13 February 1998. The second is Australia's latest Revised Schedule of Preliminary Reservations, dated October 1997.
It should be emphasised that the two documents are very much in draft form. The negotiations on the MAI are far from complete as is evidenced by the significant number of square bracketed provisions and alternative formulations in the draft. Many significant issues are yet to be settled, including the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism, the extent of any so-called ""carve outs"", the treatment of regional economic integration organisations and the nature of and processes for exceptions. Accordingly, negotiations are not likely to conclude for 
 some time. The OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in late April 1998 will need to decide the future of the negotiations on the MAI, including whether to extend the deadline for negotiations, for example to next year's MCM.
Given the nature of the MAI negotiations, countries' lists of exceptions, or reservations, will form an integral part of the agreement. Australia's draft reservations should therefore be included in any assessment of the draft agreement. I stress that Australia's draft reservations are likely to be significantly revised and refined as the negotiations proceed, reflecting:
.	 further development of the provisions of the MAI, possibly involving significant changes;
.	 the outcome of ongoing consultations with Commonwealth and State agencies as regards the application of MAI provisions and policies that may impose more stringent requirements on foreign investors than on domestic investors, for which we will need to take reservations; and
.	 the outcome of negotiations on the form that country specific reservations should take and the types of reservations that will apply, including with respect to the question of applying standstill to particular reservations.
The Government believes that an appropriately worded MAI could provide benefits to Australia. For example, Australians who invest overseas would benefit from a more transparent and certain global investment framework and Australian offshore investments will be more secure because of the protection offered by the MAI. Australia would also benefit from the higher global investment promoted by an MAI. Strong global investment is critical to generating high levels of economic growth over the longer-term, and brings benefits from the creation of jobs, from higher income and from new technology.
The Government will not sign the agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in Australia's national interest to do so. In protecting Australia's national interest, the Government has stated that it will ensure that any agreement on the MAI will not override, or weaken, Australia's existing policies on foreign investment. Australia will lodge all exceptions required to protect current policies. For example, exceptions would be taken out in the areas of foreign investment, immigration and indigenous people. Australia is negotiating on the basis that general exceptions would apply to such things as tax measures, national security, public order and health and quarantine measures. Foreign investors operating in Australia would continue to be required to adhere to Australia's domestic laws and regulations, including our environmental and labour standards. 

In conducting the negotiations, the Government is actively consulting with interested parties, including the States and Territories, business groups, the union movement and other non-government organisations.
The draft MAI has been referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for examination. The Committee has called for submissions and will undertake public hearings in most capital cities. For those who have expressed concerns regarding the MAI, the Committee process provides an opportunity to comment on the draft agreement and Australia's draft exceptions. The Government will carefully consider all issues raised by interested parties and the general public in participating in the ongoing negotiation of the MAI. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties aims to produce an interim report on the draft agreement by 25 May 1998.
The Government will not take binding action on the MAI until it has been subjected to the new treaty-making processes established by this Government in 1996. These processes require treaties to be tabled in Parliament along with a National Interest Analysis (and thus subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny) before the Government takes binding action. This process also requires that the views of the States and Territories be taken into account before Australia agrees to become a party to, or indicate its acceptance of, the treaty.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Multilateral Agreement on Investment</title>,Documents,1,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-31,"—Yesterday Senator Crowley asked me a question in relation to health services in rural areas and I seek leave to incorporate to answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
SENATOR CROWLEY: My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, do you recall me personal guarantee by Prime Minister Howard in February 1996 when he stated:
I give you my personal guarantee that under my government pensions and other social security and veterans' payments and entitlement will not be cut.
Is the minister aware that submissions from state and territory governments to the Senate's public dental services inquiry indicated that services to rural and remote parts of Australia are suffering the most from your government's decision to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program? Will you now concede that, particularly for Australians 
 in rural and remote areas, the Prime Minister's personal guarantee is and always was completely worthless?
Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. . . In the light of the Prime Minister's betrayal of Australians in rural and remote areas. . . with the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, why should people in rural and remote Australia expect that the Prime Minister will deliver on his promises in the bush for Telstra?
Minister Wooldridge has provided me with the following answer. As the Prime Minister has pointed out in answers to questions in the House of Representatives, it is completely erroneous to—suggest that the Government's commitment to pensions and entitlements must mean that every Commonwealth and State program should be maintained. He also drew attention to the fact that the level of benchmarking of pensions by the Government has been more extensive and more generous beyond the commitment made at the last election.
It is rather rich for State Governments to blame the Commonwealth at a Senate Committee for not providing adequate dental services to rural and remote areas. Provision of public dental services has long been a responsibility of the States and Territories.
As the Senator will recall, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was a desperate bid for votes as part of the ALP's 1993 election platform. The ALP made no commitment to further funding of the program in the last Budget of their administration in 1995/96, nor was a commitment made in the 1996 election campaign to keep the program.
In fact, the Program achieved the aims set by the former Minister, Dr Lawrence, of treating 1.5 million people, by December 1996. The Program was then ceased six months before it was due to expire.
Despite the posturing of state authorities on this issue, the indications were that the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was always going to cease at the conclusion of the agreements with the States in June 1997.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Services: Rural Areas</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to a question 
 without notice asked by Senator Neal today, relating to child care.
This government has certainly created chaos in the child care arena. Despite the fact that Senator Herron seems to be incapable of appreciating that this is the case, certainly the rest of the community, families and women who have to take advantage of child care are very well aware of it.
You might have noted that this government has a history of refusing to acknowledge that they have problems. You might recall what occurred with nursing homes and what is happening now in the health system. This government believes that, if they consistently deny that there are any difficulties, that in fact there are none. But the community is a lot smarter than you. What Senator Herron and the government are saying is completely contrary to every piece of evidence that is available.
Three surveys have been done. On each occasion the minister has said that they are not to be taken seriously. He said that with the National Council of Community Based Children's Services, when they did a survey. He said that the New South Wales Council of Social Service survey should not be taken seriously. He said the Queensland Child Care Coalition survey should not be taken seriously. But these surveys all say very much the same thing, and when a number of surveys and people in the community are saying the same thing, that child care is in chaos, then I really think it would be worthwhile for this government to start listening. What they are saying is all the same; they are saying that child-care costs are going up all around Australia—they are going up between $11 and $25 a week per child.
The surveys are also saying that parents can no longer afford child care. The parents are being forced to either leave the work force or, alternatively, risk their children by putting them in unlicensed care.	They are also saying that parents are being forced to expect a lower level of service because of the cuts the child-care centres are having to impose. They are having to reduce the number of trained staff; they are having to reduce the equipment that is available to them.
All round, child-care centres are doing it tough. The refusal of this government and Senator Herron to recognise that is not going to make the problem go away because, on the twentieth of this month, the inquiry being conducted by the Senate community affairs committee indicated that the concern about the chaos in child care is not limited to three surveys. We have now received 850 submissions from child-care centres, from parents and from community groups that, once again, say the same thing: the changes that have taken place as a result of this government's policy are a disaster; they are causing chaos all around Australia for parents and their families. In this day and age, it is pretty difficult to raise a family. With the increased costs being introduced by this government, it is not just pretty difficult, but if you are also trying to meet the cost of child care then, for many people, it really is impossible.
I have to say that I was quite surprised to receive, as one of the submissions received by the community affairs committee, a submission by Catherine Cusack. Catherine Cusack I have known for many years and she is a very thoughtful and considered person. But I suppose it also interesting that Catherine Cusack is an adviser to Peter Collins, the Liberal Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. Catherine Cusack was very forthright about what she thought about the policies of this government in child care and the damage that is being done by the policies of this government to parents and their families.	I would just like to read a small part of her submission, but I am sure most of the people in the Senate would like to hear much more of it. It is available and I hope that you will take the opportunity. She says:
During the period from 7 April to 1 July 1997, the costs of my child care for two children increased by $93.55.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-03-31,"—This is typical of Labor: fear mongering, scaring, saying there are crises when there are not crises. This is all they are capable of doing—no policies, no ideas. Under Labor, child care growth was unchecked and unsustainable, and that was one 
 of the other things that contributed to the $10 billion deficit that we were left. They were spending more money than they actually were getting in revenue. Living on the never-never, that was typical of Labor.
They had no formal planning system for child care, resulting in some areas having an oversupply of places and others being totally undersupplied. They focused the majority of their assistance on the community based sector, which supplied only about 30 per cent of child care places. That resulted in an uneven playing field for the industry.
They left us with a legacy of mess, total lack of planning, total lack of facilities spread across where they were needed, oversupply in one area and undersupply in another area. The child-care industry was in disarray under Labor's poor management. From 1991, private child care centres were established in various locations. They were established with no directional support from government to indicate areas of greatest need and there was haphazard growth all over the country. There were, as I said, too many centres existing in one area, where there were no centres in another area—total undersupply.
This poorly planned access to child care created uncertainty in the child-care industry about their future viability due to too many centres in some areas, and it meant a lack of choice for other families in undersupplied areas.
Under Labor the low rate of child-care assistance provided to families outside school hours meant there was totally inadequate supply of places for children requiring care between the end of school and when their parents came home from work. That was totally inadequate to meet the needs of low- and middle-income families. So they effectively prevented about 51,000 Australian families using outside school hours care from receiving any child care assistance at all. That was neglected.	But do not worry about that, they left us a system which was totally in disarray and which also neglected a whole range of families that needed after school care.
In one of the questions, Senator Mackay went on about surveys. Let me tell you about 
 one of the surveys done in South Australia last week. They claimed there were huge fee increases and that the centres were closing down, and women were having to leave work because they could not get child care. This survey was done by the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, so I do not think that was an unbiased group of people doing the survey. I think it showed that the fees went up about $4 above those of the private centres. Also, when you look at what has happened in South Australia, overall, the restructuring there has been a net loss of two centres.
Money was given by the government to centres which did not see themselves as being viable—ones which, because of Labor's poor planning, were totally inappropriately placed. They were given assistance for restructuring. If they could not restructure, they were given assistance for combining some of those services together.
The industry now is getting the measure of this Labor Party. The Australian Confederation of Child Care has issued a press release, which states:
Australian Child Care Centres are the best in the world, and are as economical as $5.00 per day to families, according to the Australian Confederation of Child Care which represents over 1000 private child care centres.
I would rather listen to them than to some survey done by the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union because the confederation is actually in the business—it represents 1,000 centres. The press release also quotes the president of the confederation, Martin Kemp, as saying:
Studies of overseas child care centres recently undertaken by members of the Confederation have confirmed that Australia has the world's best standards and facilities.
We want to completely refute recent comments about Child Care which appear to be politically motivated—
Appear to be? I would say they are politically motivated—
which suggest there have been substantial fee increases. This politically motivated campaign only serves to do long term damage to the Child Care industry as a whole. This campaign is trying to blame the current Federal Government for reduc 
 tions in attendance at Child Care Centres. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The confederation goes on to praise the current minister, saying that he has shown more understanding and leadership in child care than have ministers in previous times. This is damnation for all the previous child-care ministers on the other side, including Senator Crowley, who reigned over this raid that occurred in child care under Labor. This is just a furphy. The Labor Party has no policies on this issue. If Labor were back in power, we would have child-care centres being spawned in inappropriate places throughout Australia, like they were under Labor.

"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I have never heard such a load of nonsense from Senator Patterson. I have a great deal of admiration for Senator Patterson in a number of areas where she has worked most effectively. But, after listening to her contribution this afternoon, I really think she needs to do some homework.
I want to direct my attention to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. He has tried to discredit the Queensland Child Care Coalition survey by calling it a Labor Party front. I am sure that parents in Queensland will be interested to hear this because parents are concerned about the lack of child care, the costs of child care and the disturbing trends under this government. They are not concerned about Liberal, Labor, the National Party and the Democrats; they want quality child care.
Senator Patterson has acknowledged that Australia has had, and still has, the framework for a very effective child-care system. I would agree. Who delivered that system? It was Labor when it came into government in 1983. What concerns so many of us, Senator Paterson, is how your government is whittling away at what is a very good and recognised system.
When Senator Herron, who in this place acts for the minister responsible, says, `Look, only one or two are affected, and you always have people affected,' I ask: when did he last visit a child-care centre? He acknowledged that he had not read this report. I am sorry 
 that he has left the chamber because this report is about his state of Queensland, and the survey was by both the community based and private child-care providers that Senator Patterson referred to earlier in regard to the survey report.
The Queensland child-care survey, released in February this year, found a disturbing downturn in quality child-care availability. This is one of the highlights: 3,255 Queensland children are estimated to be missing out on quality child care. That is why we are concerned. That is why parents are concerned. That is why child-care providers are concerned. Who is caring for those estimated 3,255 children who are missing out on quality child care?
The second point is that, because of child-care funding cuts, parents have been forced to reduce the hours of care by as much as 12,000 hours. This is what we know from just this particular survey: 12,000 quality child-care hours have gone missing because of the funding arrangements and changes that the government has introduced.
What about enrolments? Enrolments had decreased by 35 per cent in the first half of 1997 and by 50 per cent in the second half. I wonder what the figures are going to be for the first half of 1998 and the second half of 1998. The fee increase reported in the first half of 1997 was between 50c to $30 per week per child. That is alarming for families. No wonder they are withdrawing their children from child care. They cannot cope with that kind of increase in fees. The average fee increase for the second half of 1997 was $11 per week per child. Again, who can say what it will be for 1998 and, if this continues, the second half of 1998?
A community centre in Ipswich stated:
Mainly with fee increases, families have found it difficult as their wage had no rise to combat the rise in fees. Some parents were commenting about their security of employment. We are finding that the overall spirit of families is suffering as parents battle to meet costs not only with child care but elsewhere as well. Families are convinced that the government is determined to keep parents, particularly the mother, at home.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-03-31,"—Senator Reynolds has just made the statement that the government is forcing increased fees on child-care centres. That is absolute nonsense. The government does not set child-care fees. In the community sector, child-care fees and other management decisions are made by committees made up of the parents and the staff in the centres. The government gave community child-care centres over 12 months notice that the system was going to change and provided substantial support—$8.3 million over two years—to assist them to adjust to operating without untargeted subsidies. In addition, supplementary funding of $4.1 million annually is being provided to services in disadvantaged areas.
So, far from forcing fee increases, the charges now in place have nothing to do with the government; they are set by the committees that are running these centres. Far from what Senator Reynolds would have us believe about the Labor government's record in terms of child-care centres, the truth of the matter is that the child-care program was out of control under the Labor government, with an oversupply in some areas, while families elsewhere had little access to the kind of child care they needed.
The Howard government has made vast improvements to the child-care program. In fact, it is providing more equitable access to child-care places for families all over Australia. We have addressed the concerns about child care that have been raised by Australian families and the child-care industry in extensive consultations, and we have addressed the unregulated growth in the industry over the last six years. In fact, the Howard government has introduced a child-care system which is fair to all parents. One might sum it up by saying—
—Yes, it makes them all pay more.
—a fair go to all families is being given by the Howard government child-care program.
There are six principles underlying the Howard government's child-care program—and I think I will run through those six principles for the benefit of senators on the 
 other side, who I am sure will be enlightened by them.The first principle is that the government believes it should assist low and middle income families to meet the cost of child care. Currently, around 77 per cent of families using long day child care receive child-care assistance. Of these, 42 per cent receive the maximum level of assistance. That is a very good thing, and it is something of which the Howard government is very proud.
The government believes, secondly, that families in like circumstances should be treated in the same way. This commitment is seen in the recent decision to increase the amount of financial assistance again to low and middle income families using outside school hours care. Thirdly, the government believes that extra resources should be provided to help children with additional needs. Extra funding is available to provide child-care services with the support needed to care for children with high needs.
Fourthly—and this is something which I consider very important—the government believes that it should provide additional support for services in geographically disadvantaged areas, such as remote and rural communities. Why should the people who live in isolated regional towns in Australia not receive good child care? Why should this all go to the kind of inner-city metropolitan electorates which the Labor Party funded? This is now being done. The Howard government is very proud of the fact that it is subsidising child-care centres and helping them to operate in remote rural communities.
Fifthly, the government believes that priority for new places should be given to neighbourhoods and communities with insufficient places to meet demand. The sixth point and principle under which the government operates is that parents should be confident that a high standard of child care is being provided. The government has gone out of its way to ensure that standards are not only maintained but improved.
So, overall, it can be said that the Howard government has a very, very proud and outstanding record of achievement in the field of child care—and the Labor government has 
 a lot to feel ashamed of in this area. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-03-31,"—What we have just had from the other side is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard in my life. First off, we had Senator Herron trying desperately to answer questions about a situation he had absolutely no grasp of. Then we had Senator Patterson saying that the ALP was responsible for inadequate child-care facilities.
Senator Patterson interjecting—
—Let me tell you, Senator Patterson, when I was a young mother, I lived for many, many years under a coalition government. There were very, very few child-care centres and, because of that, women like myself who came from working class areas and who had very little transport could not go out to work. But, if we did go out to work, it had to be part time and we had to work around child-care centres' hours, or stay at home. There was no choice. There were very, very few facilities. In fact, women like myself and millions of others in this country had to rely on their mothers, their mother-in-laws, the lady next door, or whatever. So do not tell me about child-care centres and adequate facilities.
The ALP government brought in an extremely successful child-care program. Under your government, since you were elected in March 1996, you have turned this area into an absolute and utter disaster. Over the past two budgets, your government has decimated the child-care sector by removing $820 million. So how can you possibly say that you are providing a decent service?
These are some of the changes that you have brought about: you have abolished income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing eligibility for child-care assistance; you have removed operational subsidies worth $100 million over four years from community based child-care centres; you have reduced child-care assistance or put in place cut-offs for second and subsequent children; you have extended the range of fringe benefits for child-care assistance income testing; and you have removed operational subsidies to outside school hours care, 
 putting in doubt the long-term viability of this flexible program—and let us talk about this particular aspect. Because of this, I do not think your government knows or understands how—
—It does not want to know.
—Exactly, Senator Neal. You do not understand how the after hours school care operates. It operates on part-time, casual and volunteer labour. Because of your IR legislation you have forced people, particularly part-time and casual people, into a situation where they have to work when their boss tells them to work. They cannot operate their own part-time working hours. They have to work when they are told to work; otherwise they risk losing their job. How does this benefit those parents and those children when their parents have to work—
Senator Eggleston interjecting—
—Senator Eggleston, it is a fact of life that in today's society both parents have to work to provide their children with an adequate and decent life. Most people in this country, if they are lucky enough to have work, need both parents working. With this particular outside school hours cut, we are going to go back to the situation of the latchkey kids, or these children will be at school unsupervised for hours and hours. Who wants to go back to the good old days of the latchkey kids?
You also froze child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate ceilings for two years, which has meant no indexation for the past two years. These changes have created total confusion and uncertainty in the sector, particularly for parents and for service providers. Senator Reynolds touched on the Queensland Child Care Coalition survey in our home state of Queensland which revealed that 3,255 children have been removed from 244 services in Queensland in the last year as a result of the fee increases—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-31,"—What really puzzles me about this debate is that Senators Neal and Gibbs, who are normally well-intentioned people, seem to be incapable of really looking at the causation of the so-called problems in child 
 care. There is a recent article in the Daily Telegraph  where commentator Miranda Devine examines in some detail the reasons for the much touted crisis in child care, which I certainly do not accept exists at all. It is very interesting because she quotes Lyn Farrell, the Director of Lady Gowrie Child Care Centre in Erskineville, who goes so far as to describe the so-called situation in child care as `precipitated by factors from changing work habits to the oversupply of centres.'
She goes on to say that if you listen to the New South Wales community services minister, Fay Lo Po—and I would interpolate there, Senator Neal and those on the other side—the fault lies with the federal government which cuts operational subsidies to community based centres. The much touted surveys are referred to. Then Miranda Devine goes on to say—and I wholeheartedly endorse this—that the truth is much more complex. She says that there is a glut of child-care centres for two- to five-year-olds and refers to the pretty obvious fact that when the Labor federal government expanded child-care fee relief in 1991 it triggered an unplanned and unchecked explosion of child-care centres so that there was actually an oversupply of child-care centres when this government took office.
It meant that all sorts of entrepreneurial types—solicitors, merchant bankers and financial planners—said, `Get into child care; that is a good thing. There are plenty of subsidies for child care. It is a sure-fire money spinner.' In almost every area in Sydney, apart from the CBD and some isolated areas in the western suburbs, there is an oversupply of two- to five-year-old places. It is not just me saying so. Elizabeth Evans, a policy officer in the Department of Community Services, also says that. Before we get too excited about this, let us look at the causes of the problems in child care when we came to government. The private child-care centres had been established in locations with no direction, with no planning and with absolutely no support for looking at where child care was actually needed, that is, where the areas of greatest need were. The total chaos created was that created by Labor.
You need to look at what we are trying to achieve with our reforms. We are trying to put child care in locations where it is really needed. Secondly, we want to make it available for those children that need care where otherwise care was not available. Our child-care reforms are all about ensuring both fair and reasonable access to funded child care for more families rather than fewer families, to improved targeting for assistance to those families most in need—those in low income families that otherwise have no access to child care, those with children with disabilities that have no access to child care, and those children under two where there was almost no child care under Labor.
We now have a planning system to ensure that child-care services are established where families actually need them. Child care is now on a sustainable footing, which will help ensure that services grow at a rate to meet expected demand. We certainly have a commitment to build on the system of quality improvement across all service types. Our objective has been—and remains—to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and community by supporting the provision of affordable quality child care. What is most interesting of all is that the latest figures show that labour force participation by women with dependent children has remained constant since January 1996. (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-03-31,"—I table a statement by the Minister for the Environment relating to the review of the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. I seek leave to incorporate the statement into Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Under the provisions of the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, I am required to commission an independent review of the operations of the Act and the extent to which its objectives have been met within S years of the commencement of the Act and at 5 yearly intervals thereafter (s 168).
In late 1997, I appointed Dr Keith Boardman AO, former Chief Executive of CSIRO to undertake an independent review of the operations of the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (the Act). Dr Boardman finalised his review and produced a report on his findings in late December 1997.
Under the requirements of the Act, I am required to table a copy of this report in each House of Parliament within 1 S sitting days of its receipt. The final date for tabling to meet these requirements would be 1 April 1998.
I would like to table Dr Boardman's report, along with a preliminary response from the Government as I consider this would be a more useful process and would provide the Parliament with a context for considering Dr Boardman' s conclusions and recommendations. Unfortunately, there has been insufficient time to prepare this preliminary response within the 15 sitting days allowed under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992.
I would therefore like to inform Parliament that it is my intention to table the report of the independent review of the operations of the Act along with a preliminary response to the issues raised during the sitting week commencing 6 April 1998.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Endangered Species Protection Act</title>,Documents,14,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-03-31,"—by leave—I believe there is no reason to delay the release of this report. We do not need to have the government's response, however preliminary it may be. This report should be tabled tomorrow, as is required under the Endangered Species Protection Act. It is a very important report, which assesses the degree to which the objectives of that act have been met, and we see no reason why the government should be able to keep it under 
 wraps for another week or so when it can be put on the table right now.
Our fear is that the government simply wants to find ways in which to diminish the findings of this report which, we must assume, are not complimentary to the government's attempts to protect endangered species thus far. The government has already had it for two weeks and, again, I argue that there is no reason why this should not be tabled. The minister is in breach of the statute by not tabling the report.

The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the main purpose of these reports is to inform Parliament that hearings have been held by the Committee to examine various reports of the Auditor-General. I propose to highlight those aspects of the audit reports examined about which the Committee has the most concern.
I turn first to Report 358, Review of the Auditor-General's Reports 1996-97, Third Quarter . A public hearing was held on 7 May 1997 to take evidence on four reports of the Auditor-General selected by the Committee for closer scrutiny. 

Audit Reports No. 22 and No. 25 concerned client service in the Tax Office and the Department of Social Security. The Committee canvassed a number of issues at its public hearing on these reports including:
.	 the development of the Taxpayers' Charter;
the effectiveness of new complaints procedures in the Tax Office;
.	 the effect of the Tax Pack on self lodgement by taxpayers;
.	 customer service policies in the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency;
agencies' awareness of the need to develop services for indigenous Australians; and
.	 agencies' efforts to improve staff training and standards of service to the public.
The Committee acknowledges the positive and constructive attitude displayed in this audit by the Tax Office, the Department of Social Security and the Audit Office. In particular, the Committee welcomes the development of the Taxpayers' Charter. The Charter was first advocated by the JCPAA in 1993 in Report 326 on the Committee's review of the Tax Office.
The Committee recommends that a detailed report be provided in the half-yearly portfolio statements on the progress of the development of client/customer oriented services in the Tax Office and the Department of Social Security.
Audit report No. 23, on the recovery of the proceeds of crime, was selected for audit by the Audit Office because recoveries appeared low, relative to the estimate of the total proceeds of crime.
Recoveries from the proceeds of crime are indeed significantly less than was expected when the Commonwealth proceeds of crime legislation was enacted. However, the Committee considers it risky to speculate about the proportion of the total proceeds of crime which fall within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction, when the figures for the total proceeds of crime are themselves only estimates.
An issue that drew the attention of the Committee was that the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police were unable to provide the Committee with accurate details on the amounts recovered by their agencies.
The Committee recommends that agencies associated with the recovery of the proceeds of crime jointly develop procedures to ensure that all proceeds recovered are clearly identified and attributed to the appropriate agency.
Audit Report No. 27, Army Presence in the North , assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of Army's management of the move of 1st Brigade to Darwin as part of the APIN Project. 

The findings of the audit report, concerning Army's failure to adequately estimate operating costs and to clearly track expenditure throughout the project, convince the Committee that much remains to be done by Defence to reform its financial management systems.
Misjudgments over training arrangements in the north require the unforeseen return, on an annual basis, of a squadron of Leopard tanks from Darwin to Puckapunyal. The Committee considers that this, in addition to the effect of the climate extremes on tank crews and equipment, poses a risk to operational readiness.
The Committee recommends that Defence provide details on the progress of the development of appropriate training facilities in the Northern Territory and the installation of air-conditioning in the Leopard tanks.
Madam President, I now turn to the Committee's Report No. 359.
Two reports of the Auditor-General were the focus of the fourth quarterly public hearing for 1996-97 held on 25 July 1997. These were Audit Report No 34, Australian Defence Force Health Services  and Audit Report No 36, Commonwealth Natural Resource Management and Environment Programs . Report 359 focuses on the main issues raised during the public hearings.
Following its examination of Audit Report No. 34, Australian Defence Force Health Services , the Committee makes five recommendations.
The Committee recommends that Defence:
.	 take prompt action to implement the accounting and financial management reforms proposed in the report of the Defence Efficiency Review;
.	 undertake an assessment of the merits and implications of a member contribution for health services additional to those required for the maintenance of individual readiness or outside Defence's duty of care to its employees;
.	 undertake a detailed costing of all Defence hospitals and medical centres, and rationalise the provision of beds where their cost exceeds the cost of beds in equivalent civilian facilities, and where their retention cannot be justified on preparedness and operational grounds;
.	 take steps towards sourcing its requirement for dentists from outside the full-time Defence Force; and
.	 urgently develop and implement short term strategies aimed at reducing the current level of injuries to Forces personnel.
The second audit report looked at by the Committee in Report 359 was Audit Report No. 34, 
Commonwealth Natural Resource Management and Environment Programs .
Madam President, it is clear from this audit report on land and conservation programs that work needs to be done to ensure the efficient and effective expenditure of Natural Heritage Trust funds.
The Committee raised a number of issues in Report 359 which have implications for the Natural Heritage Trust including:
.	 setting realistic and concise operational objectives for programs;
.	 establishing appropriate and uniform performance indicators for programs;
.	 strengthening the needs assessment process to ensure that Natural Heritage Trust funds are well targeted; and
.	 ensuring that reporting requirements for community grants meet accountability requirements without alienating those whose efforts are needed to achieve program objectives.
The Committee recommends that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and Environment Australia liaise with the States to ensure that appropriate and uniform performance indicators for the Natural Heritage Trust programs are developed and effectively applied.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee those people who contributed their time and expertise to the JCPA's review hearings, upon which these two reports are based. The JCPA has been appreciative of the cooperation it has received from the agencies involved.
I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated much time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports. As well. I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries, Dr Margot Kerley, the JCPAA secretary, Ms Jennifer Hughson and Ms Tiana Gray.
Madam President, I commend the Reports to the Senate.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I rise to speak to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 . I am pleased to see this bill here today because it fixes up a mess which the government made. But, by the same token, it is only necessary because of this government's misjudgment and the chaos that this government is presently creating. The situation would have been even worse except that the opposition saved the government from some of its excesses. 
 When the Child Care Payments Bill was first debated, I remember being assured by I think the same advisers who are in the advisers' box now that we could put this bill into effect by 1 January this year. I thought they would be over here shaking my hand thanking me for having saved them the necessity of doing that.
One of the amendments that went through during the negotiations deferred the bill taking effect until 27 April. That saved them from being in an extraordinarily difficult situation because although a whole new administration for child-care assistance was in place in a legislative sense, the necessary mechanics were not. As I understand it, Centrelink is nowhere near ready to perform the role that was envisaged. That is why we find ourselves here tonight debating the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 .
This bill was debated for some eight hours, and the Community Affairs Legislation Committee also took evidence for two days. In all that time the government seemed unable to understand the practical difficulties of putting into effect this new administration of child-care assistance. During the hearing of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, we received a large number of submissions. This was quite surprising, bearing in mind that the hearing was held over only a very short period. In fact, the submissions were made only by invitation. At least 15 of the submissions that we received at that short notice pointed out the impracticality and unfairness of a system that was being established by the Child Care Payments Bill.
Despite that, the government persisted with its course of action. At the end of November the bill was passed. It was not very long after that—in fact, 23 January this year—that the minister announced that he had changed his mind; that all of the things they refused to acknowledge and concede during the debate and during the Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing were all true; that it would be impossible for the system to be established to allow Centrelink to pay  parents directly. In fact, it was conceded by the minister that he had made the decision to reverse the implementation of the new system because of 
 representation made by parents and by the industry.
You have to wonder why the same sorts of representations that were made at length during the debate on the bill were suddenly riveting to a minister who had completely ignored them less than 60 days before. Maybe it was that over the Christmas period Minister Warwick Smith had time to really think. I suppose that suggests that he did not think prior to that time. If we give him the benefit of the doubt, we can say that the minister had some opportunity to reflect and see that the matters that have been raised by the opposition and by the industry were not just rhetoric but a serious, practical proposal about a change in the system.
I suppose the minister might also have suddenly realised during his period of contemplation over the Christmas break that the mess they were making of child care was going to rebound on them; that it was going to rebound very strongly during the coming election when many families who rely on child care were going to express at the ballot box their dissatisfaction with the way this coalition government has dealt with child care.
I do not believe that the reversal on this piece of legislation—this backflip—will mean that the community will forget what this government has done to child care. They have done a few backflips so far, I suppose the most obvious one of which is nursing homes. The elderly in Australia still have not forgotten the callousness of this government in terms of the fees they wished to impose. The new version of nursing home fees that has been introduced is still seen as being very difficult for families who are looking after their elderly parents. It is seen as very callous by the elderly people themselves.
The opposition will be supporting the bill that is now before us because the government basically accepts the argument that we put during the debate on the previous bill—that it would be ridiculous to have two major changes of administration of child-care assistance within a period of some 12 months; that it would not be possible for this to happen in such a time period. What Warwick Smith 
 actually announced was that the new form of administration would be delayed until the introduction of the smart card. He was very vague about exactly when that might be. Note that in the bill it says that the bill may be delayed for a period of up to 30 months. That is 2½ years.
That is quite extraordinary when you recall that, through various debates and in the estimates, the minister and her representatives at the time expressed very strongly the view that the smart cards would be introduced about, or shortly after, 1 January 1999. I am now told that the introduction of the smart card is a much more difficult task than this government ever imagined and that when they called for information—I am not sure of the term; I do not know whether that commits them to doing anything—they discovered that there is this huge task that they are unable to perform in order to introduce the smart cards before that date.
They are very vague about exactly when those smart cards will be introduced, but you can rest assured of one thing: we will not see smart cards emerge before the election. Despite the protestations of the government and their minions, the main reason they are not introducing the smart card is they realise that in addition to some practical problems involved it is a major political problem for them. What they have done in child care is already rebounding on them and they do not wish to make the situation any worse.
Despite the backflip, I do not believe that the electorate is going to forget what has been done in child care. It is not going to forget that over two budgets this government cut $820 million from child care. The electorate is not going to forget that child-care assistance has been reduced by an average of $10 per day per child—that is, $126 million. That largely affects children in family long day care and in vacation care. Fees have risen. The community based and private sector long day care centres say that fees have increased somewhere between $11 and $25 a child per week, depending on the type of service and, obviously, what its competition is.
Let me remind the government that those who run child-care centres in the private 
 sector are small businesses. They say that their usage rates, as a result of these price increases, are down somewhere between 20 per cent and 30 per cent and that, as a result, many of them are not viable. They say that though few centres in the private sector have yet closed, they anticipate large numbers of closures in the near future. As we all know, many community based centres have closed already—my office has documented almost 50. The difference in timing between the two sectors is largely a result of the way they operate. Most community child-care centres are run by community management committees and if they are told by their accountant that they are running up a debt—and knowing that they have personal liability for that debt—most community based centres make the immediate decision to close. That is why you are seeing them close much earlier than those in the private sector. Although many centres in the private sector are having great difficulty with their usage rates, and their financial viability is a big problem for them, particularly in Queensland, many of them have tried to hold off, making little profit or in some cases accumulating some debt, in the hope that other centres around them will close and they will again become viable. For many, a return to viability, at least under the policies of this present government, will not occur.
I am not given a lot of hope by the response of the minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Herron. In question time today in this chamber he continued to deny that there is even a problem, despite the evidence of three surveys—not just of the community based sector, as he insists on misunderstanding, but of both the private and the community sector—and despite the evidence of 850 submissions from individuals—mainly parents—and organisations involved in the industry and child-care centres. He refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem. I strongly believe that if this government does not even acknowledge there is a problem then we do not really have a great deal of hope that the matter will be solved.
The child-care centres that have been most harshly dealt with as a result of this backflip 
 are those in the outside school hours sector, which is in an extraordinarily difficult position. Their operational subsidy has been taken away, effective as of 27 April. That is a substantial amount of money; in fact, to those centres it is equivalent to about $14 per child. Most of these centres—and I am sure that the minister does not have a real understanding of how they operate—operate in schools and halls after hours. They certainly do not operate out of purpose-built facilities. They operate on the smell of an oily rag. They normally have staff who are casual—they come in for a few hours in the morning and again in the afternoon. Most of them obviously enjoy their job, but you could not say that it was a particularly lucrative job. Any administration that they do is largely done while the children are there or half an hour or so on either side. In most cases the additional work done by carers outside care hours is on an unpaid basis. It is just an extra contribution that they put in.
So to take away this operational subsidy for before and after school care is an extraordinary difficult proposition for them. I note that, despite the reversal of the child-care payments bill, I have seen nothing from the minister to indicate that, in fact, their operational subsidies will continue until it actually comes into play. It is a shame that the minister scooted out because I would be very pleased to hear from the minister or his representative—someone else has his brief—whether they will provide an undertaking that the operational subsidy for outside school hours care will continue until the child-care payments bill—I suppose it is an act now—comes into effect because many centres in that situation will have to close.
I have had personal contact with an outside hours centre just up the road from me at Currarong on the central coast of New South Wales. What they tell me, having done their sums and been responsible, is that, even with the changes in child-care assistance, they are required—to make ends meet—to increase their fees by 50 per cent. They said that a discussion that they had had with the parents indicates that many of them intend to leave as a result. They anticipate that, shortly after 27 
 April, they will be closing their doors. I am advised day in and day out by centres that I have contact with, both in person and by phone, that they are not a once-off, that there are many centres in this position.
The minister has obviously recognised that there is some sort of problem because he has announced that this sector will be provided with $8 million—according to the minister's press release—to try and put in place a new system of administration of child-care assistance. I will just remind you that this is a sector operating largely on a casual basis and, except for a very small group of people, has never had to operate or administer child-care assistance. They will have to administer child-care assistance for a very short period—we do not know how long because the government cannot tell us when the smart card will come into place, but it will be within 30 months—while at the same time losing an operational subsidy of $14 per child.
As I said earlier, the minister announced in his press release that some $8 million would be provided to assist in this changeover, but the industry itself—the before and after school centres—calculate that just to put in place this new system will cost them $12 million, which means that they are all out of pocket to start with, without dealing with the operational subsidy at all.
I do not have a great deal of time but I really believe that the government might be assisted in understanding the problems that do exist in the child-care sector by having a look at some of the submissions. I would really recommend that the minister read them if he can. I certainly am going to. I will just read you a few extracts. This is the comment of Robin Monro Miller from the National Out of School Hours Services Association:
What we are effectively doing is implementing all these changes at once on services which are primarily parent management and parents are struggling to find out what is happening. Through working with a variety of parent managements, I have heard quite a few incorrect versions of what is about to happen. I think we need that time in order to get everybody in line. Really, it is to give everybody a fair go and know about the changes so that services do not throw their arms up and say, `This is too hard; we will not survive,' and pack up 
 their bags and go home. We will lose services. They—
referring to the government—
need to take note of the fact that the sector is not highly organised and has not had the back-up support. They did not have the admin. people, they did not necessarily have trained staff and they do not have their own venues.
That is just a plea from that particular sector to have regard for their circumstances. I noticed that the government liberally quoted from a particular press release that it had received from Ian Weston of the Australian Confederation of Child Care, but I have to say that the confederation and all its members are not always as positive about the government's changes. I have been unable to obtain a copy of that letter.

There was an announcement made by the minister there would be a national child care advisory council. I am wondering which ought to come first. Should it be the advisory council that can actually talk about the traditional fee structure—

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-03-31,"—The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  will defer the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 because of the government's decision earlier this year to reverse some of the changes that it was designed to introduce. The Democrats support the government's decision today to delay streamlining the payment of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate until 1999. It is, of course, too early for us to sign off on the proposal to link this measure with the introduction of a smart card. Although it does sound like it could be a step in the right direction, we always with this government in particular want to see the small print. We also strongly support the government in their decision not to place an increased responsibility on parents in relation to estimating and reporting their use of child-care services and I, for one, am particularly pleased to see that, with these changes, the harsh criminal terms which were contained in the previous bill will no longer be applicable. I have to say that I found those particular measures to be incredibly objectionable. The thought that by some government action all of a sudden we were 
 going to make parents liable for prison terms seemed to me to be quite an appalling proposition.
It is heartening to see that at least in this instance the government has been willing to acknowledge that it got it wrong. It is also heartening to see that at least in this instance the government has been willing to reverse policies which would have had a negative impact on families, making life even harder for many who are already suffering the ill-effects of earlier policy decisions. Asking parents to take more responsibility for estimating and reporting their usage of child care would have been a big mistake. It would have been a big mistake simply because it fails to take into account the enormous pressure many families are already under. It fails to recognise that many families already have enormous difficulty just trying to juggle their existing work and family responsibilities. And it fails to recognise that for many families it is a huge challenge just trying to make ends meet and hold their family together.
This measure was one of the major issues raised with the Democrats prior to the Senate's consideration of the earlier bill, and it was one of the reasons we suggested that it should be examined by the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. That hearing was held and I believe we gathered from that some very significant evidence. We are pleased to see that, as a result of this committee hearing and subsequent representations, the government has finally seen the light. This is a positive outcome for Australian families.
The bill we are considering today contains the remaining changes which were originally contained in the earlier bill. These are: the 20-hour cap on child-care assistance for non-work related care; the long overdue planning system for private sector child-care places; and establishing immunisation requirements for child-care assistance eligibility. In the interest of not taking up too much of the Senate's time and recognising the enormous legislative load we have—which I have got to say is not because the Senate has blocked legislation but is because the government has failed to in any way get its legislative program in order, and I would be happy to 
 debate that point at any time—I am not going to go into any great detail on the nature of these changes. We have already debated these and it is on the record what the Democrats' position is. It is there in Hansard to be read, as a result of the debate we had last year.
As we did then, the Democrats will be supporting the first of these two measures. As I also did last time, I will also be leaving my colleague Senator Bartlett, for Meg Lees, our leader, to outline the position the Democrats will be taking in relation to the immunisation requirements.
Notwithstanding this, however, I want to take a moment to put on record the fact that the Democrats have been critical of the way this government has handled the whole area of child care. As I have said on other occasions, one of the problems is that it is not the Minister for Family Services who ought to be criticised, because I think both the former minister, Judi Moylan, and the current minister have been doing their very best to make the policy work. The problem is with the Treasurer, who has taken so much money out of this area that any policy would be almost bound to fail. The government needs to be condemned for a number of the changes that have already been introduced and the effects that these changes are now having on many families. And I want to put on the record, despite the exchanges in this place this afternoon during question time following a number of questions from the opposition to the government, despite the government's very poor defence of their record, that it is true that for many families things are getting worse.
Centres across the board, both private and community based—not simply community based centres, as the minister seemed to be suggesting but also private centres—are now reporting that they are operating at somewhere between 10 per cent and 15 per cent less than their capacity. This is following the previous experience when those same centres all had waiting lists. The problem is that many parents have had to make the very difficult decision to withdraw their children from formal child care. For many two-parent families, this has meant that one of them has 
 had to leave the work force, and in many cases this has seen the mother being forced to return to the home on a full-time basis. For many single parents, this has meant that they have been left with no alternative but to withdraw from the work force or from study altogether, simply because they can no longer afford the cost of having their children cared for. For others, this has meant finding alternative, less formal child-care arrangements, with grandparents and friends being asked more and more to care for children while their parents are at work or studying.
Child-care operators are now also really beginning to hurt as a result of dwindling numbers in child-care centres. Many of these centres are the very same centres which, as I said previously, prior to the introduction of the changes contained in the 1996 budget were subject to lengthy waiting lists. Now they have vacancies, and the extent of the vacancies is getting larger. Some centres have already been forced to close, with a number of others predicted to close within the next few months. I have got to say to you that in my own state of Queensland I have had the most desperate phone calls from people in the Sunshine Coast area, where a whole group of centres has got together and begged me to come and talk to them. I said to them that they really needed to talk to the government, but I will not repeat what they said to me when I told them that.
This government can no longer afford to ignore the damage which has been done to parents who have been forced to give up work or study simply because they can no longer afford the cost of child care. What this government needs to understand is that these families are really hurting. It is shameful to think that a government which so strongly speaks of its deeply held commitment to families can at the same time come up with policies which are making it increasingly difficult for the very families it claims to represent.
The Democrats fought very hard to prevent many of the changes which were announced in the 1996 budget from coming into effect. We voted against the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care 
 centres; the capping of child-care assistance at 50 hours per week per child; the abolition of the additional income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing a family's eligibility for child-care assistance; and freezing of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate for two years.
Unfortunately, the combined vote of the opposition parties was not enough to prevent these changes from coming into effect and these regressive reforms passed the Senate with the support of independent senators. I am sure that the government underestimated the effect these policies would have on Australian families. What is clear now, however, is that these policies are well and truly affecting families. This effect is a very negative one indeed.
The Democrats will continue to put pressure on the government to reverse its policy decisions in the area of child care. We can only hope, as with the measures the minister decided to reverse earlier in the year, the government will be willing to admit that in a number of these other areas it also has it wrong. The future of child care in this country depends on that change of heart. I think it will be at the government's peril if it chooses to ignore the plight of Australian families who can no longer access the child-care services they need.",SENATE,<title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1998-03-31,"—In rising to speak to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill, I am reminded of the pledge given by the coalition prior to the last election. The promise was that all parents would have fair and equitable access to affordable, flexible and high quality child-care options regardless of whether they were participating in the paid or unpaid work force.
In listening to government members in the Senate earlier today, including the embarrassing manner in which the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services (Senator Herron) avoided answering questions on this issue, it is quite clear that not only has the government walked away from this commitment but it never really understood what it meant in the first place.
No one sector of the community highlights the anti-social agenda of the Howard govern 
 ment more so than the child-care sector. The measures contained in this bill—which include a revamp of the payment arrangements for child-care assistance, payment of child-care assistance in arrears, limiting the number of new long day care places and changes to outside school hours care—all have one dramatic consequence: they all limit the work force options available to Australian women.
As a result of the massive $820 million taken out of the child-care sector over the past two coalition budgets, parents are having to reduce their work hours, leave work altogether or rely on neighbours, extended family or backyard operators for their child's care. It is now estimated Australian families are $25 per child per week worse off under the coalition.
A recent survey conducted by the Queensland Child Care Coalition revealed that 3,255 children have been removed from 244 services in Queensland in the past year. This is the same survey Minister Herron dismissed in question time today as having no relevance. Other data suggests that somewhere between 200,000 to 300,000 people have been discouraged from seeking employment because they could not find or afford child care. More than two-thirds of these are women.
Unfortunately, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not understand the dynamics of contemporary child-care policy. He is sadly out of touch with the practicalities of the system. Child-care assistance is a social policy measure which allows women to participate in the work force. Unnecessary and ill-conceived changes to its focus are causing widespread confusion and uncertainty for parents with children in care.
The reality of this bill is that it should never have had to be introduced into this parliament. This legislation is a result of a government which is making up its policy initiatives on the run. Following the passing of the Child Care Payments Act 1997, the government was inundated with complaints and representations from the sector about the impact this legislation would have if it started in April 1998 as planned. In January this year the government announced it had decided to defer the implementation of the new payment arrangements until new smartcard technology 
 is available—hence the need for this amendment bill. But this process would not have occurred if the coalition had consulted with the sector prior to announcing the initial changes.
As I said in my earlier contribution to the Child Care Payments Bill 1997, the bill introduces a number of new measures which have not been meaningfully considered by stakeholders. The consultation process has been, in a word, deplorable. The bill is a very complex one. While it may make things easier for the government, it certainly does not make things easier for the end users—parents and service providers.
Until questions arising out of these myriad of issues are resolved, it is farcical to say that there has been proper consultation as it cannot as yet be determined what the impact of some of these changes really means. Recent developments have proven my earlier comments correct. But, far from taking any satisfaction from the government's admission of error, I am saddened for the heartache and uncertainty the coalition has forced upon this sector.
As a result of this government's incompetence, service providers and parents have had to live with a major cloud over their arrangements for the past 18 months. A competent government would have consulted and negotiated with all stakeholders before announcing major administrative changes. But not this government.
As we have witnessed in the aged care sector with deferral of the implementation of the extra daily fee on four occasions, the Howard government has an appalling record on consultation. Apart from taking away the work force options of women and highlighting this government's inability to consult, this bill represents a major attack on the out of school hours care program. The Howard government has removed operational subsidies from out of school hours care—like the similar way it removed this assistance from community child-care centres in the 1996 budget. This action will result in the closure of services.
Just as galling is this government's obvious lack of knowledge about the role of out of school hours care within the child-care sector. 
 Many out of school hours care centres are operated by part-time and volunteer staff in non-permanent premises such as community and school halls. The administrative work is often completed by parents, and the service provides for the constantly shifting requirements of its users. For instance, a service may have a couple of hundred children on their records for 50 or 60 places. The operational subsidy is vital to coordinate such complex and under-resourced enterprises.
Rather than the operational subsidy going to the service, parents will now be paid child-care assistance, but the out of school hours service will have to calculate the amount each family will have to pay weekly. There is simply not the administrative infrastructure capability in these services to undertake such an assessment. As a consequence, many of these providers will give up and force the families who use the service to make other arrangements. Alternatively, providers will be forced to dramatically reduce overheads and increase their fees. This new administrative arrangement underlines the coalition's inability to understand the various needs of stakeholders within this sector. In this case, it is forcing a tight administrative maze on a part-time service which has been renowned for the flexibility it offers to its user groups.
But there are other areas of concern in this legislation. It provides a tighter targeting mechanism for eligibility for child-care assistance, which will effectively result in a saving to the government of $33 million in this financial year alone. It involves the cessation of indexing the child-care assistance fee ceiling and the child-care cash rebate ceilings at a saving of $31 million this financial year. The changes to new growth strategies for long day care centres will be a $25 million saving. Reforms in the area of school age care will be a $5 million saving, and paying child-care assistance in arrears will be a saving of $32 million.
All these changes are on top of the other massive reforms inflicted upon this sector by the Howard government over the past two years. They include removal of operational subsidies worth $100 million over four years from community based child-care centres, 
 reduction of child-care assistance for cut-offs for second and subsequent children and freezing child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate ceilings for two years, which has meant no indexation for the past two years. With all these massive cuts to the sector, it is hard not to argue that the government simply view child care and fee assistance as a luxury. They do not see how the increased financial demand on families of up to $25 per child per week adds a dangerous balancing act to most family budgets.
A recent discussion paper drafted by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association highlights just how delicate this balancing act is for most families. It found that family income earners are finding it difficult to make ends meet in a way that enables their family to enjoy a decent standard of living. It found a large number of working poor families in Australia who, in return for active work force participation, are only marginally better off than if they were on social security. Removal or reductions in child-care assistance and increases in provider fees as a result of the loss of operational subsidies will push some families into the working poor category and not only act as a disincentive for both parents to work but also increase the demand on Australia's social security system.
A further example of the situations that can arise as a result of the coalition's cuts to the sector was documented in today's Daily Telegraph Mirror. A mother of two children in child care, who just happens to be a Liberal Party staffer to the New South Wales opposition leader, Mr Collins, has sent a submission to the Senate's inquiry into child-care services detailing how cuts to the sector are costing the government lost tax revenue. Ms Catherine Cusak said she reduced her hours of work from five days per week to three days after her child-care fees rose by $93.55 per week last year. The reduction in her working hours reduced her family's income and saved the government $3,800 per year in child-care subsidies. But, as a result of the change in her work circumstances, Ms Cusak paid $11,000 per year less in income tax and, as no-one has been hired to fill her 
 job for the remaining two days of the week, the government is worse off by $7,200. Regrettably, Ms Cusak and thousands of women like her are also worse off financially and professionally as a consequence of these short-sighted arrangements.
With well over 850 submissions already received by the Senate inquiry into child-care services, I am certain the frustration of Ms Cusak's circumstances will be borne out many times over from other working mothers and families. There is probably no more important task facing families and the Australian community than to bring up our children in a balanced and decent environment. The child-care policies of the Howard government are exposing families and children to unnecessary risks as parents are being priced out of the sector.
Parents feel as though they can no longer afford quality care. I believe the representations we are getting from parents and providers in our electorate offices and the large number of submissions already received by the Senate inquiry are only the tip of the iceberg. The coalition attempt to make political mileage out of being pro-family. However, the erosion of the child-care sector is evidence that they are not interested in the concerns of hundreds of thousands of Australian families. It also proves they are not interested in women. The government, with these policies, are trying to force women back into the homes. We are going back 50 years in history to where women stay at home, have babies, cook the meals, do the washing, but do not dare think of ever having a career.
—Oh, come on, Brenda!
—No. With these policies the Howard government is forcing them back. I would like to know exactly what the women members on the government side think about this; I really would. You all sit over there, you push these policies and you never support women. But you make a great play of how many women you have in the government. All I can say, Senator Ferris, is shame on you and shame on all of those other women. As a result, I believe the parents of Australia will have the issue of child care upper most in their minds when they vote at the next election. ",SENATE,<title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I very strongly endorse the remarks by my colleague Senator Gibbs. Indeed, she has probably just given most of my speech. Firstly, the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  is an embarrassment to this government. This is not a bill to be pleased about. This is a bill that embarrasses the government. It is brought in here to correct an appalling mistake the government were about to make. That is what they admit; `Actually, we're not really ready to do this, so we have to introduce legislation to correct what we were proposing to do.' Rarely do governments sink to that level. You have got it so wrong that you are actually legislating to correct what you have already put in place. You have not spoken to the community. You have not spoken to the child-care operators. You have not spoken to the families using child care. You have not listened at all. The submissions to the Senate inquiry currently under way are a clear indication of the angst and concern out there. This bill is an embarrassment to the government.
Secondly, as my colleague has just said, it ought be a terrible embarrassment to the women of the Liberal Party who make such a big song and dance about how many of them are over there—`It just shows we're the party that is concerned about women.' I have congratulated the Liberal Party on the increased number of women they have. Every day I will stand up in this place and argue that all those women in the Liberal Party come into the Senate and the House of Representatives and vote for policies that are wrecking the lives of Australian families and particularly Australian women.
What are the women saying to you, Senator Ferris, or to any of your colleagues about child care? I am sure they are not ringing up and saying, `Isn't it exciting. I've had to drop out of the work force. Thank you very much for increasing the cost of child care.' If they are saying that to you, then you are getting some very strange messages. The women of Australia are saying, `What about these Liberal women who are putting up their hands each day with Mr Howard to make child care more expensive, to make it impossible for us 
 to afford the fees, to make it impossible for child-care centres to cope?' Something like 50 community based child-care centres have already closed as a direct result of your policies of removing operational subsidies. In most of those centres on average about 10 women work. You have directly contributed to 500 women being on the unemployment list.
But, worse than that, there are thousands of families who use child care. As my colleague Senator Gibbs has spelt out so well, in the survey from Queensland alone, thousands of children are no longer in child care. Thousands of women are giving up their working positions and retreating from the work force altogether or going to reduced hours. Today we heard from the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Herron, that that is a nonsense, that the ABS data shows there is no retreat of working women from the work force. I do not know whether you should ever doubt statistics, but he certainly has not read the submissions that have come to the Senate inquiry. He certainly has not spoken to the thousands and thousands of people who are writing to us and calling us about it.
Also in relation to this mean-spirited, miserable government, under your changes now introduced about assisting people with your privatised CES, if women are not on any benefit, they will have to pay to get assistance to look for further work. `Mean-spirited' is hardly the word for you. The women of Australia are saying clearly day by day in ever-increasing numbers and with louder and louder voices, `Mr Howard's government and all those Liberal women, we thank not one jot but indeed we blame. We judge them as not caring about us. It is a clear, coherent program—but not spelt out, like most things—to remove women from the work force.'
This will do a very interesting thing. At least 200,000 women are now discouraged workers out of the work force. But they are not counted in the unemployment benefit figures, because they have a partner or a husband who is working. They are not counted. They are discouraged workers and they are part of your government's policy to get 
 women out of the work force to close down some of the assistance that has been put in place for women, particularly in the child-care area. Let us wait and see what they say at the next election.
We do not have to wait as long as that. As Senator Gibbs has urged, we just have to read the submissions coming to the Senate inquiry. I would also like to put on record the points made by Catherine Cusak. This is hardly what you would call a Labor Party stoolie, if I can paraphrase the minister in his answers today. This is a Liberal Party staffer.
Ms Cusak, a former young Liberal president who works for Opposition Leader Peter Collins, has told the committee the $800 million savings from the child-care cuts have to be weighed against lost taxation revenue from working mothers. She has two children and, as a result of the increased fees—that is, as a direct result of your government's policies in the child-care area—her child-care fees have risen by $93.55 a week. She has had to sit down and make the relevant calculations. She has done so and has reduced her time at work. She no longer works full time and, as a result of her retreat from full-time work, she is paying $11,000 a year less in income tax. The result is that your government is over $7,000 worse off and her own family income is significantly reduced.
What kinds of policies do you think you are implementing if Liberal women want to say this on the public record? I believe Labor women—any sorts of women, for that matter—are telling the same sort of story. But, for the record, this message has a particular potency. This is hardly a Labor Party stoolie.
This piece of legislation seeks to implement the decision by deferring implementation of the Child Care Payments Act 1997. It amends the Child Care Act 1972 and the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 to allow the implementation of other decisions taken in the 1997 budget and reflected in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. These are, first of all, a limit on child-care assistance of 20 hours a week for non-work related care; secondly, the introduction of a planning system for long day care places and a limit on the number of new places approved in 1998 and 1999; and, thirdly, the 
 introduction of immunisation as a criterion for eligibility for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. The bill also facilitates the transfer of the payment of the current child-care assistance program to Centrelink in the interim period pending the commencement of payments under the Child Care Payments Act 1997.
To pick up some of those points, I have listened to a lot of twaffle in this place, but I heard today some absolute rhubarb which, in other places, would be called, frankly, dishonest—misinformation of the worst sort. You accused the Labor government of never having a planning system for long day care or any of the new places. It is, I suppose, dull and boring to try to argue these issues on facts, but the facts are that you are completely wrong in that misrepresentation.
The previous government had a planning program in place—and one is still in place—and that planning program covered all community based child-care centres, long day care centres, all family day care and all outside school hours care. Well before we went out of office we had published by region across the country areas of high need to assist private child-care operators to set their child-care centre where there was already a measured need for child care.
If we are talking about improving planning or trying to bring the private child-care centres more directly into line with that planning, let us say that. But let us not tell gross lies about the failure of a previous Labor government to have any planning system. It had a comprehensive planning system, and that system is indeed to be extended to cover the private centres.
It is amazing, to my mind, that private centre operators, most of whom would regard themselves as small businesses and hopefully making good decisions about where they would put their child-care centres, raced to put them in places with no regard to the demand for child care in those areas. That is why there is a gross oversupply of child-care places, mainly private, in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales: because the centre operators insisted on building them there.
On one visit to Queensland I found four child-care centres on each of the four corners of an intersection. It reminded me of the days when we could expect a petrol station on each of the four corners—
—Or a pub!
—I have never seen four hotels on four corners of an intersection, Senator, but we have certainly seen petrol stations on each of the four corners and we have seen what has happened to them. Over the years there has been a recognition that that is a stupid way to behave, and the petrol stations have seen that they could not all compete.
Child-care centres have taken a long time to make good business decisions about where they put their centres. I hope that, by increasing the planning system to include the privates more directly, we will get more coherence in the planning of child care. But please let us not have this nonsense that there was no planning there before. There was. It covered all the community based, the family day care and the outside school hours care places.
For that we saw under the previous government there was a significant distribution of child-care places to areas of need. Also true is that the community sector, the public sector, put child care in places that the private operators decided would not be very profitable: in the lower income areas, in rural and remote areas—places where the privates were not prepared to go to. So let us talk about the child-care debate based on facts, not rhubarb.
You are planning to introduce this planning system. I will be very interested to hear from the minister in the committee stage of this bill exactly how it will happen. It is still very difficult, even in questioning during estimates, to find out precisely what the process is and how it will be put in place. I do believe that will be very important. I also wonder what the effect of all these changes will be. We are already seeing, as I have said, the closure of 50 long day community based child-care centres, and any number of the private child-care operators are now saying they are feeling the pinch to the point of facing the prospect of closure.
The introduction of immunisation as a criterion for eligibility for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate is of concern. First of all, I would like to know how it will be implemented. Who will decide or on what evidence will families be able to confirm that their children have been immunised? Will immunisation require all possible immunisations?
I would certainly be appreciative of some detailed explanation of exactly how this will happen. If, for example, a family have not been eligible for maternity assistance and did not have to meet any criteria for evidence of immunisation for that payment and the first time they front the system will be with the prospect of needing child-care assistance, how will this confirmation of immunisation happen? Will they have to take, for example, a stamped or signed book, or something like that, to the director of the child-care centre, or will they indeed have to clear it through Centrelink? If they have passed some immunisation test for the payment of the maternity benefit, will that be sufficient for approval for child-care assistance eligibility?
I would also like the minister to provide for me information on exactly what immunisations will be required as part of the eligibility. Does it include measles or merely diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio? Does it include any of the hepatitis programs? Does it include mumps? What exactly are you saying are the immunisations that are needed?
Up to this point I have had some very concerning evidence brought to my attention. In the Centrelink documentation there has been a failure to provide to families information that says that if they are passionately opposed to immunisation or if they have a medical reason for not being able to proceed with immunisation, they are exempt under the requirements of this act and still eligible for child-care assistance.
I am not clear that Centrelink documentation in the area of child care is at fault here by omission, but it is clear—I understand that the minister's office has advised the department to get it right through Centrelink next time—that full information must be provided to families about the requirements of immuni 
 sation. Centrelink's documentation has been incorrect and at fault by leaving that piece of information out. From reading the documentation, there is clearly a sense of there being a compulsion for families to be immunised. We know that that is not the case after considerable debate in this place.
Let me make it clear, should anybody want to use these words against me, that I am one of those who supports immunisation. I would like to see families provide the immunisation available for children in this country as much as possible. I am also aware of considerable and serious evidence that there are concerns about immunisation. I am also aware that lots of families worry about it. The legislation we introduced in this place before took account of those concerns. It is a great pity that the Centrelink documentation failed to provide fulsome information in this area. It is almost like coercion by omission—`Let's leave out some of the facts and maybe families won't quite notice it.' That is very disappointing. If you are serious about assisting families, as in the question I raised before about the introduction of planning, let us tell the full truth. Let us assist families by telling them exactly what is the requirement and let us deal with families then, not by some kind of program of obfuscation.
The other important point that needs to be made in this legislation is that you have done well. You have done very well because you have alienated absolutely everybody in the child-care area—the families, the providers and every sector of child care. They are all absolutely up in arms about what you are planning to do. First you propose to do things by 1 January and then you defer it to April. You are deleting it for 30 months until the smartcard may be available.
The other important thing that you propose to do is to make the payments for child-care assistance directly to families. Surveys from 1994—I cannot be absolutely clear of the year, but prior to the Howard government coming into office—show that over 66 per cent of parents did not want the payments to them. They would prefer those payments went to the child-care centre so that was one thing they did not have to worry about. I urge the 
 government to rethink that proposal that the payments would go to families. They do not want it. It is only going to cause more agitation for them. I do believe it is just another example of how this government has not been listening.
There is insecurity, anxiety and confusion in child care now. This is a government that does not listen and does not care. You have your covert agenda to make sure that women are out of the work force and that lots of child-care centres are closed down. You have made sure that an industry that was well established and, indeed had got to the point where you boast what we established—that is, the accreditation program to see quality care in all long day care centres, something we should all be very pleased about—is being wound back in a very sad, unnecessary and destructive way.
Let us look at another article from the Daily Telegraph of Monday, 30 March 1998. `Forced to pull out of child care' is the heading of an article by Kate Hannon. Evidence from New South Wales, from the Penrith City Council—one of Australia's largest providers of child-care services—has found that low income families, families earning less than $27,000 a year, are hardest hit by child-care fee rises. The article talks about the impact on families of those increased fees. It found that 181 families had withdrawn their children altogether from the long day care and 183 families had cut the number of days their children attend care.
Centres have been forced to skimp on their spending on food and children's equipment, including toys. They have also cut staff by 10 per cent. Many centres had a smaller staff to children ratio, fewer qualified staff and were unable to give children as much individual attention as in the past. They are concerned about a direct reduction in quality care as a result of this government's policies. It is something to be very concerned about. We fought and struggled to get quality care to give parents an assurance. You have taken it away.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-31,"—I am only going to speak on one part of this legislation, but it is an important part 
 to many people. All of those who have been listening closely to this debate would know that my Democrat colleague from Queensland, Senator Woodley, covered all other issues relating to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  comprehensively and admirably.
As the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees, has stated in the past in relation to the Child Care Payments Act 1997, the Democrats support the general direction taken by the government to offer incentives to encourage parents to give serious consideration to vaccinating their children. We know from research that most parents who fail to vaccinate their children have done so not because they hold strong views against vaccination—although it certainly applies to some—but because they are not aware of the recommended vaccinations for their children or, simply, because they have not yet got around to it. Giving the Australian people an incentive to make sure they do give adequate thought to this issue is an important initiative.
Tying child-care payments to immunisation addresses this issue and should result in higher levels of vaccination amongst the vast majority of children whose parents do support immunisation. However, whilst supporting the general thrust of this legislation, the Democrats have been concerned to ensure that those parents who have a strong and genuine opposition to vaccination are not denied access to child-care subsidies because of their beliefs. Senator Lees has raised these concerns in relation to the Child Care Payments Act and the government responded to this concern previously by making provision for conscientious objectors in this act.
These provisions are reflected in this bill that we are debating this evening and include the requirement that parents visit a recognised immunisation provider to discuss with them the benefits and the risks of immunisation. While this may be a sensible requirement in many cases, the Democrats do have concerns that in some specific cases this provision may not be appropriate. For example, I have received—and other Democrat senators, and I imagine many other senators from other parties in this place, have received—many 
 representations from Christian Scientists who believe that this requirement goes against their religious beliefs. Christian Scientists feel that, for them, a visit to the doctor to talk about immunisation is not only against their beliefs but also unnecessary and a waste of time and public money.
In that circumstance, why should people have to sit around a doctor's surgery to talk about something when they know what they think about it, when it is a matter of faith and belief and not a matter of science or medical opinion? Why should they waste the doctor's time, why should everybody else have to wait longer in the doctor's surgery and why should we drain Medicare funding, et cetera, in that situation with people going through that charade simply to satisfy technical requirements of the act?
I have had personal representations on this including from people from my own state of Queensland. A letter I received just a week or so ago was from Mr Ronald Walker from the Christian Science Committee on Publication for Queensland, a representative of the Christian Science community in Queensland, specifically drawing my attention to this matter, something I had been aware of in a general sense before but certainly not in relation to the specifics of this issue. It has been of some enlightenment to me to become aware in a bit more detail of the beliefs and concerns of Christian Scientists. Certainly, Mr Walker and other Christian Scientists have indicated that they do wish this matter to be considered and wish that not just Christian Scientists but also the significant group of people that this relates to, who do choose to avail themselves of their civil right to refuse immunisation, due to their own personal beliefs, be properly accommodated in this government's legislation and ongoing policy.
Recognising the needs of specific groups in the community, whether they be minority groups or otherwise, and trying to ensure that those needs are addressed as part of the broad policy announcements and directions of government that apply to the whole community, is a principle that the Democrats do give a lot of attention to. Christian Scientists operate within a different modality of health 
 based on their religious beliefs. Their representatives, who have written to me and to other Democrat senators and have come to speak to Senator Lees and her staff, who have given a great deal of attention to this issue, have presented a carefully considered position and have done a great deal of research on this topic. In fact, they are probably better informed about immunisation than are most lay people.
Their objections stem from their religious beliefs rather than from a specific disagreement with the logic or the scientific validity of the medical research which supports universal immunisation. Therefore, no amount of evidence, scientific facts or discussions with the local GP, hospital intern or whomever, will convince them to immunise their children. In that circumstance, it seems unnecessary at a minimum to force people to go through this charade. They can in no way be considered equivalent to those parents who have not immunised their children due to ignorance, inconvenience, neglect or other reasons such as not having got around to it, and they should not be treated in the same way as those people under this legislation if at all possible. The Democrats believe it is possible and we believe that their needs should be addressed.
The Democrats believe that Christian Scientists have the right to have their specific situation acknowledged and to have more appropriate conditions attached to their application for conscientious objector status, rather than individually having to visit doctors to get certificates. The Democrats will not be moving amendments to this bill on this issue that I have raised in my short contribution this evening because we understand the mechanism is available within the bill as it stands.
Before we indicate our position on this specific aspect of the legislation, the Democrats do ask the minister, or his representative, in his concluding remarks this evening to give an indication on behalf of the government that they will use the powers vested in them under proposed section 12(h) of this bill to address the concerns that Senator Meg Lees has raised with Minister Wooldridge predominantly, and also with Minister Warwick Smith, the 
 Minister for Family Services, regarding the specific concerns of the Christian Scientists. We believe it is something that can be addressed and we hope the government will give a specific commitment to addressing those concerns in relation to this legislation that have been raised as part of this debate.",SENATE,<title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I rise to speak on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 . I must say that I agree with Senator Crowley when she says that this bill is an embarrassment to the government. It is incredible that the Minister for Family Services, Mr Warwick Smith, continues to self-delude on the issues of quality, access and range of choice in the area of child care in this country when he states:
We are concerned about quality child care for Australian families and access in an affordable way for families to ensure that they have a range of choices from family day care to after school hours care, and also from the community care sector and the private care sector.
What does the minister mean by `access in an affordable way' and `a range of choices' when $820 million has been cut by this government from child care? It is understandable that the minister is concerned about child care because the whole area is in a shambles.
What the minister means is that most families will pay for access to care regardless, because he knows that the overwhelming number of mums and dads of this country will not, where possible, compromise the care of their child. They will do everything in their power to ensure that their child or children get the best form of care, and they will simply pay the extra.
Such families who are able will deal with these cuts in the best way that it is possible for them to do so. They will not be happy with the substantial increase of dollars per week per child for community long day care or outside school ours care, the reduction in the child-care cash rebate for families earning more than $70,000 a year, or the restricted access to child-care assistance for non-work related care, but at least they will be able to continue to choose the level and quality of care. They will be able to exercise the so- 
 called range of choice, but it is now a lot more costly to retain that range of choice.
Now we move to another group of parents, for whom the increased cost of child care has made it unaffordable and for whom a mother, in most cases, is left with only two choices. The range of choice has now shrunk markedly to two options: such families take the risk and either opt for a reduction in quality of care or opt out of the work force and care for their child at home. The first choice is a choice for poorer quality of care; the second is not an exercise of choice but rather of necessity.
The first option will lead parents to seek those unregulated care providers—be they a friend, a grandparent or a provider who operates outside the system. With regard to the second option—some of my female colleagues have dwelt on this in detail, so I will not—it is a sad scenario to think that this government has caused women in particular, but not solely, to remain at home. For those mothers, or families, to do otherwise would compromise and prejudice the future of their child or children in other ways—the child's future education or, even more drastically, the health of such a child.
As the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, Ms Jenny Macklin, recently stated in the other place, women are becoming discouraged workers. It is estimated that about 200,000 women have been discouraged from seeking work because of the new cost regime of child care. As we know, what this bill does is postpone the date of the effect of changed methods of payment, made by a number of 1997 budget measures, to await the introduction of smart card technology. The timing of this postponement is no accident, with an upcoming election.
The government debacle regarding child care has not been as great a fiasco as that over aged care. But then it has always been a botched affair from the beginning. We had the initial announcement that parents could expect to be paid child-care assistance by Centrelink. This was to be implemented this year in January. But, subsequently, that was delayed until April this year. In January this year, though, all current arrangements were overturned with the announcement that we 
 need to wait for the introduction of the smartcard, hence this legislation.
I know from talking with the child-care industry in Tasmania that there was some scepticism over the announcement that the April changes could be efficiently made without there being a waste of money, particularly with the smartcard system being planned maybe for next year. I recall from discussions that there was also concern about exactly how much the subsidy had been reduced per hour for after school hours care and whether the new reduced rate would apply generally or only to new children coming into care.
Now concern reigns about the administration of the smartcard technology and the manner in which parents will be able to access their credits and whether individual carers will have machines or whether there will be a need for a central pay system. This general uncertainty has had a harmful effect on parents, on the public perception of Centrelink and last but not least on child-care providers, especially for a period that is recognised for the level of basic insecurity that has been experienced by members of the public. The whole confusing administrative environment has led to some extraordinary happenings which in turn, I believe it is fair to say, is leading to Centrelink losing its integrity as an organisation because this government lost any integrity it had in the administration of child care long ago when it failed to consult from the outset.",SENATE,<title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-03-31,"—I feel sorry for anybody who has been listening to this debate, considering the carping criticism that has come from the trio of Labor women on the other side. I want to stand up for the men. We have been given the impression that the only people involved in child care are women. Personally, I am happy to say that my wife and I have more children than the whole trio on the other side put together; we certainly have had more experience than any of the ladies over there. But all we have heard is this carping criticism.
It takes two to tango, and it is a matter of fact that men have an equal role to play in the care of their children—and if they do not take that responsibility, they should. I know that is one of the problems that has occurred in our society—that, in many cases, they have not taken that responsibility.
We seem to get the impression that child care provided by paid people is the best quality of care. I was distressed to hear Senator Denman say that care at home was poorer quality care. I hope I am not misreporting her, but that is what I heard: that care at home was poorer quality care. I find it unconscionable that such a statement should be made. To regard that quality child care, regardless of age, would be best carried out by professionals disregards the influence of the mother and the father.
The agenda put forward by the opposition disregards the desire of many mothers to care for their young children at home, if they can afford to do so—and I am sure that Senator Cooney would agree with me in that regard. Certainly, all the surveys that I have seen show that mothers, of preschool children in particular, would prefer to stay at home, if they could afford to do so. And, of course, there is accumulating evidence that early child care, sometimes independent of quality, is associated with risks of undesirable outcomes.
These amendments are designed to make child-care assistance easier for families. Feedback from the industry indicated that the arrangements envisaged under the Child Care Payments Act 1997 would be difficult for families and services during 1998. With this government being responsive to the needs of parents and service providers, the minister announced on 23 January that the commencement of payments under the Child Care Payments Act 1997 would be deferred, pending the introduction of smartcard technology. So, far be it from us having not listened to anybody, having not spoken to anybody and being out of touch, as was stated by Senator Crowley; that is completely untrue.
This Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill defers the implementation of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 and maintains the current familiar child-care system. Operators 
 and families are used to this system. While there are a number of changes to the system to be implemented from 27 April 1998, these reflect 1997 budget initiatives, including the 20-hour limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care, the new immunisation requirements and the planning controls for 1998-99. All of these measures were previously part of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 and were passed by the parliament late last year. Nothing of substance has changed.
Child care is an integral element of the government's strategy to promote the wellbeing of Australian families. The range of child-care reforms that were introduced in the 1996 and 1997 federal budgets focus on providing fair and reasonable access to funded care and address concerns about families' access to quality care, especially in rural and remote areas. The reforms are the result of extensive family research and consultations with both parents and the child-care industry.
The government is committed to providing support to assist parents to fulfil both their work and family responsibilities. The government maintains its commitment to child care. This year we have allocated $1,200,000 million to child care—an increase of 18 per cent since the last year in office of the former Labor government.
Much has been said about the impact of the government's change to outside school hours care funding. This change is not contained in this bill but, nevertheless, I would like to respond to some of the statements that have been made about it both in question time this afternoon and this evening.
The reforms will better target assistance within stand-alone outside school hours care services. Currently, most of the assistance is provided in the form of operational subsidies which allow the fees to be reduced for everybody, regardless of income. Under the new system, those most in need of government assistance will receive the most help—and surely nothing is more equitable than that.
Also, school children attending stand-alone outside school hours care services currently receive lower levels of assistance than do school children receiving after-school care from centre-based long day care services or 
 family day care schemes—and that is not equitable. So that has been approached by reforms which will make subsidies for schoolchildren more equitable, since they will not depend on where the children receive their care.
The government has been responsive to concerns raised by outside school hours care services about the administration of a proper child-care assistance system, and it has provided generous assistance to help services through the transition. The new and equitable school age child-care assistance will inject an additional $11 million over four years into school age care.
The government has already made $12.2 million restructuring assistance available to services to obtain business and marketing advice, purchase equipment or specialised assistance, and undertake minor capital works. Also, the government is providing another $8 million to assist outside school hours care services to make the transition to the new arrangements. Transitional support offered includes initial training and information sessions for all services and individual service-specific support during the transition period.
The department has set up a dedicated outside school hours care child-care assistance telephone help line and an in-person service visit and support system. The department will also provide transitional child-care assistance implementation grants to help services during the changeover to the new system. These grants will be equivalent to two months of operational subsidy and will assist services setting up accounting procedures, attending training and helping parents during the transition. The government is more than fulfilling its obligation to assist services to adjust.
Moving back to the bill and the real business of this chamber: care has been taken to ensure that administrative demands on services will be kept to a minimum. For the 20-hour measure, services will ask affected families in receipt of child-care assistance to sign a work test statement indicating that they meet the work study training test.
The bill and associated disallowable instruments impose the same limit on care, with the 
 same exemptions, as was approved by this chamber in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. Nothing of substance has changed. This bill introduces the immunisation requirement for both child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. These requirements are identical to those contained in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. All of the same exemptions will apply.
Families who want to claim an exemption will need to consult an immunisation provider. This is considered fair and reasonable. This bill introduces a much needed planning framework. It imposes a 7,000 place per year limit on new long day care places for 1998-99. It introduces procedures to be followed in imposing a sanction on an operator and safeguards in the form of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. All of this produces the same planned environment envisaged by the Child Care Payments Act 1997.
In addition, the government has also acknowledged the concerns of Christian Scientists referred to by Senator Bartlett. I would like to give an assurance to the senator and to Christian Scientists that the minister will use the powers vested in him under sections 12H and 39B directing that identified children of Christian Scientists who undertake counselling from a nominated person who is not a medical practitioner be exempted from the requirements to be immunised. This will save Christian Scientists from the requirement to receive information from a medical practitioner while still ensuring that the facts are put before every parent. This is consistent with the principle contained in the immunisation charter signed by the government and 23 medical and community organisations last week respecting people's beliefs and privacy.
I reject the statements by those opposite in criticism of the government. You would think that we had not taken into account advice that we have received predominantly from parents and from providers. We have taken that advice. I reject the philosophical base that has been put forward from those on the other side. As I have said in my earlier remarks, I commend the bill to the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-31,"—This is the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 , and the opposition will be supporting this legislation. I note for the record that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, in the House of Representatives successfully moved an amendment to this bill. The government accepted that amendment. By its acceptance of the proposals we put in the other place, I think there is now significant bilateral support for this legislation.
The bill is significant because it clearly arises as a direct result of the Asian economic and financial crisis. In short, if it were not for the Asian economic crisis, we would not be debating the bill here in this chamber tonight. The Asian crisis is already having a profound impact on the Australian economy, and it will almost certainly dominate economic developments, both in Australia and internationally, over at least the next year or two. The wider economic, political and social repercussions of this crisis will be felt for many years, not only in the Asian region in general but also in Australia. The bill provides an opportunity for us to debate some of those implications.
The particular purpose of the bill, however, is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to establish a framework for Australia to provide financial assistance to a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund. First, it makes specific—in effect retrospective—provision for appropriations to fulfil Australia's pledges of financial assistance already given to South Korea and Indonesia and made last year. These pledges involve currency swaps or loans of up to $US1 billion for both countries.
The bill does not specifically refer to the currency swap, also of $US1 billion, that has 
 already been negotiated through the Reserve Bank of Thailand. The bill is also significant because it provides a framework for future Australian financial assistance in support of IMF programs. Indeed, it not only provides a framework for future assistance but also provides what is, in effect, a standing appropriation to enable the government to supply this assistance from the consolidated revenue fund. While it is expected that such assistance will be required only in rare and exceptional circumstances, this legislation could eventually involve very significant future appropriations.
I would like to make it clear at the outset that the Labor opposition supports this bill, just as we supported the announcement by the government of Australia's participation in the IMF programs for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. The IMF sponsored adjustment programs of this kind are vital to restore confidence and to restore stability in countries experiencing financial crisis. It is important that Australia participates in these packages when they relate to countries in our region or with which we have strong economic links. We support the government's action in ensuring that Australia is the only country besides Japan to have participated in each of the IMF sponsored financial packages for our Asian neighbours. We agree with the proposal in this bill for an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF sponsored adjustment programs with, in effect, a standing appropriation, as I have said, to allow the Treasurer to make loans or currency swaps.
In this context it is important to note that the bill does not provide for grants but rather for loans that must be repaid in the future. The Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assistance if at least one other country or international organisation is participating, or has agreed to participate, in the IMF program. In addition, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at the request of the International Monetary Fund itself. The bill also requires that any agreement by the Treasurer on behalf of Australia must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of a suspension or premature termination of the fund program. Finally, the bill provides for assistance to the 
 Republic of Korea and the Republic of Indonesia, made under an agreement entered into before the announcement of the act, to be appropriated from the consolidated revenue fund, provided that the conditions of the bill are satisfied.
I have to say a deficiency in the original bill that came before the House of Representatives is that it did not impose any explicit disclosure or accountability requirements on the Treasurer. While extremely unlikely in practice, in principle the old bill would have allowed the Treasurer to commit very substantial amounts of public money to an IMF program without making any public statement of that assistance. More seriously, the bill would have allowed the Treasurer to commit substantial sums of taxpayers' money to an IMF program without having to justify his decision. The lack of explicit provisions requiring the Treasurer to publicly announce the size of any own loan or currency swap made under the bill and the reasons why such assistance is in Australia's national interest was indeed a very clear shortcoming.
Accordingly, the Labor opposition in the House moved an amendment to the bill which will require the Treasurer to issue a public statement detailing the terms of any currency swaps or loans to be provided in support of an IMF-sponsored program and to provide reasons why this assistance is in Australia's national interest. I am pleased to say that my advice is that that amendment was accepted. The opposition believes it to be an important one in terms of this government's accountability to the taxpayers of Australia as to what it does with their money.
There are three important general issues, however, thrown up by this legislation which need to be debated: the nature and course of the Asian economic crisis itself, the role of the International Monetary Fund and the international monetary system in resolving it and the domestic impact in Australia of that crisis. Let me start with the first of those, the Asian economic crisis. There is no doubt that the Asian economic and financial crisis of 1997-98 is an event of profound significance not only for the economic and political development of Asia but also for the evolu 
 tion of the international monetary system. The influential Vice-Minister for International Relations of the Japanese Ministry for Finance, Eisuke Sakakibara, has described the Asian crisis as the first crisis of global capitalism. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Dr Alan Greenspan, has said recently of the Asian crisis:
The architecture of the international financial system will need to be thoroughly reviewed and altered as necessary to fit the needs of the new global environment.
Given Australia's close proximity to Asia and our extensive economic links with the region, Australia has a vital national interest in the Asian economic crisis being resolved as rapidly as possible. Over the last eight months Australia has participated in IMF-sponsored economic assistance packages for, as I have said, Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. Australia's participation in these assistance programs has been very much in our national interest. We have had a vital stake in ensuring that our Asian trading partners have the capacity to stabilise their economies as quickly as possible in the face of a massive loss of international investor support. The IMF-sponsored adjustment packages for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia have been designed to stabilise the financial system in each of the countries and to provide foundations for eventual economic recovery. People do differ as to how long it will take. Most seem to suggest between three to five years.
With the benefit of hindsight, elements of the international response to the Asian crisis, including the adjustment packages proposed by the IMF and supported by Australia, will probably be seen to have been flawed in various ways. Indeed, legitimate concerns are already being raised about aspects of the IMF packages and the way in which they have been implemented, particularly with respect to Indonesia. Nevertheless, as Dr Alan Greenspan has pointed out, governments have had to respond to the Asian crisis within the structures and institutions that are in place today. To have delayed action in search of an ideal international response would have been to invite disaster. When the patient is bleeding to death you do not turn the ambulance away 
 in the hope that a better ambulance will show up in a couple of months time.
Fortunately, the IMF-sponsored programs have so far generally worked well in stabilising financial conditions in Korea and Thailand, although these economies will continue to experience very difficult economic conditions for some time yet. Developments in Indonesia have, however, been less encouraging. Nevertheless, in the case of Indonesia, participation in the IMF program has provided Australia with some inside leverage to seek appropriate modifications to the economic assistance package to take account of the special circumstances currently prevailing in that country.
I would also like to say a few words about the role of the IMF and the international monetary system. The opposition would not like our support for this bill to be seen as indicating that we are not alive to the vigorous international debate that is currently occurring about the modus operandi of the IMF and what Dr Alan Greenspan has dubbed the `architecture of the international monetary system'. While it is still early days yet, ad hoc IMF-sponsored assistance packages of the kind envisaged by this bill may be rendered redundant by new forms of international intervention, possibly through expanded IMF resources based on the new arrangements to borrow.
All of this does, of course, remain speculative. In the meantime, a vigorous debate on the IMF and its methods and the structure of the international monetary system is to be encouraged. However, while this debate is resolved it is important to recognise the need to work within the existing international monetary framework, in which the IMF plays a central role. At present, an IMF-sponsored assistance package is simply the best option for a country facing a collapse in international investor confidence. Our Asian neighbours have not been forced to accept IMF packages; they have turned to the IMF for support. And they have welcomed Australia's participation in these packages.
The opposition hopes that further loans or currency swaps will not need to be made under the provisions of this bill. However, if 
 the circumstances again arise where Australian participation in an IMF-sponsored economic adjustment program is justified in the national interest, this bill provides a framework for a quick and decisive response. Importantly, the amendments proposed and now adopted will ensure this response occurs within a transparent framework.
Australia's participation in the IMF packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea has been important. But it would be a grave mistake to see this participation as justifying a complacent domestic response to the Asian economic crisis. It is true that the precise impact of the Asian economic crisis on the Australian economy cannot be easily estimated in advance. There are, indeed, estimates as to its impact ranging from between ½ per cent being shaved off GDP to up to 1½ per cent being shaved off the growth rate for the Australian economy. When you consider that in the March quarter the market sat breathless in anticipation that the figures for growth for this economy would come in at four per cent or more and was disappointed to find that they came in at 3.6 per cent, the loss of ½ or even one or 1½ per cent in the growth figures for this economy would be disastrous for employment, business and consumer confidence. Indeed, it would also suggest in the current climate a devalued Australian dollar with imports being sucked in at a great rate, pressure on our current account; ergo, pressure on Australian interest rates. So it is not a small matter nor is it a matter from which we should in any way shrink.
In fact, it is no longer justifiable to speak of the impact of the Asian economic crisis in a future tense for it is already clear that the Asian economic crisis is starting to hit the Australian economy. We have seen several effects, the strongest of which have been a collapse in tourist numbers from the Asian countries most affected by the crisis and a dramatic decline in live cattle exports to Asia. We have seen, as well, falling world commodity prices in response to the Asian crisis—and, of course, most of the Australian exports are commodity based—and we have seen a reduced demand for an Australian university education by Asian students. Even 
 the car industry has been affected, with Mitsubishi Australia requiring 3,000 of its factory workers in Adelaide to take annual leave for two weeks next month to reduce the production levels of cars destined for the Asian market.
No government could ever completely insulate Australia from the Asian economic crisis—that, of course, is true—but we would have been better placed to confront it if economic growth in our own domestic economy were stronger than it is and especially if unemployment were significantly lower than it currently is. The government's rhetoric that it has `fireproofed' the Australian economy from the effects of the Asian crisis betrays a disturbing degree of complacency. This underlying complacency was betrayed by the Treasurer's claim last year that the effect of the Asian crisis on Australia would be `hardly measurable', even as private sector economists were revising their estimates of the impact. The government may claim to have fireproofed the economy but business and consumer confidence in Australia is quite brittle.
In recent weeks the leading business surveys, including the NAB and ACCI-Westpac ones, have shown a sharp fall in business confidence. Expectations for future exports have fallen particularly dramatically. This pessimism about the economy has spread to consumers with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey showing a dramatic 10 per cent fall in consumer confidence in the last month. With Treasury identifying a loss in confidence as a major threat to its growth forecasts, the downturn in confidence in recent months has profound implications for the Australian economy. Just last month, in a Senate estimates hearing, Treasury Deputy Secretary Borthwick conceded that:
. . . for economists, business confidence is always the uncertainty which often trips us up.
As I have said, the surveys of business confidence by ACCI-Westpac have shown sharp drops in that business confidence. I hope that these are not severe harbingers of economic misfortune for this economy in the future, but there does need to be a rethinking of government economic strategy to ensure that the 
 levels of business confidence are, in fact, bolstered and that consumer confidence holds up as well.
I know that in this chamber during question time we often hear the Assistant Treasurer, who now sits opposite me, boast about Australia's economic performance.
—Just the facts.
—`Just the facts,' you say by way of interjection, Assistant Treasurer. Let me say that those facts, in your words, are often very elastic facts.
But let me come straight to the point: the Australian economy is not growing at the levels that were forecast by your government in your last budget. They did not grow at the levels forecast by your government in its previous budget either. In two successive years you have undershot the levels of growth that you have forecast. We know that, for unemployment in this nation to fall, the Australian economy has to grow by in excess of four per cent. We know it is growing at 3.6 per cent. We know that you aimed for the economy to grow at 3.75 per cent in this budgetary year. In other words, not only did you not budget for unemployment to be reduced; you, in fact, budgeted for unemployment to increase, and your performance thus far through this budgetary year shows that you have succeeded in your goal because even your best bet is being undershot.
Business and consumer confidence is dependent on a buoyant economy and, with external demand falling because of the Asian currency crisis particularly affecting the countries of South-East Asia, one would hope that domestic economic demand would be improving. The tables on business confidence suggest that that is not, in fact, the case and the forecast for the economy is gloomier, therefore, than predicted. I hope I am wrong about those things. I do not want to see the economy struggle. I do not want to see people unemployed. But I do want to see a change in the urgency the government brings to its economic responsibilities in this country and, within the urgency it brings, for it to give a clear focus to tackling the problem of unemployment. 
Denying young Australians and unemployed Australians opportunities for careers and for a future is not a way to govern the country. The best asset this nation—which is a nation wealthy in physical attributes—has, however, is its people, and providing employment for them is a fundamental obligation of government. By the budgetary settings that you have imposed, you have not aimed to do that. The crisis that this bill refers to undercuts those goals further, and that does require a considerable level of new thinking in the government to start to get the economy moving out of the sluggish levels of performance it is now unfortunately experiencing.
I conclude—because the light is on and I have only one minute left—by saying we support this bill because we believe that Australia should be a good neighbour in its region. The countries that this bill provides cover for are important trading partners to us. Their economic health reflects on our economic wellbeing as well and we need to help them in their times of crisis. Ours is a country that lives in this region. When the foreign investors depart and return their funds back to the US or European economies, Australia will still be here and, as a neighbour, will be able to take advantage of the future growth rates that these countries will enjoy. That is the very important reason why this bill is supported. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-31,"—The Greens (WA) support the underlying aims of this bill, the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 . The objectives of this bill are to increase transparency, parliamentary scrutiny, and provide a framework for any provision of financial assistance to countries under IMF sponsored economic programs. It is perhaps a good aim a little late. Transparency and consistency are worthy goals and ones which the Greens (WA) have advocated in the past. It is clear that the previous ad hoc non-consultative approach was a poor one. The bill retrospectively provides for Australia's appropriations given to South Korea and Indonesia in 1997. It also provides a framework for financial assistance that Australia may pledge in support of IMF programs in the future. 
 Effectively, the bill provides a standing appropriation to permit the government to provide such assistance from the consolidated revenue fund.
The Greens (WA), however, have some major concerns, two in particular. The first relates to the adequacy of the mechanisms to increase transparency and scrutiny. The second relates to the purpose for which the money is lent and the implementation of the purpose by the IMF. The Greens (WA) are concerned that the mechanisms in this bill achieve the goals of transparency and scrutiny much too late. We appreciate that in circumstances of financial crisis it may be necessary to act swiftly. However, there are virtually no checks or criteria before the Treasurer can pledge Australia's financial support to the IMF programs. The only touchstones are, firstly, a request by the IMF, and, secondly, that one other country or organisation is also contributing—a great choice there.
If the first benchmark is regarded as any kind of safeguard, it must be assumed that the IMF is a competent body with good judgment. This is a highly questionable assumption. Most recently in relation to the Asian crisis, the competency of the IMF has been seriously challenged. Commentators from all political perspectives have said that the IMF have got it wrong and have failed to understand the local intricacies. Initially, it was criticised for its blinkered `if you've seen one economic crisis, you've seen them all' approach. The IMF assumed that old programs it had used in past monetary crises could be recycled. We know the ones: you get into the country, whether it is going well or not going well. The IMF says, `Cut spending, increase exports, deregulate your economy'—the same reply to every country they go into.
The IMF took this approach despite the fact that these old programs had caused untold damage to citizens in developing countries. They took this approach without even considering that the Asian crisis and the countries involved may be unique and require new and creative solutions. The IMF have also been heavily criticised for unilaterally usurping the sovereignty of recipient nations and imposing harsh and unjust social policies which are 
 resulting in enormous pain for everyday people. Of course, they do this at the time when the countries generally have the least power to argue back.
The programs and policies advocated by the IMF have gone much further than any mandate the IMF has and diminish the ability of governments to make fundamental decisions about policies in their own nation. The straitjacket of structural reforms and micro management goes way beyond an economic transformation but forces political and social transformation as well. Moreover, as I will elaborate in a moment, the IMF's policies rarely assist the majority of the citizens in recipient countries. If the IMF is blase about the national interest of the recipient country, it would be foolish to assume that the IMF's opinion could be regarded as some kind of safeguard, a sort of `trust us, we're the IMF'.
The second benchmark, that another nation or organisation is contributing, contains no assurance of anything. The logic is based on a strange notion that if another country has decided that contributing is in their national interest, it may naturally or somehow be in ours. There are no rational criteria, not even a cursory investigation of whether our national interest is promoted or whether the program is economically, morally and environmentally sound.
The Greens (WA) would like to see the government critically assessing these schemes they are signing us up for. We realise it is not always appropriate to go through a rigorous due diligence report of the pros and cons, but there should be some fundamental criteria the government considers before blithely promising Australia's financial assistance. The bill does require that there be a condition on any appropriation that allows Australia to demand accelerated repayment of the loan in the event that the program is suspended or terminated in advance. The Greens (WA) judge this to be an appropriate condition but do not regard it as a substitute for critical assessment prior to the loan.
Consequently, the Greens (WA) will be moving an amendment which is in a similar vein to the amendment we moved in relation to the International Monetary Agreement 
 Amendment Bill 1997. The amendment essentially seeks to ensure that the IMF's program that Australia is supporting is consistent with our other international commitments. The amendment seeks to use international instruments and principles to which Australia is committed as benchmarks to judge the program and the appropriation. If you think about it for a minute, here we have Australia signed up to a treaty. It is not unreasonable to suggest, even if it is a country to country treaty or a country to IMF treaty, that the other treaties Australia has signed also are taken into consideration in the way we put this contribution together.
The amendment injects benchmarks such as non-discrimination, social justice, democratic rights, sovereignty and environmental sustainability into the process. All of the transparency and assessment mechanisms come after the event—when it is all too late. The reporting in the budget, the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the national interest statement suggested by the opposition—all of these are positives for transparency and accountability. But, whatever the result of the scrutiny of the committee or the public, these mechanisms do not enable the money to be retracted or the government to demand accelerated repayment. All I can say is, where was the Labor government last year?
—We were in opposition last year.
—Yes. So, if the committee, for instance, discovers that the true effect of the IMF program was to benefit a few transnational companies and relegate the majority within the recipient country to poverty, Australia could not resile from its commitment. It would be locked into supporting an unjust and destructive program.
As I have alluded to before, this amendment is a reflection of the often dismal record of the IMF to truly assist the citizens of recipient countries. This is an ongoing debate since the fund began about who is really getting the benefits of IMF loans. Past and present IMF programs have resulted in lenders continually receiving a stream of money from southern nations, regardless of social and environment 
 al costs. The IMF places emphasis on export incomes rather than domestic production, and focuses on loan repayment rather than social programs. The IMF seems happy to impose rescue packages which cause hardship and internal disruption within countries while setting up a system of financial liberalisation which is likely to result in a phenomenally huge transfer of assets from domestic to foreign owners.
It seems like they are using the desperation of countries to put forward what is in fact a political choice; because, unlike a number of other people in this chamber, I actually think economics is a political decision. Political economy is not called political economy for no reason. We make political choices, and the choice of political theory is a political choice. In this particular case, it would seem the IMF is imposing their political choices on other countries when they have the least ability to resist.
The current IMF experience in Indonesia exemplifies the IMF's socially irresponsible method of handling crises. In the face of enormous devaluation of the rupiah, which will cause serious pain, the IMF is twisting the knife deeper and rubbing a truckload of salt into the wound. While the economy is crashing and estimated GDP loss for the year is climbing, the IMF is prescribing even tighter monetary policy and requiring Indonesia to restrict the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP.
How will Indonesia be able to meet these targets? How about taking up the IMF suggestion of eliminating the food subsidies? What a fabulous idea when Indonesia is faced with a grave food crisis and millions losing their jobs. The IMF clearly does not have the interest of everyday citizens anywhere in its thought processes. The IMF is ripping the food out of people's mouths while ripping any political decision-making power from the government.
We can see quite clearly what happens when governments are left with this no-win situation. It becomes quite convenient, in a desperation situation, to look at those people in their society who are doing relatively well—in this case, the Chinese merchants. It 
 is quite convenient for the governments of these countries which are put under this kind of pressure to allow that kind of scapegoat mentality to take over. This is certainly what is happening.
I believe the IMF's actions are completely politically insensitive. The IMF knows that it would never be viable for a government to impose such harsh measures themselves. Why does a short-term financial need give the IMF the right to strip a legitimate government of its ability to make decisions about provisions of services, health policy, wage levels and the like?
The Thailand experience is also a case which casts doubt on the benevolence of the IMF. On announcement of the rescue package, many analysts pointed to the fact that the beneficiaries were primarily the transnational banks and creditors. The fact that the ordinary Thai's life was not improved one iota was not considered to be of more than marginal importance. This is despite the fact that the debt which resulted in the need for rescue was generated by the consumption of the highest strata of Thai society. But, of course, it is the ordinary citizen who bears the full brunt.
There are a multitude of examples that question the value of IMF's programs. Australia should be assessing these programs that we are throwing millions of dollars at to ensure that they come up to the social, equitable, democratic and environmental standards that Australia supports. If they do not, Australia should be moving to give notice that this will not be a permanent agreement.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-31,"—I wish to make a few comments concerning the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 currently before us. A brief description of the purpose of the bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to establish a framework for Australia to provide financial assistance to a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund.
This purpose obviously gives rise to a number of issues: firstly, Australia's participation in IMF sponsored economic assistance packages for Thailand, Korea and the Repub 
 lic of Indonesia; secondly, the nature of the financial collapse in Thailand and South Korea; thirdly, the nature of the economic collapse in Indonesia as it develops and gets worse; and, fourthly, the role of the IMF in the circumstances that the above countries find themselves in at the current moment.
Turning briefly to point one, of Australia's participation in the economic assistance packages for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, in each case Australia has pledged loans or currency swaps of up to $1 billion. Our participation has been in our national interest, and it is important that that is said and goes on the record. It goes without saying, also, that stability in nations located in our region, in the economies of countries that are or will be major trading nations of this country in the foreseeable future, and in countries that are properly described as fully fledged parliamentary democracies is a good thing and to be encouraged and facilitated at nearly every opportunity.
It also goes without saying that these countries like Australia which do participate in loans or currency swaps have the ability to seek modification or change to IMF packages because of special circumstances that might apply in countries like Indonesia. Those special circumstances may have more impact on, or be of more concern to, Australia than a country like the United States simply because of their locality in this area and the immediate impact if Indonesia should go into a dire economic recession.
Issues like drought, starvation, severe social dislocation, rioting, internal upheaval, unemployment and loss of life savings for what is commonly described as the emerging middle classes are all factors on the horizon for the Republic of Indonesia. Their impact could be horrendous both for relevant individuals in those countries and nearby neighbours like Australia. Hence, any opportunity to point out, stress or demonstrate to the United States and to the IMF the possible consequences of inappropriate economic measures is a special circumstance which this country needs to take advantage of. In this context, the intent of the bill is worthy of support.
The bill provides an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF-spon 
 sored economic adjustment programs. The bill essentially provides for five things: firstly, a standing appropriation to allow the Treasurer to make loans or currency swaps to a country that is participating in an IMF-sponsored economic adjustment program; secondly, the Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assistance if at least one other country or international organisation is also participating in that arrangement; thirdly, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at IMF request; fourthly, any agreement by the Treasurer must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of the suspension or premature termination of the fund program; fifthly and finally, the bill provides for ratification taken in respect of assistance offered latterly to South Korea and Indonesia. Having made these rather technical contributions, I want to pass on a few observations on what has become known as the Asian financial crisis and the appropriate role for the IMF to pursue as this crisis develops over time.
In this context it is proper to acknowledge my reference to three articles. The first is by Wade and Veneroso entitled `Asian crisis: the high debt model versus Wall Street—Treasury—IMF Complex', as yet unpublished but available on the Internet. The second is an article by Lester Thurow called `Asia: the collapse and the cure' was published in the New York Review on 6 January this year. The third is an article by Martin Feldstein, Professor of Economics at Harvard University and President of the National Bureau of Economic Research, entitled `Refocusing the IMF', published in the Foreign Affairs Journal of March-April 1998. All writers are very senior and respected economists in their field. They are longstanding public commentators on finance and economic matters. They are published authors with longstanding interest in developmental economics, Asia and the variants of finance and differing models of capitalism that have developed in the last 50 years, and they are all senior professors at elite universities such as Harvard, MIT and Princeton. 
Wade and Veneroso develop an interesting thesis. They argue that the debt crisis in Asia is now a fully fledged development crisis. 
 They point out that South-East Asia, particularly East Asia, has been a region of great economic success over the last 30 years and that living standards have risen at high levels over many years. They stress that at risk are the living standards and lifestyles of millions of people who, as I said earlier, have entered the middle classes in those countries and obviously would seek to retain that status. They point out that Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia are all heading down the path to significant depression with all the consequences that flow from that. They ask: what are the features of this Asian financial crisis? And they point out that most, if not all, of the countries in East Asia and South-East Asia have a number of features. Obviously all of the features do not apply to all countries but, if you plot them, most of the features apply at this time to most countries.
Firstly, they say that in nearly all of those countries most debt is private debt and not government debt. Secondly, they say there is low inflation, budget surpluses or very small deficits which have been under control for many years. Thirdly, they say that nearly all of the countries have stable or rising foreign exchange reserves. They point out that the region as a whole has been, and is, growing fast, that it has a quarter of world output, half of world growth in this decade of the 1990s and, in the last seven years, over two-thirds of capital spending around the world. They point out that the IMF solution is relatively simple and is based upon models developed in many countries that needed assistance in recent years—most recently the Mexican crisis in the early 1990s. The solution which the IMF seeks to impose on South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia in the forthcoming months has two threads. The two threads are, firstly, domestic austerity—the aim being to restore the capacity of those countries to repay foreign debt—and, secondly, to seek radical institutional reforms, including further financial liberalisation, essentially freeing up the product, labour and capital markets in each of those countries.
They then conclude that the crisis that has developed is essentially one of a lack of liquidity—or illiquidity—more than one of 
 insolvency of firms in each of those countries. They say this crisis has occurred because of excessive financial deregulation in allowing banks and firms to borrow abroad without either government control, coordination, supervision or monitoring once those funds have been borrowed. As well as that, they point out laxness or slackness at government level in each of those countries. International banks have largely been unregulated. They have been very happy to provide Asian corporations with large amounts of short-term unhedged dollar loans. The consequences of both of those factors coming together is that, once any company or corporation is pressed to repay loans short term and is unable to do so, others also seek to call in loans and the crisis builds, and builds very quickly.
So they conclude that the immediate goal is very simple. In terms of the financial markets, provision of capital from international banks and the guarantees from international organisations via the US is simply to restore confidence in international capital markets that existing debts, existing loans and future loans will be repaid as their original terms allowed. They say this requires overcoming collective action problems in which no lender wants to re-finance what others will not and hence suffer a loss. In the short term, they say that demand and liquidity must be increased, not reduced.
Thurow, in his article, `Asia: the collapse and the cure' makes a number of points about the current problem, likely future problems and what the role of the IMF should be. Thurow argues a number of points. Firstly, he says that the IMF and the major world economies must not allow panic to continue to be almost the sole and dominant theme in financial markets and economic considerations in Asia. Collapses like the current one in Asia are part of the global economy and will continue to be part of economies as domestic economies become internationalised and globalised. He says that a steady response is required, not continued panic that will lead to a continued lack of confidence in the Asian markets and a further run on their currencies.
Secondly, he says that the primary problem arising from the panic is a lack of liquidity. 
 In such a crisis, normal business practice is forgotten. Short-term loans are not renewed when they normally would be. Suppliers demand up-front cash payment when they would usually wait 90 days. Companies that cannot self-finance themselves maintain repayments out of cashflow and go broke for no good reason.
Thirdly, he says that the major problem with the IMF approach has been its nation by nation response rather than the required regional response. Its commitment to restoring national austerity is inappropriate when its measures must apply to many countries at one time. The impact of that combined approach is to cut worldwide aggregate demand, as was mentioned in passing by Senator Cook—its effect in a country like Australia. He says in particular that the IMF has not clearly understood the role of increased Chinese exports on the rest of the South-East Asian region.
Additionally, the IMF has provided a very orthodox approach, as it did with the Mexican crisis. It must be said that, with hindsight, its approach in that crisis was correct. This approach, however, does not recognise that many of the South-East Asian economies have had, do have and will continue to have very high savings levels. For example, South Korea has a 40 per cent national savings rate. Mexico, on the other hand, had appallingly low levels of national savings.
Fourthly, Thurow stresses that the IMF also needs to recognise that each nation will attempt to solve its problem by increasing exports. The natural result of that will be increased competition, which will lead over time to a devaluation of national currencies which could continue to spiral and create further continuing competitive devaluations. This of course was a major contributor to the Great Depression in the 1930s. He says that the IMF should be the agency through which procedures to certify the accounting of government and large companies are established, speed up the process of the Asian transition to an equity based financial system rather than a debt financing system, and assist Asian nations to develop their growth strategy on a domestic basis.
He concludes that the IMF must focus on the current crisis and the particular problems it presents rather than simply relying on the old orthodox methods of solving economic problems. Without this type of approach, the Asian crisis will not be resolved and their economies restructured to a satisfactory level.
Martin Feldstein wrote an article entitled `Refocusing the IMF'. As I said earlier, he is a Professor of Economics at Harvard University, President of the National Bureau of Economic Research and chief adviser to the Department of State in the US. His publication in the Foreign Affairs Journal can be interpreted as an emerging different focus within the United States government on the way the crisis in Asia should be handled.
He argues a number of points. Firstly, the IMF has recently adopted a policy of imposing structural and institutional reforms rather than focusing on balance of payment problems. This has the potential, he says, to create further long-term problems. Secondly, it is important for the IMF to recognise the difference between a lack of liquidity and company insolvency—a recurring theme in all of these articles. This requires two different approaches, certainly in the immediate future. The problem of confusing insolvency with liquidity is that businesses that should be able to finance their debt in the long term end up closing down and making workers redundant because of IMF policies that are inappropriate at that time and for that particular cause. The IMF has gone beyond the key areas of concern, such as large current account deficits. (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-31,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise this evening to acknowledge the announcement today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the Chief Justice 
 of New South Wales, Murray Gleeson, will succeed Sir Gerard Brennan as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia in May this year. In announcing the appointment, the Prime Minister described Justice Gleeson as a person held in the highest regard for his advocacy skills. The Prime Minister said:
I am sure Mr Justice Gleeson will serve as Chief Justice with great distinction. His experience, skill and superb legal abilities admirably fit him for the task.
However appropriate these words are, they convey little of Murray Gleeson the man, who has been such a feature of the legal landscape and legal profession in New South Wales for the past 30 years. My own professional contact with Murray began when he was a young and promising barrister lecturing law students at Sydney University law school, me included, on company law that some 20 years later is still in the process of being simplified.
I had the good fortune to be junior counsel to Murray Gleeson just prior to his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in an important appellate case, Norwest Beef against Peninsula Navigation Company. In trying to pinpoint the essence of Justice Gleeson's legal brilliance, I believe it is his ability to identify the issues in a case with precision and to develop an attractive legal argument out of the most unpromising case.
Justice Gleeson's use of metaphor and his ability to excite the interest of the most uninterested judge was legendary. One such case involved a collision between two vessels on Sydney Harbour, where one vessel ran tours and afternoon teas while the other, a trawler and Justice Gleeson's client, was engaged in the more serious business of carrying cargo destined for overseas ports. The three judges of appeal seemed uninterested until Justice Gleeson opened his case. `Your Honours,' he said, `my client's vessel was navigating its way up the harbour when it was run into by a restaurant.' There was instant attention from the bench. He was the master of economical understatement, always accompanied by sardonic wit that fitted him well for his nickname of `Smiler'.
Murray Gleeson was the ultimate tactician in court. In fact, I am reminded of what his colleague Justice Roddy Meagher QC is reputed to have said of him in the mid-1980s:
When one visits Gleeson, one passes fishponds wherein piranhas glide between the bones of inefficient solicitors and discarded jurors and arrives eventually at a grey house and ultimately the baleful presence himself.
Murray Gleeson will be right at home in the High Court, as much of his work at the bar brought him there primarily in the areas of equity, commercial and constitutional law.
Murray Gleeson was perhaps one of the finest advocates since Sir Garfield Barwick when he made the move from Leader of the Bar in New South Wales to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1988. During a time of great pressure on the courts in New South Wales he has struggled to reconcile the need for change with maintaining the values that have underpinned the administration of justice since the courts' inception. Although it is a futile pastime to try to predict the way in which High Court judges will decide matters, I venture to suggest that Chief Justice Gleeson will continue to find that balance between orthodoxy and pragmatism that has distinguished his work thus far.
Murray Gleeson is a great believer in the traditional role of the court and has wondered publicly about the High Court's modern reputation for radical decisions. In an article last year he said one reason for this could be the increasing use of litigation to achieve political and social aims and:
We have long been accustomed to the use of litigation as a weapon in corporate and commercial rivalry, but we are seeing an upsurge in what might be described as the politically and socially aggressive use of litigation.
Because of his great belief in and commitment to the courts and the judicial system, he is constantly monitoring developments in these areas. In an earlier article he raised the issue in which the increasing demand for the courts to tailor general rules to individual cases might undermine their legitimacy. He pondered that individualised justice could all too easily shade into quasi-legislation.
No judge has, and no wise judge aspires to, political legitimacy— 

he said—
Judges are unelected and, from most points of view, relatively unaccountable. Their independence and unaccountability are appropriate to the judicial role, but they are inappropriate to a quasi-legislative one.
He is concerned at the role of the media in the law. In his Earle Page memorial oration at Parliament House last year he reaffirmed the legal values and restated the importance of judicial independence, the separation of powers and the rule of law. But to these principles he added some thoughts on the modern realities, which include the difficulties judges face in administering justice:
. . . a context of saturation media coverage and highly politicised concern about law and order issues.
Night after night they—
the people—
see on their TV screens victims or relatives of violent crime, telling their stories and being asked whether they are satisfied with the sentences imposed on convicted offenders.
Talkback radio programs are filled with people expressing feelings of insecurity and demanding ever-increasing severity of penalties.
To all of this, politicians respond by competing with one another to be seen to be tough on crime.
As Justice Gleeson pointed out, judges cannot prevent crime; its causes lie in the social and economic conditions of the time.
Justice Gleeson also has strong views on the adversarial system of justice. Again, in his Earle Page memorial oration he said people tended to overlook the adversarial nature of our whole society.
Why should conflict and distrust be regarded as the natural order of things—
he asked—
It does not assist the people of NSW for the Parliament, the executive and the judiciary to regard each other as adversaries.
Justice Gleeson will bring to the High Court a distinctive intellect and an intellectual rigour that will see High Court decisions continue to be cited in common law countries. He may also be able to achieve what many have been unable to do successfully in the past: explain to the general public what it is the High Court does and why its role is so important. He 
 went a long way to achieving this in the New South Wales Supreme Court with the appointment of a public information  officer. A similar role for the High Court should not be ruled out.
The people of Australia will be well served by a Chief Justice of such calibre. I welcome his appointment and congratulate him on it. I also wish Justice Gleeson, his charming wife, Robyn, and their family well for the arduous task that will be ahead of them.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>High Court of Australia: Chief Justice</title>,Adjournment,24,1,speech
