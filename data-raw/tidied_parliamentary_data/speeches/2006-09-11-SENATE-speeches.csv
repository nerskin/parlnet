"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-11,"—by leave—On 7 September in question time Senator Ray asked me a question which said in part:
Why are young Australian service men and women risking their lives in Afghanistan to protect a government that ignores poppy cultivation, which in turn has the effect of allowing heroin to be sent to Australia with the resultant loss of young Australian lives?
In my response I said in part that I totally rejected the proposition that ADF personnel are protecting opium growers and drug suppliers. In saying that, I believe I was quite reasonably following the assumption behind the senator’s question and on rereading Hansard I still believe that to be the case. I disagree with Senator Ray’s statement in taking note when he said, ‘My question was fairly explicit.’ I was responding to a serious question with a serious answer. I make it clear, however, that I now fully accept Senator Ray’s assurances that he did not intend his question to have the meaning it did. I also make clear that I did not intend any offence to Senator Ray and I withdraw any that was taken. However, I reiterate the point that I totally reject any connection between heroin illicitly brought into Australia and the role of the ADF in Afghanistan.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Afghanistan Opium Trade</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,1,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I rise to speak on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 at a time when Australians are more concerned than ever about record high petrol prices. Reform of the petrol retail industry, including the repeal of the two acts dealt with in this bill, has never been more important. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 are outdated and serve no useful purpose in today’s petrol retail industry. Well over 50 per cent of the industry by volume of sales is not covered by these acts, because of the inclusion of the supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths. The rules for market participants are inconsistent and unfair. That is bad news for the industry and it is certainly bad news for consumers.
The Oilcode, which will be introduced as a mandatory industry code under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974, will bring the whole industry into a common regulatory regime with better protections for market participants and better protections for consumers. The Oilcode will improve the protections available to commissioned agents and independent operators, who currently do not have the protections available to franchisees. Both franchisees and commissioned agents will also have access to a low-cost dispute resolution scheme for the first time. Labor’s view is that section 46 amendments to the Trade Practices Act are necessary to address outstanding concerns about the potential for abuse of market power, and I call on the government to bring these forward as a matter of urgency.
Nevertheless, the introduction of the Oilcode to cover the entire petrol retail sector will be an improvement over the existing situation where more than 50 per cent of the industry by volume is not regulated at all. Petrol retail reform is a good step forward to give consumers more confidence that the petrol prices they are paying are as fair and competitive as we can make them.
But reform has been a long time coming. Petrol retail reform has been government policy since 1996. In 1998 Labor said it would support petrol retail reform as long as an Oilcode was agreed. But it has taken this government another eight years to get to that point. As in so many other policy areas, reform under the Howard-Costello government has stagnated for 10 long years. This government simply cannot keep up with the changes that are necessary to encourage investment and maintain competitive markets and affordable prices in petrol, in electricity, in transport and in telecommunications.
This Howard-Costello government has failed completely to keep the reform momentum of the Hawke-Keating era going and we are starting to pay the price: in labour shortages, erosion of our skills base, choked infrastructure, inflation pressures, productivity stagnation and higher interest rates. And, most worrying of all, this government’s answer to everything is to spend, spend, spend, and that solution has hit a brick wall. The budget is no longer sustainable. The chickens are coming home to roost. Interest rates are rising. Petrol prices have been going through the roof. It is said that there will be some short-term relief for motorists because of the current reduction in petrol prices but experts are telling us not to expect that to continue. Wages for the already struggling are under pressure because of this government’s extreme industrial relations changes. Tax cuts have been more than swallowed up. Foreign debt is through the roof.
The Prime Minister and Mr Costello will not be able to spin their way out of this one. They tried cutting petrol excise back in 2001. They have used tax cuts, family payments, baby bonuses and any number of other handouts to buy off the electorate since then, but eventually the coffers will run dry. Now they have no options left on petrol prices. Petrol retail reform has taken them 10 long years. Excise cuts are no longer an option because we cannot afford them. And this government still have done nothing to address the real issue: our dependence on foreign oil from unstable parts of the world such as the Middle East.
It is obvious to everyone except this government that, if we do not have home-grown fuel industries, Australia will always be hostage to foreign oil. That is the key, not short-term fixes but a national transport fuel policy that guarantees supplies for the long term and gives Australia options to deal with global fuel supply and price emergencies—because that is what it is really about: supply and demand. When supplies are short or demand is high—or both, as is the case now—prices go up. The absolutely ironclad rule is that prices go up. It is only with home-grown fuel industries that Australia can have policy options available to it to ensure that the wheels continue to turn for Australian consumers and Australian industries to ensure that Australia can afford fuel. That is where this government has been seriously remiss.
Federal Labor has always supported the oil and gas industries and, indeed, the alternative fuel industry. They are strategically important to Australia, and I remind the Senate that Labor supported the proposal to extend the effective excise-free period for biofuels and LPG by three years, until 2011, and supported legislation to introduce mandatory cleaner fuels standards that should benefit environmentally friendly fuels. However, while Labor supported this approach, I must point out that the overwhelming reason for that was to provide some level of certainty for the alternative fuel industry and for the refining industry.
Historically, of course, it was the Keating government which introduced an 18c-a-litre production bounty for ethanol, in the 1993-94 budget, in addition to the zero excise rating for that product. The Howard government abolished the bounty scheme one year early, in the 1996-97 budget, and has consistently undermined the industry by changing the playing field on a regular basis over the last nine years. In the last parliament alone, the Howard government changed its mind three times on the excise regime, not only for ethanol but also for LPG. Despite the Treasurer’s May 2002 view that applying an excise to ethanol and LPG was a bad idea, he announced in the 2003 budget that he would do just that. He announced that biofuels and LPG would be subject to an excise from July 2008. In December 2003, he changed his mind again, announcing new excise regimes to apply from July 2011.
Between May and December 2003 the LPG industry was in turmoil, and many of the small business operators involved in LPG conversion and maintenance suffered serious business downturns due to the uncertainty about the excise regime. Now, when the government announces a subsidy, we are seeing that problem play out with massive shortages in the supply of fitting capacity. Of course, the biofuels industry also suffered during this period, with no certainty for new investors in the industry. It has taken some time for both of these industries to recover and it will be some time before the LPG conversion industry has the capacity to meet the rush of demand—which, the industry notes, might have been addressed had it been consulted about the government’s plans for the subsidy that was most recently announced.
We also have to have regard to the problem being exacerbated by record high petrol prices. This means that consumers are more willing to set aside their concerns about fuel tax uncertainty than they would otherwise have been and that biofuels are now more price attractive to refiners and marketers. In fact, let me say at this point that Caltex is to be commended for its announcement about discounting all E10 petrol by 3c a litre.
The history of the Howard government’s double backflips on alternative fuels is in stark contrast to the stability Labor provided throughout its 13 years in office, when it maintained the LPG excise exemption introduced in 1979 for fuel security reasons. The other stark contrast is between just how interested in fuel security the Prime Minister was before he was Prime Minister, in 1979, and his complete lack of interest today as Prime Minister when fuel security has never been so important and petrol prices have historically never been so high.
As Mr Martin Ferguson, our shadow minister for resources, has said before, this government treats tax cuts as ‘go away’ money for motorists worried about petrol prices. Let me remind the house of some other facts I have raised before and indeed that Mr Ferguson has raised before many times in the other place. The fact is that, without developing large-scale alternative fuel industries in Australia, we will increasingly be hostage to supplies from the Middle East, west Africa and Russia. I do not need to spell out the implications of that for energy security. Australians around the kitchen table today want to know that their governments and the companies with stewardship of their resources have a plan to secure their energy supplies for the future at affordable prices. But there is no plan and they are far from ‘relaxed and comfortable’ about that.
Creating the right fiscal and regulatory regime to convert our natural gas and coal to clean diesel, as well as new industry options and a new fuel supply source for Australia, is just not on this Prime Minister’s agenda. He was thinking about energy security in 1979, but it is not on his radar in 2006, when it has never been so important. Frankly, the government’s most recent announcement was poll driven, not national interest driven. Unlike other alternative fuels, the Prime Minister has done nothing to provide any industry framework to encourage the establishment of industries in Australia to convert our vast coal and gas resources to clean diesel. The Labor Party has always been a great supporter of both gas to liquids and coal to liquids, which of course are integral to the commercialisation of clean coal technology for power generation.
I recall that former Prime Minister Paul Keating, as former resources minister, was a great advocate of gas and coal to liquids technologies more than 20 years ago. So were my colleagues, Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow resources minister in the last parliament, and Martin Ferguson, the shadow resource minister in this parliament. Establishing new nation-building industries is not easy and, more than anything, it requires sustained leadership and focus at the national level to make it happen.
Unfortunately, the Howard government has waxed and waned on both coal to liquids and gas to liquids. Once again, let me remind the Senate that it is now almost five years since Senator Minchin, the then minister for resources, appointed a gas to liquids task force to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a gas to liquids industry in Australia. Five years later, no action has been taken other than the most recent announcement to think about it again. Australia’s reliance on imported oil and fuel is increasing and, while the liquefied natural gas market is booming, it remains a tough job to get new gas projects off the ground.
My colleague the member for Hunter once said that in the Prime Minister’s Australia it is easier to get gas to Shanghai than to Sydney. The Prime Minister is happy to dig it up, ship it out and look after Japan’s, China’s and the United States’ energy security, but this government has no plan for Australia’s security—no domestic gas strategy for our future and no transport fuels strategy either. When the wells run dry, the Prime Minister will still be hoping for a miracle, still hoping that he will be able to spend his way out of trouble with the electorate. Prime Minister, you need an industry policy, a resources policy and an energy policy, and those policies have to give us large-scale options to reduce our reliance on foreign oil if the Strait of Hormuz is closed, the Alaskan pipeline has to be fully shut down, war escalates in the Middle East or civil unrest shuts down west African production.
The Prime Minister knows that gas to liquids is Australia’s best option today. His own gas to liquids task force noted that, while Australia can simply wait for the market to provide an incentive for a gas to liquids industry, once gas supply infrastructure is in place and investment is sunk into countries where taxation and infrastructure incentives are on offer today, those countries will serve as investment hubs for expansion for many years to come—and that is exactly what is happening in Qatar.
The implication of the task force was that Australia’s remote gas fields could be left stranded from markets for even longer because, by and large, it would be cheaper to expand existing projects than build new ones here. I am sure this is a concept Australia’s LNG industry already fully understands. The task force highlighted the potential significance of a gas to liquids industry to Australia’s economy, saying it could underwrite offshore gas supply infrastructure to bring forward the possibility of major new domestic gas pipelines to connect the national market, increase domestic gas competition and energise gas exploration. The task force said:
These benefits would be of national strategic significance to Australia ...
It went on to say:
The cost of any government intervention must be considered against the potential benefits.
The potential benefits go beyond unlocking new resource wealth and creating new industry, more jobs and more exports. They include the opportunity for Australia to address this most pressing of problems: our future transport fuel security.
It is also three years since CSIRO’s report, The Energy and Transport Sector Outlook to 2020, which laid out its proposed strategy for Australia’s transport future—a strategy that identified gas to liquids and coal to liquids as the keys to our future transport fuel security. The tragedy is that we can all see the potential but the reality remains just beyond our grasp. Without sustained and committed national leadership to deliver the right policy settings and right fiscal environment, it will remain beyond our grasp.
The Prime Minister should be seriously reviewing the petroleum resources rent tax regime and considering special treatment of capital investment in gas to liquids fuel projects and associated gas production infrastructure. He should be facing up to some responsibility for resource related infrastructure instead of passing the buck to the states once again. Above all, this government should be sending a clear signal to Australians that it is interested in their future fuel supply security and a clear signal to the industry that it wants gas to liquids and coal to liquids as part of Australia’s national energy strategy.
I will be moving the second reading amendment circulated in my name today, which calls on the government to immediately conduct a feasibility study into a gas to liquids plant in Australia. The Prime Minister needs to dust off his 2001 gas to liquids task force report, bring it up to date and move us closer to making that industry a reality in this country. I also call on the government to review in 2009 the proposal to introduce excise on ethanol and biodiesel and LPG and CNG in 2011, and consider whether there is a case for deferring the introduction of excise depending on industry progress at that time. I think this matter is of such public importance that the government should require the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to report to the parliament annually, commencing next year, on the measures taken and the progress made to wean Australia off its foreign oil dependence. Such a report would need to address progress on market uptake of alternative fuels and new investment in alternative fuels industries in this country.
If this government were serious about a plan to lower petrol prices for Australians it would embrace Labor’s fuels blueprint proposals to make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free and grant tax rebates for other measures which will improve the uptake of LPG. It would have to be committed to finding more oil and using more gas in this country by using flow-through shares and re-examining the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure.
Finally, the government should be criticised for its tardiness in moving on petrol retail reform; bypassing due parliamentary process in introducing a regulation to undeclare companies under the sites act; failing to introduce amendments to the Trade Practices Act to implement the 2003 Dawson and 2004 Senate recommendations for reform; and, above all, failing abjectly to take action to reduce Australia’s dependence on foreign oil and improve its transport fuel security. I move the circulated second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-11,"—I rise to speak to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. The petroleum industry in total—exploration, production, manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing—is an industry where there are major barriers to entry and exit. Barriers to entry range from the extraordinary investment and expertise required at the exploration, production and manufacturing end to the planning difficulties surrounding retail siting. Barriers to exit particularly apply at the retail end, where franchise contracts and a shrinking service station sector have often made a profitable exit difficult. It is an industry which has always been characterised by the dominance of the transnational majors, which have always striven to maintain their captaincy of every level of the supply chain to the customer. Consequently, until recently the petroleum industry has not seen the emergence of strong countervailing contenders for captaincy of, for instance, the wholesale channel or the retail channel. The supermarket chains in Australia have now challenged this.
It is the Australian Democrats’ view that the industry still exhibits fatal flaws which materially affect investment, profitability, pricing and competition. These flaws include the oligopolisation of supply, difficulties of access and a heavy concentration of direct and indirect market power in the majors at every level in the chain of supply. Much attention has rightly been paid by concerned groups to pricing, access, supply issues, restrictive practices and market manipulation. Market power, horizontal concentration, vertical integration, ties and so on affect pricing. Those market flaws also affect profitability and the return on capital, because those with power are able to materially influence and affect where profits are made and taken. For all of these reasons market regulation has been and remains essential. That it has only partially succeeded does not mean that it is time to give up on regulation. If we are to envisage an industry with much enhanced pricing and competition and better profitability prospects, we do need to continue to attend to the structures, behaviour and conduct of the industry at every level.
The purpose of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is to repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, and to make a consequential amendment to the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987. The government proposes to replace the two petroleum retail acts with a mandatory industry code, to be known as the Trade Practices (Industry Codes—Oilcode) Regulations under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974. This particular bill has been floating around since the late 1990s with no success. One reason for this is that the different sectors of the industry could not agree on the content of the proposed Oilcode. For decades the Democrats have argued that a strong small business sector is essential to the economic and social health of Australia and that small business has a value of itself. Our views on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 are necessarily coloured by that perspective. We strongly support the workings of a free and fair market, as evidenced by our work on corporations, trade practices and tax law, but we have long been concerned that a weak Trade Practices Act does not deliver sufficiently fair competition for small business with sufficiently adequate protections from predatory pricing and the abuse of market power.
In 2004 the government’s intention to proceed with the proposed reform was announced and a bill in almost the same terms as the 1998 bill was introduced. In August 2005 a revised Oilcode was sent to stakeholders. It met with a contrary reaction, similar to past efforts, from interested groups. We agree that the new regulations are likely to offer significant improvements in transparency in the wholesale pricing of fuel and allow access for small businesses to the terminal gate price. However, differential pricing will still apply based on volumes as the market dictates. That is, a large chain such as the Coles Myer controlled Shell franchises can be expected to receive a superior price to an independent since they are likely to purchase a far greater volume. This could lead to an increase in the concentration of industry participants and a commensurate reduction in outlet choice for consumers. We are concerned that the result will be a significant reduction in the number of independent franchisees and small business operators, except perhaps in less economical or uneconomical regional and rural sites.
The Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Service Station Association and others had concerns about the impact of the legislation and the Oilcode on independent retailers. The MTAA argued that it would be important for an effective regulatory framework to be in place to deal with issues relating to the misuse of market power, and that the Trade Practices Act needs to be strengthened.
The Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 were passed to address an imbalance in market power at that time between the oil refiners and marketers—namely, BP, Caltex, Mobil and Shell and their commission agents. It was strongly asserted that the major companies had abused their market power. However, as the petroleum retail market has developed since that time, the consequence of these two acts has been the creation of a two-tier system, as the acts apply to only part of the industry. The acts have not prevented the growth of retailing outside the acts’ ambit—most notably through the entry of supermarket chains and independent importers and marketers into the industry—nor have they prevented the demise of thousands of independents.
The 1980 acts, contrary to their original intention, now restrain competition and limit the ability of the retail arms owned and franchised by major oil companies to compete with supermarket chain retailers operating outside of the ambit of the two acts. That is why there is again an agitation for those acts to be repealed. However, that should not occur without a recognition that this would deliver more big company competition for the four oil majors and the two big supermarket chains but leave independents and other small chains still, and perhaps more, exposed to predatory behaviour. Therefore, repeal of these acts should be accompanied by an Oilcode that supports full competition, not oligopoly, and a strengthened Trade Practices Act that better protects competition by independent small business. The problems are not new. The Australian Democrats pointed this out in their Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee minority report in 1999. It said:
5.1 The issues for the petroleum industry are vertical and horizontal integration, open access to terminals and protection of the rights of individual operators. The correct mix of regulation of each of these areas should result in increased competition and profitability, and better pricing practices. It would also result in a beneficial end to the market dominance of the oil majors in the wholesale and retail sectors.
The Australian Democrats agree that an appropriate access regime should be implemented and is needed. We agreed with the majority recommendation in the 1999 report that the franchise act should be retained until the completion and tabling of the Oilcode as regulation pursuant to part IVB of the Trade Practices Act. Further, we recommended that there should be a parliamentary review of the access regime after 18 months of operation of the Oilcode. That is plainly going to be necessary with respect to the new Oilcode. The petroleum industry is understandably desperate for there to be resolution of this legislative block so that it can forward plan in what is a very volatile and ever-changing market. The Democrats understand this and sympathise with that position. However, the government does not accept that the petroleum market should be assessed together with general trade practices protection.
The government presents this bill in isolation, as though the petroleum industry were not part of a bigger retailing or national picture and strengthening amendments to the Trade Practices Act were irrelevant to the matter under discussion here today. The Australian Democrats do not agree. As evidenced by the Labor Party’s attempt at amendments in the House of Representatives, they also do not agree. The Trade Practices Act deals with broad competition issues and it needs strengthening to provide a proper safe harbour for all small businesses, not just those occurring within the petroleum industry. Consumers, experts and business see the ACCC as having a pivotal role in the petrol industry regarding pricing, collusion and abuse of market power. Elsewhere I have said that the ACCC should have an enhanced capacity to get behind the corporate veil in that respect. I have been criticised in this chamber for suggesting that they might do well to have some ASIC-like powers with respect to that, but I continue to hold that position.
The Democrats have tried to persuade the government to not deal with petroleum issues in isolation from the whole question of competition law, but they have proven unwilling to listen. The government’s position is incomprehensibly stubborn. Also, when you think of all the changes to regulation that they have made in Corporations Law and with respect to financial services reform, it is extraordinary that the one area in which they have been obdurate, slow, resistant and negative in terms of change has been trade practices law. It is the one area in which they are excessively obeisant to big business.
The government’s position is that they want this bill passed first, unchanged. Separately and later, they want the Dawson bill passed, unchanged. After that, they might deign to pass a weak small business trade practices bill, unchanged. The height of hubris is to believe that all wisdom is yours. This is not macho and it is not even a sign of strong character; it is just silly. All these matters should be sensibly resolved together. Issues of dispute, like the government’s anti-union and anti-choice clause in the Dawson bill that prohibits unions from bargaining for business, should just be laid aside for another day.
Let me remind the Senate about matters relating to this bill which have occurred in the last 12 months. To his great credit as a member of the government coalition and under considerable pressure, Senator Joyce has had the gumption to vote on conscience on these matters. His opposition to schedule 1 of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 plus the opposition of all non-government parties to the whole bill on 11 October 2005 have meant that the amended bill has stalled in the House of Representatives. Nothing would have stopped it being passed and dealt with long ago. Senator Joyce’s motion to disallow the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. l) on 15 June 2006 was supported by the non-government parties but failed on a tied vote.
The Democrats opposed the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 principally because we wanted this bill to be balanced with trade practices reforms for small business. We opposed the anti-union clause in this bill, the third-line forcing provisions and the changes to the relationship between the tribunal and the commission which would encourage forum shopping. The Democrats opposed the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. l) because we wanted the regulations to be balanced with trade practices reforms for small business and because the enabling legislation had not even been passed.
The Democrats have a particular interest in the passage of many of the recommendations of the majority—and even the minority, which we support—Senate Economics References Committee report of March 2004 on the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. If the 17 recommendations that cover the misuse of market power, unconscionable conduct, collective bargaining, creeping acquisitions, divestiture and the powers and resources of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission were implemented, then fair and free competition would be greatly strengthened in Australia. Further, there would be less of a case for industry-specific regulation if the general law were so strengthened. Small business strongly support those recommendations overall.
The Democrats would not oppose the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 or the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), which of course have passed, if at least those trade practices recommendations popularly described as the Brandis amendments—from Senator Brandis’s minority report of the Senate Economics References Committee on the Trade Practices Act, in March 2004—and those already accepted by the government in its response to the Senate report were passed into law.
The Democrats would not oppose the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 if at least those recommendations by Senator Brandis’s minority report and those already accepted by the government in its response to the Senate report were passed into law. We would not oppose it if the anti-union clause in the bill were dropped. The third-line forcing provisions have already been dropped, thanks to the good work of The Nationals in pressuring the Treasurer, but we would have to consider our position on the changes to the relationship between the tribunal and the commission which will encourage forum shopping.
The anti-union clause, by the way, was not part of the Dawson recommendations. It is not about creating a more effective Trade Practices Act; it is simply a clause that was inserted to anger and upset the Labor Party. Small business owners should be able to have unions negotiate on their behalf, as should workers. This provision is simply a political stunt to try and curtail what the government believes is union power, as the underlying backbone of the Labor Party. It should be recognised by industry that it is this trade practices intransigence by the government which is stymieing passage of this petroleum legislation, not the lack of cooperation of other parties.
Schedule 1 of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005, which Senator Joyce voted against last year, contains a voluntary form of merger clearance system that can operate in conjunction with the existing informal ACCC system. Under the current system, an unfavourable decision in the ACCC is reviewed by the Australian Competition Tribunal. The new formal system, which means that merging parties can go directly to the tribunal, could have the effect of reducing the power of the ACCC and result in forum shopping between the ACCC and the Australian Competition Tribunal. It is also relatively unnecessary, because there is no sign that the ACCC has been failing to properly police acquisitions and mergers. The real issue of course is that there are no divestiture provisions. Senator Joyce’s main concern with the schedule was that mergers would be sanctioned under a different reasoning and would impact heavily on small business. His main concern was about what constituted public benefit. If I were the government and had to deal with Senator Joyce, I would make sure I recognised that he was expressing legitimate concerns which were widely shared in both the political community and the industry community.
The Senate Economics Reference Committee report of March 2004, The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business, contained 17 recommendations that cover the misuse of market power, unconscionable conduct, collective bargaining, creeping acquisitions, divestiture and the powers and resources of the ACCC. The government did not accept nine recommendations; it accepted five in full and accepted three in part. Those recommendations having been accepted, they have consulted with the states but are just sitting on their hands and not introducing those in conjunction with this bill.
The Senate Economics References Committee unanimously recommended changes to strengthen section 46 on misuse of market power. Those amendments will strengthen the courts’ powers to rule where big business is unfairly using its market power and conducting predatory pricing to eliminate a competitor. These are important issues for small business. They are important issues with respect to this legislative change that is before us. But the government has not presented those amendments to the Trade Practices Act since the committee report was tabled, even though they accepted the recommendations. In that report, the government recognised the importance of small business to the vigour of the Australian economy and the contribution that small business makes to the growth in employment and innovation. If you think that way, match your words with action!
To recap, what is holding up the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 and the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006—and listeners will note that during my remarks I have continually linked these together—is the government implementing those Senate recommendations that are relevant to the Trade Practices Act, recommendations that they accepted in their response and which are part of the Brandis package. It is necessary that the government drop, in its entirety, the outlawing of collective bargaining in the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. The two bills that I have referred to and the new trade practices bill, with regard to the needs of small business, need to be dealt with cognately or in the same week.
The government also needs to implement the single, unanimous trade practices recommendation in the October 2005 report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, Operation of the wine-making industry, which recommended that the government should give priority to amending the Trade Practices Act 1974 to add unilateral variation clauses in contracts to the list of matters which a court may have regard to in deciding whether conduct is unconscionable.
Those are amendments the government will accept. They apply to the wine industry as much as they apply to the petrol industry. But the government simply will not move. They are obdurate and difficult, and their behaviour I think is contrary to the public interest. Just by the way, in view of the current problems, in that Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References report the committee supported a mandatory code of conduct under the Trade Practices Act to regulate the sale of wine grapes.
The Democrats strongly support the workings of a free and fair market. We have long been concerned that a weak Trade Practices Act does not deliver sufficient fair competition for small business with sufficiently adequate protections from predatory pricing and the abuse of market power. Everyone needs to understand that a weak Trade Practices Act in Australia compares badly with many overseas laws. In that respect, we set great store on recommendations in the Senate Economics References Committee majority report, which we supported. We hope when Labor get into power that will be amongst the first bills they introduce to address competition needs in this country. There would be less of a case if that happened—if the general law was so strengthened—for industry-specific regulation in any industry.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-09-11,"—Before I begin, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Parry on his elevation to Deputy Government Whip. I have the chance to do this while Senator Parry is in the chamber and probably in his first hour of duty in the job. I hope it does not become an onerous task and that it is an enjoyable task for him.
My job today is to talk on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. It forms part of the government’s downstream petroleum reform package. This package is aimed at addressing the regulatory failure resulting from the existing outdated legislation. This bill will repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, which restricts the number of retail sites that prescribed oil companies such as BP and Caltex can directly own and operate. It also of course repeals the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980, which sets out the terms and conditions for franchise agreements.
These repeals are much needed since the old acts have failed to take account of or keep pace with changes that have come about in the oil market. The major example of this is that the large supermarket chains such as Woolworths and Coles now have their own outlets. The reforms introduced under this bill will be accompanied by the introduction of a new industry code, which will supposedly introduce greater certainty and protection for all parties, introduce a nationally consistent approach to terminal gate pricing, and improve transparency in wholesale pricing. In short, the government claim that these changes, as a package, will facilitate a more effective regulatory environment in the industry and improve the operating environment for the small operators also in the industry.
I am pretty sure that there is nobody in this chamber, let alone in a family household, who is not concerned about the state of the petrol retail industry and the way that extremely high petrol prices—together with higher mortgage repayments brought about by rising interest rates under the Howard government—are hitting the hip pockets of nearly all Australians and families. This is especially so in my electorate of the Northern Territory. Some southerners speak in hushed voices when petrol prices reach $1.20 or $1.25 a litre. Let me tell you that most of my constituents would welcome the price dropping to $1.20 or $1.25.
I noticed in the paper today a suggestion that petrol prices are coming down, to between $1.25 and $1.28, in most of the eastern seaboard states. However, in the Northern Territory they are still paying $1.39—and that is in Darwin, where we are paying 11c to 14c more a litre than anywhere else in this country. Even at Tennant Creek—which is on the main highway, the Stuart Highway—the petrol price has been over $1.60 for many months now. At more remote places such as Nhulunbuy or Numbaa, it is well above this price—$1.80 a litre is quite common in those communities.
In the Territory we not only pay more for our fuel but also pay more in government tax—in GST. As was stated very clearly by my Territory colleague in the other place, Mr Snowdon—unlike Mr Tollner, who never gets to stand up and talk on these sorts of bills—the GST is nothing but a tax on a tax in relation to petrol. The GST simply gets higher as the price of the taxed product goes up.
The Prime Minister tried to make it sound so great that the excise tax on petrol is frozen, but why should he worry when the GST rises ever upwards with the increasing price at the pump? This government is reaping a huge tax windfall while the people in remote Australia are being ripped off more and more at the bowser by the GST. The increasing price of fuel means that the GST has risen for all motorists but far more so for those living in remote areas, where the petrol price and the price of fuel is way above your average eastern seaboard suburban prices.
I want to make sure that others in this place get the message and realise that remote communities are paying the highest prices in this country—and, therefore, more tax than motorists anywhere else—yet they are getting no more benefit than anyone else. Unfortunately, we cannot tell whether this bill that is now being debated will provide relief to people from the present high prices and GST payments; however, we can hope and trust that the introduction of the Oilcode will even out the playing field with the introduction of consistent national regulatory requirements and a consistent approach to terminal gate pricing. It may have a beneficial effect on the east coast, or other major centres where there are multiple outlets, in providing some competition, but many of the Territorians that I represent have no such choice—there is only one outlet in most communities. Whether this outlet be owned by the store or the council, it is only one small outlet with very limited buying power. They cannot buy in bulk. They have to pay high freight costs before the fuel gets to the community pump. They then pay GST on top of that as it goes into their tanks. It is in these remote communities that we find the highest fuel prices—as I said, up to $1.80 a litre, and more, is common and has been for some time.
The poorest Australians in our country are paying higher fuel prices and higher GST on their fuel than any other Australians. The government then questions whether it is worth keeping smaller communities funded—whether they are viable. These communities are paying their fair share of tax to this government, so why not keep funding them?
Let us also look at another solution that was offered with much ado by the Prime Minister to the unsuspecting public. The government has offered a $2,000 rebate to anyone who converts their car to LPG. How effective a solution is that? LPG derives from oil, so if oil supplies decline LPG will also reduce in supply and rise in cost. The consumption of LPG in a car is relatively higher than petrol. The car’s range is reduced, so you need regular and fairly frequent refuelling points. Quite simply, we do not have those in the Northern Territory. There is no LPG available in Nhulunbuy, a large mining town of 4,000 people, nor anywhere on the 700-kilometre track out of Nhulunbuy. There is no LPG outlet in Borroloola, another isolated mining town. You could not drive an LPG fuelled car into, out of or even around any of these towns, and they are not alone. Along the Stuart Highway LPG outlets are few and far between. Put simply, for most of the Territory the LPG solution is simply not an alternative fuel.
On government estimates, after four years maybe only two per cent of the adult population will take advantage of this rebate; so it will have a very low level of penetration. As written in the Sunday Canberra Times on 20 August, it is a bad idea which has no place in a well-designed energy policy. Last week’s decision to increase the subsidy for LPG is bad news for 98 per cent of the taxpayers, but let me tell you this: it is pretty bad news for almost 100 per cent of the constituents that I represent in the Northern Territory. So, once again, the Prime Minister and his government offer little hope or help to the many regional and remote Australians who remain stuck with paying the highest fuel prices, the highest GST on fuel, the highest food prices in this country as trucking companies are forced to pass on high fuel costs and the higher interest rates coming about under this government.
The Treasurer beams that oh so warm smile of his when reminding Australians of all the recent tax cuts. The problem is that, although the tax cuts started on 1 July, they were all gone—well gone—by 31 July as a result of people’s increasing bills. And, of course, some of the income tax cuts have gone back to the Treasury—courtesy of the higher GST paid every time we fill up the car in the Northern Territory. No wonder the Treasurer keeps smiling. But has he got any real reason for doing so? I think not. The Howard government have run out of steam. They have run out of ideas other than the old-hat ideological wishes of an ageing Prime Minister who wants to crush unions; disadvantage workers; reduce their wages, conditions and job security; and privatise everything as a way of increasing employment and productivity. For 10 long years they have been able to live on the coat-tails of the previous Labor government, which set the economic ball rolling towards success and prosperity and a resources boom, which has nothing to do with their economic management.
But this is a government that has now run out of puff in keeping up with relevant changes to encourage investment and to further drive productivity and prosperity. It has failed to keep up with education investment, leading to a drastic skills shortage. It has failed to invest in infrastructure, leaving our ports and roads in poor shape. It is prepared to sell off Telstra despite obvious disadvantages to rural and remote Australia. Reduced services in the bush will do nothing to help regional businesses. It has bought votes through tax cuts, which have increased spending and led to inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. It has failed to act on looming fuel problems.
 While Australia has very abundant supplies of natural gas, the government have done nothing to encourage examination of the use of this as an alternative to oil. They have stuck their heads in the sand, or perhaps the coal heaps, and have done nothing to really encourage research and development in alternatives for fuel. So now the government have put up this bill we are debating. While necessary, it is really too little too late. We have a nation still reliant on oil for our transport sector—oil from the less stable parts of the globe, oil now stuck at higher prices.
The government have done nothing, despite our own resources, to encourage the establishment of a home grown, home based fuel industry. We are stuck with a heavy reliance on imported oil, the demand for which is rising rapidly, as countries such as China and India develop further. Anyone with Basic Economics 101 knows that a rising demand with a more or less fixed or reducing supply can have only one result—the price of the product will rise. That is what is happening to oil and it will continue to happen.
No matter how often the Prime Minister tries to be like King Canute and stop the rise, saying a price of $1.15 per litre or whatever is possible again, the truth is that this is simply pie in the sky; it will not happen. The Prime Minister obviously never got as far as economics 101. He tries to reject that the war in Iraq has anything to do with the price of petrol. He says the trouble is the high world price of crude oil, and indeed so it is. But why is the world price for crude oil so high? It is due in part at least to the instability of one of the major producing areas in the world, with the war in Iraq an absolutely undoubted contributing factor. So at least try and be honest for once, Prime Minister.
The price of oil goes up, the price of fuel goes up, GST paid on fuel goes up, the cost of freight goes up, prices in the shops go up and GST paid on food goes up. The Treasurer keeps smiling reassuringly, inflation starts and the Reserve Bank puts the brakes on by raising interest rates, so mortgage payments go up, leaving the average Australian struggling to keep up or spending on credit cards to dangerously high levels which cannot continue. The good times are over. This is not a sustainable situation.
So we have this bill and an offer to rebate some of the expenses of converting to LPG as this government’s reaction to the situation. In addition, there seems to be some rather shaky government support for some forms of biofuels, such as ethanol. I heard somewhere the other day, on one of those early morning radio shows, of an Aussie investor, I think from the Gold Coast, who is putting millions into several biofuels plants. The shame of it is that they are all in the USA, where he says they are really going for these alternatives, unlike our government here, where it is just not worth investing.
What an indictment of this government. It has flipped and flopped over what to do about fuel alternatives like ethanol and LPG and has kept changing the playing field and goal posts. In the last parliament alone it changed the proposed excise regime on no fewer than three occasions. Labor believe that we must do something real and positive to ensure the future of alternatives like ethanol and other biofuels. Without ensuring the security of these alternatives we will remain captive, or hostage, to oil supplies from the Middle East, Russia and west Africa and to high oil prices. These are all areas with problems of stability and continuity of supply.
We should long ago have been looking at converting our own natural gas to fuel, working on cleaner coal for power stations and converting coal to diesel as more desirable options as fuel sources. Instead, we export as much of our gas as we can sell to look after Japan and China. How can this be in the long-term national interest? Sadly, working on alternative, cleaner and sustainable fuel has not been on the Prime Minister’s radar. He has been far too preoccupied with his extreme workplace relations legislation, ruthless changes to Welfare to Work rules or beating our Indigenous people about the head with major changes to land rights in the Northern Territory without consultation.
The time has come for urgent action, for Australia to actually have a proper energy policy, to work seriously towards developing alternatives with our own resources and to review the decision made to introduce excise on ethanol, biodiesel and LPG in 2011. The time has come to genuinely assist in the development of these alternative fuels and not muddle along like this government has done for far too long. (Quorum formed)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2006-09-11,"—I remind the Senate that we are debating the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, because the chamber might have forgotten that, given the contributions that we have heard so far from the opposition benches. Senator O’Brien briefly referred to the bill and accused the government of stagnating reform in this area but then referred to a whole lot of measures that are quite irrelevant to this legislation. Senator Murray spoke largely about trade practices issues, which might have some peripheral relevance to the legislation, and Senator Crossin talked about high petrol prices and GST revenue. I will deal with those comments in a few moments. At the outset I want to congratulate Senator Stephen Parry on his election as Deputy Government Whip. I hope he enjoys his tenure in that office and I am sure that he will contribute very positively to the way in which this chamber operates. Congratulations to Senator Parry.
The legislation that we are debating this afternoon, the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, opens the way for a new era in petroleum marketing because it paves the way for the introduction of the Oilcode. The introduction of this bill follows extensive consultation with the industry, industry associations and consumer groups, who all agree that the current legislation—the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980—has become obsolete.
This 1980 legislation implemented what was known as the ‘Fife package’, after the then Fraser government minister responsible for its implementation, Wal Fife. As a then member of the House of Representatives who had previously worked in oil industry marketing management, I was involved in the consultation process that led to that legislation. It was much needed at the time to ensure a fair go for service station operators. However, to those who argue that this legislation should remain in place I say that it is well past its use-by date.
The retail petroleum market has changed substantially, and not just in recent years. The entry of Coles and Woolworths into the market during the past two decades has allowed substantial circumvention of both the intent and the letter of the 1980 Fife package. What made the Fife package obsolete was the introduction by the oil companies in the early 1990s of multisite franchising and the failure of the then Labor government to stop it—to amend the Fife legislation at that time to prevent multisite franchising, which was circumventing the intent of the Fife package. As an opposition senator at the time, I well recall calling for action on this front, but the Labor government simply sat on its hands. So I say to those who remain advocates for the legislation that we are repealing today—and this is worth repeating—it has been obsolete and ineffectual since the last Labor government allowed the law to be compromised by multisite franchising a decade and a half ago.
Subsequent marketing arrangements, in particular the developments with Coles and Woolworths, have simply built on that. That is why a new approach is required. That is why, after much consultation and negotiation, albeit not to everyone’s satisfaction, the Howard government is legislating the Oilcode through the Trade Practices Act. Labor sat on its hands and did nothing to give service station owners a fair go. The Howard government has acted—with the Oilcode.
I noticed, in his brief reference to the bill, that Senator O’Brien accused the government of stagnating on this matter. Over the years there have been entrenched differing positions between the retailers on the one hand and oil companies on the other on a few aspects of the Oilcode. Quite rightly, the government facilitated negotiations on those issues and allowed time for those negotiations to bear fruit. However, in the face of continuing disagreement, the government has taken the very difficult decisions on these aspects that have been in dispute and determined that it will mandate the Oilcode. That is why it has taken a considerable amount of time for this legislation to come forward—because, quite properly, the government allowed appropriate negotiations to be undertaken.
As I said at the outset, apart from that brief reference to the legislation, Senator O’Brien did not really address this legislation at all. He talked about excise issues and gas and coal to liquids, which he indicated that Labor had supported 20 years ago when they were in government, and then he accused this government of not doing anything about it. What did Labor do when they were in government to bring about some practical results as far as gas and coal to liquids were concerned?
As I said, Senator Murray referred to issues related to the Trade Practices Act, and they are certainly still under consideration. Senator Crossin, in her contribution to this second reading debate, talked about high petrol prices and then went on to talk about the increased GST revenue that was being generated as a result of that and the impact that that was having on people’s ability to cope. I remind Senator Crossin that if she is concerned about the revenue that is being generated by the GST she should talk to the Northern Territory Labor government, because they are the beneficiaries of the GST revenue. If there is some capacity for GST revenue to be used to relieve the effect of high petrol prices, which result directly from the fact that international oil prices are high, then it its within the capacity and the wit of the Northern Territory government to use some of its GST revenue to provide a rebate to petrol consumers and benefit them in that way. So, as I said, I suggest to Senator Crossin that she talk to the Northern Territory government if she is concerned about the amount of GST revenue that is being generated.
The concurrent repeal of the Fife package and the instalment of the Oilcode is undoubtedly essential to ensure greater transparency, accountability and national consistency in this radically altered market, which I referred to a few moments ago. Of course, the petroleum market is one of the most competitive in Australia. For these reasons, I strongly support this legislation. Support for the legislation was also recommended by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I am a member, in its report on the provisions of this bill that was tabled in the Senate on 11 May this year.
The entry of supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles into the retail petrol market has altered significantly the structure of the industry. Under the current legislation—the two pieces of legislation that this bill repeals—they hold a competitive advantage in the industry, free from the conditions that are currently placed upon the oil majors with regard to franchising. This has affected the industry to such an extent that the supermarkets now account for 50 per cent of all metropolitan sales. This has rendered the retail petrol sites of the major oil companies a dwindling market share, as they find it increasingly difficult to compete in a market in which they are put under exceptional restrictions on their business structures and the contracts they provide to their franchisees. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee concluded that it is difficult to justify the maintenance of one set of restrictions on a retail petrol site that may be operating directly next door to another site that is able to determine the conditions of its contracts under another completely unrelated piece of legislation. Through this legislation the Oilcode will be able to simply and uniformly create laws that are the most conducive to an open market performing at its optimum.
It follows that the legislation currently in place, which was developed, as I said, some 25 years ago, is no longer appropriate. Again, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, considering changes to the industry’s structure since the introduction of the prevailing legislation, concluded that the different regulatory requirements of different market participants were unjustified. Indeed, we found that the most difficult obstacle to reforming the retail petrol industry was in reconciling the competing interests of the major oil refiners with those of the independent retail franchisees. The Howard government has provided a piece of legislation, which we are debating today, to take the necessary next step in reform of the retail petrol industry. It will provide greater flexibility for those in the market and ensure greater simplicity and efficiency, which will balance the different interests of the two parties by providing an atmosphere of competition that is similar to that experienced in other industries throughout Australia.
The most important potential benefit from the introduction of a bill affecting the sale of petrol is that it will reduce prices for all Australians. In the Oilcode, this is to be achieved through national terminal gate pricing, whereby the wholesale price of petroleum will be transparent whilst still able to be sold below cost. This will be consistent for all petrol retailers. It should put downward pressure on the price of petrol and retain competition through allowing all market participants to negotiate the price they pay for petrol.
Moreover, this legislation will address the continued insecurity that has occurred across Australia in relation to retail petrol sites, which have declined in numbers since the early 1970s. It is believed that the introduction of terminal gate pricing will have the secondary effect of ensuring the number of petrol retailers in Australia is at an optimal level, achieved through their capacity to remain price competitive or through their ability to retain a niche benefit for their customers.
I note some in the opposition have expressed concern that the potential for below-cost sales to those with greater buying power will result in a reduction in competition, as smaller operators may be forced out of the market. However, the introduction of the Oilcode will not undermine competition. Those sites that remain competitive will continue to be economically viable when faced with further industry rationalisation and the increased dominance of the supermarket franchises. Regardless of the introduction of this bill, the retail petrol market will continue to evolve according to market demand with regard to the sites of independent operators in opposition to larger retail franchises or the oil majors.
Indeed, it was the conclusion of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that we risk seeing a decline in competition within this industry if reform does not occur, as Coles and Woolworths will be able to continue their ascendency within the market if left with their current competitive advantage. It was concluded by the committee that the oil majors, if faced with continued competitive disadvantage, will not have any incentive to stay in Australia. The distinct possibility arises that the majors would be forced to consider withdrawal from the market altogether. This would not only weaken competition within the industry, which would result in higher petrol prices; it would see a discontinuation of their interest in developing more efficient fuels and, through market withdrawal, result in a loss of refining capacity within Australia. This raises serious issues of energy security for the nation, and it is only fair that we ensure the market is free from disadvantage for any of its members by removing this outdated legislation.
The Oilcode contains appropriate safeguards to ensure all market participants are safe from their interests being compromised. Establishing disclosure statements when parties are engaged in fuel-reselling agreements will ensure that all of those in the retail petrol market are accountable. This will protect the interests of all independents and retailers by ensuring that both parties are accountable to the provisions of the agreement as specified within terminal gate pricing. This will level the playing field for petrol retailers, regardless of their relationship to the supplier, and will in turn provide an across-the-board solution to the current problems of inconsistency being experienced by our retail petrol sites, which are under different legal classifications.
Further safeguards have been put in place for all market players through the establishment of the independent, downstream petroleum dispute resolution scheme. This will provide consistency of outcomes for all retail petrol sites through the provision of an acceptable and affordable alternative to court proceedings. The dispute resolution scheme will protect the interests not only of those vulnerable independent retailers but of all retail sites equally.
The introduction of the Oilcode in an extremely competitive environment will provide an efficient mechanism to ensure all reselling agreements are honoured. The repeal of the current legislation and the introduction of the Oilcode will be a long-lasting reform for the retail petrol industry. It will provide a fair platform upon which businesses can compete and will improve competition by actively putting downward pressure on petrol prices. It will also allow the process of market rationalisation so that the industry will be able to perform at its optimal level. On this basis, I oppose the amendment that was moved by Senator O’Brien and commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-09-11,"—The Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is yet another piece of economic legislation that has been some time in coming. The bill was first referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on 30 March this year, and a message was conveyed to the committee, of which I am a member, that there was to be a sense of urgency in our inquiry into the bill because the government attached a degree of urgency to the legislation. So it is passing strange, to say the least, that it has taken until now to debate the legislation. The committee had two public hearings, a hearing held in Sydney in early May and a hearing held here in Canberra on 8 May, and the committee reported not long after the second hearing. As far as those of us on the economics committee are concerned, we have been ready to deal with and have had a view on this legislation since May, and we are now in September.
At the committee’s hearing in Sydney we heard from a lot of the players in the petroleum retail industry, which is hardly surprising. In discussing their views on this proposed legislation, a lot of the players referred to the Oilcode, a code that has been referred to by Senator Chapman and others who have contributed earlier to this debate. I mention this because, at the time, those of us on the committee were unaware of the totality of the package. We were unaware that this piece of legislation was to go hand in hand with an oil code and, in fact, had not been provided with a copy of that code. So the hearing where we heard from industry was a little disjointed. We probably did not give them a true sense of where we were at and we did not have the opportunity to pursue the issues with them the way we would have if we had had all the information before us.
In discussing the issue with industry representatives in Sydney, it came out that they were of the view that the Oilcode, as they were discussing it, was available on the department’s website in draft form. It was not until the committee got to have its hearings in Canberra that we were able to have a discussion about what was in the code and to have it before us and get a true understanding of the status of the code and how that was to correlate with the legislation. In fact, when we were talking to departmental people they were able to tell us that as far as they were concerned the code, as it stood on the website, was the final document and not a draft, as some in the industry still seemed to consider it to be. As has been mentioned by others, when the economics committee reported in May, although we agreed to the passage of the legislation, a number of us put in some additional comments on other measures that we thought needed to be taken to insure the petroleum retail industry.
As part of the assistance to committee members in the lead-up to our hearing in Canberra, we were provided with some briefing notes from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, which I must say—and I remarked about this at the time—were most useful. Perhaps if we had had them a bit earlier it would have stopped some of the pain at the Sydney hearings. One of the things mentioned in that briefing was a discussion about the change in the environment regulating the retail petroleum industry. It said that the proposed legislation would not eliminate the rationalisation of retail sites that had been experienced by the industry over the past two decades. We were provided with the useful information that in 1970 there were over 20,000 retail petroleum sites around Australia but that, following the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s, the number had reduced to approximately 12,500 sites and has continued to decline to the current level of 6,500.
The briefing note went on to say—and this is one of the things that causes some concern for those who are worried about the operation of independent retailers and smaller players within the sector:
However, ... rationalisation will eventually plateau as retailers compete on the even playing field facilitated by the Oilcode and the number of retail sites reaches an optimal level in response to the demands of the domestic market.
I presume that, by the note saying it will eventually plateau, we can still expect to see some decline in the number of sites. In a state that is as geographically large as Western Australia, and which has an industry as significant as Western Australia’s but still with a fairly centralised population, the thought of any further decline in the number of retail outlets will be of real concern to the people of that state—the people of my home state. If you are from outside Perth, there are no options of public transport or other methods of getting around, so easy access to petroleum at a reasonable price is a very important part of keeping my state going.
Hand in glove with this piece of legislation, as has been highlighted by Labor members of the economics committee and by Labor in its proposed amendments, is the need to reform the Trade Practices Act. Trade Practices Act reform is something that has been discussed in this chamber. It has been highlighted in this chamber for almost as long as I have been a member; indeed, it has had a quite high profile in that time. It was only last week in question time, in response, I think, to a question from Senator Fielding—even though it is only a week old it is testing my memory—that Senator Minchin said that the government accepted the need to reform the Trade Practices Act but would do it when it had the numbers to secure it. We all know that the government has the numbers in this place, so I can only assume that any government reluctance to reform the Trade Practices Act is due to a level of disharmony or disagreement within its own forces; that should be the only reluctance. As I say, this is an issue that has been highlighted for quite some time.
The need to reform the Trade Practices Act was highlighted quite significantly by a now extinct body, the Senate Economic References Committee, when it reported, back in 2004, on the need to make the act more robust in protecting the rights of small business. Whilst Labor supports the legislation, we feel that hand in glove with that needs to go some further reform to the Trade Practices Act. As those of us from Labor commented in our additional remarks in the economics committee inquiry, it is well known that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act has been rendered inefficient and ineffective because of a number of Federal Court and High Court cases. For example, in the Safeway case the concept of taking fair advantage was brought into question. In the Rural Press case, the concept of abusing market power in another market was brought into question. Then, of course, there is the infamous Boral case, where the very concept of market power was also brought into question. The ACCC has effectively given up pursuing cases under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act because it now knows, in our view anyway, that it has been rendered ineffective.
At the time the Senate Economic References Committee brought down its report, there was unanimous agreement that some sort of reform of the Trade Practices Act needed to take place. The only disagreement within the committee was the full extent of that reform. Some two years later we are still waiting to see some government legislation and government response to that inquiry. It is very difficult to continually come in here to raise real questions about individual pieces of legislation and the effect they will have on small, independent operators in collaboration with a less than effective Trade Practices Act in this day and age when we are yet to see the colour of the government’s proposed reforms. Every time Labor raises these issues, we are told that there is a package coming and that the government fully intends to reform the Trade Practices Act. Some two years on, considering it will be a significant package that will affect those in small and intermediate businesses, I am surprised that a government that claims to be the champion of the small business sector is yet to come forward with a package of reforms to protect the sector in an increasingly combative and robust market.
The report of the Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act on small business was brought down in 2004. It made a number of recommendations to strengthen the Trade Practices Act, some of which the government at the time committed to, yet we are still to see any legislation resulting from that. Particularly as the government, we all know, have the numbers in this place, it is completely unacceptable for them to say, ‘We’ll wait and see when we can get the package through.’ They have the numbers; they need to use the numbers. This is something that those of us on this side of the chamber have been told they have been working on for some two years. Surely, therefore, this is a package that should be ready to go. Labor senators at the economics committee hearing particularly noted the comments of Mr Cassidy from the ACCC when he said:
I would say that, to the extent that there are shortcomings in the current section 46—and that is obviously well-travelled ground—we think the answer to that is to amend the section.
So the ACCC wants the section amended. The Senate economics committee unanimously wanted the section amended. Those from almost every peak small business forum or locally organised forum of small business also want the section amended, yet we are still to see any form of activity from the government.
The reforms are long overdue. For those of us that are very aware of and have a lot of sympathy for the claims that were made by the independents in the petroleum retail sector, it is very difficult to continually take the government’s point of view that this piece of legislation is essential and that the Oilcode will go hand in hand. In a way the government forced our hand by removing all regulation and then said, ‘We have to pass the legislation or the entire industry will be left unregulated.’ It is very difficult for us to continue to deal with these issues industry by industry, sector by sector without having any undertaking or any indication from the government on when we can expect any reform to the Trade Practices Act and what that reform will look like. This is reform that we have been waiting some two years for. Every time the government bring in a piece of legislation like this that seeks to govern the commercial activities of one particular sector of our economy, those of us on this side of the chamber will go out of our way to remind them that they cannot adopt this piecemeal approach. In order for the small business sector of our economy to prosper in the way that it should, they must give us the legislative framework or at least the undertaking of what that legislative framework will look like so that we can see the true operation of a decent trade practices regime in our economy.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In particular, I want to focus my remarks this afternoon on responses from Senator Santoro in respect of the provision of residential aged care in Queensland. We all know in this place, and anyone who reads the papers knows, that Senator Santoro is a major factional player in Queensland state politics.
—Or used to be.
—I accept your interjection, Senator O’Brien: he used to be. The question I have now is: which faction? The Caltabiano faction, of which I understand Senator Santoro was a major member, has reduced its number quite significantly and there has been a split in that faction. Maybe, Senator Brandis, you could make that clearer.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This has nothing to do with any answer in question time or any question asked of the minister.
—There is no point of order. Senator McLucas, I draw you to the taking note of answers.
—It is not surprising, then, that he and his office have spent much of their time over the last three weeks involving themselves in the state election campaign. We know, from reading the newspapers, that his press adviser, Mr Malcolm Cole, was parachuted into the campaign in the very early days of the campaign, even inasmuch as attending joint campaign committee meetings. He stressed that this was all in his own time. I gave the minister the opportunity during question time today to clarify the involvement of Mr Cole, to explain to the chamber what he had been doing as a part of his responsibilities as press secretary to the minister or what he had in fact been doing as part of his involvement in the Queensland state election campaign. It was interesting to note that Minister Santoro completely avoided that opportunity—he did not try in any way at all to explain the involvement of his press secretary in the Liberal Party’s Queensland campaign.
We also know that, over the last week or so, we have been subjected in this place to Senator Santoro’s attempts to attack the Queensland government on the state of the health system in that state. I thought it was opportune to clarify what effect that expenditure of public resources had on the state election campaign. I have to ask: did he take the opportunity to perhaps doorknock in the electorate of Gaven? Did he send his speech to the people who live in Redcliffe? Did he ask the people of Chatsworth whether they thought it was a good contribution and whether it would in fact affect their vote? I think that, if you look at the results of those three electorates in particular—in fact, the whole state campaign—the answer is extremely clear.
I congratulate Peter Beattie and his team of ALP candidates on a strong campaign that focused on the message of fixing our health system, fixing the water supply and the other issues—but, particularly, fixing our health system. We recognise in Queensland that the problems we experience are not all of Queensland’s making. There is a doctor and nurse shortage. We know that we are dealing with changing demographics. But we also recognise the pressure that is being placed on Queensland hospitals by this government’s neglect of residential aged care in Queensland.
It is in the minister’s interest to cloud and confuse the issues surrounding the number of aged care places that are being provided, not only in Queensland but right across the nation. But the facts are these: in 1996, when Labor was last in government, for every 1,000 people in Queensland over the age of 70, there were 97 operational beds; 10 years later, in 2006, there are 86 operational residential aged care beds for every 1,000 people over 70 years old. We have lost 11 beds for the group of people who need them most—11 beds for every 1,000 people over 70 have been lost to the people of Queensland. And the government themselves lowered the target that they were attempting to achieve in 2004 from 90 beds for every 1,000 people over 70 down to 88. So they are still not even meeting their own target, even though they lowered it themselves.
The minister talked about increasing the number of places in Queensland. You basically talk in telephone numbers when you talk with Senator Santoro about the number of aged care beds, because he just lists numbers. He does not recognise that people in Australia actually understand that we are ageing in this country, as we are around the world. We are getting older. So rattling off total numbers does not actually explain anything. That is why you have to understand the application of the ratio.
The other thing we know is that there are 1,500 more Queenslanders coming into Queensland every week. A lot of those people are either requiring aged care or very close to requiring aged care. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-09-11,"—I think it is very important at this stage to help Senator McLucas remember what the initiatives of the 2006-07 budget were. This budget invests in security and quality of care, which I know she is very passionate about, as am I. There was $8.6 million for increased spot checks of aged care homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. I must say that, during a visit to Port Hedland some three weeks ago, I visited an aged care, low-care facility, and two spot check accreditors were at the facility. I had a very interesting talk with them and the staff who worked there. The staff were delighted that they had been visited by these surveyors and the surveyors were also very happy with what they found, so I think it was a great initiative, especially for rural and regional facilities.
There is also $4.7 million over three years for a major expansion of the Community Visitors Scheme and $1.8 million to extend police checks to all volunteers participating in the scheme. Once again, with regard to my own home town of Kojonup, I must say that the Community Visitors Scheme is very welcome, as is the fact that police checks are carried out on all the volunteers. I think that all the people involved feel very happy to have their police check and that they are able to do their community service in the way they wish to.
In July 2006 the Australian government announced an additional $90.2 million package of reforms aimed at further safeguarding older people in residential aged care homes from sexual and serious physical assault, and I know that Senator McLucas has also been very concerned about this. The budget is investing in the skills of Australia’s aged care staff with $21.6 million over four years to identify and replicate best practice clinical care in aged care homes, $13.4 million in training for the community care workforce and $66 million to continue vital training programs for nurses and aged care staff. Once again, for small rural and regional facilities this is a great incentive. The budget is also investing in aged care services in the community with $19.4 million over four years to extend the viability supplement to community aged care programs in rural areas, $24.2 million for more care services in retirement villages, $20.1 million for indexing of the aged care assessment teams program and $24.2 million over five years for improved aged care assessment arrangements.
The budget meets the special needs of older Australians with $15.1 million over four years for an additional 150 aged care places under the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Aged Care Strategy, $13.8 million for a national eye health initiative and continued funding of capital assistance to eligible aged care homes in rural and remote areas. Once again, this is a very valuable program. Most aged care facilities are not able to come up with the money or the funding for capital improvement, so that one is especially welcome for rural people.
To follow on, there is $134.2 million for psychogeriatric services, $23.7 million for the National Continence Management Strategy, $18.2 million extending the grace period for income testing to $23.8 million and $1.1 million for the National Seniors Productive Ageing Centre. All these initiatives go to helping all states, including Queensland, with their aged care issues. I am very interested in improved quality of aged care. The government brought in the Aged Care Act 1997, which provides for an accreditation based quality assurance system for aged care homes. As a result, aged care homes must now be accredited to receive Australian government subsidies. Accreditation assesses the performance of homes against 44 expected outcomes. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I rise to speak on health care or aged care more broadly. What I have just heard is at least an attempt by the government to defend their record. By and large it will not wash with the electorate, but at least it was an attempt. But what we saw last week was not an attempt to defend their poor policies in this area, their poor application of how they assist in fixing some of the problems at their feet—not at the feet of the Beattie government. What we saw last week was Senator Trood asking a question of Senator Santoro about recent COAG meetings to provide more doctors. The answers went more to the political content of state elections than to the issues at hand. Senator Santoro talked about ‘rivers of gold that are squandered irresponsibly by state governments such as the outgoing Beattie Labor government’. It is no defence to then say that that is not relevant to the debate, because Santo Santoro was talking about the state government, talking up the Liberals’ chances—and, let me say, they certainly needed talking up.
On another occasion last week Senator Trood went to the same point when he asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing—again, Senator Santoro—about the Queensland health system. The question was not about the issues at hand but was another attempt to talk up the chances of the Liberals in Queensland. Not to be outdone, Senator Brandis also stooped to it as well. Not only did Senator Trood ask two questions but also Senator Brandis attempted to squeeze himself into the deal, and he directed a question to Santo Santoro, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, on the same issues. He ended up by saying:
What is disgraceful in this place is that every time I get up to talk about the neglect of the Beattie Labor government when it comes to the health needs of Queenslanders, and today specifically old Queenslanders, not one Labor senator opposite stands up for the health rights and needs of Queenslanders.
That is what he said last week. Hopefully, what we will hear from him when he stands up today is where the Howard government has failed miserably to work hand in glove with the Beattie government to fix the crisis.
—A crisis of the Beattie government’s creation.
—You’ll get your turn, Senator Brandis. What the Beattie government has said is that it is back to work to fix the problems. Unlike Senator Santoro and Senator Brandis, who were preoccupied last week with attacking the Beattie government and trying to talk up the Liberals’ position, the Beattie government is now back to work on its 100-day plan to address the health and water issues in Queensland.
—How many days are there in eight years?
—Senator Brandis, you will get your opportunity to defend Dr Flegg this week. You will get your opportunity to argue why you provided such a miserable turnout in the Queensland election. What I could say is, despite those objections that were run last week by Senator Santoro and Senator Trood, the Queensland public did re-elect the Beattie government for a fourth term on Saturday. I quite openly congratulate Premier Beattie on this historic achievement. It has been 65 years since a Labor government has achieved a fourth term. As a Queensland Labor senator it is truly a humbling experience to find that the state party has received such an endorsement from the voting public and to see that the Labor brand name is still out there well and good, notwithstanding the attacks by Senator Brandis and Senator Trood last week on the Beattie government. This is an important issue and they should have taken it as one last week. Hopefully they will take it as an important issue this week and deal with the issues at hand, particularly the failure of the federal government in this area. But I suspect that they will go on to defend their position from last week. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-09-11,"—We have just heard two remarkably fatuous, graceless, inaniloquent speeches by Senator McLucas and Senator Ludwig pretending to address the issue of aged care. These two Labor senators have detained the Senate this afternoon while they pursued a political attack upon the Liberal Party in Queensland in relation to Saturday’s state election and, in Senator Ludwig’s case, a self-congratulatory spree about the historical success of Mr Beattie in winning four consecutive terms of government. We can see how interested Senator McLucas, who is meant to be the shadow minister for health, and Senator Ludwig, who is also a shadow minister in a different portfolio, are in aged care that they would waste the Senate’s time by diverting a debate about aged care into a fatuous—I am sorry, Senator Ludwig, I have succumbed to a fit of lethologica, having listened to your remarks; I cannot remember what I was about to say, I am so taken aback by you—tedious rant about the Liberal Party and its internal affairs and self-congratulatory statements about the success of the Beattie government. That is all they are concerned with.
Let me put the facts on the table; let me put those facts into context. The aged care sector, as Senator McLucas as the shadow minister above all people should realise, is a sector of growing importance to all Australians, including Queenslanders. With respect to residents of aged care facilities, there are medical, psychological, behavioural, dental, hormonal, emotional and gerontological issues—the whole range of issues that afflict people as they move into the twilight years of their lives are presented for these institutions to deal with. But what have we heard from the Labor Party? No concern whatever to come to grips with that range of important issues.
Let me tell you what the Howard government has done in relation to the aged care sector. What it has done is what the sector has demanded: increased the number of places. That is what has happened. Senator McLucas implausibly, bizarrely accused Senator Santoro of, to use her words, ‘talking in telephone numbers’ because he was always talking in statistics. I would be interested to know, Senator McLucas, how it would be possible, without descending into a fit of echolalia, to convey changes in statistical aggregates without explaining those in terms of numbers. Of course Senator Santoro is talking in terms of numbers—big numbers—because he is quoting the figures, putting on the public record, the increase in the provision being made for people in aged care homes.
Let me remind you that the number of Australian government subsidised aged care places continues to increase. The ratio has been increased from 100 operational places to 108 operational places for every 1,000 people aged over 70, and double the proportion of places are offered in the community so that more older Australians can receive care in their own homes for as long as possible. While you, Senator McLucas and you, Senator Ludwig, divert this serious debate, which is of importance not only for older Australians but also for their families, into a tawdry political rant and an exercise in self-congratulation about the political success of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, the Howard government has, in fact, been getting on with the job of increasing the aged care places. The best your shadow spokesman can do is ridicule the minister for talking in telephone numbers because the number of places is a large number. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-09-11,"—This whole argument has degenerated into a very shabby attack on people who have genuine concerns about aged care in this community. I challenge the senators on the other side to attend some of the Senate estimates processes where senators from this side across the board, with some support generally from some of the people from the government as well, look painstakingly at the specific issues of aged care services in our community. If any of the senators who have been involved in this discussion from the government would care to go back and look at the questions that were asked of the minister today, they would see we were asking specifically about aged care services, about the number of beds that are available. In this case we were asking about Queensland, but the figures could be extended across the whole country. In my question to the minister, I asked specifically about bed opportunities for Queenslanders and the minister got up and had a go. I am not even going to attempt to define some of the terms that Senator Brandis just used because I am not sure how you spell them, let alone how you say them. I asked about aged care beds that were currently available under the government’s proposals in the Logan River area. I also asked about the south coast area. These are people, Minister. We are not talking about numbers that can be read out. We are talking about opportunities for people to have effective aged care in their communities.
The current situation using these figures indicates that, under the ratio and formula that the government has introduced through media releases across the country over the last few months—and we celebrated the introduction of this increase in availability of beds—the numbers of beds are at a low in the Logan River Valley area. In the suburbs of Woodridge, Logan, Waterford, Albert, Springwood, Beaudesert, Gaven, Redland, Capalaba—a lot of those suburbs had the chance to vote in Queensland and made their obvious awareness of their conditions of service known at the ballot box—there was a negative result of over 300 on the government’s own expected figures of ratios of beds available. But even that looks pretty good in comparison with the south coast in the areas of Currumbin, Burleigh and Robina, which we know have an ageing population, where the demand for effective aged care is very high. It is not a new demand; it is a demand that everybody has known about for many years. In that area, under the government’s determined ratio of bed availability, the government is falling short by almost 600 beds.
That is not an argument just about numbers. The minister got up today and read off a whole range of figures which we have heard before when we have asked questions about what is happening with aged care. We have read the media releases that the minister puts out about budget initiatives. We have heard Senator Adams, again, talk about the range of initiatives that were brought in at the last budget. We are waiting to see them happen. We are waiting to see those services put in place. The members of the community have an expectation because they have been told by the government about the services that they are going to receive. The government have created an expectation. We are asking: where is the result? We do not want to get into some shabby discussion about election results. I think a few people have to take ownership for the way questions have been asked, and the responses made, in the weeks leading up to the state election in Queensland.
The minister today made two comments that I was particularly interested in. Amongst all the figures—and I have taken note of those as well—the minister in one response made these two statements: that Queensland has received ‘more than its fair share’ under the budget initiatives that he has ministerial responsibility for, and that ‘Queensland has got what it deserves to get under the formulas’. I am interested to see whether we are going to get what we deserve to get under the formula or more than our fair share, but I would hope that the people, particularly in the areas of Logan River Valley and the south coast, would be able to expect that they will have access to beds for their aged relatives and for those of them who need it. We will not degenerate to the kind of shabby discussion that we have heard today and also in the process. We need direct answers to questions, not meaningless rhetoric.

Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 132
The Environment Protection Regulations specify revised provisions concerning the regulation of persons, vessels and aircraft within the Australian Whale Sanctuary. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations introduce similar provisions to regulate the impact on cetaceans within the Marine Park.
New subregulation 8.04(3) of the Environment Regulations creates a strict liability offence if the person operating a vessel fails to move away from a cetacean at “a constant slow speed”. The same phrase is used in paragraph 8.05(2)(a), which is also a strict liability offence. This imposes an imprecise obligation on a person operating a vessel.
Regulation 8.09A, of these Regulations specifies certain offences concerning swimming with cetaceans. However, there is no provision for a defence, similar to that found in subregulations 8.05(6) and 8.06(4), stating that it is a defence if the cetacean has approached the person.
Similar comments apply to subregulation 117D(3), paragraph 117E(2)(a), and regulation 117J of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations.

Dear Minister
I refer to the following Standards made under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.
Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006
Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006
Sections 6 and 7 in each of these two instruments prohibit a licensee from broadcasting programs that could reasonably be construed either as recruiting people to join terrorist organisations, or as soliciting funds for such organisations. A licensee will be in breach of these standards regardless of whether the licensee knows that the program could reasonably be construed in this way. The Explanatory Statement does not indicate why the element of the licensee’s knowledge has not been included in sections 6 and 7.
Further, notwithstanding sections 6 and 7, section 9 permits a licensee to broadcast a program that “merely gives information about, or promotes the beliefs or opinions of, a terrorist organisation”. If section 9 is intended to operate as a defence against an apparent breach of sections 6 or 7 it is not clear whether the licensee bears the burden of establishing that the program merely gives information or promotes certain beliefs.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 16 June 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Standards. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Standards made under the 
Broadcasting Services Act 1992


Thank you for your letter of 11 May 2006 concerning the operation of the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006 and the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006.


I note that these Standards address a significant community concern by aiming to prevent the broadcast of programs that directly recruit or solicit donations for terrorist organisations and terrorist activities.


As the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has responsibility for the determination of these Standards, I have sought its advice in relation to the matters raised by the Committee.


Sections 6 and 7— knowledge of licensees


ACMA has advised that they intentionally decided against including provisions in the Standards that would require a licensee of a narrowcast television service to 
knowingly
 broadcast programs that could reasonably be construed as recruiting people to join terrorist organisations or to solicit funds for such organisations.


The reason for this decision was to provide a clear disincentive to a licensee of a narrowcasting television service to broadcast programs from sources that may carry a risk of breaching the Standards, without first vetting or viewing the programs and making an informed assessment about them. The licensee bears responsibility for the service and as such it is appropriate that it is obliged to be aware of its content. The strict liability approach taken by ACMA is necessary in order to ensure that an effective enforceable obligation is established.


ACMA notes the Committee’s observation that the Explanatory Statement does not indicate why the licensee’s knowledge has not been included. ACMA staff have subsequently undertaken to recommend to the Authority that the Explanatory Statements be amended to include further information about these two sections, explaining the reasons for applying strict liability to licensees that broadcast material in breach of the Standards.


Section 9—exemption for licensees providing information only


ACMA has advised that section 9 of the Standards is not a defence against breaches of sections 6 or 7. Rather, the intention of section 9 is to narrow the scope of the Standards by excluding those broadcasts that are deemed merely informative.


I note the Committee’s query in relation to whether it is the licensee who will bear the burden of establishing that a program merely gives information or promotes certain beliefs. I understand that as ACMA’s investigation process is inquisitorial, the licensee will not bear the burden of proof in any process that might involve consideration of the application of the Standards. Rather, ACMA would determine whether the standard has been breached, having regard to any conduct of a licensee, on the balance of probabilities.


I trust this information addresses the Committee’s queries about the Standards. The contact officer in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on these matters is Mr Gordon Neil, General Manager, Licensed Broadcasting. He can be contacted on 62711712.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 16 June 2006 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006 and the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006.
In your response you advise that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) intentionally decided against including provisions in the Standards that would require a licensee of a narrowcast television service to knowingly broadcast programs that could be reasonably construed as either recruiting people to join terrorist organisations or as soliciting funds for such organisations (sections 6 and 7). The Committee notes that these sections are intended to discourage licensees from broadcasting programs without first vetting or viewing their content and making a decision as to whether they breach the Standards.
You also advise that the intention of section 9 is to narrow the scope of the Standards by excluding those broadcasts that are deemed merely informative and that it is not a defence against breaches of sections 6 and 7.
The Committee would appreciate further advice on how sections 6, 7 and 9 are intended to interact. In particular, how may a person distinguish between a broadcast that merely promotes the beliefs or opinions of a terrorist organisation, and a broadcast that could reasonably be construed as recruiting people to join a terrorist organisation? In such instances, who would determine what is reasonable and whether a program breaches sections 6 or 7?
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 28 July 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Standards. In the meantime, as a precautionary measure, the Committee has given a notice of motion to disallow the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006. The Committee has agreed that it will give a further notice of disallowance on the remaining Standard in August if more time is needed to resolve its concerns with these Standards.
Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Standards made under the 
Broadcasting Services Act 1992


Thank you for your letter of 22 June 2006 regarding your request for clarification in regard to sections 6, 7 and 9 of the Broadcasting Services (Anti-terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Services) Standard 2006 and the Broadcasting Services (Anti-terrorism Requirement for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006.


As the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has responsibility for the determination of these Standards, I have sought its advice in relation to the matters raised by the Committee.


In regard to your query regarding the interaction between sections 6, 7 and 9 of the Standards, ACMA has advised that the Revised Explanatory Statements registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 6 July 2006 provide further clarification around the operation of these sections.


Sections 6 and 7 of the Standards do not prohibit a program that merely promotes the beliefs or opinions of a terrorist organisation and may inadvertently encourage people to join or otherwise financially support the organisation. This exception is contained in section 9 of the Standards and ensures that freedom of expression is not unduly restricted. Section 9 does not operate as a defence; rather it limits the application of the prohibition in the first place.


In regard to your query concerning the means by which a person may distinguish between a broadcast that ‘merely promotes the beliefs or opinions of a terrorist organisation’ and a broadcast that ‘could reasonably be construed as recruiting people to join a terrorist organisation’; ACMA has advised that only programs that “directly” encourage people to join the organisation or become involved in its activities (for example, by calling for new members and giving contact information) or solicit or collect funds (for example, by giving information about where funds may be sent) are prohibited by sections 6 and 7 of the Standards. For example, as indicated in section 7(2), a program that called for viewers to make donations to a terrorist organization named in the Criminal Code and provided bank account details or other means of making payment to the organisation, could not be broadcast.


The licensee will only breach the standard if the program can ‘reasonably be construed’ as:

directly recruiting a person to join, or participate in, the activities of a terrorist organisation; or
soliciting or assisting in the collection or provision of funds for a terrorist organisation.
What is reasonable involves an objective assessment of what a reasonable viewer, with knowledge of the meaning of ‘terrorist organisation’ in the Criminal Code and these standards, would draw from the program. It is a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances of each case.
As advised in my letter to the Committee of 16 June 2006, ACMA’s investigation process is inquisitorial; the licensee does not bear the burden of proof in any process that might involve consideration of the application of the standard. Rather, ACMA would determine whether the standard has been breached, having regard to all relevant matters including the submissions of a licensee, on the balance of probabilities.
I trust this information is of assistance and addresses the Committee’s further queries about the Standards. The contact officer in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on these matters is Mr Simon Cordina, General Manager, Digital Content Branch.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 9 August 2006 providing clarification on the interaction of sections 6, 7 and 9 of the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Television Narrowcasting Services) Standard 2006 and the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirement for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006.
The Committee has found your advice on the interaction of these sections, and the revised explanatory material, very helpful. However, the Committee still remains concerned about the level of uncertainty that may arise out of the operation of these Standards. While you indicate that an objective assessment will be made as to whether a program has breached the Standards, broadcasters are faced with having to make a subjective decision about the content of that program before (or as) it goes to air.
For example, how will a broadcaster determine the point at which a program becomes one that seeks funds for or promotes terrorism if it is not immediately apparent? For instance, if a program seeks funds to aid a refugee charity which is later found to be linked to a terrorist organisation, will it still be caught by this prohibition even though the funds were only for humanitarian aid? It appears that broadcasters are being asked to make subjective judgements about programs and hope that they do not contravene the Standards. The Committee understands that broadcasters have themselves raised this uncertainty with ACMA. Given these uncertainties, will any further guidance be provided to broadcasters to assist them in determining whether the content of a program breaches the Standards beyond the ‘reasonable person’ test?
The process for assessing whether a program breaches the Standards also raises some concerns. In your response you advise that the Standard imposes an objective test—“what is reasonable involves an objective assessment of what a reasonable viewer, with knowledge of the meaning of ‘terrorist organisation’ in the Criminal Code and these standards, would draw from the program”. The Committee notes that the definition in the Criminal Code provides that a terrorist organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in or planning a terrorist act, or is one that is specified by the regulations. A terrorist organisation may often be known by a variety of names which either change from time to time, requiring changes to the regulations, or which may not be specified in the regulations at the time a program is broadcast. It may therefore be difficult for a broadcaster, or a reasonable viewer, to have sufficient knowledge of the relevant law to determine whether a program has breached the Standards at the time it is televised.
Given these concerns, the Committee also seeks your advice as to what consequences, if any, are faced by a broadcaster if a program is subsequently found to be in breach of the Standards, and what rights of review or appeal are available where ACMA makes an adverse finding?
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 1 September 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Standards. In the meantime, as advised in its letter of 22 June 2006, the Committee has also given a notice of motion to disallow the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006 today to give it more time to resolve its concerns with these Standards.
Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Watson

Anti-Terror Standards made under the 
Broadcasting Services Act
 1992

Thank you for your letter of l0 August 2006 seeking further clarification on the operation of the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirements for Subscription Narrowcasting Services) Standard 2006 and the Broadcasting Services (Anti-Terrorism Requirement for Open Narrowcasting Television Services) Standard 2006 (the Standards).
As you are aware the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has responsibility for the determination of these Standards and I have sought advice from ACMA on the additional matters the Committee has raised.
ACMA has noted the Committee’s concerns about the nature of judgements a broadcaster may need to make to comply with the Standards as currently drafted, and considers this could be best addressed by amending the Standards to provide greater certainty in determining which individuals or organisations are deemed to be terrorist entities.
In this regard, ACMA has indicated that it intends to seek public comment on a proposal to amend the Standards to replace the expression ‘terrorist organisation’ wherever it appears in each Standard with ‘listed terrorist’. This will confine the operation of the Standard to those organisations listed in the Criminal Code Regulations 2002, as amended from time to time, or in the consolidated list of proscribed persons and entities kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealings with Assets) Regulations 2002 (‘the DFAT consolidated list’).
The DFAT consolidated list includes a more extensive list of specified individuals and organisations, in addition to those referred to as ‘listed terrorist organisation[s]’ in the Criminal Code. This approach will provide narrowcast broadcasters with greater certainty as they will be able to determine whether any particular person or organisation is a listed terrorist at any particular time by consulting the list in the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 and the DFAT consolidated list. Subject to consideration of any public comments on the proposal, ACMA intends to amend the Standards to give effect to this proposal.
Where ACMA determines that the Standards apply (i.e. the material is not exempt under sections 8 or 9) and the program can be reasonably construed as directly recruiting or soliciting funds for a listed terrorist, ACMA may use its powers to enforce compliance with the Standards. Section 5(2)of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires ACMA to use its powers in a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the breach concerned. ACMA’s current enforcement options in the event of a breach of the Standards include:
acceptance of voluntary undertakings in appropriate circumstances;
issuing a notice directing the broadcaster to take action to ensure that the service is provided in such a way as to comply with the requirements of the licence. It is an offence not to comply with a notice;
referral of the matter of non-compliance with the Standard to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP); and
application to the Federal Court for an order that the person providing the service cease providing that service.
The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 does not provide for internal or merits review of these enforcement mechanisms, however an action may be available under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in respect of the issuing of the notice to comply and each of the more serious forms of enforcement are imposed through a court.
ACMA has also advised that it will determine guidelines to assist licensees in applying the Standards. It is proposed that these guidelines will particularly focus on:
how to determine whether a person or an organisation is a ‘listed terrorist’;
“recruiting for a terrorist” at section 6 of the Standard and “financing terrorism” at section 7 of the Standard; and
reminding narrowcast broadcasters that complying with the Standards does not abrogate the need to comply with other relevant laws such as the provisions of the Criminal Code.
I trust this information is of assistance and that ACMA’s proposal to amend the Standards will address the Committee’s concerns about providing greater certainty for narrowcasters in complying with their requirements. The contact officer in the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in relation to this matter is Mr Simon Cordina, General Manager, Digital Content Branch. He can be contacted on 02 6217 1858.

Senator Bob Brown to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
notes that:
a report of the United States of America Republican-led Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that there is no evidence of any relationship between the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein and al‑Qaeda, and
the Government is yet to state whether it now believes that any such link ever existed; and
calls on the Government to outline when it first became aware of concerns that there was no link between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al‑Qaeda.

Senator Milne to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
notes that:
various global oil depletion protocols have recently been proposed, and that the basic principle underpinning each is that oil importing nations agree to reduce their imports by an agreed yearly percentage (the world oil depletion rate), while producing countries would agree to reduce their rate of exports by their national depletion rate,
such protocols seek to prevent profiteering from shortage, avoid destabilising financial flows arising from excessive oil prices, encourage the avoidance of waste and stimulate investment in alternative energies, and
the next meeting of the Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will take place in Melbourne in November 2006 and that the issues listed for discussion include energy security; and
calls on the Government to include consideration of an oil depletion protocol on the agenda of the 2006 G-20 meeting.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,NOTICES,10,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-09-11,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the annual report of the committee’s activities for 2005-06. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Section 31 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 requires the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security to report to the parliament annually on the committee’s activities during the previous year. I present the following report as a fulfilment of that requirement. This process is an opportunity for the committee to inform the parliament of the committee’s work in a consolidated form. It is also an opportunity for the committee to review its own work and to review the act as it affects the committee’s operations.
The Intelligence Services Act is relatively new, having been passed in 2001. The committee has been in place since March 2002. Over that time, the work of the committee has evolved and grown because of the nature of the times, something that does not need elaboration for the Senate. Each year the committee has found itself with a steady stream of legislative review, reviews of proscriptions as well as its core requirement of scrutinising the administration and expenditure of the intelligence agencies. The breadth of the oversight task has also grown because of the inclusion in this last year of three additional agencies into the responsibilities of the committee. The committee is still in the process of establishing its procedures and practices as far as the oversight of administration and expenditure is concerned. This report canvasses some of the complexities that the committee faces in managing its responsibilities. However, this is a work in progress and future annual reports will no doubt continue to examine the challenges faced by a committee such as this one.
Last year saw amendments to the Intelligence Services Act which changed the committee’s name from the ASIO, ASIS and DSD committee to the Intelligence and Security Committee. This reflected the fact that, on the recommendation of the Flood inquiry in 2004, the committee’s responsibilities for oversight had increased to include all six intelligence agencies: ASIO, ASIS, DSD, DIO, DIGO and ONA. The size of the committee was increased from seven to nine members with the addition of a new opposition senator and a new government member of the House. A position of deputy chair has been created. The committee now has the capacity to form subcommittees should the pressure of work dictate the need for them.
In the last year, the committee tabled six reports: four reviews of terrorist listings and two reviews of legislation—one a major review of the ASIO questioning and detention powers. In addition, the committee has conducted a review of the recruitment and training procedures of all six intelligence agencies, although this report was tabled outside the reporting period for this report. The committee also has a program of regular private briefings involving the directors of the agencies, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and visitors—overseas counterpart committees or specialists. Details of all of these activities are listed in the report. The committee has chosen to highlight three issues of procedural and practical interest in this report.
The first affected the conduct of the inquiry into ASIO’s questioning and detention powers. The committee sought clarification of its powers in relation to the calling of witnesses who might have been associated with the operation of the powers under division 3 part III of the ASIO Act. Such people are subject to strict secrecy provisions under the ASIO Act. Nevertheless, the committee had a statutory obligation under the Intelligence Services Act to review the operations of the provisions. The committee sought to conduct as thorough a review as possible while not exposing individuals wishing to give evidence to any serious legal ramifications. Advice received from Mr Bret Walker SC affirmed the rights and protection of witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry so long as the provisions of the Intelligence Services Act for the taking of sensitive evidence were observed. The second issue related to the preservation of archive copies of classified documents within the committee’s own records, a matter that would require amendment of the Intelligence Services Act.
Finally, the committee remains concerned about the application of the non-disclosure provisions of sections 6 and 7 of the Intelligence Services Act. These blanket provisions, which require a series of permissions for both the taking of evidence and the clearances for reports, have been brought to prominence by the increasing role of the committee in legislative review. This is a process which does not necessarily involve national security information and more closely approximates normal parliamentary processes. The committee believes there may be scope for a refinement of sections 6 and 7 to accommodate what are unforeseen circumstances in the work of the committee. This is a report which covers the work of this committee for the past 12 months. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Intelligence and Security Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,14,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-11,"—The issue raised by Senator Ferguson is a most interesting one—that is, this parliament passed an intelligence act that required secrecy in division 3 part III but also required the parliamentary committee to inquire into its operations. At first view of this issue, I would have thought that parliamentary privilege would have overcome the existing statutory provisions of this act, but it was most fortunate that we did not have to try to reconcile those two issues. The very fact that the act had a requirement for parliamentary review of the act implied that those secrecy provisions would not be necessary. The committee itself treated these areas sensitively. I do not think any information was disclosed at all that would have been of any embarrassment or in breach of the act.
I am most grateful to Mr Bret Walker SC for the very incisive advice that he gave us at a very reasonable price, and he has always done that for parliamentary committees. Too often, you do not see senior counsel giving us a good discount rate out of public service and public duty.
The second issue that has come up is the handling and retention of documents. We are obviously given documents and submissions that have various classifications. It is quite clear that, under the act, we are required to return certain documents. This creates a dilemma for the committee: how do we continue to exist with incomplete records? For the most part, the agencies have been fairly liberal in their interpretation, and we have been able to retain for committee records some of these documents. In the last year, however, ASIO has required that two complete sets of documents be returned to the agency. That, in turn, could have created a problem inasmuch as committee members may have made internal notes on these documents which would have revealed the internal deliberations of the committee and therefore would have been disclosed to ASIO officers receiving it. A compromise was drawn up and those documents are now returned to ASIO, accompanied by a committee member and destroyed within their sight—a rather sensible arrangement, I thought.
The only time that I have expressed any disappointment at the government’s response to our deliberations goes back to the sunset clause on the questioning and detention regime. We as a committee recommended a 5½-year sunset clause. We calibrated it to fit the political cycle, we agonised over it and, in the end, it was not so much a compromise as a complete agreement by the committee that that was the appropriate date for a sunset clause.
Initially, the Attorney-General’s Department, ASIO and the government opposed any sunset clause. Eventually, they compromised and gave us a 10-year sunset clause. Not many of us really regard 10 years as a sunset clause. I raise this issue again just to say that I think governments have to be sensitive to the fact that the more powers that they seek for intelligence agencies, the more they have to be balanced by more scrutiny. Scrutiny is always enhanced when a piece of legislation disappears after 5½ years and you need a proactive decision to resurrect that piece of legislation. As such, I am disappointed. But you do not win everything in politics; you do not win everything as a committee. I accept that. On the whole, the government have been quite reasonable in giving proper consideration to the views. We are, by the way, not the font of all wisdom. We are not always right, and some of our recommendations will be wrong. We just have to accept that some will be rejected. But, in the case of the sunset clause, I still maintain that we are right.
Although this committee was set up in 2002, it had a predecessor in a committee that went back 20 years before that. In the time I have been on this committee, every report bar one has been unanimous. That is not because committee members are great compromisers. They generally approach things, as much as possible, in a bipartisan way. It is never possible to discard your prejudices or your political position. That would be asking too much. If you could find a senator here who would do that then, frankly, I would think they were worthless. If they could so discard their prejudices and their political position, I would not want them here.
The committee has worked hard at consensus. We did disagree over the government listing PKK as a terrorist organisation, although I have to say that no-one on the committee recommended disallowance. Two members recommended reassessment; seven members put in some cautions but recommended that it be continued with. I do not think it is necessarily a bad thing that we do not always produce unanimous reports; I think it is a good idea always to aim at it.
Senator Ferguson mentioned that the committee have been subject to many high-level briefings over the last year just to keep ourselves informed. That is especially valuable when new members of the committee are joining us. We have also seen delegations from the United States, the United Kingdom and, in my absence, they saw a delegation from Vietnam. Later this year, there are at least one or two more delegations coming by.
A development that I also want to commend is the attendance by committee members at the biannual oversight conference. This is a conference of inspectors-general and parliamentary intelligence scrutiny committees that meets every two years to exchange ideas. The next such meeting is in October in Cape Town and the government, I think, very kindly has consented to committee members attending that so that they can better inform themselves. I think that is an excellent development.
Historically, I think one problem we have had, but which is no longer plaguing us, is the fact that staff members of each committee member of this committee have to be positively vetted. This can be a very intrusive process and probably has put off a couple of potential staffers from wanting to go through that very tough process. However, currently, the committee secretariat is doing an excellent job, including the secretary, Ms Swieringa; the inquiry secretary, Ms Hearn; the research officer, Dr Ollif; and also the executive assistant, Mrs Quintus-Bosz. Those four people make a terrific team. It is one of the best staffed committees I have seen for a long while. All the inquiries have proper preparation and the briefing is always excellent. I would like to commend them on the work they put in for this annual report.
Almost lastly, I would like to say that I am very pleased that the issue of a deputy chair was resolved. Initially, it was the intention of the government to have a government deputy chair. They were concerned that if the chairman was absent for long lengths of time this would leave the opposition in charge of the committee. The easy compromise was to say, ‘If that circumstance happens, you have our word that a government person will be able to chair the committee but, in the meantime, let’s have an opposition deputy chair. That means that the chair and deputy chair, when necessary, can get together, agree, conspire or do whatever else they like to be able to move issues forward without having to call a complete committee meeting.’
I am very pleased to say that Mr Anthony Byrne from the Labor Party is now deputy chair of the committee. I suppose his main qualification is that he was the only one of the four Labor members to have a political career in front of him rather than behind him. So we think he will get full value out of the deputy chair’s position.
The last thing I wanted to mention was that we lost a committee member during this period of report. That was Senator Sandy Macdonald, who twice served on this committee. The electors put him on the interchange bench for a few months, so he had to go off the committee while he made his own way in life, but then he came back to the chamber. Senator Sandy Macdonald always was engaged in the issues before the committee. He was always a contributor and always had an intense interest in the issues before us. I do hope that, after the next election, he is qualified to come back and join us—maybe even as the deputy chair. That would be a most appropriate position.

That means that the chair and deputy chair, when necessary, can get together, agree, conspire or do whatever else they like to be able to move issues forward without having to call a complete committee meeting.’
I am very pleased to say that Mr Anthony Byrne from the Labor Party is now deputy chair of the committee. I suppose his main qualification is that he was the only one of the four Labor members to have a political career in front of him rather than behind him. So we think he will get full value out of the deputy chair’s position.
The last thing I wanted to mention was that we lost a committee member during this period of report. That was Senator Sandy Macdonald, who twice served on this committee. The electors put him on the interchange bench for a few months, so he had to go off the committee while he made his own way in life, but then he came back to the chamber. Senator Sandy Macdonald always was engaged in the issues before the committee. He was always a contributor and always had an intense interest in the issues before us. I do hope that, after the next election, he is qualified to come back and join us—maybe even as the deputy chair. That would be a most appropriate position.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-09-11,"—I rise to speak in this second reading debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. I do not want to go over all of the arguments made by my colleague Senator Murray, who has principal carriage of this bill. We think it makes some sense to reform the Petroleum Retail Sites Act and even to replace it with the mandatory Oilcode but as he has said, and I have said, this should not be done before the Trade Practices Act is amended—and it should be amended to protected small business from large business. I do not think there has ever been such a good example of how, in the past, Australia has protected small business in the oil sector and in the retail sector, from the major oil companies who, as we know, would readily take up that sector.
The government needs to implement the Senate recommendations on the Trade Practices Act that were in the report of the Senate Economics References Committee of March 2003 entitled The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. We say that the government should, at the very least, implement those recommendations in that report with which it agreed. As I understand it, it accepted in full five of the recommendations and it accepted three in part. We would sooner see all of the recommendations picked up, but at the very least we argue that the Trade Practices Act must be changed before the Oilcode is introduced and replaces the Petroleum Retail Sites Act.
We would also like to see the collective bargaining provision in the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 dropped in its entirety. We do not support that legislation, and we say that the two bills, and a new trade practices bill, should be cognately dealt with. But obviously we are now dealing just with the one bill before us.
My main interest in speaking today is to draw attention to a related issue, and that is the failure of this government to put in place measures which would see a place for alternative fuels in petrol retailing. I am referring to biofuels—ethanol and biodiesel—and gaseous fuels, including LPG and compressed natural gas in particular but also liquefied natural gas. This government, despite an agreement being reached under the Biofuels Action Plan just a little over six months ago, has failed to get the industry to meet even the modest voluntary targets that were set for the first 12 months of that agreement. We have a biofuels target of 350 megalitres, which is hopelessly inadequate in the scheme of things. That is a tiny percentage of what could be used by the transport industry by way of fuel replacement.
We have seen almost no growth—in fact I think it is fair to say we have seen no growth—in the use of compressed natural gas. Compressed natural gas has great advantages, but I think it is correct to say that there are no metropolitan stations which sell compressed natural gas. This is puzzling because compressed natural gas comes in a pipe to most people’s households. It goes into their stoves and ovens and sometimes it heats their hot water, and yet this valuable and very low emissions fuel has been ignored by this government.
The Democrats did negotiate a conversion grant scheme back at the time of the GST and diesel changes in 1998. That conversion scheme runs out next year. After that, there will be nothing being done by this government to encourage compressed natural gas into the transport sector. The conversions have not been taken up because there are very few retail opportunities. I once had a car that was converted to run on compressed natural gas. It was a dual fuel car but there was only one location in Melbourne for refuelling. It was certainly a long way out of the way for me; it was in a dark industrial sort of space that was quite unsuitable.
Until we get the full range of fuels available in each of our petrol stations, Australia is not going to move very far away from its dependence on fossil fuels and on oil that is largely now imported into this country. We will not use up our existing resources and we will certainly not be moving much to renewable fuels until the government takes a big stick, quite frankly, if I can put it that way. With minimal targets, like 350 megalitres, where there is no requirement and nothing is mandated and it is all up to the sector to do or not do, with respect to either the production or the selling of alternative fuels, it is not going to happen.
In fact, the government, as we understand it, is sitting on a report of the first six months of the Biofuels Action Plan. It knows that the industry has not been able to meet the target and is not likely to meet its first 12-month target. But it is not going to tell us that, of course, having sold to the Australian community the idea that it was working very hard to keep petrol prices down and to welcome onto the market alternative fuels. It is a pathetic situation that we currently find ourselves in. For this reason, I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment from the Democrats that notes that Australia has the capacity, with production facilities that are already on the ground—these are not ones that are planned or that we might be going to see the bank about; these are production facilities that are already churning out ethanol—to produce 110 million litres of ethanol a year. But of course we know that the major oil companies are holding the cards. They have only purchased less than a quarter of that amount. So it is the oil companies that are reluctant to sell alternative fuels, including ethanol blends. As I said, they have failed to meet the voluntary targets that were set for selling biofuels, as required under the Biofuels Action Plan.
The government’s reluctance to do any sort of mandating has triggered some action in other states. In Queensland, which is very much ahead of the pack on ethanol blends because of its sugar industry, at least the Queensland government has taken steps to encourage the take-up of ethanol blends. And now the New South Wales government is looking at methods to mandate ethanol.
We will be calling on the government to introduce a mandatory target in the order of 90 per cent of all retail outlets to have available E10—that is, 10 per cent ethanol, 90 per cent petrol—and biodiesel blends by 2012. It is not possible for us to amend the bill to do this, although we have examined that; we would have liked to put up amendments, and I think it would have been very interesting to see what the National Party would do, given their previous commitment to mandated targets. We think that is a modest kind of target. We are not even talking here about the total amount that would need to be sold; we are simply saying that motorists should have the choice. This government talks a lot about choice, about the need for families to have choice and so on, but virtually no-one has the choice in my home state of Victoria. I think there is one outlet close-ish to me in south Melbourne, but for the rest of the motoring population in Melbourne it is largely unavailable.
So we would like to see incremental increases each year; we think 20 per cent would be reasonable. So from 1 January 2007 the industry would be on notice that it has to make E10 available to motorists at their service stations, and each year those increases would be 20 per cent from the previous year so that by 2012 most people would have access to both biodiesel blends and ethanol blends.
I think it is interesting to consider that just the other day there was a press report that Saab is introducing a new vehicle into the Australian market that runs on 85 per cent ethanol. Senators here will recall that it was not that long ago that the government introduced fuel standards that in fact prohibit anything more than 10 per cent ethanol blends. It will be interesting to hear what the minister has to say about that. Will this car not get off the ground, as it were, in this country, because it is against the law to sell a blend of petrol and ethanol that is higher than 10 per cent? We pointed out at the time the absurdity of this ban. It is presumably going to be tested with this new vehicle. It is a great pity that senators and members in this place are not able to purchase such a vehicle so that we could be leaders, trendsetters, and get these vehicles on the road as part of our electorate provision of a car.
We also say that, if the government is not amenable to that, we would like to see all fuel contain a percentage of ethanol or a renewable fuel by 1 January 2007, with percentage increases according to a published schedule—so we would ramp it up. Obviously, we cannot put 10 per cent into every litre of petrol that is sold today—you cannot ramp up production overnight. There is some indication that, if we were to produce as much ethanol or even biodiesel as that, we would be taking away from food production vast tracts of land. So we recognise that this is not the answer to everything, but it does at least help keep the price of petrol down to a modest level and make us less reliant on fossil fuels and on imported oil.
Another option is to establish a mandatory target of 30 per cent of all retail outlets to have available compressed natural gas—again, a very modest target. It is a chicken and egg situation in that people will not have their vehicles converted to compressed natural gas if there are no retailers who sell it. Quite frankly, that is a pretty straightforward observation. As I understand it, it is possible to have a very small compressor at home, where you can hook it up to your garage and have it pump away during the night, compressing gas into your vehicle. That would be very cheap and, at the present time, not taxed. It seems to me that the home option and the option of having compressed natural gas available from your local petrol retailer would make a lot of sense.
That is the thrust of the amendment I am foreshadowing and will move, and I notice that the ALP have moved a not dissimilar second reading amendment. It is good to see the ALP finally recognising that alternative fuels have a place in the future of our transport sector, and this is welcome. For a long time the ALP joined with the government and voted in excise regimes which were inappropriate and which caused some of the major problems in confidence in biofuels. They thought that was a useful thing to do in this country, but it was not. It is good to see that the ALP have finally seen the light and recognise that the future in this country will, at least partly, be about alternative fuels.
I also recognise that there are some in this place who will want to see excise reduced on fuel. They will see that as an option, a way in which people can better afford petrol, but we do not see that as the answer. The government froze excise on petrol many years ago, and a great deal of revenue has been forgone as a result of that, so now Australia’s petrol is some of the cheapest in the world. The problem with that is that it has encouraged us to keep on purchasing big vehicles—four-wheel drives, V8s and V6s—so we are still consuming petrol at a terrific rate in this country when other countries have recognised the need to scale down to smaller cars and to have more fuel efficient vehicles in our mix.
It is interesting to note that in the last week I received a letter—no doubt many of us did—from Minister Abbott’s department offering the new range of vehicles for our electorate cars. We do not have, for instance, a rating on the list of cars that are available, and that list includes V8s and V6s—huge fuel-consuming vehicles. We do not have the green car rating, from which senators and members might be able to make an informed decision about what they are signing off on. We do not have any indication of the other cars which have been previously approved as non-standard vehicles, such as my Toyota Prius. I have now had three Toyota Priuses, and I use this opportunity to say how good they are and how little fuel they consume, but there is nothing in the list of cars available to us which suggests that the Prius is available. I may have to send a memo around to everybody explaining to them that it will be okayed if they put their hand up for it. I can recommend it as a beautiful car to drive, one which makes hardly any noise and uses less than one-third the fuel of a car of a similar size and a great deal less than some of the V8s and V6s that are on the list.
It is disappointing that we have a government that is interested in reform of a certain sort—reform that benefits the big oil companies—and does not care much about consumers. It does not care much about the environment, it does not care much about oil security and it is not interested in the long-term future of this country with regard to where our energy is going to come from for transport. I have also said many times in this place that this government does not care about alternatives, even to the private car.
We still have a situation in which this government—and it is one of very few in history—does not put any energy, time or money into the question of public transport. After the oil prices skyrocketed just a few weeks ago we heard people starting to say, ‘Now it’s almost cheaper for us to travel by public transport.’ I hope people do move across to public transport, particularly for commuting long distances, so that they do not sit in traffic jams on freeways for hours on end. I am sure it must be better to be reading the paper on a tram or a train and going to work in a less stressful environment. But, quite frankly, our public transport system is not up to meeting the needs of the vast majority of commuters. That is why they opt for a comfortable vehicle with air conditioning and a radio which takes them from point A to point B, instead of opting for transport where they might have to stand around waiting for lengthy periods of time and which will not connect with another transport mode to get them to their place of work or wherever they want to go.
So my message to the government through this legislation is that the government needs to look beyond this microscale, this micro kind of reform which sees to it that the major oil companies will own more petrol stations and which will move independents out of the sector even more than has been the case in the past. The government appears not to care very much about the future of our transport needs, our oil needs and the cost of transporting ourselves around.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-11,"—Family First believes the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 will not ensure the lowest possible petrol prices for families and small businesses. That is why Family First will be moving amendments to the bill to ensure that no company selling petrol can own or operate more than 25 per cent of petrol retail sites. Family First wants to try to level the playing field for small businesses competing with the oil giants because that will lead to the lowest possible petrol prices for families and small businesses.
It is generally agreed that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 are outdated, no longer serving their intended purpose and should be removed. Apart from anything else, these acts were written before the petrol retail market was transformed by the entry of the supermarkets Coles and Woolworths. Family First believes the proposed Oilcode fails to adequately address this reality and is concerned the Oilcode would allow even greater market dominance by the major players. This would threaten independent service stations, which are vital for a competitive petrol market and to ensure the lowest possible petrol prices. Let me be clear: Family First wants the lowest possible petrol prices for families and small businesses. There is a tendency in small markets such as Australia’s for large companies to keep getting bigger until there are only a handful of players controlling the sector.
Family First is convinced there will be fewer and fewer petrol retailers and less and less competition unless we have adequate regulations to ensure a genuinely competitive market. The current Trade Practices Act is not up to the job. Woolworths and Coles already have a stranglehold over Australia’s supermarkets and are now seeking dominance in service stations. It is estimated that Shell and Coles and Caltex and Woolworths may already control up to 70 per cent of the retail petrol market. Family First’s amendment will restrict the number of sites that a company or partnership can own or operate to 25 per cent of all service stations. That would mean the alliance between Caltex and Woolworths could only own or control 25 per cent of sites and the Shell and Coles Myer alliance could also only own 25 per cent of sites. Companies or alliances that already operate or control more than 25 per cent of petrol retail sites will not be allowed any more.
Family First’s amendment will put a lid on market dominance, to benefit families and small businesses. Family First’s action strikes a good balance between two extremes. No regulation means the law of the jungle, where only the biggest survive. Too much regulation chokes the market and is a burden on all business, particularly small business. Putting a lid on market dominance is fair and reasonable regulation. It makes sense. It allows the big end of town to survive as well as the independents.
Family First is also concerned that service stations cannot buy at the best price as they are small players without bargaining power. That is why Family First will move an amendment to give service stations automatic exemption to collectively bargain with the oil giants to buy fuel. Everyone accepts small businesses need bargaining power when negotiating with big business. So why should service stations be burdened with an application process and be forced to get permission to collectively bargain? It does not make sense. This is time consuming and there is no guarantee of receiving permission either under the current system or under the government’s proposed changes.
The Senate approved simpler collective bargaining notification procedures last year, but the government has stubbornly refused to implement them and is trying to blackmail the Senate to also pass merger changes to help the big end of town. It does not make sense. Family First believes small business should not have to suffer and wait around while the government engages in such power plays. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has said the Oilcode will introduce a nationally consistent approach to terminal gate pricing which will:
... improve transparency in wholesale pricing and allow access for all customers, including small businesses, to petroleum products at a published terminal gate price.
Family First’s amendment would achieve greater transparency, by making clear the breakdown in prices, including discounts, as well as how the service stations qualify for those different prices. Family First’s changes will not stop discounting but do address the concerns of independent service stations and other small businesses that the criteria to qualify for those discounts need to be made public. Small business deserve to know what criteria they must meet to receive discounts.
Family First’s amendment also addresses a concern raised in the Senate committee which examined this bill about anticompetitive behaviour. Understanding how prices are set can help reduce anticompetitive behaviour. While small businesses may not have the buying power to qualify for bigger volume discounts, at least they will know how to make the most of their buying power. It is important to state that petrol is an essential resource and there are no ready alternatives for most consumers.
The four oil giants, due to their control of the market, can use their power to discriminate between service stations. Family First believes it should do everything it can to ensure that the risk of anticompetitive behaviour is reduced. One way to remove competition, such as that by independent service stations, is to refuse to supply them with petrol. The Oilcode states that suppliers must not unreasonably refuse supply, unless they do not have supplies themselves or they think the customer cannot pay or cannot transport the fuel safely.
Family First acknowledges there is a dispute resolution process, but what do service stations do about getting supplies while a complaint is being investigated? In this situation the oil giants have all the power. They could delay resolving disputes and threaten the viability of small businesses at the same time. The Family First amendment switches the balance to the small business so that oil giants are not allowed to refuse supply except for health and safety reasons. That makes sense. When there is a dispute about supply—a dispute that could take a long time to resolve—Family First’s amendment requires the oil giants to supply on a most favoured customer basis so the small business does not suffer. Family First is seeking other senators’ support for this common-sense amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I also rise to contribute to the debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. I listened with great interest to the comments by Senator Fielding about the relationship between the Trade Practices Act and this bill, and the bills that are repealed through this bill. This bill repeals two pieces of legislation that were enacted more than 25 years ago—the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchising Act 1980, otherwise known as the franchise act, and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980, otherwise known as the sites act. The truth of the matter is that over that 25-year period there have been such profound changes in the petroleum marketing industry that the two pieces of legislation enacted all those years ago now cover less than 50 per cent of the industry by volume. So it is timely that the government reviews this legislation and removes it from the statute book, conditional upon the implementation of an Oilcode. Senator Fielding spoke at great length about the conditions of the Oilcode and the concerns that some parts of the industry had about shortcomings that they still perceived to be in the Oilcode. But, at this stage, it is an agreed set of arrangements between the players in the industry that has finally been brokered by the government.
Such repeal legislation has been contemplated by this government many times but sadly it has not been able to get that Oilcode development, which would provide for greater transparency and a more even playing field for all participants in the industry, until now. Labor supports the repeal of this very old legislation and the implementation of an Oilcode. The sites act is so old that it restricts the number of retail sites that prescribed oil companies—namely BP, Caltex, Mobil and Shell—can directly own and operate in Australia. The franchise act sets out the minimum conditions and terms for franchise agreements between the oil majors and the franchisees. One of the profound changes that has occurred over that 25-year period is the market entry of the large independent retailers chains that we saw in the 1980s and 1990s and, much more recently, the supermarket retailers. We have had many discussions in this place over recent months about the role of supermarket retailers and the relationships that they have with their petrol partners with the debate about the fuel excise legislation and now this legislation.
The Oilcode that has been brokered introduces, amongst other things, a nationally consistent approach to terminal gate pricing. I know that we have had much discussion in this chamber about just what terminal gate pricing is and who pays that amount. It provides for greater transparency in the wholesaling of petrol to independents and other players by the major oil companies. It also establishes a more efficient dispute resolution system to provide the industry with a more cost-effective alternative to taking disputes to court. There were some concerns raised during the inquiry of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee into this bill about that whole dispute resolution process. Some concerns were raised this morning in this debate by Senator Murray, who recounted the evidence that was received by the committee from some of the independents. They were again referred to by Senator Fielding when he was talking about the time constraints between lodging a complaint with the disputes process and having it heard.
This bill is very timely. People all over Australia are struggling with soaring petrol prices, interest rate increases and greater uncertainty in their workplaces. People are now spending a higher proportion of their income on mortgage payments than ever before. We saw in the Sydney papers on the weekend that there are now almost 5,000 mortgagee-in-possession sales going on in New South Wales as people relinquish their mortgages because they simply cannot afford them. At the last election, the Prime Minister promised to keep interest rates low, but people are now realising the hollowness of that promise. People now spend about 11 per cent of their household disposable income on mortgages compared to less than 10 per cent when interest rates peaked in 1989. So these families in my state—and your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—of New South Wales who are paying off a mortgage are hurting much more than they did in the past.
This bill shows us that the government is capable of taking corrective action in the retail petrol market. The question begs to be asked of why it has taken so long. Why has a 25-year-old regulatory regime been allowed to fester until today? Rather than take the initiative to resolve the issues raised by this bill, we have had discussions about the Trade Practices Act. The recommendations of the Dawson inquiry into the Trade Practices Act have been sitting here and have been the subject of debate in this place and in the House of Representatives for years as we have waited for the government to take some action on those recommendations. In fact, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in 2004 reported on the Trade Practices Act amendments, investigated how the Trade Practices Act was protecting small businesses and made significant recommendations on the legislation, which again we are still waiting to see and which would strengthen the conditions of the Oilcode that are part of the whole package of this petroleum reform.
It was very interesting listening to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. The evidence suggested that the government did not proceed with the bill in 1998 because the affected parties could not agree on the Oilcode proposal. It has taken six years for the government to broker a compromise on this particular legislation and, on the evidence, there are still some parties—particularly the independents—that are very worried about some parts of the Oilcode.
However, there can be no doubt that vigorous marketplace competition is one step to holding petrol prices as low as possible; so we have waited to see this legislation come into the Senate, hoping that it has been drafted in a way that can mitigate the impact of petrol prices on ordinary Australians. We have had significant representations from both the ACCC and the Australian Institute of Petroleum about the importance of repealing the two acts and about the impacts that might have on petrol prices. Let us hope we do see the impacts that are anticipated from the repeal of these pieces of legislation. The committee actually recognised that neither act is effective and that neither act keeps pace with the structural changes that have taken place in the petroleum industry. The acts expose different parts of the industry to different regulatory requirements that are now very difficult to justify.
The entry into the market of the supermarket chains, with their market strength, means that it is necessary to ensure that all participants can compete on equal terms. Failure to do this is likely to lead to a lessening of competition if the refiners withdraw from the market altogether, which was something that was discussed during the hearings and was considered to be a possibility. That is possible if their competitive disadvantage is not addressed. The committee was also very concerned that failure to address these issues might lead to a continuing loss of refining capacity. We now know that we have lost more than half of Australia’s refining capacity over recent decades. As we have heard from several speakers’ contributions to this debate, that raises serious issues for Australia on energy security.
So, on the whole, the committee supported the repeal of the acts and considered that the proposed Oilcode would significantly improve the situation of many industry participants, particularly the commissioned agents who do not currently enjoy any of the protections afforded by the franchising act. These groups will also have access to a low-cost dispute resolution scheme for the first time. The committee also noted the concerns of some industry participants about aspects of the Oilcode, particularly in relation to tenure and the potential for abuse of market power. The committee did not believe that the concerns about tenure were very well founded, although they were passionately argued throughout the hearings, but we did suggest that the government revisit the issue of the $20,000 threshold for extended tenure under the Oilcode and we did express our concerns about the government’s need to bring forward amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, which we believed was a much more appropriate way to address these concerns.
The Labor senators argued the importance of section 46 of the Trade Practices Act and added some comments to the report which reflected our concerns about the fact that, in the Rural Press case that had been brought to the Federal Court and the High Court, the concept of abusing market power in another market had been brought into question. In the Boral case the very concept of market power was brought into question. The ACCC gave evidence that they had effectively given up taking cases under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act because they now knew that it had been rendered ineffective.
We made several recommendations in the report of the Senate inquiry on the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act on small business. These recommendations involved strengthening the Trade Practices Act, some of which the government has committed to. But much more needs to be done. The measures in this legislation do not achieve the objectives of encouraging competition in this sector in isolation from the section 46 reforms that the Senate has previously called for—and Senator Fielding made those points in his contribution to the debate. We on this side of the chamber believe that the most effective market outcome will not be achieved unless section 46 reforms are implemented concurrently. We note the comments of Mr Cassidy from the ACCC in evidence to the Senate inquiry:
I would say that, to the extent that there are shortcomings in the current section 46—and that is obviously well-travelled ground—we think the answer to that is to amend the section.
So the ACCC clearly supports the strengthening of section 46 to support competition in this and other markets—and I suspect Senator Joyce does too. Ideally, the government should commit to immediately legislating the recommendations of the Senate committee in relation to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act.
I note the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth recommendations of the Labor senators’ report. The first is that the legislation be amended to state that the threshold of a substantial degree of power in a market is lower than the former threshold of substantial control—a subtle difference but an important one—and to include a declaratory provision ‘outlining matters to be considered by the courts for the purpose of determining whether a company has a substantial degree of power in a market’. It says these matters should be based upon the suggestions outlined by the ACCC.
Recommendation 2 says:
The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to include a declaratory provision outlining the elements of ‘take advantage’ for the purposes of s.46(1). This provision should be based upon the suggestions outlined in ... this report.
We recommended:
... the Act be amended ... without limiting the generality of s.46, in determining whether a corporation has breached s.46, the courts may have regard to: the capacity of the corporation to sell a good or service below its variable cost.
Even in the current inquiry that is taking place into the supply and cost of petrol in Australia, we are hearing serious concerns about the way in which the independents in particular are feeling very vulnerable without the provisions of section 46 of the Trade Practices Act being amended by this government. We understand that the government will bring forward a bill that includes a small set of the recommendations but that it has been held up, as I said earlier, by the apparent linkage with the other trade practices bill—the Dawson report bill, which contained merger changes that were deleted from the bill in the Senate. So our recommendations, presented as an amendment by Senator O’Brien, relate to section 46, which constrains abuse of market power. They seek to toughen section 46, to allow the ACCC to crack down on the abuse of market power, and we know that this is an important concern of senators on both sides of the chamber. We believe that there should be no ducking and weaving on the other side in relation to this amendment, which will ensure only that huge corporations operate properly and fairly towards small businesses.
While one aim of this bill is to increase competition, we cannot forget that the main objective of competitors within a market is to eliminate competition. The increasing oligopolisation in this and many other industries pays testimony to this fact. The government should not half-complete its job of promoting competition in the petroleum industry by ignoring the vulnerability of small businesses to the blatant abuse of market power. High Court cases dealing with this issue do not bode well for the ACCC securing prosecutions for the misuse of market power under current provisions in the future. Again, we should not allow dysfunctional legal provisions to fester while market share is increasingly being concentrated in the hands of a few rather than in the hands of many.
In the past the government believed the best approach for controlling the power of the major oil companies was to specify the number of retail sites the companies could operate. As I have said, Labor believes the focus should be on reforming the Trade Practices Act. We need to ensure that the ACCC has the power to ensure that oil companies are not abusing their market power. Labor’s amendments to this bill reflect the recommendations of the Senate report into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act for small business. We want to toughen section 46 of the act to allow the ACCC to crack down on the abuse of market power.
While Labor accepts that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act represent an outdated model for regulation of the petrol retail sector—as they exclude major supermarket chains engaged in petroleum retailing and have been circumvented by major oil companies in some circumstances—I am also of the view that the principal issue in encouraging competition in this sector, and indeed across all markets, is the strengthening of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act against misuses of market power. That can only occur if the section 46 reforms are implemented concurrently. Even the ACCC has shown its clear support for strengthening section 46 to support competition in this and other markets—and I have quoted comments made by Mr Brian Cassidy to the original inquiry.
There are enormous challenges ahead for Australia as supplies of fossil fuels come under increasing pressure from the rapid pace of development in countries like India and China, but there are also opportunities for us as we develop our own resources. With vision and leadership there is the real prospect of major new industries opening up in areas such as natural gas and the conversion of coal to diesel. As a representative of a regional and rural electorate, I am very interested in the potential for large-scale ethanol and biofuels industries in Australia. What I do not want to see, though, for the people of Australia is ever-rising fuel prices and an increasing reliance on overseas oil, with our future prosperity and security held to ransom as a result of the government’s lack of initiative.
I commend the bill to the Senate. I look forward to seeing those long-awaited changes to the Trade Practices Act which need to be part of the Oilcode as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-09-11,"—I too want to join in the debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. As other speakers have said, the purpose of the bill is to introduce major reforms to the petroleum industry. The bill will facilitate greater transparency in the wholesale and retail fuel markets. The changes in this bill will lead to greater competition amongst the major players, which must ultimately have a positive effect on fuel prices at the pump. Senator Stephens, from the Labor Party Right, said vigorous market competition is one way to hold down petrol prices. That quote was worthy of my jotting down and quoting here in the chamber. That is a quote you would only ever hear from the Labor Party right wing, which has remnants of sense in regard to economics. You would certainly never hear it from the Labor Party Left, epitomised by Senator Carr.
The bill will abolish the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980. These are important dates to remember. The two acts, which once served a purpose, have now become outdated and ineffective. Frankly, the acts are a hindrance to industry competition and efficiency. Moreover, the acts have become a hindrance to many of the small operators whom they once sought to protect. The sites act sets a quota on ownership of petrol stations by the oil majors. The policy was to prevent the oil majors from dominating the market to the extent that competition would be severely reduced. That was a good intention back in 1980. The policy was introduced to protect and encourage an industry that was predominantly made up of small service stations. But that can no longer be said; today the structure has changed.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on this bill tells us that in 1980 there were some 20,000 service stations and that by 2004 the figure had fallen to 6,649. There has been an enormous shift and change in the industry whilst the sites act and the franchise act have been in place. The structure of the industry has completely changed, and the sites act, for one, is now hardly relevant to its original good intentions. With the adoption of multisite franchising arrangements, whereby a single operator or company will legally circumvent the act with franchise agreements to operate several sites, the sites act has, frankly, become a farce.
The two major supermarkets, Woolworths and Coles, own hundreds of service stations. Unless you are the chosen petrol brand of Coles, which is Shell, or the chosen brand of Woolworths, which is Caltex, you are locked out. What about the other two majors: BP and Mobil? Even they are finding it tough. Talk about catering to the big end of town; it just got bigger with both Shell and Caltex linking up with the two major supermarket chains. I want to refer to the economic legislation committee report on this bill. I will quote from what a Mobil representative said about this. He said:
 ... Mobil’s ability to respond effectively and in a timely manner to the rapid changes in the retail fuels market has been limited by the constraints placed on us under the sites and franchise acts.
The President of BP was also a witness before the committee. He said:
Reform is important to us largely because we do not have the freedom to operate the sites as efficiently as we can and thus to compete as best we can.
The point here is that these two majors have been locked out by the two major supermarkets. They are at a disadvantage, and that is unfair, in that they are uncompetitive against the other two majors. In the long run you may well get the absurd situation where those two, Mobil and BP, merge or just leave town. If they are unable to establish relationships like the other two majors have, it will have a long-term effect. Talk about catering to the big end of town; it just got bigger.
In regard to the franchise act, as with the sites act it has been superseded by the events in the market since its introduction in 1980. It is a fault of the act that it narrows the definition of what represents a franchise agreement. The act does not extend to small business operators or service station owners who have to deal with the petrol companies; nor does it cover the massive number of supermarket sites, independent operators or commissioned agents—all of whose presence has grown in the market since 1980. Certainly the big changes have come about in the past decade. Given these developments in the industry over the past 25 years, it is crucial that the industry adapts. It would be foolish to stand still and maintain the old structures. This is an industry vital to Australia’s economic wealth and its health and efficiency directly affects fuel prices at the pump. To this end, the government will be introducing the mandatory Oilcode code of conduct to replace the franchise and sites acts. I am very interested in that mandatory oil code of conduct given that at the moment the government is debating whether or not to have a mandatory horticultural code of conduct. That is definitely an aside. So to replace these two acts the government will be introducing a mandatory Oilcode code of conduct so as not to create an ethical void with the abolition of the two acts. To quote Minister Macfarlane’s second reading speech:
The package will recognise the power imbalance inherent in the substantial interdependency between some small businesses operating under the franchise and commission agency agreements and their wholesale fuel suppliers, whether those suppliers are oil majors or independent retail chains.
The components of the Oilcode will be a national terminal gate pricing regime; minimum standards for new fuel reselling arrangements; greater coverage for different forms of agreements, such as commissioned agencies; and a dispute resolution service. I would like to further quote from the minister’s second reading speech to give greater clarity and a surety to the other side in regard to the introduction of the Oilcode. The minister said:
The oilcode regulations will achieve this outcome through three key policy initiatives. It will establish minimum industry standards for fuel re-selling agreements between wholesale fuel suppliers and fuel retailers to provide a baseline for negotiations on those agreements. These minimum standards build upon and strengthen relevant provisions in both the franchise act and the more general franchising code of conduct and will provide greater certainty and protection for all parties to fuel re-selling agreements.
The oilcode will also introduce a nationally consistent approach to terminal gate pricing arrangements to improve transparency in wholesale pricing and allow access for all customers, including small businesses, to petroleum products at a published terminal gate price.
That is something we already have in Victoria, I might add. The minister continues:
This approach will not negate the ability of parties to negotiate individual supply agreements nor will it prevent the offering of discounts by wholesalers.
Finally, the oilcode will establish an independent downstream petroleum dispute resolution scheme to provide the industry with an ongoing, cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism as an alternative to taking action in the courts.
So any changes the government can facilitate—with the cooperation of the industry, of course—that support the industry to operate more efficiently are welcome, particularly in these times of high petrol prices. I can say that there are very few more consistently hot button issues in politics than the price of petrol, and for good reason because petrol prices go directly and swiftly to household budgets. It is worthy of note that Australia has the fourth lowest tax regime on petrol of the OECD countries, surpassed only by Canada—just—the USA and Mexico. Nevertheless, I recall that in 2001, when the price of petrol shot up to 85c a litre, a price which seems pretty reasonable now, there was an enormous public backlash against the government in regard to its indexation policy—ironically, a policy initiated by a Labor government.
However, we listened to the public in 2001 and abolished indexation. It is worthy to note that, if indexation were still in place today, the excise tax would be 54c, not the current 38c. I should also add that in 2000, with the introduction of the GST, the federal government implemented further measures to cap and reduce—or suppress—the price of petrol. When the GST was introduced in 2000, the level of excise on petrol and diesel was reduced by 6.7c per litre. Again, in 2001 the government reduced fuel excise by a further 1.5c per litre and, as I said before, in the same year abolished indexation.
In the time available, it is worthy to note that the existing excise tax is 38 cents. Whether it is 80c, 85c or $1.40, the federal tax is static. It is important to say that the federal government receives no windfall from higher petrol prices. In fact, the higher petrol prices are, the more the market reacts and consumes less. Therefore, at the federal level the tax take is less. It is the state governments that receive the big windfall out of this because of the 10 per cent GST on the petrol prices at the pump. You never see them making any commitment to reduce the taxes—not in the last decade—as this government has.
It was a Labor government which refused to sacrifice its budgets and reduce the petrol tax take, but the truth of the matter—as it is known by this chamber and is also generally known and accepted by the public—is that petrol prices are affected by world prices. Though, if you listen to the opposition, you would really think it was this government which dictated the price of a barrel of oil. What I have just said with regard to the tax regime being the fourth lowest in the OECD and the measures the government has taken over the past decade to reduce its take of petrol taxes puts a lie to the Labor Party claim.
The current high petrol prices yet again highlight the energy challenges facing Australia and our need to reduce reliance on oil and develop an alternative fuel market. To this end, only last month the Prime Minister brought down in parliament the government’s energy initiative statement, announcing new measures to further accelerate investment in alternative fuels and to provide Australian motorists with cheaper fuel options. The headline announcement was that the government would ‘bring forward the previously announced rebate for the purchase of new LPG vehicles for private use’. The statement further said that the government will:
… contribute $1,000 to the purchase cost of a new factory-fitted LPG powered vehicle.
In addition, the Government will provide a grant of $2,000 to the cost of converting vehicles to LPG for private use.
The energy statement further states:
While savings will depend on fuel consumption and driving habits, the Australian LPG Association estimates that, on average, the fuel bill for a six cylinder vehicle travelling 15,000 kilometres a year would be cut by $27 a week, or more than $1,400 a year ...
Ethanol blends—which have so often been debated in this chamber—can also make an important contribution to meeting Australia’s transport fuel needs. The Australian government has spent over $55 million to date in production grants to effectively offset the excise on ethanol production in Australia. We have already implemented a range of measures to help companies achieve a target of at least 350 megalitres of biofuels production in Australia by 2010. This government has worked hard to restore confidence in ethanol after the disgraceful campaign waged by the Labor Party 18 months ago or thereabouts.
In question time in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, Labor asked question after question, discrediting and slurring the ethanol industry just for base political purposes to the point that the public really did react against the ethanol industry and the possibility of it ever starting up in this country. They really did scare the public, and we have spent an enormous amount of time and resources to restore public confidence in that industry. And what do you know: Labor are now on board with the ethanol industry. They have done the complete circle. Suddenly, they now think the ethanol industry is worth supporting. They would be right in that respect—of course, they are. At least they see a winner in the ethanol industry. In June this year, Minister Macfarlane held a roundtable conference in Canberra of all the ethanol players. The news coming out of that conference was extremely encouraging indeed for the future of this industry. I will read from part of the minister’s statement:
A national roundtable on ethanol has heard that production of transport ethanol in Australia will have jumped by more than 50 per cent in the last 12 months, from almost 23 million litres in 2004‑05 to an expected 36 million litres by June 2005-06.
That is very encouraging to this government, which has been steadily building up the confidence of people in accepting ethanol in their cars, after the disgraceful Labor Party campaign against ethanol.
The reports from the ethanol sector at the roundtable meeting included: BP plans for a hundredfold increase in ethanol sites over the next two years; United Petroleum will increase ethanol retail sites from 67 to 130 by the end of 2006; Woolworths proposes to enter the ethanol market, with 50 sites by 2007; Caltex is to double the number of ethanol retail sites by the end of 2006; and Australian Farmers Fuel has 52 stations selling ethanol and biodiesel blends. So, as you can see, the ethanol industry is getting on its feet and production is increasing.
As I mentioned before, the recent government support for the ethanol industry has been not only through capital grants and research and development grants. We have also given it a honeymoon on excise till the middle of 2011, scaling up to 2015, after which this fuel will be on a competitive footing with other fuels. In short, the news is good in the alternative fuel market, if for no other reason than that petrol prices are so high, thus making alternative fuels even more competitive. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-11,"—I rise today to make some comments on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. I remain unconvinced by the government’s argument here. It seems to me that it is really quite simple. We have a situation where the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act do need revisiting. Everybody, I think, agrees with that. They have allowed the rise of retailing outside the acts’ ambit, most notably through the entry of supermarkets and the independent importers-marketers into the industry. And, although they were intended to ensure competition, the acts have also restrained competition by limiting the ability of the majors to compete with retailers operating outside the acts’ coverage. But the Greens do not believe that the Oilcode in its current form is sufficient to maintain the competitiveness of the independent retailers, because it does not prevent either below-cost selling or the provision of discounts to large-volume customers in the wholesale market.
It is obvious—as Senator Murray has argued, and as others in this chamber, notably Senator Joyce, have argued previously—that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act needs to be dealt with and strengthened before we move on any of these others, because people need some surety; they need some security about what is going on here. I am glad that Senator Murray for the Democrats has brought in a number of amendments which would strengthen the capacity of the parliament to support small business.
I am always interested to hear the government say it supports small business. From where I sit, time after time the actions that are taken do nothing to support small business—in fact, they undercut them and, really, drive them out of the industry. That is what is going to happen with regard to small independent outlets as a result of this legislation.
Nobody has been able to explain how, when you are allowing the majors to move in and sell below cost and access the discounts to large-volume customers in the wholesale market, the independents are going to compete with that. How could they? Can somebody in the government explain to me how the four majors operating in that way are going to leave any space for the small players? It just beggars belief, because that simply will not happen. The major players will reduce their prices, drive the small independent retailers out, take more market share themselves and then put up their prices, as is consistent with what they have done time and time again in the past.
Senator Murray’s amendments, I believe, are very important ones, because they, at least, move on the following principles. They look at this issue of some organisations having ‘a substantial degree of power in a market’. They look at a whole range of issues which would strengthen section 46, and I think that that is something that the government needs to look at. It is no use the government saying that they will deal with section 46 later. That does not give comfort to anyone because we do not know exactly how it is going to be dealt with. And, whilst this is a mandatory Oilcode, it does not go to those issues that I have just spoken about in relation to the Trade Practices Act.
Obviously, it does seek to prohibit the misuse of market power by organisations with a substantial degree of power in the market, but I think that if we move on that in the way Senator Murray has suggested it will be a very good thing. I note that some in the government are arguing that this view is absolutely wrong and that the mandatory Oilcode has satisfied the concerns of the small retailers. But, in fact, the Motor Trades Association of Australia—and it represents service station operators—has said it believes that the proposed code is defective because it will not ensure a level playing field that would allow small service station operators to compete fairly in the market with the large supermarkets and oil companies. And these are the people representing the small players. They go on to say that the outcome of the government’s changes will be the closure of more small franchised and independent retail outlets, meaning, in rural and regional areas in particular, that motorists will have to drive longer distances to obtain fuel.
We will see increased dominance of the retail petroleum market by the two supermarket chains. We will see loss of competition in the retail and wholesale markets as independent importers struggle to find sufficient retail outlets to sustain a viable import business. There will be detrimental impacts on motorists in the longer term as small competitors exit the market and the larger chains gain a greater share of the retail petrol market, leading to less price competition. And service station operators wonder where the benefits to motorists and the government are in these proposed reforms. The only winners here would seem to be the oil majors and the two supermarket chains. From my point of view, in the absence of the changes to section 46, that is the only conclusion that I can draw. The only winners here are, in fact, BP and Mobil, who will be able to get themselves into the market in a way that they have not been able to because of the dominance of Shell and Caltex.
To suggest, as members of the government have, that if BP and Mobil do not get their own way they might leave the country beggars belief. I do not know of any country in the world where those petrol majors have just up and left. So I would like to be enlightened by the government—by any member speaking for the government—explaining to me on what basis those companies would leave the country when their businesses are in fact extremely profitable, as we know from their annual reports.
We know that the chief executive officer of the Service Station Association, Mr Ron Bowden, predicted that between 1,000 and 1,500 service stations will close and another 200 franchisees will leave the industry in the next two years. So in fact the government’s proposals would increase concentration in the industry and market power would be in the hands of a few large companies, which would ultimately lead to higher prices. There is no doubt that, after discounting or selling below cost in order to drive out the independent operators, the minute they have driven them out they will then up the prices to recoup whatever discount they had put in there in the first place. The Oilcode is not going to prevent them from doing that.
I have some very great concerns about this. The government has been aware of the need to deal with section 46 of the Trade Practices Act for a long time, and it has not done it. I think it is totally irresponsible to come in here with legislation that repeals existing legislation without letting the parliament know and without having introduced the changes to the Trade Practices Act that would supposedly give protection to the small operators in the way that the government says that it has an interest in doing.
In terms of the issue of alternative fuels—and this certainly comes to the point of the majors having control of petrol retailing—we have been trying for a long time to have the rollout of alternative fuels in Australia. The reason that has not happened to the degree that we would like is that the majors have no great interest in doing it. I acknowledge that some of them are moving on this at the moment and may continue to do so, but the fact that they will have control of the majority of the outlets means that that will be something that they are able to control much more readily than anybody else.
We have an oil crisis that is converging with a climate change crisis. We need to reduce our dependence on petroleum. We need to get into the alternative fuels in a big way, and compressed natural gas, particularly in the heavy transport industry, is something that the transport industry itself says it would be interested in. But of course you need a distribution network, a refuelling network, up and down the east coast and on the major transport routes if you are going to get that kind of change from the heavy transport industry. So we come back to the same conundrum about rolling out adequate networks for distribution.
As some senators would be aware, we already have this problem in Tasmania. There is no other outlet for LPG after Sorell, which is just outside Hobart, for the entire east coast of Tasmania. So if you wanted to have 100 per cent LPG, as some councils would like to do for their car fleets, you cannot, because there is not one distribution outlet. Tasmania has an appalling distribution network for LPG. Once again, it is no use putting up conversion to LPG and subsidising conversion if you do not have a distribution network that will actually provide for that to occur. So we have some real issues about not only funding research and development in alternative fuels but actually making sure that you get an appropriate distribution network throughout the country.
But the other issue that I want to speak on for a moment is the Labor Party’s second reading amendment. There are a number of issues in that that of course the Greens are interested in: increasing the market penetration of ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and compressed natural gas; and securing new investment in biofuels. But we do not support investment in coal to liquids. I think this shows the internal lack of cohesion of Labor’s policies. On the one hand they say they want us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and on the other hand they want to invest large amounts of money in coal to liquids when the Centre for Low Emission Technology has said quite clearly that, even if you could get into carbon capture and storage and it was a 100 per cent success—and at a price where you would do that—the emissions from the tailpipe of a vehicle running on liquid coal are the same as from conventional oil.
So there is no point in it. What is the point in a greenhouse gas world, in a world that is heating up? Why would you go down the path of spending millions on research into something that you cannot use at the end of the day, whereas if you put the same amount of money into lignocellulose research, which will generate ethanol from waste plant material, then you get a win-win for climate change and for new fuels?
So there are lots of ways of actually addressing the crisis that we have globally. The report brought down by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee is reading that I would recommend to everybody in the chamber. But I think that the internal inconsistency of putting in coal to liquids actually demonstrates that Labor wants to have it both ways on transport fuels and climate change. It is an unacceptable way to go. So I move an amendment to the Labor Party’s second reading amendment:
Paragraph (a)(iii), omit “and coal”.
So gas to liquid stays but coal to liquids goes from the Labor Party’s amendment through the amendment I am moving here.
I am also concerned that Labor is advocating finding more oil and spending more on finding more oil. Yes, of course that is going to be an option. But what we know from the latest information coming to us from all of the exploration companies and academics and so on is that going into deep water becomes extremely costly. So when it comes to any oil that you might find, particularly around Australia, where we are not known for major finds, you might be investing more in trying to extract the oil from the deep ocean than you are ever going to get from the oil.
I would remind senators that the expectation is that, if oil stays at $50 a barrel, by 2015 imports will exceed the value of exports by $25 billion. What is that going to do to the current account deficit? What is it going to do to inflation if we allow that to occur? We are talking about less than 10 years time; we are not talking about a long time away. So the sooner we can get into alternative fuels, the sooner we can improve our own self-sufficiency, the sooner we can reduce our dependence on imported oil, the better it is for the country in terms of energy security and the better it is for the world in terms of greenhouse gases.
In this move away from oil, we should not just be looking at this issue of how we distribute petrol and the issues around pricing, I suggest that at the big picture level we should be pushing for an oil protocol globally. Such an international multilateral protocol would organise a way of gradually reducing in an orderly manner each country’s dependence on oil by a certain per cent, and the same with supply, so that we gradually get there—instead of being confronted by what I believe will be social and economic chaos as this situation with oil depletion plays out over time, especially in convergence with climate change. Quite a lot of work has been done on the notion of a multilateral oil protocol, a protocol that would have no country producing oil above its present depletion rate, no country importing oil above the world depletion rate, and so on and so forth. There is a great deal of detail in relation to these protocols. I float that idea. Whilst we need to look at the day-to-day issues and whilst politics is dominated by petrol prices in the here and now, we know that petrol prices now are nothing compared with what they are going to be in the future. We know that, if we have to suffer $25 billion in imports exceeding exports by 2015, we will be in real trouble.
My view is that at the national legislative level we should be protecting as much as we can the independent and small operators, because they are our best hope for rolling out, particularly in rural and regional Australia, opportunities for taking up alternative fuels. The only way we are going to get real competition is to maintain those independent and small operators in the marketplace. The only way we are going to do that is by amending the Trade Practices Act right now, and not waiting—giving this power to the majors now, going with an Oilcode we know is flawed, and then waiting for some changes to the Trade Practices Act which may never eventuate. I say that because the government said previously it was going to go with a mandatory code for the primary producers of Australia in terms of retail groceries and it totally reneged on that after it had said that was going to happen within 100 days of the 2004 federal election.
We have had the government not act on the country of origin labelling; we have had the government walk away from alternative fuels in rural communities, which has been a big slap in the face for them; and now we have had the government renege on a very clear promise that if the coalition was returned that mandatory code would be in place 100 days after the 2004 election. It is not, and it is not going to be. Saying that there will be an announcement this Thursday about more or less starting the process again is an absolute slap in the face. If those rural communities continue to support the coalition when it has done them in on small business—from the individual fruit and vegetable growers through to the small businesses in the towns such as these independent franchisees and other small business operators—if they continue to vote for a government that is not acting on climate change or oil depletion, then they are only going to see more of their own kind driven off the land. The South Australian Farmers Federation put out a release recently saying that at least 15,000 families have been driven off the land already.
Let us not see rural communities suffer any more in this way. Let us address these issues with the Trade Practices Act. I implore the Senate to support Senator Murray’s amendment and to heed what those people who represent the industry are actually saying—that by repealing these acts without the safety net that is necessary with the changes to the Trade Practices Act what is going to happen is that all these small businesses will be closed. I am not in support of handing over retail petrol sales in Australia to the four majors, and that is what this legislation is about. This is about the government acting on behalf of BP and Mobil so that they can get in on the act because they have been outmanoeuvred by Shell and Caltex. But in giving BP and Mobil what they want and setting up perhaps greater competition between the four initially, what we will see, once those four majors get rid of the people they are in real competition with, is no below-cost selling; and we will see them back to their old tricks.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I rise to speak in support of Labor’s second reading amendments to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. Australians who do not have the luxury of getting fuel cards, like we all do, have been doing it very tough since the last election. When the Howard government was re-elected in October 2004, the average petrol price in the Perth metropolitan area was 104.7c a litre and to fill the tank of a Holden Commodore would have cost $78.52. As at June 2006, the average petrol price in the metropolitan area of Perth had risen to 134.5c per litre and to fill the petrol tank in that same Commodore in June this year would have cost $100.87. That means that, since the Howard government was re-elected in October 2004, the cost of filling that tank in the Holden Commodore has increased by $22.35. The average family in High Wycombe, a suburb of Perth in the marginal government-held seat of Hasluck, would easily go through a tank of petrol a week going to and from work, dropping their kids off at sporting events and training, or going to the shops. Four tanks of petrol a month—and I am sure many families use more than this—adds up to an extra $88 a month that a family has to find just to get around.
I have probably burnt through more diesel than anyone else in this parliament. In my 11 years as an owner-driver, carting freight to and from the northern sectors of Australia, including Darwin and the Kimberley region, I have filled the tank on my rig more times than I care to remember. When I fill it, I put in 1,500 litres of diesel at a time. The average cost of diesel in the Perth metropolitan area has risen from 112.9c per litre at the time of the last election to 143.9c a litre in June this year. It now costs $465 more to fill my truck with fuel than it did at the time of the last election.
Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, you are probably the last person I need to explain this to, because you would fully appreciate—as I am sure many senators on the other side of the House do as well, although sometimes they have a habit of forgetting—that goods do not just appear on the shelves in shops. Clothes do not accidentally fall onto the racks in the shopping centres. These goods are all carted on the backs of trucks. Unfortunately, when the price of fuel goes up so too does the cost of goods to consumers.
If we consider the needs of people in rural and remote Western Australia, we should realise that most of their food gets to them on the backs of trucks. These trucks are travelling all the way from Perth. If we also consider that the industry standard for heavy-freight fuel consumption is around one litre for every kilometre travelled, then we know that a round trip, for example, from Perth to Kununurra and back again—a distance of about 6,200 kilometres—would use approximately 6,200 litres of diesel. As a rough estimate it means that, since the last election, an extra $1,900 in fuel costs has been added to the cost of one roadtrain of freight to Kununurra. Thankfully, there are signs at the moment that fuel prices are going down; but, as we have all seen in recent years, it takes only a cyclone or a maintenance shutdown on a major pipeline to send the price skyrocketing once again. Sadly, this bill will do little to address these problems.
The main purpose of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is to repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. Labor supports the repeal of these acts for two reasons. The first reason is that the minister has already put forward a regulation that undeclares the four major oil companies from the operation of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act, so it applies to no-one. The second reason is that, even if the act applied to the four major oil companies, the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 are outdated acts and serve no useful purpose in today’s petrol retail industry. Even if the minister had not undeclared the four major oil companies from the operation of the act, well over half the industry by volume of sales is not covered by current legislation—and that includes the retail stores Coles and Woolworths.
Over the years, the major oil companies have effectively been able to circumvent the act, particularly by way of creative multisite franchise arrangements. We have also seen in the market the emergence of partnership arrangements between Coles and Shell, and Caltex and Woolworths. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act, which was designed to limit the number of service stations the oil companies could run directly, does not cover Coles or Woolworths. The rules for participants are inconsistent and unfair. That is bad for industry and, far more importantly, it is bad for Australian consumers, who are doing it tough at the moment.
The repeal of these outdated acts is only the start of putting in place a regulatory regime needed to protect operators in the fuel retail sector, to prevent the abuse of market power by the refiners and to promote competition in the industry. The next step for the government is to introduce the Oilcode as a mandatory industry code under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act. In 1998, the opposition said that they would support petrol reform as long as the Oilcode was agreed to, and it has taken the government another eight long years to get around to it. Labor have said all along that we should support the government in its efforts to repeal these acts and to reform the fuel industry, as long as the government implemented the Oilcode to address the gaps in the existing regulatory regime to protect smaller operators and consumers. Because of the Howard government’s incompetence and failure to show leadership, it has taken eight long years to secure agreement from industry and consumer representatives for an oilcode that was acceptable to all involved.
The Oilcode’s dispute resolution scheme will provide a low-cost and rapid means of addressing disputes as an alternative to legal action. These changes are likely to lead to increased competition in the sector, with the potential for positive impacts on fuel prices, particularly in rural and regional areas. Unfortunately, the Oilcode does not go far enough. Although the mandatory Oilcode, pursuant to section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974, will place industry under a common regulatory regime with some protections, reform should also include amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act in order to prevent the potential for abuse of market power.
It is to the continuing detriment of small businesses in the petrol retail industry that the Howard government continues to stuff around with delivering on the recommendations of the 2003 Dawson report and of the 2004 Senate inquiry. Australia needs a national transport fuel policy that guarantees supply for the long term and that gives us options to deal with global fuel supply and price emergencies. We need to reduce our dependence on fuel from unstable regions in the world. We cannot rely on foreign oil if the Strait of Hormuz is closed, if the Alaskan pipeline has to be fully shut down, if war escalates in the Middle East or if civil unrest shuts down West African production. It is obvious to everyone, except the government, that, if we do not have home-grown fuel industries in Australia, we will remain at risk. If we do not develop large-scale alternative fuel industries in Australia, we will increasingly be hostage to supplies from the Middle East, West Africa and Russia. To prevent our country becoming hostage to foreign oil, we need to begin weaning ourselves off traditional fuels and to develop domestic alternatives.
High petrol prices are driven largely by the high price of crude oil. Oil is a finite resource. We are running out of oil. On the basis of the law of supply and demand, demand for fuel is going up and supply is coming down, so the price is naturally going to go up. When the price of crude oil is high, it is all the more urgent that governments act. We have to wean ourselves off Middle Eastern oil. In fact, we have to wean ourselves off all traditional fuels. Unfortunately, the Howard government is asleep at the wheel. If it has taken the government eight years just to develop an Oilcode, I have no faith that it will be able to develop an industry plan to wean Australia off foreign oil.
The Howard government is all over the shop on its policy towards alternative fuels. In the last parliament alone, the Howard government changed its mind not once, not twice, but on three occasions with respect to the excise regime not only for ethanol but also for the LPG industry. Despite his May 2002 view that applying an excise to ethanol and LPG was a bad idea, the Treasurer announced in the 2003 budget that he would do just that. He announced that biofuels and LPG would be subject to an excise from July 2008. In December 2003, guess what? He changed his mind again, announcing a new excise regime to apply from July 2011.
Senators will be aware that there is a Senate inquiry currently underway into Australia’s future oil supplies by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee—which I know has now changed its name. The committee, of which I am a member, along with Senator Milne and Senator Joyce, has taken evidence on a range of matters, including on the question of whether the world oil supply has hit peak oil. Briefly put, peak oil is the point at which world oil supply peaks before beginning to fall. With the Senate’s indulgence, I would like to share some statistics that show that Australia at least seems to have reached peak oil in domestic production.
In 1998-99, the Australian production of crude oil, condensate and LPG came in at 32,265 megalitres. This figure rose steadily to 42,279 megalitres by 2000-01. Since then, Australia’s production of crude oil, condensate and LPG has fallen steadily to 29,995 megalitres in 2004-05. Unless there are more major finds and capital investment in the very near future, it appears that Australian production hit peak oil in 2001-02.
As a consequence of our reducing domestic production of crude oil, condensate and LPG, we have become increasingly reliant on imported fuels to meet our consumption. A consequence of this is that the value of petroleum imports as a percentage of the value of total imports has increased from 3½ per cent in 1998-99 to around 10 per cent in 2005-06. No wonder Australia’s trade deficit is looking so crook.
Australia’s capacity to fulfil its petroleum consumption needs from its own petroleum resources has fallen markedly in recent years, at the same time as there has been an escalation in the world demand for crude oil. From 2001-05, world oil consumption increased by approximately eight per cent. In the previous five years, world consumption of oil grew by only 4.3 per cent. Furthermore, from 2001 to 2005 the average price of a barrel of crude oil increased by approximately 150 per cent. In the five years previous, the world price increased by only approximately 3.5 per cent.
In the face of all this, the entirety of the Prime Minister’s response has been to repeal two acts and give a handful of Australian motorists a couple of thousand dollars to change over to LPG—that is, if they can find someone with the skills to do the conversion. The point is that the Howard government has let Australia down badly. Labor, on the other hand, has a plan to reduce our dependence on imported oil and to put in place new policies that can encourage alternative energy use. The solution is home-grown fuel industries in Australia. That requires that we accept that there are policy options available to ensure that the wheels continue to turn for Australian consumers and Australian industries to ensure that Australians can afford fuel and to ensure that Australian industry can afford energy.
I am advised that there are currently seven refineries in Australia with a combined capacity of around 800,000 barrels a day. This is more than sufficient to meet the entire Australian demand, currently about 750,000 barrels a day. But I am also advised that, at present, alternative fuels make up less than two per cent of the overall market for petroleum products. The two most common types of biofuels that are being developed and used are ethanol and biodiesel.
Contrary to Senator McGauran’s rantings about the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party started the ethanol industry in this country with capital assistance grants back in 1993. We have supported pushing out further the application of tax on ethanol. We did not oppose the government’s total removal of import competition. We have supported all the later rounds of capital assistance grants for new plants. We have done all the ethanol industry has asked of us, short of supporting mandating.
Ethanol is good for regional jobs, it is good for the environment and it is good for the agricultural sector. It helps the competitiveness of independent service stations because they can blend the product—having no tax makes them more competitive. But we make only 37 million litres of it in this country at the moment. If we mandated it at 10 per cent, we would need at least two billion litres.
Even Senator Boswell—yes, Senator Joyce: Senator Boswell, the cultural attache from the Queensland National Party—said on 14 August 2006 that the Howard government needs to do more to promote ethanol fuel. According to Senator Boswell, the Howard government said:
... really have to get fair dinkum about ethanol and bio-fuels because we’re only playing at the edges at the moment.
I could not agree more with Senator Boswell. I suspect Senator Boswell knows that only the Labor Party is serious about reducing Australia’s reliance on foreign fuel. Senator Boswell knows he is part of a government that got elected in 1996 promising to keep Labor’s ethanol bounty but scrapping it in their first budget. He knows he is part of a government that attacked the ethanol industry and then rearranged the support so that it helped only one person. The Prime Minister needs to understand that the ethanol industry is about more than just helping out his mate Dick Honan.
The other main biofuel is biodiesel. Biodiesel can be made from several types of oils such as soybean, rapeseed and vegetable or animal fats. Biodiesel fuel is biodegradable, requires minimal engine modification when used either as a blending component or as is, and is cleaner burning than the diesel it replaces.
I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Gull Petroleum in Western Australia, which in a number of its service stations is offering biodiesel to consumers as a fuel additive in 20 per cent blends with petroleum diesel. They have set a fine example to other retailers, and I hope their product is well received by the market. The Labor Party has always been a great supporter of both gas to liquids and coal to liquids, which are integral to the commercialisation of clean coal technology for power generation in Australia and which are part of the environmental debate.
Although the technology to produce GTL diesel has been available since the 1920s, it has been too costly to be commercially viable. Over the last decade, however, costs have reduced by 50 per cent, and there is reason to believe there will be further progress in cost minimisation and process optimisation. The advantage of GTL diesel is that it contains almost no sulfur or aromatics and is well suited to meet current and proposed cleaner fuel requirements of developed economies.
It is now almost five years since Senator Minchin, the then minister for resources, appointed a GTL task force to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a GTL industry in Australia. Five years later, no action has been taken. It is just not good enough.
Another policy initiative the Labor party has announced is Labor’s green car challenge. Around 18 per cent of new cars in Australia are bought by federal, state or local governments. Labor has said that, if the Australian car industry could build a competitive, value-for-money green car, a federal Labor government would put it into the Commonwealth fleet. As Mr Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, put it, ‘You build it; we’ll drive it.’ Labor will use industry policy and procurement policy that is available to the Commonwealth to make sure that we restructure the Australian car industry in a way that ensures not only good outcomes for the environment and lower fuel bills for Australian families but also good outcomes for the Australian economy and Australian jobs.
This policy has the support of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, which does an excellent job representing and protecting the workforce in the motor vehicle industry. Like Labor, the AMWU knows that, if we stand still while the rest of the world is moving forward, we will get left behind. Fuel prices are hurting Australian families and adding inflationary pressures to the economy. The Howard government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to developing alternative fuels to reduce Australia’s reliance on oil. Labor has a vision for an Australian economy that does not buckle under the weight of a global oil shock. That is why Labor released a blueprint in October last year that outlined plans to develop existing alternatives, for example, LPG, ethanol and biodiesel; to develop emerging alternatives, for example, gas to liquids; and to develop future fuels, for example, hydrogen. Labor’s plan stands ready to be put into action. If all the Howard government is going to do is tinker around the edges, then it should call an early election so Australians can get the kind of leadership they deserve.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-11,"—We just heard a fascinating speech from Senator Sterle—in fact, I felt like checking what we were talking on; it sounded like we were about to move a mandate on ethanol, for which he would have had my support. But he was not. Although he gave a fascinating speech, we are actually talking here today about the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006.
I want to pick up on a couple of points of Senator Sterle’s before we go much further. He talked about his overwhelming support for the biodiesel industry—no doubt in Western Australia there is a lot of support for the biodiesel industry. I remember Labor frantically knocking down our doors a few months ago asking for support for the biodiesel industry. However, what surprised me then, after Senator Sterle’s comments, was the way the vote went in the chamber. The only people who actually supported a move to assist the biodiesel producers of Western Australia were me and a senator from the Democrats. Senator Sterle actually voted to get rid of the biodiesel industry in Western Australia. We should put that back on the record, because he seems to be getting a bit shifty. He has been here for a little while, and he is getting a bit shifty now. He wants to ride both sides of the fence.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—You were not in the chamber?
—I was in the chamber; you weren’t.
—I was in the chamber. It is on the record—as is your vote against biodiesel, Senator Sterle. He also came in and gave a great hoorah about where we are at with ethanol. I can assure you that a mandate on ethanol is National Party policy. If you are about to join us in that push, I welcome you. You will have a lot of support on that day. That would really check your colours on the other side of the chamber. We would see whether they are going to walk the walk or whether they are talkers. They look like talkers over there—they are not really serious about it—but I would welcome them. If they want to come out of their burrows and be fair dinkum about supporting the ethanol industry, I challenge them. You must be getting up through the ranks of the Labor Party right now, Senator Sterle. I challenge you to go to your caucus and say, ‘Let’s get fair dinkum about this. Let’s move a mandate,’ because they will not. They have not quite got the ticker for that. They have the ticker to talk, but they do not have the ticker to walk. That is the difference.
But it is encouraging. It was a marvellous little excursion into the facts. I agree with much of what Senator Sterle said about the trade deficit, the benefits of getting an alternative fuel and the problems we could have on the Strait of Hormuz, and no doubt other parts of the world as you so choose. I have no problems with that—you are probably telling the truth on all of those issues—it is just that you do not want to do anything about it. The option is there for the Labor Party—if they want to do something about it—to come out and say they are going to mandate ethanol. I will support them, but they will not do it.
But let us go back to what we are actually talking about. We are talking about the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. It looks like the Labor Party will support it, so we can basically say from that that the legislation will go through. A key issue here is that, in 1980, when this act was brought about, they passed it because they had a belief in the participation in the retail of fuel by a wider section of the community. That sentiment was true in 1980, and it is true now. There should be a wider participation in the wealth that is generated from the retail of fuel.
It is true that Coles and Woolworths have circumvented that over a period of time, and that issue does need to be dealt with, but we are not dealing with it through this legislation in this form. There has to be an amendment brought into this legislation that protects independents in the market. Independents must be protected. Why is it that, with this piece of legislation going forward, we have said that Coles and Woolworths have circumvented the intent of the 1980 act, but instead of dealing with the problem, which is the circumvention by Coles and Woolworths, we are going to bring about a piece of legislation that is going to put the independents out of business? Why is that? How did that come about? Surely, if it was true in 1980 that it is good to have mum and dad businesses, a wide participation in the retailing of fuel, it would be as just and as good now to have a wide participation in the retailing of fuel. Why aren’t we amending this in such a form as to allow a remnant participation by independents in the market? We have heard from Senator Sterle, from the Greens and from a whole range of people how the independents are instrumental in bringing about price discounting in fuel and how the independents are instrumental in bringing about fair competition in the market, in keeping the others honest. But there is nothing in this legislation that actually protects them, and that is a concern for me.
I will be moving an amendment that will quarantine a section of the market for independents. It is as simple as that. Why? Because it is inherently good for Australia. It is inherently good for the market. It stands to an ethos that I have believed in since I gave my maiden speech—that is, an overcentralisation of any market is bad policy. It is bad for the freedom of this nation. It is ultimately bad for the consumers. When you have an oligopoly relationship, as we obviously have in the oil industry, the government has to step into the fray and promote legislation to protect them. The issue is basically how we go about it.
We have heard from the Labor Party. They have talked about the Dawson recommendations, and everybody is in furious agreement. Everybody agrees that we have to go somewhere with the Trade Practices Act. I hear that, but what are we going to do with this piece of legislation, right now, that is going to protect the independents in the market? It is one of the fundamental things when you drive up the road when you are campaigning in Queensland. You stop at a service station, you walk in and you ask: ‘How are you going? What can I do to help you?’ They almost knock you over by saying: ‘What you can do to help me is allow me to buy fuel at the price that that service station is selling it at. That’s what you can do for me. If you can help me buy fuel at the price that that service station is selling it at, you’re going to allow me to stay in business.’ When people say that, it hits a chord with you, and you think: ‘Well, I should go about trying to assist those people to stay in the market.’ In going forward during our Senate campaign some two years ago now, it was a fundamental driver to try and make sure that we keep the wide participation of Australian people in the retail market. Whether it is retailing fuel, retailing clothes or retailing groceries, there has to be a wider participation in that market.
How are we going to do that? We are going to have to do that by basically bending the rules to move away from this so-called free market, because there is no free market. There is no free market in anything in this world. If there truly was a free market, I would be able to go out the front door of my house, set up a bowser and start selling fuel, no matter what it was, without any controls, checks or balances whatsoever. But you cannot do that. So what we really have in Australia is a partially regulated market that we call a free market. Because it is a partially regulated market, it works in favour of the incumbents. The incumbents are the two major retailers and the four major oil companies.
The mantra that I have kept saying is that the purpose of the economy is not to produce the lowest priced product for the end consumer—because we hear that all the time: ‘This is going to bring lower prices.’ So it will, but the purpose of the economy is not purely to produce lowest priced products for the end consumer. That may be a consequence of a good economy, but it is not the purpose. The purpose of the economy is to create the greatest connection between the wealth of a nation and its people, and to do that it is vitally important that you have a small business sector. Where do you see the small business sector reflected in the fuel market? It is reflected in the independents.
It is going to be interesting to see how the pennies fall on this one. I will make a prediction. I predict that the Labor Party will be supporting this. Why? Because the major oil companies have got to them, that is why, and they are going to fall in line just to show that they too can put families out of business when required. It would be brave to stand up and say that we are going in to bat for families, that we are going to quarantine a section of the market to be exclusively the domain of independents, because we agree with the intent of the 1980 act—it was true in 1980; it is true now. All through this chamber, somewhere between 1980 and now, the belief in independents and a wide participation in the retail market has gone, for political convenience. Why has that happened? Where are we drawing it from?
I heard Senator Sterle talk about being an owner-driver. It must be a wonderful thing being an owner-driver, being your own boss. It must be a wonderful thing to determine your own future. It must be a wonderful thing to be in business for yourself. But it seems a shame: I believe that, today, you are not going to protect the right of other people to stay in business—that, for whatever reasons, you are going to justify to yourself why you have to let these people go. You are going to do it because the hierarchy in the Labor Party have told you to do it, and you follow orders. You do exactly what you are told. That is what is going to happen today. It is going to frustrate you because once more, just like you did over the biodiesel producers of Western Australia when you voted for that piece of legislation, today you are going to do over the families—families very similar to those of your owner-drivers. I do not know whether it is worth it. You can do something really worth while here by going in to protect some of these people.
So I am going to move an amendment to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill. I do not know how it will go. The amendment will talk about basically putting in some sorts of controls, getting 25 per cent of the market and keeping it aside for the small business operator, for the mum and dad operator. That will give them an ability to breathe, an ability to live. That will not allow them to go down this path where they are going, where they have to be driven into the ground and have every inch of commercial blood squeezed out of them by the four major oil companies and the major retailers. It will say that we will allow a section of the market for these people to survive in. We will say to them that Australia is a market that you can participate in, that we in Australia will protect your fundamental right to go into business—your fundamental right to exist in Australia in a manner that goes beyond just working for one of these companies—and that you can actually own and have further control over your own destiny, because that is the philosophical issue here.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm
—One of the other issues that we have been talking about in respect of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill is the so-called transparency of the terminal gate price. Unfortunately, I do not believe it is going to be transparent. What we would no doubt have would be a documented price. If you were mad enough, you could buy fuel at that price, but it would not be the price that everybody else would be getting it at and it certainly would not be transparent.
Transparency will be guided by commercial-in-confidence matters. You can bet your life that if it is transparent—if it is on the internet, if everybody can see it—it is not the price that it is being purchased at. That is one thing I can assure you of, yet tonight we hear both sides of the chamber talking about how good this transparency factor is going to be. I wish it were truly transparent. I wish we had an ombudsman to monitor it and tell people what the actual margin is that they are getting. We in this chamber need to work towards getting greater transparency because greater transparency will provide fairness and keep those independents in the market.
We have talked about independents: we have talked about why they are good for keeping the price down—because they promote competition—and we have talked about how independents are fundamentally a good reflection of a freedom in Australian society, the freedom to go and buy produce and make a profit out of it. Hopefully all of us on the conservative side of the chamber believe in the freedom to go into business. It is a part of what we are.
We have heard Senator Sterle talking about how he was an owner-driver. He talked about that with some gusto as if he believed in it—and I believe he does. Obviously, his freedom was to be in business and to shape his own destiny. That is one of the reasons why we support independents, whether they are in the fuel industry or whether they are in the retail industry. Whatever industry it is, the freedom to go into business should be manifest in what being an Australian is and be part of what we are ever-vigilant about protecting.
There is another good thing about independents. We believe—Senator Sterle believes and, having heard Senator McGauran, I know he believes it; everybody seems to be in raging agreement—in biorenewable fuels. We have heard from Mr Beattie that he is going to bring them in in Queensland. It sounds like the Labor Party might be getting close to talking about a mandate—great day when that happens; let us hope. We hear that everybody is in raging agreement that they all believe in biorenewable fuels. The fact is that the best mechanism for getting biorenewables out into the market is the independents. You get no better reflection of that than in this town—a town of 320,000 people and our nation’s capital—where, of the four fuel stations that are selling the E10 ethanol, three of them are independent and one of them is a major. That in itself goes to show you yet another relevant factor as to why we need independents in the market.
Why would the independents want to sell E10? I am going to hazard a guess here: because it gives them the competitive advantage that they know they cannot possibly get it at the terminal gate price. With the passage of this legislation without protection for independents, we are going to have the independents having as their supplier an unencumbered major competitor and, given the way that markets work, that will bring about the demise of the independents. That is crazy. Imagine your supplier, the person who supplies you with the product, being also your major competitor—and there is no control whatsoever on how you deal with them, because, since the Boral case, section 46 laws are lacking; they do need to be strengthened. This is why we need a section of the market that is specifically quarantined for independents, and we should not be ashamed to say we are manipulating the market to protect a basic freedom of the Australian people: the freedom to be in business. So that is going to be what we have to deal with.
This amendment will be moved in such a way that we protect independents to promote biorenewable fuels and we protect that manifest absolute freedom to be in business. We protect independents to keep competition in the market so we have price leaders and price discounting. That is one of the reasons why this bill in its current form—unamended—is lacking.
I have seen some other amendments. There is an amendment that was bandied around by Senator Fielding. The intent was good but it talked about no major having more than 25 per cent of the market. Unfortunately, four 25 per cents equal 100 per cent, which means that they would have the whole market, and if you include Coles and Woolworths that is 150 per cent of the market. I applaud his attention to it, but we need to go a bit further than that because we are not actually protecting independents; we are still leaving them out on a limb.
What this amendment does is say: ‘Let us look at this in another way; let us look at 25 per cent of the fuel being quarantined for those who have been determined to be independents.’ What is an independent? I cannot name everyone that it is but I can tell you who it is not. It is not Caltex, it is not BP, it is not Mobil, it is not Shell, it is not Coles and it is not Woolworths. That is who it is not.
That 25 per cent of the market should be quarantined for those people who are not in that group to go out and still have a corner of the market to participate in. The day that we lose independents is the day that we have an oligopolical relationship in the fuel market. When you attain a position of strength, you exploit it and the best way to commercially exploit your position is to put up prices; in fact, it is what you have a duty to your shareholders to do. When you get into that position, you exploit it by putting up prices—and I tell you what: four oil majors and two major retailers are obviously exploiting the price of fuel.
I will leave you with one final thing. The price of diesel in Iran at the moment, with all its problems—I am not suggesting that we go there; this is just to give you an idea of the margin in this product—is about 3c a litre. So the difference between 3c a litre and what we are paying for it is either government taxes, production costs or profit. I think there is a lot more to it than the terminal gate price. I suggest that a vast amount of the profits are made offshore and do not see their way into our country. If we lose the mechanism of the independence to protect our position then, as a nation, we will lose in the long run.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006. I do so with petrol prices soaring and Australian families battling to pay their petrol bills. Australians are more concerned than ever about record high petrol prices as we have seen global oil prices triple over the past three years. Reform of the petrol retail industry, including the repeal of the two acts dealt with in this bill, has never been more important.
Last year higher petrol prices meant Australians spent approximately $2.3 billion extra on petrol. To further demonstrate this point, I draw the Senate’s attention to an article published on 9 August in the Examiner newspaper in my home state of Tasmania which detailed the cost of living for families. Using Bureau of Statistics data, the article recreated an average family to illustrate family spending and pressures on the household budget. It said that an average family is made up of two parents and two children, aged nine and 12, has a combined take-home salary of $3,828 a month and is paying off a loan on an average family car. After meeting their mortgage expenses and paying for food, fuel, insurance and education, there is little money left over for this average family to spend on life’s luxuries. The article referred to, amongst other things, the impact of yet another interest rates rise and rising petrol prices. It said:
The biggest shock to families has been the rising price of petrol. The price of standard unleaded petrol has jumped from $1.18 to $1.45 in just a year, adding $59 a month to the budget.
This represents a massive change of 22.6 per cent in the household petrol budget from August 2005 to August 2006. This is on top of the average Tasmanian family paying at least $176 more a month for goods and services than they were paying in August last year. Tasmanians are paying 4.1 per cent more at the checkout, 5.8 per cent more on education costs and up to 5.8 per cent more on health costs, and the price of standard unleaded petrol has jumped from $1.18 to $1.45 in less than a year. These figures do not take into account the cost of child care—the latest available figures show that high-quality child care costs $260 a week in Tasmania—nor the impact on family-work balance of the government’s extreme Work Choices legislation.
I support Senator O’Brien’s comment that it is most worrying that the Howard-Costello government’s answer to everything, as reflected in the recent budget, is simply to spend, spend, spend. Unfortunately for average Tasmanians they are now forced to spend more on interest rate hikes, petrol and groceries. It has become blatantly obvious that the government has only two policies: sell and spend. The government wants to sell Telstra and Medibank Private, regardless of the cost to the community, and to spend its way out of trouble using taxpayers’ money.
The Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 repeals the outdated Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Sites Act 1980. These acts cover only part of the petrol retail industry; well over 50 per cent of the industry, by volume of sales, is not covered, including the supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths. The acts discriminate between large and small business, and the rules are inconsistent and unfair. More than 50 per cent of the industry, by volume, is not regulated at all. Petrol retail reform is a good step forward to give consumers more confidence, but reform, we also accept, has been a long time coming.
As has been stated by my colleagues, petrol reform has been on the Howard government’s policy agenda since 1996. In 1998 the opposition appropriately said that it would support petrol reform as long as the Oilcode was agreed to, but it has taken this government another eight years to get to that point. The Oilcode, which will be introduced as a mandatory industry code under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974, will finally and appropriately bring the industry into a common regulatory regime with better protections for market participants and consumers. The Oilcode will improve the protections available to commissioned agents and independent operators, who currently do not have the protections available to franchisees. Both franchisees and commissioned agents will also appropriately have access to a low-cost dispute resolution system for the first time.
I think we have to accept that there is no longer a capacity for short-term fixes. We need a national transport fuel policy that guarantees supplies for the long term and gives Australia options to deal with global fuel supply and price emergencies. That is the debate in Europe, that is the debate in North America, that is the debate in Asia; but unfortunately it is not the debate the Prime Minister wants in Australia, because it requires tough decisions and leadership.
Labor’s blueprint will provide a leading role in emerging energy sectors to boost our export performance and take advantage of opportunities in world markets. Labor wants to quash this threat of reliance and make Australia more self-sufficient in developing fuels that will become cheaper in the future. In October last year Kim Beazley launched Labor’s blueprint ‘Developing the Australian transport fuel industry’. I would like to quote from Kim Beazley’s address at the launch of the blueprint. He said:
If Australia is to grow, to prosper and be secure—we must be able to stand on our own two feet in the world—whether that be militarily, in counter terrorism, in educating our people, in providing decent health care, decent infrastructure or in keeping our economy strong.
                  …           …         …
My aim, the aim of the Australian Labor Party is to develop a diversified Australian fuel industry. A diversified Australian fuel industry making Australia a more self sufficient country.
We must increase the use of Australian transport fuels and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We must develop and use those fuels that will become cheaper in the future. More fuel–more types of fuel. Cleaner fuels—cheaper fuels—Australian fuels.
We need national leadership to develop:
existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and
emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid gas and stored electricity; and
future fuels, such as hydrogen.
We also need to develop the technologies to make it happen. We do this because our transport fuel markets need a fresh blast of competition.
We must make Australia less vulnerable to external shocks.
We must make Australia less reliant on the foreign oil affecting our trade deficit and foreign debt.
We must play a leading role in emerging energy sectors to boost our export performance and take advantage of opportunities in world markets. We must invest in preserving our environment by diversifying our fuel base beyond petrol to biofuels and gas and hydrogen.
I am pleased to support the bill, which repeals, as I have said, two outdated pieces of legislation. I endorse the Labor amendments that seek to, and I echo the words of my colleagues in the House, Mr Martin Ferguson and Mr Fitzgibbon: (1) strengthen the ACCC’s powers to investigate petrol prices by removing the requirement that the ACCC needs the Treasurer’s consent; (2) strengthen the Trade Practices Act to provide greater scope for dealing with abuse of market power; (3) find more oil and use more gas in Australia by re-examining the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure, allowing the selective use of flow-through share schemes for smaller operators, and conduct a feasibility study into converting gas into clean diesel in Australia; and (4) protect and promote the growth of ethanol, biodiesel, LPG and CNG by a 2009 review of the government’s plans to levy an excise on these fuels. The review will consider whether the excise should be deferred. I call on government senators to support Australian families and support Labor’s amendments aimed at strengthening the Trades Practices Act to protect against the abuse of market power and to address the rising cost of petrol. I commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-09-11,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for giving me the opportunity this evening to speak on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 which has now seen the light of day. This piece of legislation is a bit of a catch-up, as has been outlined not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate this afternoon by opposition and other non-government speakers. The issue dealt with in the legislation is how to approach the misuse of market power and get compliance. It has taken a long time for this piece of legislation to get to the parliament. This issue was raised some years ago and it has taken—as my colleagues both in the House of Representatives and here have outlined—a long time for this legislation to get here. It seems that the government has only just discovered that there might be a misuse of market power not only by the oil companies but also by the major retailers and the suppliers.
When you and I were growing up, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, there were seven oil companies which used to retail in this country. I was trying to remember the other three as I got to my feet. They were: Esso, Ampol and Golden Fleece. Together they used to make up the ‘seven deadly sisters’ that used to manipulate the petroleum and oil market in this country. Now we are down to four and both Coles and Woolworths are using their market share to manipulate and control the market. If people do not think—when they see that 4c a litre discount when they drive into Caltex or Shell—that Coles and Woolies have not in some way or another made them pay that difference in another area while they have been shopping there then they are a bit foolish. Other speakers have questioned the continued relevance of what the government is putting forward here this evening. Nevertheless, it does recognise that there has been a change in the nature of retail, the marketing and the supply of this vital energy source.
I take note of Senator O’Brien’s comments this afternoon and his foreshadowed amendments. It seems to me that there are few parties in this parliament that have recognised that there is a looming crisis and that we need to do something about it. I welcome the fact that the rural and regional references committee gave an interim report in which it in essence begged that we start preparing for our falling and failing oil suppliers. The government has not done that. If you observed the government, particularly in the passage of what has been proposed in this bill, you would see that the government’s inactivity and inertia seeps through the ranks. It seems to be a case of ‘it’ll be alright mate; it’ll be alright Jack’—a case that these problems are not here to be addressed. It is almost a case of ‘Let them eat cake.’ That is what it seems like to me. There is no outline or plan to deal with the possibility that within three years we will be paying $2 a litre for fuel.
What are we going to do then? Are we going to continue to pay the price for 10 years of neglect by the Howard government? What are we going to do when it appears that our energy supplies will be the whims and fancies of undemocratic regimes in either Africa or the Middle East? How is the government proposing to guarantee our oil supplies and our standard of living for the future? What are the initiatives of the government in this field? Clearly, I cannot see any. Maybe government speakers or the minister, when speaking in reply, may outline some. But it appears to me, and to a growing number of Australians, that there is an inertia amongst the government, a lack of attention to this, and that this inactivity will make us pay in the future, particularly as we start to pay $2 a litre for fuel. That is what potentially could happen within the next few years. As we pay more to fill up our vehicles, we will reduce our lifestyle and that will place enormous pressure on the home. I am sure that the government does not particularly wish to see that—nor do we—but there is no answer.
For 10 years now the government has been in power. It is no longer going to be relevant for ministers or backbench government MPs to get up and say that under the Keating-Hawke governments this, that or the other thing happened. At least in the Hawke and Keating governments there was initiative for reform. Some of it was painful for not only the government but the Labor Party itself. Nevertheless, over those 13 years they did grasp the nettle and did act in accordance with what they thought was in the best long-term interests of this country. But, in this particular area, there is no evidence that that is occurring. In fact, the consequences of this lack of initiative by the government are these: we have labour shortages, we have an erosion of our skills base, our infrastructure is choking and we have inflationary pressures—all as a result of a lack of initiative by the Commonwealth government under John Howard.
What has been the government’s answer to this looming energy crisis? Only recently the Prime Minister made an energy statement in which the emphasis was on LPG. One of the problems, as outlined by previous speakers, is that, for a start, not many places are available to convert vehicles to LPG or repair those vehicles. In fact, there are hardly any places in regional or rural Australia—and it is good to see some National Party senators in here this evening who may be able to reply to that.
As I said, there are no outlets. In fact, there is not a skilled workforce available out there, particularly in regional and rural Australia, for these conversions or the repair to those vehicles to occur. It has been highlighted that, in some cases, if one wishes to take up the option that has been provided by the government, one may wait up to two years for this to occur. This initiative was in response to the growing fuel crisis. One would have thought that the spin doctors, who are so well paid—there are so many of them—within the Howard government would have checked what may have been the situation before they put the Prime Minister in the spot he has been put in. But that did not occur. The fanfare was announced and, of course, once the details were exposed to the Australian community, it was seen to be the farce that it was and is.
Over the past few years Labor have put forward alternatives to the current fuel situation. As outlined in our amendments, we do not want to have our country held ransom to these undemocratic regimes in Africa or the Middle East. We do not want to be blackmailed by people who do not share the same values as us. In the 1993 budget, Paul Keating introduced 18c a litre production assistance for ethanol. John Howard, in his government’s first budget, withdrew that assistance. Since that time, the Howard government has changed the excise regime for LPG and other biofuels at least on three occasions. In May 2002, Peter Costello said that applying an excise on ethanol and LPG was a bad idea, and he did just that in the 2003 budget. In that period, between May and December of that year, it left the LPG industry in turmoil.
Our amendments offer a road map: they offer a vision of what needs to be done. That is not outlined either in the legislation to fix up a piecemeal bit of operation that is now before us or in any of the Prime Minister’s statements on our energy needs in the future. We in the Labor Party know the urgency of this matter. We know that it needs to be addressed, and we cannot put it under the carpet and hope that it will be dealt with by the next government. We know that we have to come up with solutions so that we can prevent blackmail of our country in the future. That is what is in our amendments.
If we are deprived of energy security in the future, as Martin Ferguson, our shadow minister, has said, it could be the commencement of a Cold War where, in a figurative sense, we are denied or deprived of food and fresh water or a safe and comfortable hearth, and where the certainty for trade and commerce will be removed because of the growing difficulties within the international situation. This will be the commencement of that difficulty. It will be a threat to our lifestyle and our standard of living. That is what is at stake, and we are calling on the Commonwealth to be far more broad and far reaching in its grasp of what the future energy needs of this country are. That is why, as I said, the government needs to understand this looming crisis. It needs to address it—and it can be addressed, in a small way, by the support of our amendments that are before the chair.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-11,"—I must declare at the outset of my participation in the debate this evening a vested interest in the outcome of the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 and related matters. That is brought on by the fact that, sitting in front of my house, there are generally four vehicles, one of which is mine and the other three of which are driven by my adult children. The price of petrol, the consumption of petrol and the alternative fuels that might be available to them, not only now but in the longer term, are therefore very much of interest to me.
But, having said that, I am genuinely concerned for people of lower and fixed incomes who have access to motor vehicles who need them for their day-to-day lives, to either get themselves to work or for basic family needs, and find themselves challenged by the price of fuel, fluctuating almost on an ad hoc basis, in the various parts of Australia. Strangely enough it seems to be that, around weekends, the price magically jumps. No-one seems to know why; no-one can give a logical explanation. Sometimes we have not just daily but hourly fluctuations in petrol prices. That comes as a grave concern indeed. And last but not least is the old public holiday trick.
So, whilst we see in this instance a particular bill being repealed, what might follow in the wake of this bill comes as a grave concern. I know there is talk of oilcodes and other things such as that. But the legislation that is being repealed has been circumvented. The information I have says it has been eroded over time through both High Court and Federal Court decisions. Labor therefore supports the repeal of this legislation. But, as Mr Fitzgibbon said in speaking to this bill in the other place, that was contingent upon changes being made to the Trade Practices Act, particularly in respect of section 46, to ensure that there was no use of the market power that clearly rests with the fuel distributors in this country.
It was only a couple of years ago that I had the pleasure of being briefed by Exxon in the United States. My recollection of the briefing I had from them is that motor vehicle use and petrol use in the United States would continue at an exponential rate. It seems to me that, in spite of the changes in petrol prices in this country, there is no slackening off of the use of cars or fuel. One only has to go on the roads in any of our major cities, as I do from time to time when I visit them. The use of the market power of the oil companies is therefore of great concern. Also of concern, as my colleague Senator Hutchins said, is access to fuel supplies themselves and the alternatives to petrol or petrol substitutes that might be available over a period of time.
The minister, I understand, moved a regulation that undeclares the major oil companies under the existing legislation—which, of course, therefore renders the current legislation fairly useless. It covers no-one in particular and no-one in general. So the legislation needs to be sensibly repealed. Central to this, though, is not just the repeal of this act but the need, we on the Labor side claim, for changes to the Trade Practices Act such that an attempt can be made to give proper protection to motorists at large.
This was spelt out by the Labor senators in their additional remarks to the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which looked into the details of this piece of legislation. That report was tabled in May 2006. I want to quote from the ‘Additional remarks from Labor Senators’ because I think that they are clearly pertinent in this matter. They will, of course, be known to those who were involved in the inquiry that was conducted by the economics committee. They acknowledged that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and associated regulations represented, as they said:
... an outdated model for regulation of the petrol retail sector.
There is no doubt that we have conceded that. That is not in question. But they go on to say, in the second paragraph of those remarks:
Labor Senators however, are of the view that the principle issue in encouraging competition in this sector, and indeed across all markets, is strengthening provisions in the Trade Practices Act against misuse of market power.
And that, of course, is the real nub; that is the real key. They go on to say:
It is well known that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act has been rendered inefficient and ineffective because of a number of Federal Court and High Court cases.
They go on then to give some examples. At the conclusion of that paragraph, they say:
The ACCC has effectively given up taking cases under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act because it knows it has now been rendered ineffective.
Not surprisingly, their conclusion arising out of that is:
Therefore, Labor Senators believe that the most efficient market outcome will not be achieved unless s46 reforms are implemented concurrently.
So, after acknowledging that it is appropriate for this legislation to be repealed, the Labor senators then clearly outlined a process with a series of recommendations to strengthen section 46, which would see that protections were put in place against the misuse of market power by oil companies. I think that is very important indeed.
At the outset of my speech, I declared an interest. I said that four cars sit on the front driveway of my home—and a lot of people around here probably cannot relate to that. As I said, three of those cars I never get to drive and are driven in rotation. Of course, every time the price of petrol spikes or changes, my children invariably let me know.
—Yes, it is like that.
—I hear that Senator Minchin suffers from the same indignation as me. However, clearly, this is of real concern for people out there and it must be addressed. We as an opposition have put forward, in a sensible manner, the issue that we see as the key in this: the misuse of market power by the wholesale and retail sides of the petrol industry. However, we will not be satisfied with that alone.
Labor has dealt with this bill in a fairly positive manner by putting up a second reading amendment that sets out a constructive approach that we believe needs to be adopted post the repeal of this legislation. I will refer just briefly, therefore, to the second reading amendment. I do not know how many of my colleagues have referred to this amendment already, but it seems to me that some of its points are quite logical and sensible indeed. It calls on the government:
... to require the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to report to the Parliament annually, commencing in August 2007, on the measures taken and the progress made—
in a number of areas. I will not read the amendment in full, but in part it reads as follows:
... increase market penetration of ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG ...
and we all know the role they will play in the future. The amendment also states:
(b) secure new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and
(c) secure investment in new alternative transport fuel industries in Australia, including gas and coal to liquids.
So it is not a carping second reading amendment; it is an amendment that brings a positive sense to this debate, because everyone realises just how important this debate is to the future of Australia and, of course, to Australians. The second part of the second reading amendment calls on the government to:
... review, in 2009, the proposal to introduce excise on ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG in 2011—
So it calls for a review and to—
... consider whether or not there is a case for delaying the introduction of excise, depending on the progress made ...
The second reading amendment then lists a number of important areas, which include:
(a) in increasing market penetration of biofuels, LPG and CNG;
(b) in securing new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and
(c) towards achieving the 350 million litre biofuels target in 2010.
So, again, that is not an unreasonable expectation to put down and it can be met reasonably by government.
However, the third part of the amendment does have a bit of a sting in its tail. It rightly criticises the government for its tardiness in moving on petrol retail reform—and I think that would be supported by the vast majority of Australians. The government has been very tardy. The government has not responded in a positive way and its tardiness has been shown by the response that has been received right across Australia on this issue.
That particular paragraph in the second reading amendment then criticises the government for:
... bypassing due parliamentary process in introducing a regulation to “undeclare” companies under the Sites Act ...
There is no reason why it could not have been done in other ways, but again that seems to me to be valid commentary on the way that this government from time to time chooses to do its business. It would have been much better to do it in other ways. The next point in criticism of the government is for:
... failing to introduce amendments to the TPA to implement the 2003 Dawson and 2004 Senate recommendations for reform ...
Again, this is very much warranted, because the government has to remember that the broad community out there are very price sensitive to what happens with petrol.
As I said in my earlier statement, the buying public can be faced with not just a daily change but an hourly change—and not just an hourly swing of 1c or 2c. I have driven by the same station not far from my office in Brisbane and I have seen swings in the order of 10c to 15c on some occasions. People wonder why the public at large get upset, but it is very easy to understand. If there were some commensurate changes to the Trade Practices Act, the public may start to get some confidence that there is a Trade Practices Act which has teeth. This is not going to the issue of price fixing—no-one is asking that—because that is going to the issue of justifying the behaviour of these oil companies in certain circumstances.
One cannot fail to remember the occasion when the petrol price spiked because it was a public holiday in the eastern states but in Western Australia, where there was no public holiday on the Monday, for some reason absolutely beyond anyone’s imagination the price did not spike at all. One can understand why there is no lack of cynicism out there amongst the public. Some reference to clear guidelines under the Trade Practices Act would be helpful indeed.
The third part of Senator O’Brien’s amendment criticises the government for ‘failing to act to reduce Australia’s dependence on foreign oil and improve its transport fuel security’. Again, our dependence on foreign fuel is well and truly on the public record, as has been canvassed by a number of my colleagues here. That is the sting in the tail of the second reading amendment, if one wants to call it such, but it is delivered in a positive vein. This government needs to wake up to the fact that there is a need to look at this issue critically. The repeal of this act of itself is insufficient. There is a need to make changes, as suggested by my colleagues, to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. This would build some confidence out there in the public that in Australia we are not going to see yoyo oil prices reflected in petrol prices on an ongoing basis.
On a recent visit to the United States I was told by a number of politicians that the pressure point in the United States was going to $US3 a gallon. If $US3 a gallon is the pressure point for motorists in the United States becoming extremely irate, we have well and truly broken through that barrier given that that equates roughly to about 75c a litre. It depends where you buy here in Australia—I saw $1.14 on the weekend in my state but it has been as high as $1.35 and $1.40, and that is per litre. As Senator Hutchins was mentioning, undoubtedly the price of $2 per litre will become a psychological barrier for people if there are not some checks and balances placed on the powers of the oil moguls.
There are some other parts of the second reading amendment moved by Senator O’Brien that, again, are positive statements. Point (4):
Calls on the Government to immediately conduct a feasibility study into a gas to liquids fuels plant in Australia, including—
and he again lists positive things—
(a) consideration of Petroleum Resources Rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas to liquid fuels projects—
and so on. Again, the positive element comes out in the second reading amendment of my colleague. In conclusion, I believe that the bill—as my colleagues have said—is rightly being supported. However, there needs to be a counterbalancing protection for the consumers in our community because many of them can least afford the charges that are coming about at the petrol pump in this day and age.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-11,"—Can I conclude this second reading debate by thanking all those involved. While much of what was said did not have a lot to do with the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, we have noted with interest the remarks made on all sides. I believe there is majority support for the intent of the government in relation to this legislation. I note that we have been talking about this package of reform going back to when I was industry minister more than five years ago, so I am pleased to see we are at a point now where we can hopefully proceed to bring about this much-needed reform of petrol retailing in this country. This is very important legislation—timely and long overdue—of great benefit both to the industry itself and to consumers of petroleum products. I thank everybody involved and look forward to the timely passage of this legislation.
 (Senator Marshall)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Milne on behalf of the Australian Greens to the second reading amendment moved by Senator O’Brien on behalf of the opposition be agreed to.
Question negatived.
—The question now is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator O’Brien on behalf of the opposition be agreed to.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-09-11,"—This year we have witnessed much excitement in Australian soccer. We have had the recent success of the national side in the FIFA World Cup finals, where the Socceroos advanced to the knock-out stages only to fall to the final winners, Italy; the A-League has just started its second season; and Australia has recently qualified for the Asian Cup finals, to be held in September. Indeed, the recent move to the Asian federation from Oceania means that our national side will be regularly playing nations such as Korea, China and Saudi Arabia, which is certainly a step up from playing the Solomon Islands. This is a fantastic move, and one that will be historically regarded as a defining moment in the history of Australian soccer.
Local support for the game is high. Socceroos games, such as the recent home game against Kuwait, have been selling out within 48 hours. We have had record turnouts at A-League games throughout the pre-season, seeing, for example, nearly 7,000 people turn out on a fine Sunday afternoon at the Aurora Stadium, in Launceston, where Melbourne Victory played Adelaide United.
Another key factor behind the newfound success of soccer in Australia has been the shrewd management displayed by the Chairman of Football Federation Australia, Mr Frank Lowy, and by FFA CEO, Mr John O’Neill. These two men have ensured that a sport that was once a byword for administrative incompetence has the best possible framework to build on.
Only the week before last, John O’Neill announced that he would not be renewing his contract, which expires in March, with the FFA. We acknowledge that soccer in Australia is bigger than any one individual, but the sport will miss his expertise and business acumen. I have every confidence that the FFA board will be able to find a good replacement for him and that the quality of administration will continue to rise.
Research conducted for the 2005-06 summer edition of the Sweeney sports report shows that 50 per cent of the adult population is interested in soccer—the sport’s highest level of interest since the report was first published 20 years ago. Soccer’s interest rating is only four points behind Australian Rules football and is eight and 10 points clear of rugby league and union. I note that the research was conducted between October last year and March this year, before the recent FIFA World Cup Finals in which the Socceroos advanced to the second stage. No doubt the coverage and attention paid to the Socceroos’ valiant efforts would have raised interest in the sport even further since that report. Perhaps it is more important that the report surveyed the level of participation in the various sports by adults living in the capital cities. Of those adults surveyed, 11 per cent played soccer—easily the highest-rating winter team sport; six per cent played Australian Rules football; and four per cent and three per cent played rugby league and union respectively.
At the 14 July, 2006 Council of Australian Governments meeting between federal, state and territory leaders, it was decided that all the state governments and the federal government would strongly support a bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I would like to speak for a moment about what this bid will require. FIFA regulations state that the host nation needs a minimum of 10 stadia, with at least 40,000-seat capacity. Currently, we can meet that requirement at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Telstra Dome, Telstra Stadium, Suncorp Stadium, AAMI Stadium, ANZ Stadium, the Sydney Cricket Ground, Subiaco Oval, the Gabba and Aussie Stadium. However, some venues will need a lot of work before they meet FIFA’s other standards, such as pitch condition. Another issue to be considered is that most of these venues are ovals, and while some can be converted to a rectangular configuration most cannot.
The regulations also state that only one city in the country can have more than one stadium used in the World Cup finals. This is a major hurdle for the bid. Currently, of our 10 stadia with a capacity of 40,000 seats or greater, two are in Melbourne, three are in Sydney and three are in Brisbane. If Australia is to host the World Cup finals, this rule will have to be changed or suspended, or stadia such as Canberra Stadium and Aurora Stadium in Launceston will need to nearly double their capacity.
Another major issue is the FIFA regulation that requires grounds to be unused for eight weeks prior to the finals. Given that all the stadia are currently used by the AFL or the NRL and that the World Cup finals would take place right in the middle of their respective seasons, the number of available stadia drops again. The only solution I can think of is that a major stadium in each city be reserved for AFL or rugby and that the others be rested for the World Cup. Even this compromise would require a tremendous amount of cooperation from the AFL and NRL. But even if that were the case, we would still need to find two more stadia.
A decision will be made by FIFA in 2010 as to who will host the 2018 World Cup finals. It is likely that we will be competing against England and China to host the finals. Neither of these nations will give up easily, and both will make winning the bid a national priority.
If we are being honest in our support to win such a bid, we have to realise that Australia has a lot of work to do. This will require a great deal of money, and much of it will have to come from the Commonwealth. Also, this is something we need to be addressing sooner rather than later. We have fewer than four years to get ourselves into a position where we can convince FIFA that we should host the finals. I hope we will be successful.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Soccer World Cup</title>,ADJOURNMENT,18,1
