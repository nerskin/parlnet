"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-12-08,"—There are a number of issues I will deal with before going to the substance of the Customs Amendment Bill 2004. This bill has been included for debate in the last week on the basis that it is an urgent bill, which enabled it to be exempt from the cut-off motion. The government was able to indicate the reasons for that sufficiently persuasively enough to convince the opposition to support it. The caveat that the opposition sought and that was conceded by the government was that this bill operate for 12 months and a more comprehensive bill be provided in due course. The government has conceded that that bill should be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee will examine that bill to ensure that it is appropriate and deals with the issues in a comprehensive way. In the interim, this bill will deal with the issue of having sufficient penalty options available to the judiciary in respect of criminals and commercial quantities of drugs. 
The bill before us is an important piece of legislation that seeks to enhance sentencing options available to judges in cases where individuals are caught smuggling commercial quantities of dangerous drugs as defined under schedule VI. As it stands, the Customs Act includes 130 dangerous substances that are prohibited. These substances include dangerous drugs we are all familiar with, like cocaine, opium and heroin. Of course schedule VI also contains drugs that will be familiar to ordinary Australians as pharmaceutical products, like codeine, morphine and methadone. The importation of these drugs is restricted because they can be dangerous if taken in large quantities. A third set of drugs, which most senators may not know of, is legal drugs which may be used as ingredients in the manufacture of other drugs. We need to take strong measures to ensure they are not illegally imported as well. This bill tidies up the provisions of the Customs Act to ensure that that does not happen.
The bill will not affect the legal and proper import of drugs for medicinal purposes, as authorised by the Minister for Health and Ageing. Each of the 130 substances listed in schedule VI of the act has a trafficable quantity assigned to it. Anyone in possession of a trafficable quantity can be charged under provisions that prevent low-level drug dealing. Of these 130 substances, only 21 currently specify a commercial quantity. So schedule VI provides trafficable quantities for all of those and some commercial quantities, which are significant increases on the trafficable amount. We have seen in recent times huge imports of illegal substances that have been caught either by Customs, by the AFP or by both in combined operations. This demonstrates in some instances the tenacity of people to continue to attempt to import quite large quantities of illegal dugs.
The intention of differentiating between trafficable and commercial quantities is a good idea, and in retrospect the determination of commercial quantities probably should have been done at that time. But, by and large, I think it was considered at the time that some of these were unlikely to be imported at that amount or were unlikely to be considered as being of sufficient interest for those elements that would pursue these crimes to require the listing of commercial quantities. With the effluxion of time and the changing patterns across the world and across the drug markets there are now clearly instances of people seeking to bring not only trafficable quantities of drugs but also commercial quantities of drugs across our borders. I respect the fact that legislators at the time did not have the benefit of a crystal ball to tell them that drugs like MDMA, also known as ecstasy, would eventually cause the harm they are now inflicting upon our community. I am certainly pleased that Labor can contribute to tightening the provisions for the other 109 substances listed in schedule VI.
It may be worth mentioning the effect of the legislation in relation to sentencing. By defining a commercial quantity for these substances, we add a sentencing option for judges that includes life imprisonment. The maximum current penalty available for the illegal importation of these substances is 25 years, because that is the maximum penalty for importation of trafficable quantities. By spelling out the commercial quantities, as we do in this bill, we will allow judges to impose more severe or appropriate sentences for the Mr Bigs and others who seek to import dangerous substances into our country. 
Labor is concerned about the importation of illegal drugs into this country and fully supports the excellent work of Australian Customs and the Australian Federal Police in their recent successes against drug importers. The amount of MDMA that has been detected by Customs has almost doubled over the last two years. That is excellent work, but we do not know the quantity of drugs which are getting through our borders. A number of people have been doing studies to work out what impact the current Tough on Drugs strategy is having on drug importation. We are certainly now detecting greater quantities of MDMA, but whether we are creating a dint in that market is another question that perhaps I can leave for the minister to answer. Labor is keen to ensure that there are sentencing options available for judges to ensure that they can at least deal in an appropriate way with the offences that are committed.
In truth, I think we are deluding ourselves if we believe these seizures have put a stop to the availability of illegal drugs in the community, as recent reports in the media show. If I can use figures from the Parliamentary Library and from Customs for senators' interest, it is clear that more ecstasy is being imported into Australia. As recently as 1993, there were few seizures of ecstasy at the customs barrier. In 1994, 2.9 kilograms were seized. However, in the period January to August 1996, 29.9 kilograms were seized. In 2003-04 that figure was 873 kilograms. That is a frightening increase in the detection of MDMA.
There is some evidence to suggest that Australia could again be the target of drug lords who wish to import heroin. Senators may be interested to know that, since the removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan, opium poppies have returned to the fields as an acceptable cash crop for farmers. More heroin coming onto the market may well make Australia an increased target for heroin imports over the coming few years. Labor will be monitoring this situation closely and will be holding the government to account for any increased availability of this most insidious drug.
Labor has taken a number of steps to satisfy itself that this bill will not have an unjust effect. Firstly, the bill will not be retrospective. Secondly, as far as our resources have been able to check, the bill has been examined and it has been found that it does not make any attempt to modify or vary the existing commercial quantities specified for the schedule VI drugs. We can ensure that the government will at least put on the record that that is not the case. Thirdly, we will move an amendment to the bill to include a sunset clause. That will give the parliament a chance to review the effects and operation of the bill once it is enacted. There is also a commitment, as I said earlier, for a new bill that is to be introduced into the parliament next year to go to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I suspect that will include a range of other matters as well.
In short, this bill will have the effect of making additional penalties available to the courts in the very serious area of illicit drug importation in commercial quantities. It is an issue that Labor is able to support. It is also one of those areas where it is not just a case of ensuring that there are mandatory sentencing laws available. These are maximum sentences so the range of sentencing under the Crimes Act is available, and I am sure the minister can assure the parliament that that is the case. Therefore, I commend the bill to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-12-08,"—The Customs Amendment Bill 2004, which has been introduced as a matter of urgency by the government, makes changes to the maximum penalties available for drug offences under the Crimes Act. The government indicates that recent prosecutions have highlighted an anomaly within the current provisions. Drug offences under the Customs Act are divided into those categories relating to trafficable quantities and those relating to commercial quantities of a prescribed drug. A commercial quantity is larger than a trafficable quantity and therefore attracts a heavier maximum penalty of life imprisonment, rather than 25 years imprisonment.
Currently, there are a number of drugs for which no commercial quantity has been prescribed under the act. In other words, the act only prescribes a trafficable quantity for those substances. I am informed that the reason for these omissions in the act can be largely explained by the fact that, at the time when the drug offences were originally created, many of those substances were not being brought into Australia and used to the same extent as they are now. It appears that commercial quantities were prescribed for the more readily used drugs, while only a trafficable quantity was prescribed for the more rare drugs.
The drug market has changed considerably since that time and some of these substances, such as ice, are being more widely used and presumably imported in larger quantities. The government has informed the Democrats that this issue was highlighted recently during a trial relating to a customs offence involving a very large quantity of ice. I understand that the sentencing judge in that case sentenced the defendant to 25 years imprisonment, but commented that he would have given a sentence of life imprisonment had that option been available to him at the time.
One of the important considerations for the Democrats in examining this bill is that the effect of the bill is simply to provide more severe maximum penalties. There is no prescription of minimum penalties and, more importantly, the sentencing discretion remains with the court. I understand that the sentencing guidelines set out in the Crimes Act will continue to apply and will guide judges in determining the most appropriate sentence in the circumstances of the case. This means in practice that someone could commit an offence relating to a commercial quantity of a prescribed substance and it would be possible for them to receive a penalty that is less than the maximum penalty for a trafficable offence. Whilst I am not advocating light penalties for serious drug offences, the point I am trying to make is that the discretion as to the most appropriate sentence will remain with the court. This is vitally important, because it is the court that hears all the evidence in a particular case. It has the opportunity to hear submissions about any mitigating or exacerbating circumstances that may justify a longer or shorter term of imprisonment.
Essentially, the legislation will combat situations such as that which occurred in the recent ice prosecution, where the judge was of the view that a heavier sentence should apply, but was not able to give such a sentence due to the current legislative restrictions. This bill will give judges a broader discretion to determine appropriate sentences for serious drug offences. On that basis, we Democrats readily lend our support for the legislation.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-12-08,"—in reply—I thank senators for supporting the Customs Amendment Bill 2004 and I acknowledge their contribution. In particular, I thank the opposition for their support for the quick facilitation of the passage of the bill. This is a very important bill which strikes at those people who wish to gain commercially from the trafficking in illicit drugs, in particular from the importation of those drugs into Australia. As Senator Greig pointed out, over time the drug scene has changed. When these laws were drafted some time ago the drug scene was somewhat different to what it is today. We have seen varying derivations of amphetamine type stimulants—in particular, crystal methylamphetamine, which is known as ice—gain a market share. Recently, there was a case involving the importation of that drug and, as Senator Greig pointed out, comments were made in relation to sentencing options. I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that the Attorney-General's Department had been working on this matter prior to that. It came to the department's attention that an amendment was needed and the advice was it was best done by way of legislative amendment rather than by way of regulation. That is why the urgent passage of this bill is necessary rather than waiting until early in the new year. 
I point out also that the government has a bill planned for the sittings early in the new year. The Law and Justice (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 will be a comprehensive approach to drug offences and penalties which attach thereto. In this instance, however, urgent action was necessary and the officials of the Attorney-General's Department have worked very well in getting this legislation in place. Again, I acknowledge the assistance of the opposition and others in the Senate in facilitating the passage of the bill. 
As Senator Ludwig pointed out, this amendment bill relates to schedule VI of the Customs Act, which applies to offences involving a commercial quantity of amphetamine type stimulant drugs, particularly crystal methylamphetamine, which I mentioned earlier. Previously, the law dealt with offences involving only a trafficable quantity, a lesser amount, and the maximum penalty was 25 years imprisonment. Now offences relating to those sorts of drugs will have a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Life imprisonment attaches to the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin, cocaine and other drugs about which we have a more common knowledge. The drugs mentioned in the amending bill will now have a commercial quantity provision, which will mean that life imprisonment can be handed down to anyone who imports a commercial quantity of those drugs. 
Of course, it is no secret that we face a great challenge in the illicit drug market of amphetamine type stimulants. We have made some progress in reducing the supply of heroin. We are not complacent of course; we still continue the war against drugs in that area. But, both domestically and overseas, we have seen a huge increase in the production of amphetamine type stimulants. Domestically, drug laboratories have increased by around 300 per cent, indicating a huge domestic market.
Also, we have seen very large seizures at the border. This indicates that there is a market in Australia, and that overseas criminals see Australia as a target, so we have to fight it both internationally and nationally. With this amendment we send a very clear message that Australia will not tolerate the importation of commercial quantities of illicit drugs—indeed, will not tolerate the importation of illicit drugs at all. The imposition of a penalty where the maximum period of imprisonment is life imprisonment is the strongest message we can deliver under our criminal justice system. There are people serving a life sentence under Commonwealth law for the importation of commercial quantities of illicit drugs. The Commonwealth has, we believe, the toughest penalties for the trafficking of drugs. We have seen life sentences handed down where non-parole periods have exceeded 20 years. There have been sentences ranging upwards from 25 years to life with non-parole periods in excess of 20 years. This sends a very clear message that, if you attempt to import illicit drugs into Australia, you will face serious penalties.  
We have about 700 federal offenders in Australia, and over half of those would be for drug offences. In the Commonwealth jurisdiction those offences are at the serious end of the scale. Attempts are being made to bring in larger amounts of drugs, as Senator Ludwig has pointed out. I want to place on record the appreciation of the Australian government for the work done by the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission and for the cooperation we get from state and territory police. We cannot fight this war alone. It requires a whole-of-government approach and a complete law enforcement approach. The very fine work of law enforcement is making a difference. We have had some standout results from the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service. I commend this bill to the Senate. It has been an urgent response and is much needed. 
Question agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—I move the Greens' amendment (1) on sheet 4439:
(1)	Clause 7, page 6 (after line 20), after subclause (2), insert:
Specific functions relating to the provision of water for environmental purposes
	(2A)	The NWC has the following specific functions relating to the provision of water for environmental purposes in the Murray-Darling Basin:
	(a)	to complete implementation of the Living Murray First Step by 31 December 2005 (the Living Murray First Step means the provision of an average of 500 GL of water per year in perpetuity to achieve specific environmental objectives and outcomes for six significant ecological assets: Barmah-Millewa Forest, Gunbower and Koondrook-Perricoota Forests, Hattah Lakes, Chowilla floodplain (including Lindsay-Wallpolla), the Murray Mouth, Coorong and Lower Lakes, and the River Murray Channel);
	(b)	to secure an additional annual average of 2500 GL of water per annum in perpetuity for environmental purposes in the Murray-Darling Basin by 31 December 2007, of which at least 1000GL must be used to improve the health of the Murray River;
	(c)	to complete the return of all currently over-allocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction by 2010;
	(d)	in the Murray Darling Basin to allocate water for environmental purposes in accordance with plans prepared by the Murray Darling Basin Commission.
	(2B)	The NWC must provide for a national system of heritage rivers to be designated by 2010.
It would be very helpful if the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and indeed any advisers, were actually available in the house. We had neither last night, but I think it is fair enough that this morning we should have both the minister—here he comes—and some helpful advice for the committee on the matters that have arisen and will arise.
I explained this amendment to the chamber last night, but I will reiterate briefly that this is an amendment to give some teeth and some definition to the National Water Commission, which is going to be funded by $2 billion of taxpayers' money, to meet specific targets for providing environmental flows, particularly in the Murray and Darling. These are, firstly, to secure the entire 500 gigalitres promised by the government—by several governments—required to allow the first steps for the Living Murray to be taken by 31 December 2005. 
Chair, you will recall that last night several senators, not least Senator Lees, were speaking about the parlous state of the river red gums along the Murray: 75 per cent are stressed, dying or dead. There is massive carnage of these iconic red gum forests. One scientist described it as driving from Sydney to Melbourne along a thousand-kilometre highway with dead trees on both sides. That is how rapidly the river red gum forests are being destroyed. Of course, with that you get the destruction of habitat for a whole range of birds and mammals, and even the fish life in the river because the food resource in the river is very much related to the natural botanical cover of the riverine ecosystem.
The rescue of the red gums is absolutely critical. Prime Minister Howard and the government say, `We will give 500 gigalitres some time in the coming years.' Maybe it will be 2010, maybe it will be 2014. That is too late. It has got to be now. We know that 500 gigalitres is not going to return health to the river; 4,000 gigalitres are required there—eight times as much. But the government and the Prime Minister have not returned one drop of water to the Murray or the Darling in the last nine years in office—not one drop—as this environmental catastrophe has unfolded in front of the government and several ministers for the environment. It has been a total dereliction of environmental duty to this nation's greatest waterway.
What the Greens are saying is, yes, set up the National Water Commission, let us get a national overview body, but let us not just have a bureaucracy which is monitoring things and disbursing money to applicants. Let us have real goals here which address the real problem we know about. This amendment says, `Let us get the 500 gigalitres'—one-eighth of what is required—`to the river in the next 13 months.' That is going to be too late for many of the river red gums, but let us at least set that target and not let it float off into the ether.
In the absence of that, I ask the minister: what is the target date? Tell the committee what the target date is for the 500 gigalitres. The Commonwealth and the states agreed on the 500 gigalitres and committed $500 million 13 months ago. Last month—and the minister is very pleased with himself about this—there was an agreement on specific measures to secure and fund the first 240 gigalitres, half of the one-eighth required to assure health to the rivers. But not one dollar will be spent and no water will flow because there is no agreement—there is a fight over competition payments. During the election campaign the Prime Minister revealed that the $2 billion is not going to come from the Commonwealth purse; it is going to come from competition payments that the states and territories are getting.
The second part of the amendment is to secure an additional 2,500 gigalitres of water for the environment and the nation's rivers by December 2007, with 1,000 gigalitres going to the Murray. That would take the Murray's allocation to 1,500 gigalitres within three years. That is half what scientists say is required to ensure a healthy river. The report of 2002 has been suppressed. The written report has got out; the pictorial report has not. The Greens are saying: let us go halfway and put a date on it, which is three years out from now. I asked last night about the Murray-Darling Basin. So the minister has had overnight to consider a report to the committee this morning on a part of the Darling catchment which is of national significance and one of the nation's and the world's great waterbird havens and breeding places—the Macquarie Marshes. I ask the minister to report on the state of the health of and the prospects for the Macquarie Marshes. I ask the government to turn around the wholesale destruction of the Macquarie Marshes due to the diversion of the flow from that river system over the last decades. 
The third component of this amendment is to return rivers and wetlands to environmentally sustainable extraction levels by 2010—six years from now. The word `sustainable' has become part of the government's lexicon and it does mean something—sustenance for the environment which is guaranteed. Is the government not able to give that guarantee for six years from now? If it cannot give that guarantee, what date does it give? The National Water Initiative commits to returning overallocated systems to environmentally sustainable extraction levels, but there is no time line. Can you believe that? I am sure the minister is going to give us one, because if we do not have a time line it means nothing. In fact, it says that we are not going to achieve this. If we were going to achieve it, there would be a time line. It is done in all areas of the economy, but when it comes to the nation's environment there is no time line. In other words, there is no objective in real terms.
The Australian Conservation Foundation, the Farmers Federation and the Banking Association agreed to environmental sustainability by 2014—a decade from now. When we look at the Murray-Darling system, as I said in reference to the red gum component, we cannot wait a decade. Urgent action is needed now because the whole ecological system has been collapsing in front of our eyes, due to the negligence of this government and indeed state governments, over the last decade when action was required. The problem was known further back than 10 years ago, but Prime Minister Howard, several environment ministers and government in general have sat on their hands and done nothing because they are not prepared to tackle the big irrigation players, the corporate sector, which takes most of the water out of these systems. The most vile and deployable excess has been reached with what we see at Cubbie Station and the upper catchment of the Darling River.
The $2 billion has no defined spending program—I will be asking the minister about that. We would be better off getting rid of Cubbie Station's entrapment of the flow of the Balonne and other river systems in far south Queensland rather than just spending the money on feelgood programs which are not going to make much difference. Last night the minister said that the Prime Minister wants to get 20 major programs going in the next year—or was that years? Let us not set time lines. I ask him: what are the 20 programs?
The Prime Minister has said that water is property. He has put dollars on it and wants taxpayers to compensate the corporations who are overallocated and are, therefore, destroying this ecosystem. Don't ask them to compensate the nation for the destruction of the red gum forests, the native fish populations, the Coorong and its bird population. The corporations do not have to pay for that because that is not worth a cent in this government's estimation. That is not property. Everything comes down to dollars with this government. So, despite the ecologically criminal outcome for this river, nobody will have to pay and nobody will be found responsible. 
The Prime Minister says, `Put dollars on water.' One can understand compensation for land—it is even written into the Constitution—and he now says water, but what about air? How about compensating the citizens of Australia for the polluted and heated-up air they breathe due to industrial activity, in particular coal burning, and emissions. Is the Prime Minister going to bring to book diesel exhausts, which I am told kill 1,000 Australians each year? Is air not property? If it is, why isn't there a dollar value on it and a penalty system for those who make it unfit to breathe and in fact, in some cases, lethal? It is selective; it is what the big corporations want.  
Deputy Prime Minister Anderson introduced into the discourse a couple of years ago the need to compensate his mates who take the lion's share of the water from the Darling system to make megadollars through the new industrial agriculture in that basin. Where is the compensation for the destruction of the environment that the overallocation of water has incurred? There is not a whisper or a hint of any. Instead the government wants to compensate the companies which endorse it—if commonsense prevails and they have to give back some water to ensure the health of the river. Where will the compensation come from? It will be taken from taxpayers and ordinary Australians and given to the government's corporate mates. They have done the wrong thing and have gotten away with it, under the Carr government and its predecessors in New South Wales, for example. We have been asked to legislate to do the right thing, and they will get the money. They will get paid for it. But that philosophy of compensation does not extend to the environment, and it certainly will never extend to the environment under this government. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-12-08,"—I rise in support of the sentiments expressed by Senator Brown, in particular his emphasis on a time line. We certainly do need a time line and the teeth to insist that it is met. However, we in this chamber are not the ones putting together the plan of action; we are putting legislation in place that supports a COAG agreement. As much as we might like to get inside the COAG process and undo what has been done—which is at least a step in the right direction but still not good enough—we are at last seeing the states get serious about water, about the conservation of water, about the state of our rivers and underground aquifers and about guaranteeing the long-term availability of water for cities such as Adelaide. And the majority of farmers understand that, if they are not part of this process, in the long term the water will not be fit even for agriculture. 
As I mentioned yesterday, already there are algal blooms in the Murray-Darling system and we are barely into summer. Alarm bells have rung, and with the drought they are ringing through the Murray-Darling Basin and in many other water systems across the country, such as the eastern Mount Lofty Ranges and the central Mount Lofty Ranges, in the mid-north of South Australia.
Finally there is an agreement between the states and the Commonwealth. Yes, there are some questions about funding which some states are concerned about, but we in this place cannot undo the basics of the agreement. The only issue I believe that is outstanding, where the legislation does not reflect what was agreed to, is in the process of openness and accountability. Looking at the running sheet, I see we are up to about half a dozen amendments—from the Democrats, me, Senator Murphy and the Greens—and I understand we are very close to the government agreeing that there has to be a transparent process where all parties and everybody who is interested in this is able to see what is going on, what is being accepted and what is being rejected. 
I know the frustration when I have tried in South Australia to get information on issues that lots and lots of money has gone into. Many millions of Commonwealth dollars have gone into the salt interception schemes. Farmers were promised that they would have annual watertable and salinity readings for the ground water under their properties and in the surrounding stockyard plains. What has happened? As things started to go wrong, we suddenly saw all the information dry up and the reports not released. Indeed, for the last four years farmers have been doing the work. They know that their bores are going up six or eight metres, but they cannot get the overall picture unless they put it together for themselves, because those reports are now hidden. So, while I am certainly supportive of the sentiments that Senator Brown has expressed, I believe to support at this time the amendments he has put forward will unduly delay this piece of legislation, which is a very positive step in the right direction. 
If it does not work then yes, the Commonwealth should basically say to the states that enough is enough. I believe there is already power under the Constitution for the Commonwealth to step in where water is not being used wisely—I think the words are `where there is not reasonable use'. However, if there is any question about that then the environment minister can determine to put another power under the EPBC Act so that water becomes a trigger under the EPBC Act. I believe the minister already has enough grounds to do that. I think it will be at least 12 months before it has been proven whether or not this COAG process is really going to work on water. But somewhere down the track it will be up to the government to say either, yes, this is working—yes, we are getting somewhere—or, no, the states are still refusing to come to the party and to do what is sensible so we the Commonwealth will step in. For now I think the only amendment we have to concern ourselves with is the one that ensures the spirit of the COAG agreement is adhered to when it comes to openness and transparency of process.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I want to indicate that we strongly support these objectives, along with Senator Lees, but believe that this bill is not the place for us to put them in. We would have no hesitation whatsoever in putting them into a second reading speech as an expression of what the Senate would like to see this process pick up on. I think it would be unworkable if this chamber actually imposed this on a process that is being set up, and that is what this bill is about: it is about establishing a process. So we absolutely agree with all of those points, and there are probably more that you would want to put in to get the NWC to consider. As the chair of the Senate environment committee inquiry into urban water, I would like to see the Water Commission deal with quite a lot of the very obvious problems with our urban water use that could be solved readily. I want to put on the record that the Democrats do support all of those specific suggestions.
I want to also say that designating a system of heritage rivers by 2010 is a fine idea. The Democrats have been advocating that for some time, and I hope that the heritage bill that was passed a little while ago picks up heritage rivers as one of its themes. It would be interesting if the minister could give us some information on the progress of that. I think that is the appropriate legislation under which this should be done. Certainly COAG should consider this, and consider heritage rivers and the importance of them, as part of its processes. It is unfortunate, really, that we cannot support this for the procedural reasons that I mentioned. I would really like this to be expressed by the chamber as something which we support; however, as I said, it seems to me to be inappropriate in its current form.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I indicate that the Labor Party cannot support this amendment either but in broad terms we understand the intent and the principles behind it. We believe very strongly that encapsulated in this amendment are very important issues that need to be dealt with, as matters of great importance, by the National Water Commission in its practical work plans. It is unfortunate that we cannot support this amendment. We support the principles but not in this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—I commend senators for their contributions on this amendment. To be fair to Senator Brown, I think his motivations are absolutely pristine. There is no doubting that we share his views about the need to improve the environmental outcomes along the Darling and Murray rivers and basins. We have in fact, with the assistance of many very good people both within the basin and without, invested heavily and tried to develop a framework. I think we have successfully developed a framework that can see significant progress made. It was a pleasure for me to attend my first Murray-Darling Basin Commission Ministerial Council meeting on 26 November and to add to the approved list of projects projects that will in fact deliver something like 240 gigalitres of water to environmental flows. This will assist the six icon sites and is a big step forward.
It is probably fair to agree with Senator Brown on this point and say that progress has been far too slow. If we had been more ahead of the game then those red gums would not be in the distress that they are in now. I think it is helpful to learn from our mistakes, and there have been huge mistakes made along the River Murray. However, I think the other thing we should not do is undermine or potentially denigrate the work of many good people. There are good people all around Australia—people in the state governments; people in the ACT government under Jon Stanhope's leadership; people showing leadership like Bob Debus in New South Wales, who is working very hard with his ministerial colleagues and the people from his authorities; scientists putting the hard work in; and farmers, as Senator Lees referred to—who are all working hard to get a great generational breakthrough on these issues. I do, however, think that the amendment of the Greens to effectively take the Living Murray first step initiatives and the responsibility for their implementation out of the Murray Darling Basin Commission and shift them across to the National Water Commission would be counterproductive. I hope that Senator Brown, who is quite clearly focused on the same issues as we are—we seek to deliver the same sorts of policy outcomes in a different way—would see that his amendment may actually be counterproductive.
Senator Brown asked questions about the time lines. I commend to him the National Water Initiative—if you do not have a copy, Senator Brown, then I will provide you with one—which does in fact set some quite clear guidelines and time lines. In fact, they support his own time line in part (c) of his amendment, which talks about sustainable levels of extraction by 2010. Senator Brown may not be happy with this but sometimes when you have state-Commonwealth negotiations you do not get the highest common denominator—you might even get the lowest common denominator. But I think in this case we have a practical, achievable deadline. 
Even if you accept the view of Senator Lees that we might have some constitutional power to override the states on these things, the practical reality is that, when it comes to building the projects and negotiating with the farmers, a lot comes down to land use management which is, ostensibly, under the constitutional control of the states. Negotiating with irrigators about how much irrigation water they will get and letting contracts to build pipelines and cover over irrigation channels are things that the states have to do. They are things that the Commonwealth cannot do unless we get rid of the federation all together, and some people probably advocate that from time to time. 
We do have to work cooperatively. In the National Water Initiative the states and territories have agreed to make substantial progress by 2010 towards adjusting all overallocated and overused systems, in accordance with the time lines indicated in their implementation plans. So there is a clear time frame. The national timetable for action includes the development of the implementation plans, which are, as I said, progress by 2010, risk assignment by 2014, interim thresholds for water markets and trading by June of the coming year, freeing up of institutional barriers by 2014, and a range of investment programs and processes within that. So there are some clear time lines.
We also, to be practical, need to understand that we can build the projects and we can get to work on the projects that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission ministers agreed on late last month, but it does not help the environmental debate to blur these things unnecessarily. I think more people of Australia need to understand the practical side of environmental repair. When looking at a wetland or a piece of endangered biodiversity you can see that a lot of it is about practical measures—keeping out feral animals, stopping erosion, getting rid of weeds and fixing riverbanks. All of these things will get better community buy-in, which will help the cause that Senator Brown professes to support, if you do not blur this. One thing that you can easily confuse people with about the Murray is pretending that you can create this water. You can certainly save water by closing in irrigation channels and you can save water by making sure that you do not have overallocation for irrigation purposes. But, ultimately, to improve the amount of water that goes to environmental purposes once you have done all of that you have to rely on precipitation—you actually have to have some rain. We have been very challenged for rain and, unfortunately, this parliament cannot legislate to make it rain. That is a practical fact that we should not hide.
In terms of those time lines, I said I think in answer to a question from Senator Lees during question time earlier in the week that I would seek to inform the parliament on the implementation schedule for the Living Murray Initiative, under the first steps. I will seek to do that on a regular basis. I will rely on my state colleagues to provide us with progress. It will be in my interests, in the government's interests and in the interests of the people to have regular reporting on that. I have undertaken to do that and will continue to do so. That is the key reason why we cannot support Senator Brown's amendment.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—There is an old saying that the way to hell is paved with good intentions. Everybody thinks this is a great intention. There are great sentiments about the Greens' amendment here—but, goodness, do not ask us to support it! Let us not put some teeth in this legislation, and if we are going to set schedules let us not do it before 2010—a couple of elections away at least.
It is just a derelict attitude. The stress on the river red gum forests—and we know that that is an emergency which every week, every month has catastrophic effects—is not because of the rainfall; it is because the river flow and the floods are being sapped by human use, more and more by industrial agriculture. The Greens have brought forward some measures to get the water back because this will be a crisis in the next 13 months. This minimal 240 gigalitres that the government is talking about should be 500 gigalitres. I ask the minister: when will the 500 gigalitre flow get back into the Murray? What is your time line, Minister, for getting that flow and what will it do as far as the river red gums are concerned? Will it turn around that awesome figure of 75 per cent stressed, dead or dying in those forests? ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—That is a very fair question and one that I have undertaken to report back on. Just on 26 November we have agreed on the first projects put forward by the Victorian and the New South Wales governments, under famous clause 36. Those first projects were agreed to by the state ministers. They will only commence with the recommitment of the states to the National Water Initiative. We are very hopeful of an outcome. As I have said, I will report to the Senate on a regular basis on progress. It is a very fair question. The Commonwealth wants to see those projects flow. We do not want to stop at 240 gigalitres. It is a good start, though, Senator Brown, if you want to get to 500 gigalitres. It is a substantial first step. Let us get to the 500 gigalitres. You say that we should get to 1,500 or 2,400 gigalitres. The road to good intentions is paved in fact by substantial, solid and in this case very expensive steps. We should congratulate the proponents—the states in this case—and their partners in getting to the 240 gigalitres.
It is entirely appropriate that I report on a regular basis on the progress of those projects and on the environmental flows that they deliver. I think the concept of having the six icon sites that include the red gums you were talking about, Senator Brown, is a great way to focus accountability on the environmental outcomes. Quite frankly, we should be able to say exactly how many litres of environmental flow go to those icon sites as the projects unfold. I think that is good accountability. It is good pressure on governments and the commission to make us environmentally accountable for these outcomes. It is a good process.
The National Water Commission Bill 2004 focuses on places other than the Murray. There is a risk in the environmental debate of just focusing on one river. I know that state ministers are concerned about that. It is not in the interests of the Murray, which is obviously a vital and crucial environmental and natural asset for Australia—a piece of our natural heritage—to just focus on one river. For example, I think the Premier of Western Australia used this bit of politics to not sign up to the National Water Initiative, when he went back to my own state of Western Australia—as Western Australians are known to do from time to time—and said, `This is just a Murray-Darling agreement; it's got nothing to do with Western Australia.' You get that reaction the further you get away from the Murray River.
The government will invest more heavily than any other government in the history of Australia in the Murray River, the Darling River and the Murray-Darling Basin. But we need to ensure that Australians support that process and that they see the government and other governments investing in river systems all around Australia. In Tasmania, in Queensland and in my home state of Western Australia people need to see environmental repair taking place across a whole range of rivers, river systems and their estuaries. Also we cannot ignore, as Senator Allison has drawn our attention to, the very important need for far better management of urban water. That is why the Prime Minister travelled to Adelaide to announce investments in reforms and projects there. There are projects right around Australia, as Senator Allison quite properly referred to, that need urgent and massive investment.  
Historically, there has been a massive underinvestment and massively bad management of water in many of our urban centres. We are not casting blame on anyone here. We have had massive growth in this country. We have had urban sprawl expanding at massive and, dare I say, unsustainable rates, and water management is dragging many years behind. Getting that right means major investment. The water fund can provide that major investment, but you also need some reform to the way in which people price water, use water and manage water. This fund can underwrite that.
In relation to environmental repair of other rivers, the government has invested, through the Natural Heritage Trust, in a number of other projects, including $74.7 million in the last six years for the Great Artesian Basin; the Lake Eyre Basin projects; $32.7 million for on-the-ground works aimed at reducing the impact of stormwater and waste water on coastal and marine water quality; and $10 million over the past eight years through the Waterwatch Australia program, which sees local and state governments, industry and the community working cooperatively and has included about 50,000 volunteers across the states and territories in protecting and managing our waterways. All those examples give you a flavour of the sort of work that has been enabled by the government's environmental programs across the rivers and waterways of this whole nation. A lot of that work goes unsung. 
I asked the department to provide me with details of specific Natural Heritage Trust projects on Australia's rivers other than the Murray, because we invest heavily in the Murray. I think there is a big risk in us all focusing our attention on the Murray. We need to invest heavily in the Murray—it needs that investment—but we also must make sure that Australians across the country know that their rivers in their own backyards are being looked after by appropriate levels of investment. We need to engage catchment groups and farmers, industry and dairies along the banks of our rivers, making sure they improve their work practices and stop nutrient flows into the rivers. That work is all happening as a result of the Natural Heritage Trust, through the integration of both the catchment plans and the work of volunteers across the country. 
I will get information on just how many projects the government is funding through the Natural Heritage Trust for river care in this country. The early estimate is that there are 1,700 to 2,000 projects on rivers other than the Murray. I think it is really important we get the balance right.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—The problem is that the 1,700 projects the minister is talking about—which citizens put enormous work into and break their backs over—are no match for the extractive industries which are damaging the rivers. We are seeing overall serial degradation of the riverine systems in Australia. I have a sometimes residence on the Liffey River in Tasmania. The log trucks are ripping out the forests in that basin—under the aegis of the Prime Minister of Australia. When it rains you see the mud coming down the various streams into that river from the logging operations. But the Liffey river system is better off than many of the other river systems in Australia, where there is prodigious logging of old-growth forests and the destruction of natural habitat—there is no look in there for environmental sustainability—under the authority of the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. John Howard. We see the destruction of river systems and upper catchments while money is given to citizens' groups downstream to do what they can. There is no logic. There is no national environmental common sense coming out of the Prime Minister's office. The big money wins out and the environment suffers.  
Citizens' groups very often are despairing and are driven to do what they can to pick up the pieces with a bit of largesse from the government, which is no match for the destruction the Howard government permits and encourages, day by day, to river systems across this country. Witness the failure of the Howard government to bring to an end land clearing in Queensland—a state government initiative. Witness the failure of the federal government to do anything about the disgrace of the Cubbie Station. Witness the failure of the minister and the Prime Minister to ever use—glory forsaken—the corporations power of the Constitution, which gives the government the power to stop all these destructive operations, even if compensation is involved. That power will not be used because the government is not of a mind to tackle the mighty and the powerful when it comes to the extractive industries, and the environment continues to suffer. 
The Greens have devised a simple program for putting time lines into the urgent need for a return of water to the river. The Greens program falls far short of that recommended by the scientists in the suppressed February 2002 report labelled, `Independent report of the expert reference panel on environmental flows and water quality requirements for the River Murray system' which said that you will only get a higher probability of having a healthy working river Murray system if you return 4,000 gigalitres. The minister cannot even give us the date for returning a 10th of that—something that is not going to reverse the destruction of most of the river red gums, let alone the other species, or the Coorong, the internationally renowned wetlands at the end of the Murray system. As I have said in this place, I went there earlier this year and the local expert said, `Those curlews'—the shore feeding birds—`there were 40,000 in 1990 and today there are 2,000.' The responsibility for the destruction of that internationally recognised water bird and marine and riverine system lies, above all, with the Howard government. Inactivity is every bit as culpable as wrong activity when you have the power to stop the wrong that is being done to these river systems. We bring in a simple amendment which says, `Let's take the government's projected return of water to the river and put dates to it' and people say, `That's a fine sentiment, but we cannot vote for that.' 
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) to (3) on amendment sheet 4481:
(1)	Clause 8, page 8 (lines 11 to 14), omit subclause (2), substitute:
	(2)	Commissioners are to be appointed by the Minister, by instrument in writing, on the nomination of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework.
(2)	Clause 8, page 8 (lines 15 to 17), omit subclause (3), substitute:
	(3)	A nomination of a person for appointment as a Commissioner must be made by resolution of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework.
(3)	Clause 24, page 15 (line 14), at the end of paragraph (1)(a), add:
	“or (iii)	any COAG agreed programs;”
Amendments (1) and (2) relate to clause 8 and reflect the concerns of both the opposition and those people who made submissions to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee in relation to the provisions in the National Water Commission Bill 2004. The concerns are that the whole-of-government initiative that has emerged out of the COAG Water Reform Framework, which is now the National Water Commission, would be more appropriately reflected if the commissioners were to be appointed by the minister on the nomination of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework and that the nomination of a person for appointment as a commissioner must be made by resolution of the parties to the COAG Water Reform Framework, rather than the National Water Initiative, because, as we all know, there are some states and territories that have not signed up to that agreement. Amendment (3) is a very simple amendment going to the functions of the CEO that allow us to incorporate the addition of any COAG agreed programs in his administration of funds.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting these amendments. The composition of the commission was agreed by the COAG process, and I think it is worth noting that the Western Australian and Victorian state government submissions did not suggest any further changes to the composition of COAG. The commission comprises people with a high level of expertise in relevant areas. The Commonwealth nominates four members, including the chair, and the other parties to the National Water Initiative nominate three. We support the idea that the commission is expert in relevant fields and not representative of particular interest groups or governments. I think to interfere in what has already been agreed by COAG in this respect, in terms of expertise and so on, would not be appropriate for the committee at this point in time.
There is one issue on the matter of the commission that I would like to ask the minister about. It is an issue that came up as part of the WWF Australia submission to the inquiry process. Minister, you might be able to talk about this. The WWF Australia submission says:
... the Bill sets out a list of expertise to be included on the Commission, including experts in freshwater ecology or hydrology. WWF understands that the range of expertise is not limited to the list provided for in the Bill but notes the NWI implies experts in both freshwater ecology and hydrology will be included on the Commission (Schedule C). These are quite different scientific disciplines, and both highly relevant to the NWI. WWF is concerned that it is possible that only one relevant scientific expert may be appointed to the Commission.
I wonder if the minister could clarify that and confirm that it is intended that both freshwater ecology and hydrology will be included in the composition.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—I do not think it would be wise to confirm that. That could be too limiting. I will just say that nothing in this limits us from doing that. We want to make sure—and I think you would agree with this—that we have the very best experts on board. I think the sentiments that were expressed in the submission that you have quoted are entirely admirable and supportable, but I think that it would be inappropriate for me to limit the appointments in those terms. But it sounds like a very sensible suggestion, which we will take on board.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I wish to ask the minister some general questions about the commissioners. I note the naming last month of Mr Ken Matthews as the newly appointed CEO of the National Water Commission. I ask, in terms of the legislation and within the provisions of the legislation, whether Mr Matthews will be a commissioner.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,—The answer is yes—we expect that.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,—The announcement by the Prime Minister of the Australian water fund indicated that the funds would go to projects on the ground. I ask the minister: where are the costs of the administration of the commission going to be drawn from?,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,—They will be drawn from the Australian water fund.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I have a range of other questions, but I think, for expediency's sake, I might leave those until estimates.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—There was one question that Senator Stephens did ask me privately, and that was in relation to when we want to make the appointments. We have not actually received formally the nominations from the states. As soon as the passage of this bill is complete—the first hurdle we have to jump—the Commonwealth's view is that we get on and make these appointments as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the comments I made in relation to Senator Allison's intervention in the debate. We are keen to do that, and we are obviously keen to get the nominations from the states.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I do not wish to prolong this debate, but I would be in trouble with my colleagues if I did not say, Minister, that we hope these appointments are made on merit. I would have moved the Democrats' usual amendment, which would be up to about 27 times now and which would likely not get support again. Minister, I would like you to take on board our request in this case that this be a clear process that is based on merit.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,—Could the minister tell the committee what the 20 major programs are that the Prime Minister wants to get going in the next years?,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—We are expecting to receive proposals from the states. We are expecting those proposals to be assessed under the commission's legislative responsibilities. I think the Prime Minister is giving a very clear indication—and I think Senator Brown would agree with this—that we will not just set up this bureaucracy and spend months and months, if not years, contemplating our bellybuttons. He wants projects to be commenced. That is the very clear indication. They will all be subject to the assessment processes and frameworks that are established under this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—So, when the minister said last night that the Prime Minister wanted to get 20 major programs going in the next years, that did not really mean anything in particular?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—It meant exactly what I said. I think the Prime Minister's bona fides are represented by the fact that within a few weeks of his making that statement we are here with a substantial piece of legislation to set up a new National Water Commission. That supports a historic agreement between the states, the territories and the Commonwealth on how Australia deals with water and sets up a uniform national trading and pricing system. It is a historic addressing of the fact that we have had overallocations and that we are trying to get some very serious reform. The Prime Minister has supported this entire process with his own personal commitment to getting some projects going. We have already had brought to our attention proposals for projects and on the face of them—to a non-expert and a politician, as I am—they look like terrific projects to treat effluent, to stop effluent going into ocean outfalls and to reuse effluent for watering parks, gardens, tennis courts and golf courses instead of sucking water out of the Murray and using potable water for those things. Those are the sorts of projects I have seen.
I am a politician who is attracted to the concept of not flushing potable water out into the ocean after it has been used to flush sewage. I am naturally attracted to that concept. I am naturally attracted to the concept of stopping sewage going into our oceans and into ocean outfalls. I am naturally attracted to projects that use water more wisely, and I am very attracted to using this $2 billion investment from the Commonwealth to do so. But what we are discussing here is an expert process. Commissioners who are experts in this field will have sensible processes to analyse which are the best projects and which are the best investments to achieve the best outcomes for Australia. That is how the support of projects will be determined. That is a sensible process. I commend the Prime Minister on his initiative.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—Last night there were 20 major programs that the Prime Minister wanted to get going. Today there are not any specified at all. Of course we are all in favour of the recycling of water. But we have to keep very much in mind that eight per cent of the water in the Murray-Darling Basin is used for residential and commercial purposes and 70 per cent is used by the irrigators, and that is what the government does not like to look at. Get all the community groups going and doing their bit, use that motivation, but do not touch those big commercial operators unless you give them taxpayer funded compensation! This is the typical `greenwash': let us show people—the schoolkids included—doing good things. It is part of a good education system to showcase up front the failure of activity down back, where it really matters. The friends of the government—the friends of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and other ministers—do not want their commercial activities assessed as infringements of the environmental laws of the Murray-Darling system and in need of urgent review. Can the minister tell the committee when the 500 gigalitres will be returned to the Murray? ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—I have already answered that question in a very deliberate and responsible way. I think Senator Brown's problem is that he will not recognise the fact that the government have, through a very successful political process with the states and the territories, very much addressed the issue of the big irrigators. He would like to ignore that. It is hard to cut through in the suburbs and towns of Australia on the importance of that process and on how hard it is to get reform, but the government have taken it on. It would have been easier for us not to have done it, but we have done it. We have gone through this process with the states and we have delivered on that. Senator Brown wants to ignore that. He wants to say that all of the work that goes on by the volunteers and in the urban areas is what he calls a `greenwash'. It annoys him because the Liberal government have been successful in making environmental issues mainstream so that people in the suburbs, people in the towns and people on the farms have taken them on and taken ownership of them.
He is upset about that because for his political support base he relies on creating this issue and on saying that he is the only one who cares about the environment. He gets the bundle of votes that get him in here based on that. It really disturbs him that a government has made these issues mainstream and has invested more than any other government in the history of Australia in solving them. It disturbs him because it cuts away at his little niche market. I can see why Senator Brown is so disturbed, but he should not misrepresent the efforts of state Labor governments and the federal coalition government—with the support, by and large, of the federal opposition and the Australian Democrats—in not only taking on the problem of overallocation to the large irrigators but also saying, `We have to have work all the way up and down the process.' We have to say to urban users of water that they can use water more wisely and encourage them to do that. We have just launched national water efficiency labelling. That is a tremendous result for a federation like Australia. But Senator Brown does not like that because it destroys his little niche market. We think it is really good for Australia.
I think the fact that the environment is a mainstream issue and Australians across the country are buying into it is absolutely fantastic for the environment. Senator Brown is so frustrated—it just annoys him—that a coalition government can do so much good for the environment and that we can actually deliver historic protection for the Great Barrier Reef, historic protection for forests and historic investments in the Murray through the Living Murray process. We now have huge levels of investment to solve our water problem and a framework developed with Labor governments, to their great credit. It would have been really easy for them to say: `We're not going to help the coalition. We're not going to sit down with John Howard and bring about this historic reform.' But to the great credit of the Australian Labor Party in government in the states, they have helped us do that. They will mark their place in history. That must be incredibly frustrating for Senator Brown. I understand the frustration, but let us deliver for the environment.
We know that delivering for the environment is not in essence his main task, even though he professes it is. If you go to the Greens' web site you see all the stuff about their social policies—how they want to make amphetamines more readily available for young people and how they want to close down industry and transport. We have seen this today. Senator Brown has said, `Diesels are no good.' You have the motor industry trying to develop cleaner fuels, better motors, more efficient transport systems and lighter-weight trucks—doing good stuff for the environment—but Senator Brown says: `Diesels are no good. Let's get rid of them.' What would that do to the price of goods around Australia? How would that impact on poor people through grocery prices? He could not care less about that. He wants to put up taxes and capital gains tax. We know what his policy agenda is. I can see why he is frustrated by governments across Australia reaching historic agreements to deliver historic environmental outcomes. He is not concerned about the environment; he is concerned about his little niche market in the political landscape. That is his true concern. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—I ask the minister: what is the date of the return of the 500 gigalitres of water to the Murray, which the scientists tell us is one-eighth of what is required to assure the health of the river? What is the date of the return of the first drop of that 500 gigalitres? The minister sits there. He cannot answer. There is no answer. There is no time line. After nine years of failure to get water back to the Murray—in fact, after nine years of presiding over a reduction of water to the Murray—this minister cannot give an answer and say when the repair process date will be set, after all we have heard in the last 10 years. It is just not good enough.
The schoolchildren, the people in the suburbs, those working in Landcare and those who participate in Clean Up Australia Day—I join them, like so many other people in this place do—have a right to know, at the juncture of an important piece of legislation like this, what the government's time line is for starting a process of return of water to a river where there are massive deaths of river red gum populations every day. This is a crisis situation but what we are getting is blancmange—a new bureaucracy set up with $2 billion, if the government can sort out the funding, to be taken from the state governments, but no goals are set. The Prime Minister wants 20 major programs but he does not know what they are. It sounds like a good figure. The serial announcements of 20 major programs, which cannot yet be defined, will go well over the summer.
But it is all a political exercise. There is a void of the hard, urgent and critical work of getting water back into the Murray and Darling system. You come up there against vested interests and the government is not and has not been prepared to tackle them, just as it was not prepared to tackle the land clearers, just as it is not prepared to tackle the coal industry and just as it is not prepared to tackle Gunns Pty Ltd destroying the forests of Tasmania, under the Prime Minister's signature, and with it the river systems where clear-fell logging is occurring.
So this is a move to set up a commission with the states represented and a general view that it is going to take stock of what is happening. With the minister's leave, the parliament might even find out what is happening. But there is precious little action in terms of the critical situation of these river systems and no time line for action. When the Greens moved for it, everybody in here except Senator Murphy said, `Oh no, we can't go with that.' Heads are in the sand. It is a failure of imagination—no, not imagination; it is a failure to face reality, because we are in an age when money speaks the loudest and values do not count or, if they do, they are very secondary. But every river red gum dying in these years and in these months—and with it the bird, marsupial, fish, insect and plant species that are being driven rapidly towards extinction by a failure of action or failure even to have a time line—is the responsibility of this government. The minister cavils at my using the word `greenwash'. He said that this is the best performed government in Australia. 
—I didn't say that, Senator Brown. You misrepresent me continually. You should try to tell the truth. A good argument uses the truth, not distortions. 
—The minister is now getting a bit out of hand. I am sorry, the minister did not say this is the best performed government. He admits to that, and that is a breakthrough.
—I said `the highest investments in the environment in Australian history'.
—He says `the highest investments in the environment in Australian history'. It is a money measure. We put money in there; therefore we are the best performers. It is law. It is tackling the people doing the wrong thing. That is required.
—That is called the EPBC, which you oppose.
—The minister says that the EPBC does that. Does it? What has it done to protect the river red gums? It has been there as they move towards regional extinction at an enormous rate. What has it done to protect the endangered species of Tasmania as the forests fall? It has aided and abetted it. In fact, it says that this minister is not responsible for what happens in forests in Tasmania; the Prime Minister handed that power away. That is what the EPBC did. What is the EPBC doing to protect the great wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes? I have asked the minister twice now to give this committee a report on the condition of this great birdlife habitat. He has failed to do so. That is a measure of his EPBC, which was meant to protect such places. But since the EPBC came in three or four years ago, the plight of the marshes has manifestly deteriorated. The plight of nationally significant species in these river systems has gone from bad to worse. There is another thing you need besides EPBCs, and that is government action—and we do not get that from this government.
If the minister thinks that he is in for an easy time in this environment by simply being able to criticise the Greens—take the wise-use dictum from the United States: when you cannot sustain a reasoned argument across this chamber, go for the individual, divert attention to them—he is not. I have been dealing with this for 30 years. He will be the latest in a long line of people. His predecessor, Senator Hill, was good at criticising environment groups, but the environmental awareness in this nation is way ahead of this government. I guess it is not trammelled by the vested interests. The average primary school class has a much greater environmental sensitivity and maturity than the cabinet of the Howard government with its power and presiding over the environmental fortune of this country.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I want to speak about the intergovernmental agreement, which outlines the institutional arrangements of the National Water Commission and the advisory role of the National Water Commission. Firstly, is it the minister's understanding that there is no provision for COAG or states and territories to directly seek advice from the National Water Commission, and that the general functions as described in the bill are curtailed by the commission providing advice only if requested to do so by the minister? Secondly, is he aware whether the intergovernmental agreement requires the National Water Commission to consider the views of stakeholders in preparing advice as required and that that is not provided for in the bill?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—My advice is that we did amend the bill in the House of Representatives, and that is now incorporated in this bill, and that is to seek to achieve that. It is referred to in clause 7(1)(ba) and it provides for the commission to also advise and make recommendations to COAG on any water matter of national significance. This makes it clear that the commission has a role in providing advice and recommendations to COAG.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—I want to make what I hope is a helpful suggestion that we deal with the revised Democrat amendment. As I understand, it is a set of words that might find consensus. I think all of the amendments we now have on the running sheet— amendments by the Greens, the Democrats, the Australian Progressive Alliance, and Senator Murphy—relate to clause 44. My understanding from informal chatter is that the Democrat amendment, as amended through negotiations, may make everyone comparatively happy.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—Our amendment (1) circulated on sheet 4485 replaces the previous amendments on the subject of public availability of assessments. It is slightly modified but responds to a number of submissions that were made to the inquiry into this bill which called for greater public availability of the reports of the National Water Commission. The bill says that the commission may make assessments under clauses 7(2) and 7(3) available to the public but only with the agreement of the minister and that no other advice or recommendations can be made available to the public. This reverses that onus and effectively indicates that the commission must make its assessments under clauses 7(2) and 7(3) available to the public unless the minister does not agree. If the minister does not agree then he or she must advise the commission of the reasons why agreement has not been given and the commission must make those reasons available to the public.
We feel it is important that this information is available. I note that there have been concerns raised about the fact that a lot of state government information and reports are often not available, particularly on water matters. This amendment would make sure that baseline assessments would be available under clause 7(2) and that the assessments and the comprehensive review would be available under 7(2)(i). Biennial water industry performance and COAG water form framework assessments would be made publicly available under these amendments.
We agree with the government that it ought not be a requirement that advice or recommendations which would fall under clause 7(1), which is largely about those internal COAG agreements, are necessarily made public. We are happy to agree with that, but we do think that the assessments in themselves will contain all of the data that will be useful to the general public. For that reason, we are happy to modify our amendments and are pleased that the government has reached some understanding of what has given rise to them and is prepared to accept them. I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 4485:
(1)	Clause 44, page 23 (lines 20 to 25), omit the clause, substitute:
44  Public availability of assessments
	(1)	The NWC must make its assessments under subsections 7(2) and (3) available to the public unless the Minister does not agree.
	(2)	The NWC must not make any other advice or recommendations available to the public without the agreement of the Minister. 
	(3)	If agreement is not given under subsection (1), the Minister must advise the NWC of the reasons why agreement has not been given. The NWC must make these reasons available to the public.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-12-08,"—The amendment that Senator Allison has just moved as a replacement for the initial amendment proposed by the Democrats is somewhat weaker. The initial amendment went to the question of the intergovernmental agreement on both the National Water Initiative and the National Water Commission. The amendment says that `the NWC will make its assessments under subsections 7(2) and (3) available to the public'. It goes on:
(2)	The Minister may direct the NWC not to make an assessment public in accordance with subsection (1).
(3)	Where the Minister makes a direction in accordance with subsection (2), the direction, together with a statement of reasons for the direction, must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament by the Minister within 15 sitting days of the direction being made.
The new amendment says:
	(1)	The NWC must make its assessments under subsections 7(2) and (3) available to the public unless the Minister does not agree.
	(2)	The NWC must not make any other advice or recommendations available to the public without the agreement of the Minister.
	(3)	If agreement is not given under subsection (1), the Minister must advise the NWC of the reasons why agreement has not been given. The NWC must make these reasons available to the public.
There are no time frames. It says that it must make the assessments under subsections 7(2) and (3) available. I understand that there was some concern about setting a time frame for the assessments to be made publicly available because of the states and/or territories receiving the advice—I would like some explanation, probably from the minister, to confirm whether my view is correct—but in clause 7(4A), which is `Giving advice and making recommendations', it says: 
The NWC is to give advice and make recommendations to COAG under this section by giving the advice and making the recommendations to the parties—
which I assume are the states and territories—
to the NWI at the same time as the advice is given, and the recommendations are made, to the Minister. 
I just want to confirm whether my understanding is correct that when all of the assessments and/or recommendations are given to the minister they are at the same time to be given to the states and territories, or to the parties to the NWI. Is my assumption correct?
—It's given to the states.
—At the same time as it is given to the Commonwealth minister it is also given to the states, or to the parties to the NWI. I do not know if there is a concern about time frames. One of the things I did in proposing my amendment was to look at a time frame for the commission to make publicly available these assessments. I think that is very important, because if there are no time frames then things may be able to be put off for an indefinite period of time. Even in paragraph (3) of the Democrat amendment, which says that if agreement is not given under subsection (1) the minister must advise the NWC of the reasons why and then the NWC must make these reasons available to the public, there are no time frames. 
In other circumstances, this relates to other government business operations, and I think that is why the initial amendment of the Democrats—which sets down a time frame, as is the case in many other instances, such as where a direction is given or, in this case, agreement is not given—is stronger than the new one. There has to be a time frame for making these things available to the public. I would still argue that there ought be a time frame in what has been proposed here because I think that is an important aspect to it.
Can I then go to the issue of the recommendations. I would like the minister to explain why the government is opposed to making publicly available the recommendations that the commission is likely to make. The explanatory memorandum states that part of the role of the commission will be to:
... promote debate; enhance communication with (and between) communities, stakeholders and decision makers; and otherwise promote national water reform through initiatives and actions to advance the objectives and outcomes of the NWI.  
Why can the public not be informed of what this commission might recommend to the Commonwealth government and the states and territories in respect of the National Water Initiative and its views about what needs to be done? I cannot understand why the public cannot be made aware of that. I would be interested to hear any reasons from the minister. In light of the fact that Senator Lees advised she will be withdrawing her amendment and that we are now debating the Democrat amendment, I suggest that Senator Lees withdraws her amendment, but I am not withdrawing my amendment at the moment.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—The simple explanation is that section 1 items, through agreement between the states and the Commonwealth, are matters that would potentially do harm to the process if they are always exposed publicly. A whole range of assessments, benchmarks and progress reports are made public. The problem with the scheme we are establishing, which this amendment supports, is that public disclosure of section 1 items could be counterproductive. Where you are legally requiring that things be made public by the commission, rather than putting a specific number of days or hours on that requirement, I am told that under the law there is a presumption that it has to be done in a timely manner.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-12-08,"—I question that, because I can recall a number of occasions where reports were supposed to be made publicly available but their publication was delayed for a significant period. I am not saying that will be the case in this instance, but it seems to me that history would suggest that, without some time frame, you could delay an assessment being made public for a considerable period—maybe a year, maybe longer. 
In regard to the question I asked about the recommendations: if the commission is making an assessment as set out in clauses 7(2) and 7(3)—for instance, whether or not a party has met its obligations under the National Water Initiative—one assumes the assessment will be critical to some extent and, as a result, the commission might make a recommendation as to what needs to be done. It seems to me that assessments are covered under 7(2) and 7(3). I accept that giving advice to the government is a separate matter and the recommendations as to what needs to be done are a separate matter, but I still cannot see why they cannot be made public. Indeed, I would think that in some instances if they were not made public it might add to the public confusion, not enhance it. Therefore, the public might find it difficult to accept and might ask: `What's going on? We have an assessment that is critical of a state or a territory in respect of not having met its obligations for some reason or other, but at the same time we don't know what the commission has recommended to the government because that can't be made publicly available.' ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—On the timing of responses, firstly, it would be hard to envisage why you would delay public disclosure and, secondly, the states will have these assessments anyway. So we cannot envisage why there would be any delay. The issues that are subject to public disclosure in the absence of a ministerial veto are all set out, as you know, in proposed sections 7(2) and 7(3) under the functions: determination of plans of the parties—as you say, that is the states—to the NWI for implementing the initiative consistent with objectives and advising COAG on the commission's determinations. They are all things which, quite properly, are part of the public disclosure. The reason there is serious concern about the first one is that ultimately and primarily this goes to advice to ministers. It is appropriate that the minister be able to get expert advice. The panel of experts is advising the government and the minister on the water fund and on other Commonwealth programs which relate to the management and regulation of Australia's water resources. The minister might say, `I want to get some expert advice on this.' Traditionally, as I understand, advice to ministers on what ostensibly are policy issues is not routinely made public. I think that is the simple explanation.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I invite the minister to clarify the issue which Senator Murphy has raised that recommendations which are part of assessments under clauses 7(2) and 7(3) be included in the first amendment—that they would be made public. In amendment (2) the advice and recommendations that are part of clause 7(1)—those matters that are general functions of the NWC; the recommendations which are part of the assessments referred to in the first amendment—would be taken to be included. So it is assessments, recommendations, advice and anything else which is in clauses 7(2) and 7(3) which would be made publicly available. If the minister can clarify that, it would be useful.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,—That is correct.,SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-12-08,"—Can the minister, or maybe Senator Allison, point me to where proposed sections 7(2) and/or 7(3) actually mention recommendations? It seems to me that recommendations covered specifically under proposed section 4 are separate. That is why in paragraph (2) of the Democrat amendment it says: 
The NWC must not make any other advice or recommendations available to the public without the agreement of the Minister.
I accept the minister's explanation with regard to advice. I think it is correct that the government should be entitled to seek advice and receive it without having to make it public. But I am concerned that the National Water Commission would make a series of assessments and, as a result, make recommendations for solutions, or whatever the case may be, that are not in the form of advice. To use Senator Brown's earlier argument, the commission could recommend that we have to return 10,000 gigalitres of water to the Murray by 2010. The public ought to be made aware of such recommendations which are given to the parties to the agreement at the same time—the states and territories. 
I still maintain that there ought to be a time frame. The minister says—and I accept it—that where there is an obligation to make something public it should be done in a timely manner, but what is wrong with putting into a public disclosure provision a time frame of six or 12 months? What is the objection to doing that? That is what I do not understand. I find it difficult to see how you can say it must be done in a timely manner without defining a timely manner. There have been many instances with other reports which one assumed would have been made public in a timely manner but which have not. If the minister can give me some idea of what a timely manner is, I might be happy; otherwise, I would like to pursue putting a time frame on these things being made publicly available. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I will let the minister answer the timely advice question, but I draw Senator Murphy's attention to clause 7(2)(h)(iii), which says that one of the functions of this body is:
... to advise and make recommendations to COAG on actions that the parties might take to better achieve those objectives and outcomes ...
So there is at least one reference to recommendations under clauses 7(2) and (3).",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-08,"—My advice is that the common-law interpretation is that it has to be provided in a timely manner. I think it would depend on the circumstances whether that was a month, six weeks, six months or a year. The legal advice which we took in relation to this issue was that, where there is a statutory requirement for disclosure, there is a common-law understanding of what a timely manner means. 
I think Senator Murphy would have shared my experience in this place that quite often when we do put time limits on things, particularly if there is no penalty for noncompliance, it tends to be public and political pressure that comes to bear on an organisation that fails to lodge or disclose something on time. Unless you can build in a penalty for nondisclosure within a certain statutory time frame, they are more often ignored than observed. It is the public pressure that gets brought onto the organisation. It is fair to say that people like Mr Matthews and the sorts of experts we are putting on the panel would be very keen to comply with the statutory obligation, which we are going to place on them when this legislation passes, to make that disclosure.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-08,"—I want to raise a different matter, but it comes under assessments, although we do not have an amendment that relates to it. The matter came up in the WA submission to the inquiry. The question asked why the bill does not provide for the Water Commission to make recommendations to the Commonwealth on competition payments as part of its assessments, in contrast to the national competition policy. The submission says:
This raises a question of who will then decide, from the assessments, the implication for competition payments in 2005/06. 
I know this is a contentious issue—it is probably the root of the disagreement between the states and something that has held up progress on this issue—but it would be useful if the states could raise it and have a process in which to do so.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1

I might be happy were Democrat amendment (1) to say that the commission `must make its assessments under subsections 7(2) and (3) available to the public'.

... to advise and make recommendations to COAG on actions that the parties might take to better achieve those objectives and outcomes ...

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-08,"—I move the Greens' amendment:
(2)	Clause 44, page 23 (lines 20 to 25), omit the clause, substitute:
44  Public availability of assessments
	(1)	The Minister must table the NWC assessments, advice and determinations under paragraphs 7(2)(a), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) and (3)(a), (b) and (c) in both Houses of Parliament when they are provided to the Minister.
	(2)	The NWC must operate transparently and make its advice and recommendations public except where directed by the Minister, provided the direction is public.
	(3)	Where the Minister makes a direction in accordance with subsection (2), the direction, together with a statement of reasons for the direction, must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of being made. 
We take the view that this is a $2 billion commission established with taxpayers' money to deal with the public good—which is the water of the nation and its rivers—and that the deliberations of this commission are on behalf of the Australian people and not the government of the day. We believe that the outcomes of this National Water Commission should be on the public record. I note that the minister said that it may be that policy advice will be sought from the NWC by the government. This bill says that this will be an independent public body. This is a commission for the people of Australia. This is not a $2 billion commission set up to give the government policy advice or to be used selectively by the government against the rest of the body politic or the people of Australia. Let us make that clear.
The Greens do not go along with the view that, because other governments are involved or because policy is being sought by the Howard government, this National Water Commission, entirely funded by the people of Australia, should be secret. It is a public independent organisation, and where it produces documents that go to the minister the minister should be obliged to table them in this parliament, the parliament of the people. Otherwise we succumb to saying that the executive is above the people and the parliament, that the parliament and the people are second, and that we will get to know what the commission is doing by leave of the government of the day. We do not accept that, so this Greens' amendment is an important one.

Our worry, of course, is that the current position allows for the Australian water fund to be used in the same way that so many of the other programs have been used recently by the government—that is, abused. We certainly do not want to see the Australian water fund go the same way.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-12-08,"—Australia is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, especially the state of Western Australia, which has been aptly described as Australia's resources powerhouse. Whilst our natural resources make a significant contribution to our national prosperity, stimulating economic growth, generating extensive exports and creating employment in regional areas, it is prudent for Australians to understand that, although the contribution the resource sector makes to the Australian economy is huge, our mineral and energy resources are finite. At a recent energy council dinner in Perth, Sir Charles Court, the former Premier of Western Australia, said, `The reality that our reserves are finite should be borne in mind in planning the future exploitation of our mineral and energy resources.' 
The extent of the contribution that natural resources make to our national prosperity is indicated by the fact that in 2003 resource exports had a value of $42.7 billion, out of a total of exports for Australia of $141 billion. Our mineral resources sector represents around a third of our exports. Western Australia has some 480 commercial mining projects, more than 770 operating mines and 143 plants, producing some 50 different minerals. Production in Western Australia exceeded more than $26 billion last year, representing approximately 40 per cent of Australia's total resource production. The value of resource production in Western Australia has doubled over the past decade. In fact, Western Australia has become a major energy producer of both natural gas and oil, with 55 oil and gas fields in production, and about 80 per cent of Australia's gas reserves. 
In recent times China's voracious appetite for natural resources to fuel its economic growth has resulted in increased exports and higher prices for Western Australia's resources, particularly iron ore and to some extent gas. The Chinese expansion has stimulated a significant expansion of the iron ore industry, with new mines and the growth of existing mines as well as the extension of port and processing facilities in towns such as Port Hedland and the port of Dampier. In 2003 mining investment in Western Australia increased by 54 per cent, totalling some $4.9 billion, which represents almost 50 per cent of total mining investment across Australia. Western Australia's resource sector directly employs some 45,000 people and indirectly employs another 136,000 people, which represents 19 per cent of Western Australia's labour force. 
As I said at the beginning, it needs to be remembered that our natural resources are finite. While we have a duty to maximise the value of our resources, particularly in the energy sector, it is important also that we bear in mind our future needs and interests. Western Australia's abundant reserves of natural gas present a unique opportunity to facilitate downstream processing of our resources by harnessing natural gas as an energy source or feedstock.
It was the discovery and extraction of natural gas on the North West Shelf, hence the securing of a competitively priced and reliable locally available source of energy, which led to the development of the first secondary downstream processing or value-adding plants in the Pilbara in recent years. Other factors involved have been the improved industrial relations, which flowed from the accords of the 1980s, and the improved technology, which has substantially reduced the manpower required to run large plants. Those three factors together—the availability of cheap energy, the improved industrial relations and the reduction in the size of the work force needed due to improved technology, particularly the development of computerisation—has meant that at last the concept of secondary downstream processing of mineral resources in the Pilbara can start to become a reality.
Sir Charles Court said in relation to the development of the Pilbara industries that in his day his government's objective was always adding value to raw materials before exports. But at that time, in the 1960s and 1970s, companies were dependent on imported oil as an energy source. The oil shock of the early 1970s effectively put paid to any ideas of successful downstream processing projects. Both Hamersley Iron and Robe River were forced to close down their iron ore pelleting plants in the Pilbara when they became uneconomic due to the high price of oil caused by that first oil shock in the 1970s. Sir Charles made the point, in a speech he made to the Energy Council of Western Australia, that had the North West Shelf gas been available at the start of the resources boom in Western Australia: 
... we would be looking at a different pattern of development in Western Australia than we have today.
We might, for instance, be today producing aluminium from our bauxite reserves in the north and steel from our iron ore. As Sir Charles went on to say: 
The ultimate, of course, is to use the locally produced steel, aluminium and other metals for the making of commercial products in Australia for export—
so reducing our dependence on imports of manufactured goods. Whilst the exporting of raw materials has unambiguously enhanced our national prosperity, it is value adding which presents an opportunity for Australia to garner even greater benefits. There is no doubt that secondary downstream processing, or value adding, has the potential to stimulate a great deal of further economic growth, drawing billions of dollars in investments to regional areas and creating more employment opportunities than the simple extraction and export of raw materials, which is more characteristic of a Third World country than a First World country such as Australia. 
However, while value adding, or secondary downstream processing, is what we would like to see happen, it is proving to be a somewhat illusive goal to achieve. Despite expectations of the Burrup Peninsula, in the north-west of Western Australia, becoming a major site for petrochemical industries, Western Australia has had only mixed success in attracting downstream processing opportunities, with a range of proposed projects no longer going ahead. In 2002, Syntroleum scrapped plans for a $1 billion gas-to-liquids project and in 2003 Methanex announced that it would not proceed with its proposed $800 million methanol plant on the Burrup. Likewise, the recent announcement of the mothballing of the hot briquetted iron, or HBI, plant at Port Hedland is another blow, although the plant could, it seems, be used to produce hydrogen as the basis for other chemical products if HBI production is not restored. Despite these setbacks, things are looking up for secondary processing prospects in the Pilbara, with the potential for $3.3 billion in downstream processing investments on the Burrup Peninsula, with other petrochemical plants.
The one project that is locked in is Burrup Fertilisers' $630 million liquid ammonia plant. Construction of the plant commenced in April 2003 and it is expected to commence operations in the latter half of 2005. The plant will use natural gas to produce up to 760,000 tonnes of ammonia annually and, according to Burrup Fertilisers, it will be `one of the world's largest ammonia production facilities'. The company will ship the ammonia to India to produce fertiliser. The project will create more than 600 jobs during its construction and around 60 jobs when operational.
Some other projects are currently under consideration in the Pilbara. Japan DME, a joint venture involving several Japanese corporations, is considering the construction of a $1 billion dimethyl-ether, or DME, plant on the Burrup Peninsula. If it goes ahead, the plant will use natural gas to produce methanol, which will be converted into DME. DME is primarily used as a commercial refrigerant, a propellant in aerosols, a solvent and a fuel in welding. However, in the near future DME is likely to be used as a fuel in power generation as an alternative to liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and as a transport fuel.
The second prospect in the Dampier Burrup area involves Dampier Nitrogen, which is considering the construction of a $900 million ammonia and urea plant, which would employ up to 1,000 people during the construction phase and 130 when operational. The third prospect for the Burrup area involves GTL Resources—GTL stands for `gas to liquid'. This company is considering the construction of a one million tonne per annum methanol plant on the Burrup, at a cost of $770 million. Unfortunately, this plant is now somewhat uncertain and there is no security that the GTL project will go ahead. Sadly, that is the story of many of the projects in the Pilbara. These great projects are announced, but there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, as the saying goes, and very few of them have come to fruition. 
Australia has many advantages as an investment destination. These include an abundant and ready supply of raw materials; access to a competitively priced, abundant, secure energy source in the form of natural gas; a strong and dynamic economy; a secure environment with a stable democratic government, a well established, reliable and transparent legal system, and an educated and productive work force.  
However, it has to be understood by all that we do live in a competitive world, where other countries are anxious to attract industry and are often willing to offer inducements, such as tax concessions and simplified approval processes, which are important to investors and which may outweigh Australia's competitive advantages. So there is no room for complacency on Australia's part in attracting investment. Accordingly, Australia needs to remove unnecessary impediments to investment. At the federal government level, Invest Australia has a major project facilitation program which provides a single point of contact to streamline approvals processes. It offers information, advice and support to prospective investors. This one-stop shop approach is very important, and it is used by many of our Asian competitors.
In summary, while the simple extraction and export of raw materials is the easy option, it is by value adding that we can maximise returns, create greater employment and promote regional development. As Sir Charles Court said, `It is time for Australia to think strategically about our future interests in terms of the preservation of our mineral and energy reserves.'",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Resources: Natural Resource Management</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-12-08,"—Yesterday I undertook to get back to Senator Greig with some information on a question he asked about Centrelink and the Job Network. Minister Hockey has provided me with a response to the question he asked yesterday. I am advised that there has been an increased focus on referrals by Centrelink of the job seekers to whom he was referring, in line with government directions. It is a natural consequence that there will be an increased focus on offering a range of services to all customers who are able to participate in the work force. Centrelink is, therefore, working closely with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Job Network to increase participation opportunities. Centrelink staff have been and remain committed to offering disability support pension and parenting payment customers the opportunity of a voluntary referral to a Job Network member for assistance. Centrelink offers the benefits of the Job Network to these customers and interviews with Centrelink specialist officers. Participation is completely voluntary for parenting payment and DSP customers.
Customers with a disability are advised of all forms of employment assistance. This includes specialised disability employment services. Suitability is determined through the job seeker classification instrument, otherwise known as the JSCI. Based on customer information revealed through the JSCI, they may be referred to a Centrelink disability officer, a psychologist or a social worker for a secondary assessment. These customers may choose to attend a specialist disability employment service if they are eligible to do so. Customers who receive a disability support pension may choose to end their participation with a Job Network provider and change to a specialist disability employment provider due to the voluntary nature of their participation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Centrelink: Job Network</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by senators today relating to the family tax benefit.
It was clear from the response of the minister that she has no idea about key issues in her portfolio. She was unable to answer a couple of very key questions. One of them was about the extent of the debt problem, which I would have thought, whatever one's views about the payment system, was an important issue for thousands and thousands of Australian families. She was asked about the change in the recording of that and had no idea about that. Then she was asked about the question of compensation for families who have been advised to overestimate their income and as a result lost other Commonwealth benefits such as access to health care cards. She had no answer to that. She actually sought to dispute what the Commonwealth Ombudsman said in his October 2004 report. I do not think she has read that. She referred in her answer to one of his earlier reports. Clearly she is not on top of her game.
What this reflects is a much wider problem: that the government has failed to come to terms with the family debt mess it has created. The minister, when she took over the portfolio, said in October 2003 that she was committed to fixing the problem. We now notice that, under the new ministerial responsibilities, that job has been taken off her. In fact most of the job has been taken off her. It is a bit hard to come to terms with what the minister is now responsible for because Senator Minchin, in addition to having to run half of Senator Hill's portfolio, now also has responsibilities in Senator Patterson's old portfolio area. He is the fix-it man for those who cannot manage the finances. Minister Hockey has now also been given the job of trying to manage the family debt crisis because Senator Patterson ain't up to it. She has failed so far, and the government has decided to try somebody else.
The clear issue that Senator Patterson failed to respond to today is the minister's response to fixing the debt problem by fiddling the figures. What we have is a change in the way the debts are represented. Instead of continuing to provide the information on the number of families who have fallen into debt, the big fix has been put in and they have changed the way they reflect the figures. Now when we ask how many families have family debts caused by overestimation of income, the figure is manipulated so that those who are considered to not have a net debt are excluded—that is, those families who have a debt less than $600, $1,200 or whatever their payment is. If the net result is not a debt they are not counted. Of course, those families do have a debt and it is taken off them; it is just taken out of those other payments. But the minister seemed not to have a grasp of that. I urge her to come back into the parliament and provide the proper information. It was a reasonable question of her portfolio. She did not seem to grasp the question, but the question remains. We want a true picture of the extent of the family debt problem. She owes it to the parliament and to the Australian public to make it clear. 
The other issue that really troubled me was that, as I said, the minister seemed to have not read the Ombudsman's report. The Ombudsman found very clearly that there is a problem with the Commonwealth providing advice to families to overestimate their income, because a consequence of overestimating their income was that some people did not qualify through the year for low-income health care cards. The Ombudsman was concerned about that and he raised that concern. As at today the minister seemed to have not read the report, and then she denied the fact that he had found the problem. I refer the minister to the Ombudsman's 2004 report. I urge her to read it and I urge her to come to grips with the problem. One of the things he pointed out is that one family has been paid compensation. Centrelink had provided advice that was detrimental to them because they had encouraged them to overestimate their income and they then lost other benefits such as access to health care cards, electricity account reductions et cetera.
Compensation was paid to that family because of the advice provided by the minister's department. When I asked her about compensation for other families she said, `It's not an issue, not a problem. I don't know anything about it.' It is an issue. Thousands of Australian families have been denied benefits that they would otherwise have been entitled to because they acted on advice from Centrelink. What compensation has been paid to them? What steps have been taken to ensure that they receive their full entitlements? The minister does not know, does not care and is not interested. The Ombudsman is interested, those families are interested and this parliament is interested, and we will be pursuing these issues. The minister has to do better than she did today. She will have to front up and answer why those families have not received compensation, why they have not been treated fairly and why what she told the parliament today was totally misleading.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-12-08,"—There is no doubt about Senator Chris Evans, is there? Other than screeching abuse across the chamber all through question time, he gets up after question time and verbalises the minister.
—Verbalises?
—Verbals the minister, I should say. Senator Evans should know the saying well because he consistently verbals everybody and anybody. His contribution just now was the worst example of verballing someone after a question time held only in the last hour. 
The interesting thing is that, when the Labor Party talk about family tax benefits, payments to families and those sorts of things, their memory is short. During the election campaign the failed former member for Stirling went on ABC radio and admitted that the tax policy of the Labor Party had to be changed. Guess what? The failed former member for Stirling was shut up. She was not allowed to do any media interviews; she was not allowed to do anything from that moment on. Why? Because she told the truth. Why? Because a caller rang that radio station and said, `We are a family with three and a three-quarter children'—in fact the family was only four days off having four children—`and we went onto the Labor Party web site to have a look at your tax policy. We're going to be worse off by about $800 or more a year.' What did the failed former member for Stirling say, `Gosh, we're going to have to fix that, aren't we?' That was an admission that the policy was wrong. But what happened? The temporary Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Latham, said, `Don't worry about that, that's okay, because all families will be better off every week.' They would just be worse off every year! 
—That doesn't add up, does it?
—That is a very good point, Senator Barnett. How on earth can families, or anyone for that matter, be better off on a weekly basis but at the end of 12 months when the clock suddenly ticks over be $800 or more worse off? Yet the Labor Party has the gall to come in here and talk about overpayments or the minister's alleged incompetence when it is this minister and the ministers before her who have made sure that families are better off under this government. About 1.6 million families with around 2.8 million children have seen the benefit of the $600 child supplement. The Labor Party during the campaign, apart from having a tax policy that is better off on a weekly basis but worse off on an annual basis, also alleged that that $600 a week payment was not real. How can you have a policy where people are actually getting money in their hands and have the Labor Party say that it is `not real'? And it was not just that magnificent dreamer Mr Swan; I think Ms Plibersek and a few of the others also said that it was not real.
This is the party that is grizzling today about people receiving extra money, about 1.6 million families receiving extra money, that would have cut money. After eight years in opposition this is the party that would have cut money to families. The Labor Party would have cut financial assistance to over a million people on low incomes. Yet, they have absolutely no shame. They would have scrapped the FTB part B. They have no shame. They come in here and criticise the benefits that this government is paying. They would have continued cutting assistance to families. I want to make sure that the Australian people know that Australian families are receiving record financial support from the Howard government that would have been cut had the Labor Party been elected. Now let us see what they come up with. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Patterson to a question asked by Senator Denman today. In the real world, people's circumstances change. In the real world, people's employment situation changes. The problem here is that we have a system that does not accommodate real changes for real people on an ongoing basis. We have a minister who, instead of trying to fix a system to accommodate the real world and real people, wants to blame the people who are caught out by the system. The minister is accusing people who overestimate their income, through no fault of their own, of being repeat offenders and, by implication, says that they are doing something wrong and they are guilty of some offence.  
That is an outrageous slur on hardworking people who are simply trying to do the best they can to estimate their income in the real world where circumstances change. I know it is hard to do that. Strangely enough, I am not the only person who thinks it is hard. Minister Patterson herself thinks it is hard to estimate income. In my question to the minister today I referred to an article in the Age of Wednesday, 17 November. In that article Senator Patterson admitted there would always be some families who incurred overpayments under the government's family tax benefits system because it was hard to accurately estimate earnings. Those were the minister's own words. Yet, earlier in the same article, this statement appeared:
Family & Community Services Minister Kay Patterson said yesterday she was considering “uplifting” repeat offenders' estimated incomes based on their previous years' earnings to lessen the likelihood of overpayments. 
The minister is trying to have it both ways: admitting that it is hard for them to estimate their income in advance over that period because it is hard in the real world to make those estimates. Yet, when the estimates are made, they are `repeat offenders'. The minister is going to intervene with her proposal to automatically uplift their income, so it will be overestimated, so those people cannot have their FBT element reduced. This minister is not in control of the system. Minister Patterson said she would fix the family debt crisis when she first became Minister for Family and Community Services in September 2003. All she has done is apply bandaid after bandaid, but the bandaids have not fixed and will not fix the problem. They are merely creating more problems.
Having Centrelink tell people to overestimate their incomes, so as to avoid the possibility of getting into debt at the end of the year, is creating enormous problems. The opposition referred in its question today to the 2004 Ombudsman's report, which indicated clearly that people are missing out on concession benefits they are entitled to, including stamp duty exemptions, electricity account reductions, motor vehicle registration exemptions, reduced health and pharmaceutical costs and reduced red tape costs associated with buying homes. We know from that report that some people have already been compensated for the wrong advice given to them by Centrelink. But the minister was unable to address that issue in her answer to the question. 
Minister Patterson was asked specifically by Senator Evans: `Is it true that the minister has directed her department not to officially record an FTB debt where the per child supplement is greater than the amount of FTB debt? She answered with some waffle: `Everyone knows that families are better off under this government than they would have been under Labor.' She had no idea how to address the very specific question asked of her because she is not in touch with what is going on in her portfolio. She is not in control of this situation, which is getting out of control. Now we see the minister is cooking the books to try to avoid the number of people listed as having debt to Centrelink. She has deliberately excluded from the figures some families which incurred a family tax benefit debt, thereby making the crisis seem less than it really is. This is a deceptive and misleading situation that the minister is engaged in. The minister has shown by her inability to answer questions today that she does not understand the system. She is completely incapable of fixing the very problem she recognised and said she would fix when she took over as minister in 2003. She has not fixed it, she cannot fix it, she does not know how to fix it and she is not aware of the problems in her own ministry. It is probably time that Joe Hockey was parachuted in to fix this problem and take the problem out of her ministry.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2004-12-08,"—It is an absolute pleasure to stand here today in response to this motion to take note that has been moved by Labor and to talk about families. That is what this debate is about. We have been debating the merit of choices. The Australian people made a choice on 9 October. They had a clear choice between the coalition and the Labor Party. One of the reasons that people overwhelmingly supported the Howard government was the Howard government's support for families. That is why Labor are still in opposition. Senator Marshall talked about people missing out. He made certain allegations regarding Minister Patterson. He said that people were missing out in many respects. Let's just remind Senator Marshall and the Labor Party of their own policy in terms of people who were missing out. Labor's policy made it very clear that over one million people in low-income families would miss out; their financial assistance would be cut. 
Senator Marshall, who has just left the chamber, is not willing to listen and accept the views that have just been put. These views are sound, they are real and they are factual. Under Labor's policy, over one million low-income families would miss out on this financial assistance. Labor member Tanya Plibersek said that Labor's policy was a `fantastic' policy. Wayne Swan called it `a real winner'. But they got caught out. Labor's policy was to scrap the family tax benefit part B. That would reduce the choices for families and scrap the $600 per child payment, which they said `was not real'. That is what Wayne Swan was saying. Somehow or other they came up with this policy. They tried to con low-income families by telling them they would be better off weekly, when they would be worse off annually. How does that add up? How does that make sense? The Australian people could see through the veneer, through this ploy that was put to them by the Labor Party. The Labor Party were caught out—hoist on their own petard. The former federal member for Stirling—as Senator Sue Knowles has made clear on radio in Western Australia—was caught out. 
I debated this matter with Senator Nick Sherry in Tasmania, at an independent retirees' meeting. It was made very clear to Senator Sherry at that meeting that single mothers on a low income would also miss out. It was also made clear during the election campaign, and the Australian people decided what was best for them. They decided that our policy was best because it benefits 1.6 million families with around 2.8 million children. Those families have seen the benefit of the $600 per child supplement. 
I walked through Waverley, Rocherlea and Mowbray, doorknocking with Michael Ferguson, the new member for Bass. We asked people: `What do you think of this $600? Is it real, or is it not?' They said: `Of course it is real. We have got the money in the bank. We will be spending it on household items. We will be spending it on tables, chairs and beds, and on fixing the car.' The money was being spent on a whole range of items to help these low-income families. They were thrilled and they were very thankful. This is something that the former member for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne, was not prepared to disclose. The biggest swings—in Bass, at least—were in those former `Labor heartland' areas. Michael Ferguson got a swing up of up to 10 per cent in some of those suburbs. That is primarily because of our good policy across the board, including our policy to support families— (Time expired) ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I also wish to take note of the answers given by Senator Patterson in question time today in relation to Centrelink compensation. I had great hopes that the minister would do what she said she would do when she took over this portfolio of family and community services in 2003, and fix the problem which is creating so much grief and heartache for families all over Australia. I have great difficulty in supporting a system which with one hand purports to give but which takes away with the other. Like the rebate culture, which applies with so many other programs of this government, the principal solution offered to Australian families is to overstate their income so that they do not end up with a debt at the end of the year.  
It seems to me that this government develops its philosophies for Australian families, and particularly for those in need, based on the circumstances of those who are much better off. Whether it is the Medicare safety net, child-care benefits or many other benefits, this government adopts the same approach—completely without consideration of the circumstances of those who need the support most. 
The minister seems happy to provide the bandaid advice of overestimating income to avoid an unwanted debt later. There are two fundamental flaws with this approach. First of all, it defeats the very purpose of the family payment for those in real need, which is to provide them with the financial support when they need it—to put food on the table, to clothe and to provide health care and recreation for their children. For those families who have a cash flow it is not such a problem, but for those who need every cent they receive to pay for their daily outlays, the solution suggested by the minister offers no comfort at all. Secondly, it has a disastrous flow-on effect on other costs and benefits. As I am sure the minister is aware, child-care costs are assessed based on the estimated income levels currently registered with Centrelink by the client. If a client overestimates their income to avoid a family debt later, she or he will receive a smaller reduction in their child-care bill. In other words, the client gets less in family tax benefit whilst at the same incurring a higher cost for child care. 
I have a constituent in exactly this situation. She is able to estimate her own income fairly accurately as she is on a set wage, but her partner works as a casual and they find it difficult to estimate his income from week to week with any certainty. They do not want a debt at the end of the year, so they overestimate their income to Centrelink and, as a result, suffer increased child-care costs on a weekly basis. It is hard enough for them—a family where one partner is earning a fixed and guaranteed income—but it is even harder for those who have no consistency at all in their regular income. But all this government is prepared to offer as a solution is to resort, once again, to the same old rebate culture that pervades so many of its programs. 
It is not only child-care payments which are affected. For many families the effect of overestimating their income to Centrelink to avoid an unwanted debt at the end of the year will be to lose other entitlements, such as low-income health care cards and the consequent benefits and concessions that flow from having such cards. As with the so-called Medicare safety net and the government's proposed expansion of child-care support, the mentality is all based on a rebate culture—a culture designed for families who can actually receive a rebate. 
I want to address an issue that Senator Guy Barnett referred to, and that is the way the $600 was spent. I know from experience that many families did not spend that $600 wisely. They chose to spend it the way they wanted to—and that is their right. A number of families got into debt by gambling the $600 and so the children did not benefit. Some of them did spend the money wisely but, in my experience, a number did not. They incurred debts, and so created difficulties for their children— (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-12-08,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004, which the Senate is now considering, will finally bring to a conclusion a very trying ordeal that the Liberal government has forced on some of Australia's most vulnerable and needy persons—the elderly. This ordeal has been caused by one thing, and one thing only: the harsh, brutal, at times arrogant and uncompassionate attitude of this Liberal government to elderly Australians in seeking to impose the GST on basic living services. Here we are, four years after the introduction of the GST, still dealing with its consequences.
I will briefly outline the history of this debacle, because I think it is important that those elderly Australians who are listening receive an appreciation and an outline of the absolute travesty and the very poor way the Liberal government has handled this issue. I say Liberal government as I do not call it a Liberal-National Party government, because the Nationals just follow the Liberal Party in everything they do—they are the doormats—so when I refer to the Liberal government you will know what I mean.
Let us go back to the introduction of the GST. At that time there was great concern in the community about how it would affect the residents of retirement villages, so the Liberal government promised to exempt all those in nursing homes and retirement villages from the GST. This was given effect in a determination by the former aged care minister in 2000, Mrs Bishop, the member for Mackellar. In that determination she stated the list of services that would be GST free and specified that to be eligible for the GST-free supply the resident of a retirement village must need and be in receipt of certain services. Frankly, the determination would make an episode of Yes, Minister or Yes, Prime Minister with Sir Humphrey Appleby bureaucratic-speak look good. This was the government's first failure. It failed to make the original determination clear. The sector was left in a state of confusion as to how the actual law would be applied and what it meant. So, over the intervening period—and this went on for four years—some retirement villages collected the GST and some did not. It was an absolutely absurd situation to allow this uncertainty about GST collections to run for four years.
The Australian Taxation Office began a review of the taxation treatment of retirement villages in February 2003. As part of this review process, the ATO came to the view that those living in serviced apartments in retirement villages were effectively living in their own homes. As services provided to persons in their own homes are generally not GST free, this would imply that the GST-free treatment of these services would cease, and this was made clear to the sector in the ATO's consultation process. So we had the former minister, Mrs Bishop, assuring people about the introduction of the GST. I notice Senator Murray is in the chamber, representing the party in part responsible for delivering the GST and in part responsible for creating this mess by not being thorough enough to make sure this issue was cleared up at the time in those now infamous negotiations that they engaged in. That is my flick of the day to the Democrats. I just want to remind you of your part in this debacle, Senator Murray. So we had the former minister, Mrs Bishop, saying, `Oh, no, they won't be hit by the GST.' Then we had the ATO and their officers—and I am not being critical of the ATO, who were only doing their job and who have to apply the law, which was apparently not well written by this parliament—going around in the consultation process making it clear that the GST would apply. The ATO prepared a draft ruling but did not release it. 
So what happened next was an absolute farce in public policy terms, and here the blame shifts squarely to the feet of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. When they heard of the ATO's hardline position, many in the aged care sector were, quite rightly, very worried indeed and they began to panic. They feared that they would be charged significant back taxes and penalties. So retirement village operators started to increase levies imposed on these aged persons—and we are not generally talking about the most affluent of retirees in society—to provide for back payment of the GST. Some operators seriously questioned their financial viability. They were in an uncertain position. If they did not try to recover the back GST and then had to pay it in one lump sum that would obviously significantly affect their cash flows in the year that they had to pay the back GST. That potentially could have sent some retirement villages broke. Others held out in the hope that the tax might never be levied. That is a very unsatisfactory situation.
On 10 August this year the Labor shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, the member for Hotham, asked the Treasurer, Mr Costello, a question without notice. He asked:
Is the Treasurer aware of reports that Mr Charles MacDonald of the Retirement Villages Association has stated that, as a result of uncertainty arising from the Australian tax office's deliberations on a draft ruling on this matter, some retirement villages are already being advised to start making provision for this GST impost? Is the Treasurer aware that, in December 2003 and June 2004, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer wrote to the member for Petrie confirming that the Australian tax office was preparing a draft ruling on this matter which contravened government policy and implied support for this change?
The response by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was quite extraordinary. He stated in Hansard:
Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is the legislation and that is the policy which the government announced. 
It was not, but that was what Mr Costello claimed at the time. It was a very arrogant and inconsiderate claim and declaration. All of a sudden the Treasurer, Mr Costello, had created a new tax, a new GST application, where it was not supposed to have applied. This was in direct contradiction of yet another core election promise. Mr Costello indicated that persons in serviced apartments in a retirement village were to be charged GST on their basic living services. Effectively by this announcement he extended the GST into aged care. The Treasurer did not even wait for the draft ATO ruling. 
Thanks to the inquiry by our former shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, the issue had finally been brought to light in public and had to be dealt with. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, realised he had a significant problem. When Mr Crean pressed the Prime Minister on the same issue the next day, Mr Costello denied in the House that he had said that residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages were GST free. On reflection I think that he misled the House—and the Hansard proves it. It was not a great comfort that this debacle was rolling on for the residents in retirement villages who were affected. They were still left with doubt and uncertainty. 
So what happened? Later that night, after Mr Crean had asked the Prime Minister about the issue—I am not sure what time it was but it was certainly done in the dark of night to avoid press scrutiny—we had a backflip. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, put out a press release indicating that these basic living and accommodation services would be GST free and that the Liberal government would legislate to ensure it. It is very clear what happened. On one day the Treasurer effectively made an announcement that the GST would apply. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was asked about it the next day and he contradicted the Treasurer. Then the Prime Minister obviously called in the Treasurer and said, `The GST doesn't apply. You'd better get it right; you'd better back down.' 
The Treasurer is too arrogant to back down on anything. He is too arrogant to put out his own press release acknowledging that he got it wrong so he rang up Minister Brough to get him to put the press release out late at night so that it would not get any press coverage. So we finally got the right outcome but it was four years too late. Since the year 2000, many residents in these facilities have had to suffer uncertainty or pay an unnecessary tax. This government owes an apology to those residents and to the operators of the aged residential care homes who were left in this position. Four years is a long time to allow something as fundamental as the application of GST to some retired Australians to remain in doubt. It is a very long time. 
The explanatory memorandum to this bill indicates that the cost of this backflip is some $63 million over the forward estimates, and $47 million in the first year. This is money that the Liberal government ought not to have received. This amounts to 63 million reasons why the Treasurer, Mr Costello, should apologise to the residents of aged care facilities and the operators of these homes. Will he? I am sure he will not. Even then, when we analysed this bill, we found that the government still had not got it quite right. 
I point out, as I pointed out earlier, Labor have led the way on this issue in exposing the gross incompetence of the government in their mishandling of the issue and the insensitivity in the application of the GST to certain residents in aged care facilities. Labor have consulted with the sector to ensure they are happy with the bill that we are considering. There are still some issues which need to be resolved. In particular, my colleague Senator Jan McLucas, who is the Labor Party's shadow minister and spokesperson on aged care issues, will be outlining in detail those particular aspects in her contribution and in the committee stage.
In closing my contribution in this place on this piece of legislation, yes, this is technically a tax bill. It is certainly dealing with the application of the GST to certain residents of aged care facilities. But we should look beyond the travesty of justice, the incompetence of the government and the arrogance of the Treasurer on this important issue to those who have been affected by these four years of uncertainty: the residents of the aged care facilities. You could not pick a better example of the application of a new tax creating uncertainty for retired Australians. When Australians retire I think they do want a degree of certainty. Certainly when they move into aged care facilities they do want to know what price they have to pay. It is a massive indictment of this government that four years on we are finally fixing up this tax problem. 
Senator Murray might remember that two years ago tomorrow we were in this chamber at about six o'clock in the morning correcting the GST application to the Royal Life Saving Society Australia. It is certainly written in my memory. It is not often we are here until six o'clock in the morning. We were dealing with fixing up the GST as it applied to the Royal Life Saving Society Australia, and at last count I think that was the 1,200th amendment to the GST. We were dealing with that one two years after the introduction of the GST, at six o'clock in the morning, prior to breaking for Christmas. So much for this simple tax! Here we are, another two years on, still trying to fix it up.
The Labor Party will be supporting this legislation. There are a couple of amendments that will be dealt with in committee. We have consulted with organisations from the charitable sector, including Catholic Health Australia, and they are very keen that this bill pass before the parliament adjourns for the summer break so that the uncertainty that the aged care residents, the aged care sector and the operators have had to endure as a result of the incompetence of the government in the application of the GST in this sector—this sad chapter—will hopefully be brought to a close.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT VILLAGES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-08,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 ensures that supplies of certain services to residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages are GST free where the resident requires daily living activities assistance or nursing services. It was always the intention of the Democrats—and, as we understood at the time, of the government—that health care services be provided GST free. We always regarded health care services in the broad sense, not in the narrow sense. It is frustrating that nearly five years on the government is only now legislating to confirm this principle. On the one hand it is concerning that the explanatory memorandum indicates that there are $47 million in refunds that will need to be paid retrospectively to residents of retirement villages that have been incorrectly paying GST—that is a large sum of money. Of course on the other hand the government gets a big tick for retrospectively compensating people, because it is important that where the law has changed in this manner individuals and organisations are not prejudiced. We do urge the Australian Taxation Office to provide these funds as soon as practicable and possible.
The Australian Democrats are supporting the bill, but we do note the concerns of the retirement village industry that an aged care assessment team will be responsible for assessing the level of care that a resident of a retirement village requires. We understand the concern that ACAT may set a level of care criteria that would make the provision of care services in serviced apartments too onerous. It does not automatically mean that they will; they might not. We support the position of the industry and of the Labor Party that a registered nurse or doctor should be able to make this determination. More particularly, we support the broad intentions of the Labor Party amendments, which have been circulated on sheet 4442 revised. Amendment (1) says:
The Aged Care Minister must set by determination the way in which the levels of care services required by residents are to be assessed.
We think there is some sense to that, because in this area it is often a very anxious time for people. Knowing how their case will be assessed, we think, will be to their advantage. 
Moving on from those remarks, with respect to the bill specifically I want to briefly make a couple of remarks about the GST. Overall the GST has been a wonderful boon to Australia. It has delivered tremendous certainty to state funding. It has replaced an inefficient wholesale sales tax on goods with a much more efficient, if admittedly complex, tax on goods and services. That was always a desirable proposition. I notice the states are singularly happy with the cash flow that they are now using.
—Have they thanked you, Senator Murray?
—Many of them have thanked me privately, but I have yet to receive any public acknowledgement of the role we played.
—You'll die waiting!
—I think I will die waiting. We have taken a lot of pain to deliver Australia a lot of gain. I do note, however, in some newspapers reports on and advocacy for a rather poor proposition that the GST should be revisited to apply to basic food. In response to that the Treasurer made it very clear the other day that he was not interested in that proposition. But I should remark that some of those very newspapers that are pushing that boat, that the GST should be extended into areas to which it presently does not apply, of course, forget to remind their readers that, at the time of the original debate, they were asking to be GST exempt themselves. That is a little fact that is conveniently left out of the commentary. I want to again put on the record that before the Democrats made the decision to amend the government's controversial tax package, we did listen to the evidence from a comprehensive parliamentary inquiry, which clearly indicated to us the benefits to low-income earners of basic and fresh food being GST free.
Some of these editorial writers and advocates imply that food is the only thing which is GST free, but I want to remind people that the coalition decided on extensive GST exemptions: for dwelling rentals, health services, education, financial services and exports, all of which total well over 20 per cent of GDP. In other words, right from the start the coalition advocated that one in five consumer dollars should not be subject to the GST, and basic and fresh food was added to that; it was not the only exemption or even the most important exemption. The Democrats agreed with the coalition's proposed exemptions, and we then broadened them to include basic and fresh food, which is consistent with GST/VAT systems the world over. We also negotiated extended exemptions in the health, education and charitable services sectors. I freely admit that we could have done a bit better; undoubtedly the government could have done a bit better. Everybody concerned could have done better. But, overall, I think it was a very good outcome in Australia's national interest.
Even without taxing food, this year the GST will provide the states with an additional $1.6 billion revenue windfall. I am sometimes astonished by the fact that people who say they are in the progressive sector of policy and thought and who want much more spent on services for Australians simultaneously oppose a GST system which delivers the money that enables those services to be provided by governments, especially bearing in mind that around three-quarters of countries in the world have those systems, and it is a very common tax methodology. Including GST on food now would not reduce small business paperwork significantly and it would do nothing to fix the other problems that are apparent, so we certainly would not support any proposition to go back and tax fresh and basic food. For the record, I do recall a little fact that is often forgotten: three times in divisions the Labor Party did, in fact, vote to apply the GST to food. It is on the record; it is in the Hansard. We should remember that. We are certainly pleased that the government have no interest in going down that route, and the Democrats certainly have no interest in it. ",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT VILLAGES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I ask senators to cast their minds back to 2000 when the GST was trumpeted as a simpler tax system, one that was going to make compliance with tax law in Australia simpler, fairer and easier for all concerned. The fact that we are here four years afterwards debating the Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 that is trying to clean up this mess makes an absolute lie of the claim. Four years on, we are cleaning up the mess that the retirement village sector has been complaining about since even before the tax law came into effect on 1 July 2000. We are still cleaning up that mess. I have to say I am pleased that finally the government has been brought to the table to deal with the uncertainty in the retirement village sector about the application of GST to services that they provide. However, I am disappointed that the government has not quite got it right and has not really solved the problem.
Let us be clear about why we are debating this legislation. The reason is that the Labor Party, on behalf of the retirement village sector, has been pursuing the government for more than two years to try to get some resolution on how the GST is applied to services provided to retirement village residents. It may have taken a long time but, once again, it is the Labor Party leading from the front and it is the coalition government that has belatedly listened and finally acted on Labor's calls. I am pleased to say that it has finally acted to sort out the mess regarding GST and retirement villages, albeit not completely. The lack of clarification about how retirement village residents are taxed has dragged on since before the GST was introduced in 2000. Prior to the government introducing the GST act, which was effective on 1 July 2000, the implications of how the GST would be applied to the retirement village sector were unclear. In particular, it was unclear how it would impact on retirement village residents who require types of care similar to that provided in residential aged care—services which are GST free.
Over the last few years Labor, along with the industry, have called on the government to clarify the issue of how the GST on retirement villages is applied, to bring certainty and security to the sector. Finally they have listened to our concerns and that of the industry. However, the history of this issue, given the time it has taken for the government to respond, is illustrative of the way the coalition have failed to treat older Australians with dignity and security. The original intent of the GST legislation appeared to support the view that people in retirement villages should not pay the GST on services that were similar to services provided by Commonwealth funded aged care providers. But what happened was that the Australian Taxation Office had such a narrow definition of what `residential setting' meant that it caused widespread confusion within the sector for residents of retirement homes and for their families. In March 2000, the then shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, pursued the issue with the Treasurer of the absurd situation of the GST applying to services received by one elderly person living in a retirement village but not applying to a person in a nursing home receiving exactly the same service.
People living in retirement villages have faced an uncertain situation for over four years. These retirement villages, which have been operating privately or by community organisations since the 1950s, cater for people aged over 55, through either self-care accommodation or continuous care. The primary point at issue was how the GST was applied to residents of serviced apartments in a residential setting. Independent living units are very similar to serviced apartments: they provide a range of accommodation services such as meals, the provision of daily living assistance, nursing care where needed and, if required, cleaning and other accommodation services. Residents of self-care units often provide their own food and personal care but they also utilise common village facilities and services. In this respect, many retirement village residents are self-supporting. On the other hand, older people living in serviced units often have their meals as well as other services, such as cleaning and nursing services, provided. 
The problem is the grey area that exists between self-supporting residents and those requiring some form of assistance. This has been particularly complex for the retirement village sector when factoring in the GST. There was a lack of clarity and clarification in relation to how the GST applied to retirement villages because of the ATO's extremely narrow definition of `residential setting'. The ATO commenced a review of the GST in retirement villages through the Retirement Village Industry Partnership in February 2003. The association representing the sector, the Retirement Village Association, was involved with the ATO's partnership as they tried to get the ATO to clarify GST issues and not radically change, by reinterpretation, their understanding of how the GST was to be applied to services provided in retirement villages. Over time the ATO, in a number of private tax rulings, has been making determinations that differed from the understandings that had been reached with the sector when the GST was first introduced. Of particular concern at the time to the industry was the ATO's position that serviced apartments were not residential settings. The ATO's then position was that serviced apartment residents were not living in a residential setting as the ATO did not believe serviced apartments met its definition of a `congregate care' facility.
The purpose of this bill therefore is to clarify the definition of `residential setting' in relation to retirement villages so that those people living in a serviced apartment located in a retirement village who are receiving nursing or living assistance on a daily basis will have those services provided GST free. The bill seeks to link the term `residential setting' with `residential facility', meaning that services delivered in a residential setting are now recognised as similar to those delivered in publicly funded residential care, such as a nursing home. This change will go a long way towards removing the grey area that has caused so much anxiety and so many problems among residents, village owners and the families of people in retirement villages. 
As I said before, Labor does have concerns about other aspects of the bill with regard to the provision that the Minister for Ageing or the aged care secretary can assess and determine the degree and level of daily living and nursing style assistance that is GST exempt and can delegate the power to assess a person as requiring a specific level of care to members of an aged care assessment team, or ACAT. Labor's amendments are designed to remove the discretion given to the Minister for Ageing and the secretary to specify the level of care that a resident needs to enjoy to be deemed to be in a serviced apartment in a residential setting.
The industry has raised concerns about changes to the status quo and about the retention of the system whereby a resident's doctor or a registered nurse who is independent of the retirement village can make the assessment, as the doctor or nurse often has more intimate knowledge of their patient's changing health status. We do not want to see the ACAT assessment process bogged down or the aged care assessment teams unable to make timely assessments of residents in retirement villages or delays in the work that they are doing assessing needy people who are looking for further support, either through residential aged care or through community aged care packages. Even though the bill does not specify who should do this assessment, we see no reason why medical doctors or registered nurses could not be trusted to provide the proper assessment of the level of daily assistance a client may require. 
The government has, to some extent, fixed up the problems of defining residential settings by including serviced apartments in retirement villages. I suggest that adopting Labor's amendments would go a lot further towards clarifying the GST issues for people in retirement villages. I believe that the sector has advised the government of its concerns in this area. At this point in time we hope the government has taken on board the sector's concerns and will continue to work with it to improve the care and services provided to older Australians. During the committee stage we will further explain Labor's amendments, and I urge the government to consider them in good faith.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT VILLAGES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-12-08,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 makes some minor amendments to the new tax system to remove public uncertainty in relation to the GST treatment of retirement villages. It is not that the government's policy on the GST treatment of serviced apartments in retirement villages has changed. It has always been the government's intention that GST-free treatment apply where residents require daily living or nursing assistance. The government is simply removing uncertainty surrounding a potential ATO ruling that may have the effect of changing the GST treatment for some residents. The government is confirming that, in the context of the ruling, residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages who are assessed as requiring daily living and nursing assistance will receive these services GST free where the retirement village provides the daily living and nursing assistance in line with the quality of care principles under the Aged Care Act 1997.
The other main part of the bill concerns the charitable sector. Retirement villages operated by the charitable sector receive GST concessions in relation to accommodation, related services and meals if they meet certain guidelines—and always have. This bill protects that treatment.
The opposition is accusing the government, in effect, of a lack of care for elderly Australians, and I reject this accusation totally. In fact, this is just one of a range of measures this government is committed to which recognise the contributions of senior Australians and the issues faced by retirement home residents. The government has announced a comprehensive program involving more financial support and respite for carers, and exempting accommodation bonds paid by people entering low-level care, hostels or homes from the social security and Veterans' Affairs assets tests until bonds are refunded. These measures complement other government initiatives such as making a national health priority of dementia and increasing at-home support for people living with dementia; a 100 per cent Medicare rebate; and the increased private health insurance rebate—for people aged 65 to 69, increasing it to 35 per cent, and for people aged 70 and over, increasing it to 40 per cent. I add that the government has moved quickly to remove public uncertainty about the potential Taxation Office ruling. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-12-08,"—I move:
That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.
(Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION REPORTING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,28,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-12-08,"—We are dealing with the return of the message from the House of Representatives in respect of Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Reporting) Bill 2004 and the two amendments that the House has rejected which were passed in the Senate chamber and added to this bill yesterday afternoon. The taxation super laws reporting bill deals with the removal of the requirement for employers to report to their employees within 30 days of the end of the quarter that they have paid the superannuation contribution. This is a measure that was introduced by this government together with the requirement for the payment of superannuation contributions at least quarterly. So the issue that we are dealing with in this bill is a consequence of the government introducing this reporting requirement.
If the bill passes, which it will, the requirement that employers notify their employees of the payment of superannuation will be removed. However, this requirement will not be removed for all businesses because a substantial proportion of them are required under various industrial instruments, federal and state awards and other industrial instruments, to notify their employees of the payment of superannuation. Even many of those that are not required to do so do notify their employees of the payment of the superannuation contributions. From the outset, even prior to this bill being given notice of via a government announcement during the election, I had a number of complaints about the practical application of the payment reporting system.
In particular, I had drawn to my attention specific examples in the hospitality industry and in some sections of the agricultural industries of the practical limitations of this reporting mechanism, particularly in industries where there is a very high turnover of labour, as there is in the two examples I have given. There are practical problems in carrying out the reporting requirements and therefore, where it is impractical to carry out the reporting requirements, employers would be in breach of the law. The Labor Party recognised from the outset that there was a practical problem in some areas with this reporting mechanism. This highlights the fact that the government did not give sufficient thought to this mechanism when it introduced it some years ago. 
In the message we are considering, the House of Representatives has disagreed with two amendments: one that was successfully moved by the Labor Party and supported by the Democrats, and one moved by the Australian Democrats and supported by the Labor Party. I would not say that I am disappointed; I think it is a sign of the arrogance of this government, which will get worse over time. The two amendments that were passed by the Senate and added to the bill were reasonable amendments. The Labor amendment went to ensuring that we are regularly updated with a factual report on the number of employers not paying the SG, the quantum of moneys involved, the number of employees and the actions being taken by the tax office to recover moneys. The Labor amendment required the reporting of this information on a yearly basis. I do not think that is unreasonable. That amendment was passed by the Senate.
In the public interest it is important that, in considering the reversal of a reporting measure, we do know the facts and what is going on. A relatively small number of employers do not pay SG, but the fact that SG goes unpaid, often for considerable periods of time, does impact, I am led to believe, on tens of thousands of employees. So it is important to at least know what the facts are. I think that that, in the context of what we are considering, is a reasonable amendment. But the government with its arrogant approach—take it or leave it; black or white—does not agree with that reasonable amendment; likewise with the Democrat amendment. I was not here for the debate yesterday but I think the Democrats recognise that there are some problems and they have attempted to come to some sort of practical solution to deal with the problems that do exist in some areas. Nevertheless, the government has chosen to reject both amendments by the message.
On the issue of unpaid superannuation contributions, it is hard to establish the facts. Occasionally we get some information from estimates. We do know that there are tens of thousands of employees each year who go without their SG and that it is crystallised as a problem when, as happens in some cases, the employer is put into receivership and bankruptcy proceedings. I point out to the chamber and to those who are listening that, even though the superannuation guarantee is a statutory entitlement in this country, there is no compensation in the event of employer bankruptcy. Often, the outstanding superannuation contributions—a statutory entitlement—will exceed the redundancy payments that an individual should receive and are covered, at least in part, by the Commonwealth's statutory employee entitlements scheme. We have an absurd situation where some elements of redundancy pay—long service leave, outstanding wages and matters of that like—are, on employer bankruptcy, covered by a limited statutory entitlements scheme, but not one cent of superannuation that is unpaid on employer bankruptcy is compensated for. I point out that one of Labor's policies is to ensure that in those circumstances the outstanding superannuation guarantee contributions are covered by an employee entitlements protection scheme. That is another issue for another day. We should minimise the outstanding superannuation guarantee contributions and ensure that, where we cannot recover the moneys, employees are covered in terms of compensation. 
In considering this bill the Labor Party recognises that there are some practical issues that have to be resolved. The government has provided a blanket solution. It is not a perfect solution by any means but nevertheless it is a solution. It could have been dealt with in a better way. The two amendments that were carried in the Senate were reasonable in our view. However, a solution has to be found and, even though it is a solution that we think could have been better refined, we will not be insisting on our amendment and we will not be supporting the amendment that was successfully carried by the Australian Democrats, because we want to ensure the passage of this legislation. So we will be accepting the message transmitted from the House of Representatives.
A lot of the focus of the argument on this issue has been about red tape, particularly for small business. Whilst the problems in this area are important—and I have mentioned some of industries where they are important—the problems that businesses are going to face with new paperwork, new costs and legal liabilities when the so-called `fund choice' hits the deck on 1 July next year will rival those of the GST. There are other issues, but that is for another day. The problems that businesses are going to face with additional paperwork, record keeping, inspections by the tax office, paying moneys to multiple funds, paying for the transaction costs for payment to multiple funds and the legal liability if they give advice outside of the terms of the fund choice bill will be very significant indeed. 
We have a government that talks the talk on red tape for business—in particular, small business—but it does not walk the walk. The Labor Party will be drawing to the attention of employers throughout Australia in the run-up to fund choice just who is responsible for the additional work requirements that employers will have to go through in respect of superannuation fund choice. We will be drawing to the attention of employers that it is a Liberal government that has imposed significant new red tape burdens on employers with superannuation fund choice. I am already starting to get significant levels of complaints from employers as they are being briefed by superannuation funds on the new obligations—the burdens, the red tape—that are going to be introduced for them with superannuation fund choice. Those burdens will far and away exceed the issues relating to red tape as it applies to small business in this bill. 
That is another debate for another day. I look forward to that debate and to drawing the community's attention to the direct responsibility this government has for new employer obligations for superannuation fund choice. We will be holding the government accountable. It appears that there is a hypocritical double standard. You address the paperwork requirements for superannuation reporting, where there are some real problems—so it is one step forward for business—and then next year in the lead-up to 1 July it will be 10 steps backwards once employers start implementing superannuation fund choice.
That is not to say that superannuation fund choice can be reversed—I will be making comments about that on another occasion—but certainly there are going to have to be solutions found in two areas: the compliance burdens for employers and the issues in relation to fees and charges. Again, that is another debate for another day. The Labor Party will certainly be pointing out the Liberal government's responsibility for the new paperwork and costs that will result for employers. They will be many, many times those of the bill we are considering at the present time. The Labor Party will not be insisting on its amendment or supporting the Democrat amendment. We will accept the message from the House of Representatives.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-12-08,"—I want to express my disappointment with the attitude of the government to these amendments and my disappointment that the Senate will not be insisting on them. The issue of whether this bill is necessary is one the Senate needs to consider very carefully. True, I suppose, we have to acknowledge that some businesses have complained about the compliance costs of reporting to their employees on a quarterly basis about how much superannuation they pay. But what is wrong with that? What is wrong with saying to employers, `Good practice is telling your employees four times a year how much super they are being paid and where it is being paid to'? Surely that is what you would call minimum good practice by an employer.
In the first 10 years of the SG there were 45,000 complaints by employees to the tax office about unfunded superannuation guarantee payments. The measure we are putting in place with this bill is going to make it harder for people in the future to be able to track whether their superannuation guarantee is being paid or not. Yes, the quarterly payment into the super fund continues. But, really, if it is not being paid and you are not being told, it becomes much harder to track.
Senator Sherry missed the debate last night. When this bill was announced by the government last July the Financial Review editorial described it as `political opportunism'. That is what it is. It goes backwards in terms of improving the safety and security of our superannuation system, giving workers the information they need to protect their superannuation and ensuring that workers can track what is happening to their superannuation. We acknowledged, given the government wanted to reduce compliance costs, that we should look at that issue. We went back and looked at the explanatory memorandum the government produced with this bill, which asserted that awards and state legislation require superannuation to be on pay slips. According to the ACTU's submission to the inquiry into this bill, that particular assertion was grossly overstated in that a lot of awards do not require that at all and state legislation only requires the amount and not the fund to be stated on the pay slip.
But we thought, okay, given the government is saying that we do not need this reporting requirement because it is on pay slips, let us say that if it is on a pay slip then that reporting requirement is met. By that simple amendment you reduce the compliance costs of the current law by half and probably by two-thirds or three-quarters. In doing so, you are encouraging employers to aspire to a best practice human management technique, which is telling their employees on their pay slips, comprehensively, at least once a quarter, how they are going in terms of their superannuation. From that point of view we thought it was a reasonable amendment and we thought the ALP's proposals to make the tax office a bit more assertive in pursuing SG or collecting the data was reasonable as well.
I am surprised by Senator Sherry's statement that he will not insist on these amendments because this bill needs to go through. I would remind Senator Sherry of his own `superannuation: a safer system' policy released only a few months ago. It does seem like a long time ago, but a few months ago it said:
All contributions, made by either the employer or the employee, are included on an employee's pay slip at the time of payment.
That is what we are essentially saying here. That is what we are trying to encourage—best practice to ensure that superannuation becomes regularly reported in pay slips and, as a result, becomes a reporting mechanism. I think that the amendment that we moved achieves the outcome that we wanted of ensuring that employees know what is happening to their super, while significantly reducing the compliance costs of the bill introduced some 18 months ago into this place which introduced quarterly reporting. That is the sort of approach we would like the government to consider rather than this sledgehammer to crack a walnut approach. A couple of businesses that do not follow best practice human resource management practices complain and, as a result, suddenly all the employees about to face choice of fund lose vital information that allows them to track their superannuation. 
Why do we not look at something more reasonable, something that tries to balance compliance costs on the one side with benefits to the employees on the other? I note—and this was also noteworthy when the original bill was debated in this chamber 18 months ago—that there were, in fact, substantial benefits to employers in quarterly reporting. On the introduction of the quarterly reporting bill back in 2002, the government senators, in their report on the bill, said:
 ... employers may also benefit from the measure, including from reduced administration costs associated with quarterly rather than annual contributions. In particular, benefits may result from the potential for:
	achieving interest savings that could result from the accrual of smaller SG shortfall amounts over a quarter rather than over a full year;
	receiving early warning of possible problems regarding the level of contributions and the opportunity to rectify these leading to reduced SGC payable over the year; and
	developing better business practices, especially by small business, and thereby avoiding large annual outlays.
Another benefit that the government senators noted at the time was that it would be about:
	improving employees knowledge and understanding of their superannuation entitlements resulting in the potential for early notification of difficulties regarding payment of contributions and incentives for consolidation of disparate contributions.
All of those are important benefits, yet apparently in the new-look Liberal Party it is all one way: business gets the benefits but any costs associated with that have to be downplayed and got rid of; they are unnecessary. If that is the basis for balance, I shall be pleased to leave this place in July because, in some respects, it will be tragic to see coming forward these sorts of provisions that are so unbalanced against the interests of ordinary Australians—the so-called `battlers' who voted for the Howard government—and so unbalanced in the favour of business, even in the face of clear evidence that the provisions are needed. There have been 45,000 complaints in 10 years. Surely we should be trying to reduce that. Surely we should be trying to make efforts, as the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer said in her second reading speech when introducing theses measures 18 months ago, to reduce the incidence of lost accounts.
I am disappointed that the Senate tonight has not received support from the government for these amendments. I think they are reasonable. I think they are appropriate. They try to take the intent of the government's legislation, as reflected in the explanatory memorandum, give it some real meaning and make it work for both employees and employers. Surely that is what a government of balance is about, not being totally and utterly one eyed in standing up for the interests of the squeakiest wheel in the small business sector. From that point of view, I think that at the end of the next three years we will see workers much worse off than they are now, and Australia much worse off. Certainly, this measure is going to make it much harder for choice of funds to be successful in July. That disappoints me because I supported that legislation. 
The Democrats will be opposing this motion. We believe these amendments should be insisted upon and we would certainly ask the minister to seriously consider withdrawing her motion at this stage and considering a proposition that finds a reasonable compromise on this. To insist on removing a reasonable reporting mechanism that the government knew was necessary 18 months ago, that all of industry says is necessary and that the evidence from the statistics of the tax office says is necessary certainly is, in my view, a retrograde step.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION REPORTING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,28,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-12-08,"—I want to first of all deal with the remarks made by Senator Sherry. I note that the Labor Party will now be accepting the message from the House of Representatives. I think it is fair to place on record just what has happened in respect of the anticipated passage of this bill. Last night in the Senate we had a chaotic and a divided Labor Party effectively voting down a bill that just two days before they had said they would support. Just two days ago, in the other place, the shadow minister, Mr Fitzgibbon, said in his speech on the second reading debate of the Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Reporting) Bill 2004:
The bill is a genuine attempt to reduce the compliance burden on small business. Labor supports this and will support the bill.
Yet last night in the Senate we had Mr Fitzgibbon's Labor Senate colleagues introducing their own amendments to create a complex new reporting structure that would have simply added to the burden of complying employers. This is notwithstanding the fact that much of the information referred to in the amendments is already provided.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. The minister is misleading the chamber in saying that we voted the bill down. We did not vote the bill down last night. The minister is lying.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—You should withdraw that, Senator Sherry.
—I withdraw that. I now have the minister's position clearly on the record to say—
—There is no point of order, Senator Sherry.
—I can understand how Senator Sherry, as the spokesperson for superannuation, realises that just about anything that the Labor Party do on superannuation consigns them to utter irrelevance. Senator Sherry was actually the architect of a superannuation policy that he took to the election where he proposed to rip $4 billion out of the superannuation savings system. Not worrying about the workers, Senator Sherry's policy, on behalf of the Labor Party, was going to rip into the savings of workers and rip into and actually abolish the co-contribution, when it was a measure designed specifically to help low- and middle-income earners.
It ill behoves Senator Sherry to be talking piously, so it would seem, about Labor's position on this bill. I can understand why Senator Sherry is very sensitive about the fact that he has just had to do a huge backflip by accepting the message from the House of Representatives and dropping the poor old Democrats down a hole once again. You cannot trust the Labor Party on these kinds of amendments, that is for sure—as Senator Cherry would appreciate. 
Labor were once again in complete disarray last night, introducing their own amendments to create a complex new reporting structure that would simply have added to the burden of employers needing to comply with this legislation. Thankfully, it would seem that cooler heads have prevailed in the House of Representatives. Senator Sherry now has his riding instructions. He has been told what to do and the Labor Party will now be supporting this legislation without amendment, as they should have done in the first place.
It really did get worse, because Labor also voted for a Democrat amendment that would reverse the intention of the bill by reintroducing the superannuation reporting requirement, which the shadow minister said on Monday Labor would support removing. So there is confusion all around on the part of the Labor Party, but that is not very surprising. This bill has a commencement date of 1 January. It is too important to fall victim to Labor's continued internal chaos and policy paralysis.
As for the issues raised by Senator Cherry, who I think does try to get some balance into the approach taken by the Democrats, I reiterate comments I made in the debate last night. The government notes that there is a combination of practices and safeguards to be found throughout the legislation that satisfies the government that it will allow employees to remain informed about their superannuation. That is important.
As I pointed out in my earlier comments, the government does recognise the importance of employees knowing that their super entitlements are being met and their having a sense of ownership over their retirement savings. As I have already noted, employees will continue to receive annual statements—at least—from their superannuation funds and, importantly, they can contact their funds as frequently as they like to satisfy themselves with certainty that their entitlements have been received by the funds and are being allocated to their accounts. This level of conclusiveness is not provided by current or, I should add, mere employer reports. I do not mean that annual reporting is not important—it is. The government takes the view that an appropriate balance is reflected in this legislation, and I am sorry that Senator Cherry has not reconsidered his position. I am glad that the Labor Party now accepts the government's position and will be supporting the legislation.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-12-08,"—This amendment relates to a bill which was proposed by the Attorney-General in fulfilment of an agreement made some time ago now, on 25 June 2004. It relates specifically to a part of a national licensing regime regulating the access and ownership of materials considered a threat to national security. At the time the bill was introduced and dealt with, the opposition indicated that we would be agreeing to the passage of the bill on the basis of the requirements to meet national security. However, we did, and still do, believe that it could be improved significantly. We sought to include a provision which ensured that the word `thing', which was contained in paragraphs 35 and 39, had a bit more substance around it and could be dealt with by regulation and, by way of definition, the regulation could then assist in describing the word `thing'. The opposition was concerned with what is called incremental legislative overreach, whereby you can, by regulation, expand definitions that should not be expanded without significant oversight by the parliament. It ensures that, by way of regulation, it can in fact be done.
There is, of course, the ability to have a disallowance motion provided for to give notice and disallow, but that is used only in circumstances where there is clearly overreach by the legislators. We are not suggesting that would be the case here, but it is one of those parliamentary scrutiny measures that deserved consideration by the government. We are disappointed that they did not include the amendment in the bill, because it would have made it a much better bill as a consequence. However, the overriding position that the Labor Party has adopted in respect of this particular issue is that the bill is a beneficial bill. As I have said, it provides a licensing regime which will allow states, in the normal course of checking on people's backgrounds, not only to check their criminal databases but also to access ASIO's terrorist database. In allowing them to do that, the provision will assist in ensuring that people do not obtain ammonium nitrate or other chemicals which could be used for explosive devices without at least adequate security checks being in place and without a licensing regime administered by the states.
Although it is belated and it provides a bit of a catch-up on national security, it meets the test of being a bill that is needed and that will provide enhanced national security for Australia. Therefore it deserves support, notwithstanding the inability of the government to recognise the need for the amendment made by Labor in this instance. We will not be insisting on that amendment because we think overall that the bill should pass, come into operation and be part of our national security response.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 </title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,29,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-12-08,"—Likewise, we Democrats will not be insisting upon the amendments proposed by Labor—amendments which I made clear in my second reading contribution to this debate earlier in the week that the Democrats had given thought to. We did not move them simply because Labor had come to the same conclusion and had circulated its amendments before we had. We consider that the bill as a whole, on balance, is good and necessary. I have made those points also in my contribution to the second reading debate. Our only criticism is what we see as the late timing of the bill. We would have liked to have seen this particular legislative reform introduced sooner and we have been calling for something similar for some months now.
However, we agree with Labor that the substance of the bill could be improved upon by better addressing the issue of the terminology `a thing', which is really quite extraordinary in terms of legislative framework. We believe that the bill could do with better regulation, structured in such a way that it could perhaps be a disallowable instrument such that the parliament would also have a role of oversight and review of the powers we grant to ASIO. As it stands the bill is structured in a way which offers ASIO, to some degree, a blank cheque. Senator Ludwig has referred to that as legislative overreach and we would agree with that. It concerns us that there will now, it would seem, be opportunities for ASIO, in terms of the operation of this bill, to extend its processes of liaison and scrutiny to things other than, in this case, ammonium nitrate. That may seem benign on the surface but I think that, unless we as a democratic institution take great care to proscribe the powers and opportunities that we give to our intelligence agencies, necessary though they are and accepting the important role that they play, we may be diminishing the civil liberties and rights of our citizens. We have some discomfort with the blank cheque that this provides to ASIO but nonetheless, on the basis of the broader aspect of this bill being good, we will not be insisting upon the amendment.
Question agreed to.
Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 </title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,29,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-12-08,"—The stated intention of the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 is to provide a procedure where the disclosure of information relating to or that may affect national security could be introduced during federal criminal proceedings. The stated aim of the bill is to allow this information to be introduced in an edited or summarised form so as to facilitate the prosecution of an offence without prejudicing national security and the rights of a defendant to a fair trial.
In this instance we have a schedule of amendments that have been made by the House of Representatives to clarify the procedures and ensure that the operation of the procedures that are contained within the bill will work more effectively. We are disappointed that all of the matters that could have been dealt with were not dealt with in the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill. However, when you look at the position of the bill as a whole, it is much improved from when we first started. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee was able to provide a number of recommendations on the bill and they were in part picked up by the government. Although they were not completely and all picked up by the government, significant improvement was made. 
I think it is worth mentioning the significant improvements that committee work can make. Senator Greig was also a party to that committee and I think that in this instance he would concur that the work of the committee was able to significantly advance the recommendations that were picked up by the government. The recommendations exposed issues that the government were able to incorporate into the bill to improve its operation. They ensured that issues such as how the procedures would work, and how the process would be dealt with and continued in a fair way, moved the balance between national security and the right of defendants in these matters to receive adequate instruction from solicitors and barristers. They ensured that there were checks and balances and that public interest rights were significantly protected. So the changes ensured that the public interest was balanced against the needs of national security.
Although, as we indicated during the second reading debate, the bill is not perfect and Labor certainly would have done it differently, I think it has been significantly improved. Without taking up a significant amount of the chamber's time, I have been able to at least put down our position. We would have implemented a new federal protected disclosure regime, which would have included appropriate protections for persons working in the area. We would have had a better position than the one the government has now adopted.
One of disappointing things that came out of this, notwithstanding the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee work, was that the government failed to address the Australian Law Reform Commission work. A unique situation developed where the ALRC developed a report, called Keeping secrets, which by and large was ignored by the government. They developed a model of their own. One wonders what the ALRC really thought about the whole process. They clearly spent significant amounts of time and energy developing a response to this position without the knowledge that at some point the government would in fact develop a bill and response, but not based on the work that ALRC had done. The ALRC ended up commenting, in relation to the national security bill which was proposed by the government, that they were—perhaps in my words—a little bit disappointed that the government had not taken the opportunity of utilising a lot of their work.
Labor will agree to the passage of this bill. The scheme will provide protections and the right checks and balances. It balances national security on the one hand with the rights of the offender and the defendant on the other. It ensures that the judiciary still has a significant role in ensuring fairness all round. It has been substantially amended to pick up recommendations of the Legal and Constitutional Committee.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,30,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-12-08,"—As I made clear in the Democrats response to the bill in the second reading debate, we oppose the bill in toto. In relation to the amendments which have now been made by the other place, we welcome some but disagree with others. I would like to touch on some of those briefly. We would argue that amendment (1) basically accepts what was the opposition's original amendment, which we supported, to insert a definition of `substantial adverse effect'. The government amendment we have now expands upon and further clarifies the definition inserted by Labor. 
Amendments (2) and (3) we could support. Amendment (2) further expands the regulation-making power under clause 23. In particular, it provides that regulations may be made in relation to accessing, preparing, storing, handling and destroying information. Amendment (3) ensures that the court can make orders relating to not only the storage of information but also to its handling or destruction. Amendment (4), again, we could support. This amendment makes it clear that a defendant's legal practitioner is a potential discloser for the purposes of paragraph 28(8)(c). This is important because it ensures that the defendant is provided with the Attorney-General's certificate but is also subject to the offence of unlawful disclosure.
We do not agree with amendment (5), but we could begrudgingly accept it, I suppose. The amendment removes subclause 29(3A), which was inserted by an opposition amendment in the Senate. The subclause provides that, in considering whether to exclude a lawyer who has not received a security clearance, the court should consider how long that lawyer has been in active practice without previous criminal convictions or adverse findings in disciplinary matters, the lawyer's previous experience in handling confidential information and the effectiveness of any undertakings to the court. The government makes the point that this subclause does not add anything to the bill and that essentially the court will still have to consider whether granting an uncleared lawyer access to information would be likely to prejudice national security. While it may be true that these additional considerations add little to the bill, in the sense that they may be taken into consideration by the court in any event, the Democrats do see some merit in explicitly including them in legislation. They serve to remind courts that, just because a lawyer has not received a security clearance under this legislation, he or she is not automatically prevented from accessing high-level security information. Ultimately, such access will be at the discretion of the court and the court will be free to take into account matters such as the legal practitioner's previous record. As these are important factors, the Democrats do see some benefit in expressly including them in the bill. However, as they do not change the ultimate decision to be made by the court, we will accept the amendment.
Amendment (6) is one we could not support. This amendment removes subclause 29(6), which was included in the bill by an opposition amendment. It provides that the court must make the record of a closed hearing available to the public unless the court determines that the publication of the transcript would prejudice national security. We accept the government's point that the transcript of the rest of the trial proceedings, other than closed hearings, would be available to the public and we also accept its point that the transcript will be available to the parties for the purpose of an appeal. But perhaps the most important point that the government makes is that the hearing is closed to the public in order to prevent the disclosure of information that may affect Australia's national security and that it would not be appropriate to protect the disclosure of information all the way through trial only to have it disclosed to the public. In part, we Democrats agree with this argument. However, we are also conscious of the possibility that, in some circumstances, after hearing the relevant evidence in full, the court may reach the conclusion that the information would not, in fact, prejudice national security. In those cases, the interests of an open justice system should prevail. We concede that this will rarely be the case. However, we are concerned that this will be the case on occasions, and for the sake of those occasions the court should retain its discretion to order the public release of the transcript. 
Amendments (7) and (8) relate to the opportunity for the prosecution and/or the Attorney-General to seek an appeal of the court's decision in relation to a request to vary aspects of a record. They are similar to provisions in clauses 32 and 33 relating to appeals against the court's proposed statement of reasons. This is because in each case the legislation sets up a process which involves only the court, the prosecution and possibly the Attorney-General but which occurs without the knowledge of the defendant and his or her lawyer. We Democrats view these provisions not only as inherently unfair to the defendant but also as a dangerous blurring of the separation of powers.
Regardless of any genuine security concerns raised by the prosecutor or the Attorney-General at this stage, these provisions have the potential to create a perception that the executive government is playing a direct and active role in the decision-making process of the court. We Democrats believe it is important to guard against such a perception. It should be the case that the prosecutor and the Attorney-General can make their national security concerns clear to the court prior to the making of a section 29 order. There is no need to give them an additional right of appeal in the absence of any counterarguments from the defendant. In summary, that is the Democrats position on this latter suite of amendments progressed by the government through the other place. Our opposition to the bill in toto remains.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,30,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-12-08,"—Earlier today the House of Representatives passed the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 subject to eight amendments, and Senator Greig has just canvassed those. These amendments further the policy objectives of the bill agreed to by the Senate last week without undermining its effectiveness. These amend-ments achieve two main goals. Firstly, they reinforce that there is only one criterion that should be considered by a court in deciding whether to give uncleared legal representatives access to security sensitive information—that is, whether such access would be likely to prejudice national security. Whether a lawyer has previous convictions or adverse findings in disciplinary proceedings of itself offers little insight into whether the lawyer is of security concern, although it may be something to which the court has regard in assessing the likely prejudice. Only an appropriate security clearance process can give us that assurance. Secondly, they ensure that a security cleared legal representative of the defendant can access the closed hearing transcript in a prescribed place and manner.
The amendments facilitate the work of the defendant's legal representative in a secure environment, ensuring both fairness to the defendant and the protection of sensitive information. In this way the bill strikes an appropriate balance between the competing public interests of open justice and national security. In the spirit of working collaboratively to combat the growing threat of terrorism, the House of Representatives decided to reach this compromise to facilitate the passage of this bill. A number of the amendments I have referred to are consequential on amendments which the opposition moved in the Senate and which were passed. I think an example of this was the substantial adverse effect, which Senator Greig pointed to in his speech and for which Senator Ludwig outlined the situation. I will not prolong matters unduly. Suffice to say these amendments are in line with the policy objectives of the bill. They are worth while. I commend the motion to the committee that it agrees to the amendments made by the House of Representatives. 
Question agreed to.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I rise to speak on the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. If we were to document Australian corporate history, it is highly likely the most alarming and unethical chapter would concern James Hardie Industries Ltd. For decades the health risks of asbestos have been known and, in spite of this knowledge, James Hardie continued to produce asbestos until 1987. Thousands of Australians have fallen ill and many have died as a result of asbestos related diseases. These illnesses are painful and terminal. The victims have not just been those who suffered and suffer from diseases like mesothelioma—the James Hardie workers—but also their families. These were the victims' loved ones, the people for whom the workers were trying to build a better life. Now they are left with little; they have lost what is most important and they are left to fight for compensation. James Hardie has gone to considerable and unethical lengths to avoid paying this compensation. Indeed, it appears that if James Hardie had taken as much care of its workers as it has in avoiding its liabilities we might be thinking of them in a better light.
The ALP have been doing everything in our power to support James Hardie's victims and to pressure James Hardie to do the right thing. Some months ago Mark Latham decided that Labor would not accept the donation from James Hardie to the party and, instead of giving the money back to James Hardie, he gave the money to sufferers of asbestos diseases. It is interesting to note that during the election campaign, two weeks from election day, the Prime Minister finally jumped on this bandwagon and decided that he should not accept the money from James Hardie either.
The newly elected member for Parramatta has also been a key player in putting this issue in the public eye. She has worked with local families in her community, lobbying, agitating and doing all the things a local champion should. With the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, she helped organise a council boycott of James Hardie products, with over a dozen councils now participating. It is interesting to contrast the actions and position taken by the ALP and the member for Parramatta with those taken by the member for O'Connor. Last night we saw an extraordinary contribution to the House of Representatives—an extraordinary defence of James Hardie. Indeed, one might say the member for O'Connor is in the smallest club in the nation: he is the sole shareholder and director of the James Hardie fan club. His comments likening Hardie victims to `ambulance chasers' were offensive and completely lacking in compassion. I call on him to apologise to James Hardie workers and to asbestos victims, sufferers and their families for his comments.
The Australian Council of Trade Unions have also been at the centre of the victims' struggle. The ACTU have been with the Hardie victims all along, negotiating, organising and leading the public movement to stop the injustices. This is the same ACTU that this government would prefer did not exist and will be trying to dismantle over the next three years. I congratulate the ACTU on their work, a fine example of the collective spirit that underpins the trade union movement. I also acknowledge the fine and courageous work of the victims, their families and their supporters in their campaign for justice for asbestos disease sufferers. Currently negotiations are continuing between James Hardie, the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, and the ACTU on behalf of claimants, for additional funds to be paid to the foundation by James Hardie. Legislation like this before the chamber is strongly supported by our community as a necessary measure to pressure Hardie and to ensure that justice is done. 
The actions of James Hardie in relation to victims of asbestos related diseases are reasonably well known. The company engaged in a complex corporate restructure, separating subsidiary companies with liabilities and transferring assets offshore to a Dutch-registered legal entity. The company also established the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, ostensibly to deal with the claims of all victims of asbestos related diseases against the various companies comprising James Hardie. Despite the clear public assurances of James Hardie officers that the foundation was sufficiently funded to meet its liabilities, it has become clear that a substantial funding shortfall exists, currently estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion. In addition, the financial state of the foundation was debilitated by the cancellation of partly paid shares by the former parent company subsequent to the corporate restructure being authorised by the New South Wales Supreme Court. The cancellation effectively removed an additional potential funding source for the foundation and occurred despite the existence of the shares being relied on in the court proceedings to approve the corporate restructure.
The New South Wales government has provided pivotal support for Hardie victims from the beginning. Premier Carr and Attorney-General Debus have applied pressure on Hardie management and used whatever means at their disposal to force its hand. The New South Wales government established the Jackson special commission of inquiry, in which adverse findings were made against various Hardie executives. Subsequently the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced it would fully investigate these matters. The New South Wales government has liaised extensively with ASIC to assist it in carrying out its investigations. It passed a bill providing for the statutory transfer of all records produced for or created by the special commission. However, the New South Wales bill does not abrogate legal professional privilege or confidentiality in the records for the purposes of ASIC's civil or criminal proceedings. This was identified by ASIC as a potential limitation and ASIC sought that this legal professional privilege be abrogated by the New South Wales government. That government rightly took the view that it was not appropriate for a state government to seek to pre-empt Commonwealth decision making on ASIC's powers, which could effectively put the regulator in a more favourable position under New South Wales legislation than it would be under its own Commonwealth act.
Some weeks ago, the New South Wales Attorney-General wrote to the federal Treasurer, requesting his urgent consideration of this shortcoming in ASIC's powers. As a result of this initiative, we now have this bill. Given this background, it is disappointing that the Treasurer sought to imply, both in the parliament last week and in a subsequent media statement, that the bill arose out of the failure of the New South Wales government to act appropriately or swiftly in respect of Hardie. A cynical person might question the Treasurer's motives in making such an implication. Certainly we would hope that he is not seeking to play politics on such a sensitive issue. We on this side of the chamber support this legislation and its speedy passage through the parliament. We believe the circumstances of asbestos victims and the conduct of James Hardie justify the legislation. 
The bill significantly enhances the ability of ASIC or the Director of Public Prosecutions to undertake investigations and take proceedings against corporate bodies that are part of the James Hardie group, its officers, employees or advisers. The bill expressly abrogates legal professional privilege in relation to certain materials, permitting their use in these investigations or proceedings. Materials include records used in the special commission, as well as materials requested by ASIC or the DPP in relation to their investigations. The investigations and proceedings for which privilege is abrogated are limited to the circumstances of the restructure I described earlier, including Hardie's ability to meet its liabilities. The bill effectively removes any uncertainty as to whether ASIC's powers to require the provision of materials can be obstructed by a claim of legal professional privilege. Whilst there is broad support for this bill in the community, in parliaments around the country—with the exception of the member for O'Connor—and amongst those who are supporting the cause of Hardie victims, some concern has been expressed by the Law Council and in legal circles about the implications of this bill.
It is indeed a serious matter to abrogate legal professional privilege. We on this side do not take lightly any move of this kind and would see that this is not a precedent. However, the investigation of these important issues may be impaired if ASIC or the DPP were unable to obtain and rely upon materials before the Jackson inquiry, on the basis of a claim of legal professional privilege. In particular, the subject matter of many of the things which require investigation include complex transactions. Materials documenting relevant advice may offer critical evidence as to the purpose of these transactions and the intention of James Hardie officers, which would otherwise be extremely difficult to establish. Without the measures provided for in this bill, we may not be able to establish the knowledge and intention of James Hardie officers. We believe not only that there is a public interest in establishing these things but also that they are likely to be critical in determining whether any breaches of the law have occurred.
There are many alarming findings of the Jackson inquiry which require further investigation by ASIC. Adverse conclusions were made against Peter Macdonald and Peter Shafron, as chief executive officer and chief financial officer respectively. Commissioner Jackson also found that Mr Macdonald and possibly James Hardie Industries Ltd may have been in breach of section 1309 of the Corporations Law and that their decision to send a media release asserting that liabilities were covered to the Australian Stock Exchange on 16 February 2001 contravened section 995(2) of the Corporations Law. It is fundamental to the public interest that these allegations be investigated and tested.
The opposition will be supporting the legislation. However, we do flag a number of issues on which we request some advice, and I will indicate them to the minister: why there was a decision not to extend to the ACCC similar provisions to those extended to ASIC, and whether or not personal legal professional privilege will be retained by Hardie's officers. This bill is specifically intended for Hardie, and it is intended to facilitate justice for its victims, who have been undermined, mistreated and misled. This bill has no wider application, but if it were to have any wider effect I hope it would be simply to discourage corporate misbehaviour of this kind in the future. I know that many good Australian corporate citizens have been shocked and horrified by Hardie's actions.
Of course, for ASIC's investigation to be effective it needs to have not only the information required but also the necessary funds. It was particularly disturbing to see on Business Sunday two weeks ago ASIC's Chairman, Mr Jeffrey Lucy, indicating that the organisation needed further funds to fully investigate Hardie. We call on the Treasurer to guarantee in no uncertain terms that the government will provide immediately the funds required for ASIC to fully investigate James Hardie. The opposition want a full, prompt and thorough investigation by ASIC, and any wrongdoing to be addressed as soon as possible. This matter has dragged on for far too long for too many innocent Australians. 
I would like to turn to one other issue arising out of the Jackson inquiry. The New South Wales government has announced legislation which seeks to enable asbestos victims to take action against related corporations, including the Dutch-registered entity. The Commonwealth has indicated support for this legislation. However, there is a lack of clarity as to the enforceability of any judgments under this legislation in the Netherlands. In particular, the Jackson inquiry queried whether laws that were retrospective and Hardie specific would be enforceable in the Netherlands in the absence of a treaty. The legislation proposed by the New South Wales government and endorsed by state and Commonwealth attorneys-general is specifically directed at Hardie and is retrospective. Therefore, a treaty would appear necessary. However, when commenting in favour of the New South Wales legislation, the Commonwealth Attorney-General claimed that Dutch authorities had advised that, in general, it was not necessary to set up a treaty with the Netherlands for conventional Australian court judgments. But this is not what the New South Wales legislation is likely to deliver. Previously, the Attorney-General indicated that the government would consider pursuing a treaty. We call on the Attorney-General to table the advice he has received as to whether a treaty is necessary. Victims and their families deserve certainty. They need to know that any court proceedings and charges that are successfully prosecuted will have the full force of the law behind them. They need to know that no sanctuary and no succour can come from the change of address on Hardie's letterhead.
The financial state of the foundation remains parlous. Its directors recently sought the appointment of a provisional liquidator and have indicated that without further cash injections by James Hardie the foundation will have to be liquidated. This process was temporarily averted by a last-minute cash injection of $88 million by the former James Hardie parent company, and these proceedings have now been adjourned until late January next year. The potential liquidation of the foundation has ramifications not only for future and current unpaid claimants but potentially also for those persons who have received payments to date. In this parliament we need to do all that we can to see justice prevail for Hardie's victims. More than anything, however, we need to see James Hardie take its seat at the table and negotiate in good faith to see this matter resolved. James Hardie must immediately agree upon a fully funded settlement arrangement for asbestosis victims.
I want to briefly comment on the second reading amendment which Senator Murray has flagged with me. I indicate that the Labor Party would be very happy to support paragraph (a) of that second reading amendment. It is entirely consistent with the strong position we have taken for a number of months, including during the election campaign, against James Hardie's actions and its callous disregard for the victims of asbestos related diseases. However, we are not in a position to support paragraphs (b) and (c), which deal directly with tobacco companies. I indicate that the Labor Party have also taken a strong position in relation to tobacco companies. Unlike the government, we have indicated that we would no longer take political donations from tobacco companies. We hoped that the government would engage in some bipartisanship on that issue and we challenged them to do the same thing. 
We also, in our previous election commitments, indicated a substantial increase to funding for antismoking campaigns and antismoking programs. We are not soft on tobacco companies; we have taken an extremely strong position. However, we think tacking that aspect of public policy onto this legislation is not appropriate. The issue of the abrogation of legal professional privilege is a difficult matter. It is justified in the circumstances of James Hardie, where we have had the Jackson inquiry and where we have the information to demonstrate that that is the case. If such legislation were mooted in relation to tobacco companies, we would obviously examine it in light of our previous policy commitments to support antismoking campaigns and to refuse to take political donations from the companies. However, we are not prepared to support the second part of Senator Murray's second reading amendment.
In closing, I emphasise again that bipartisanship—except for the member for O'Connor—across parliaments around this country to pressure James Hardie to fund an appropriate settlement fund for asbestos victims is welcome. This parliament does call on James Hardie to do the right thing. The community calls on James Hardie to do the right thing. What they have engaged in has been unethical. It has not been in accordance with the standards of ethical behaviour we do expect from Australia's corporations. Hardie's victims and their families deserve far better than the company have provided to date. They must immediately agree to fully funded settlement arrangements for asbestosis victims.",SENATE,<title>JAMES HARDIE (INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-08,"—As I understand the procedures for the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004, because there are no amendments we will not be going into committee stage. I have received a copy of a James Hardie letter which has been addressed to, amongst others, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Leader of the Opposition, Minister for Defence, Leader of the Government in the Senate, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Leader of the Australian Greens and Leader of the Australian Democrats. This copy of mine is with the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats. There may be many other people who have copies of this letter. Because we are not going into committee stage, I would suggest that the contents of this letter are such that they should be on the record. I am going to ask if I can give this letter to the attendant so that the whips of either side can have a look at it and be satisfied that this can be tabled at the end of my remarks, if that meets with your approval, Mr Acting Deputy President.
 (Senator Brandis)—You do that, Senator Murray. I assume that you will at the appropriate time seek leave to table or incorporate the letter, subject to what the whips say.
—I will at the end of my remarks.
—I am advised by the Clerk that, if you request it, the Senate can go into committee in these circumstances.
—I am not asking that it go into committee. That is why I would rather short-cut the procedure. 
—You can proceed with that course you have foreshadowed, Senator Murray.
—Thank you for your forbearance. The James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004 abrogates legal professional principle from the James Hardie Group and their advisers in respect of the investigations surrounding the James Hardie restructure. My notes from the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member, say that the James Hardie bill seeks to remove legal professional privilege from material arising out of the James Hardie special commission of inquiry in New South Wales, otherwise known as the Jackson inquiry, in order to facilitate investigation and instigation of legal proceedings by ASIC and the Commonwealth DPP.
In its Bills Digest the Parliamentary Library has identified several issues raised by the bill. The main issue is whether the bill, in particular proposed section 4(4), could be interpreted as being contrary to the constitutional principle of separation of powers since it contains a possible direction to courts conducting James Hardie proceedings to disregard any claim of legal professional privilege. The Bills Digest notes that this area of law is unsettled in Australia and that there is no fully accepted test for when legislation will constitute an impermissible interference with judicial functions. The pertinent issue is whether the proposed legislation or a provision within that proposed legislation constitutes a direction to courts in a pending or prospective case rather than a substantive change to the law.
The position taken by the Privy Council in Liyanage v. The Queen, where a piece of Ceylonese legislation aimed at securing the conviction of alleged conspirators in a coup attempt was found to be a usurpation of judicial power, has received a mixed reception by Australian courts. Some Australian cases have indicated that without such direct intervention in the judicial process there will be no breach of the doctrine of separation of powers, but in recent decisions courts have been reluctant to fully adopt the approach in Liyanage. In some cases the approach has been at least partially endorsed by Australian courts. Those notes from the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services capture the likelihood of a legal challenge. But the likelihood of legal challenge is low, in my opinion, because of wide community and political outrage at the behaviour of the James Hardie Group with respect to their failure to meet their obligations to asbestos victims.
The muted adverse reaction to the announcement of the removal of legal professional privilege for James Hardie does not conceal the fact that some of the legal fraternity are concerned about the precedent. Undermining the principle of legal professional privilege has its attractions in moral circumstances like these surrounding the asbestos claims scandal. This bill does increase the probability that directors and managers at James Hardie will be properly punished for their behaviour. That is its plus. Its minus is that to do so requires the removal of a legal protection that has until now been available to all. And if the whips are happy to have that James Hardie letter tabled they will see that that group is concerned about unintended consequences. 
I am also assisted, apart from by the Bills Digest and my notes from my corporations committee, by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which tabled its report this afternoon. In that Alert Digest—which a number of people would perhaps not have had a chance to access because it was tabled only this afternoon—the committee does make the point that any abrogation of legal professional privilege: 
... trespasses on the rights of those affected, and the Committee will always draw such provisions to the attention of the Senate.
It goes on to say:
The Committee also notes the retrospective effect of the legislation, which would abrogate legal professional privilege in respect of records produced to, or created by, the James Hardie Special Commission of Inquiry and transferred from the NSW Government to ASIC, as well as relevant material obtained after the commencement of the bill.
The Committee considers that, while clause 4 clearly trespasses on the rights of the James Hardie Group of companies (to the extent that the group can be considered to enjoy such rights)—
and of course they distinguish individual rights as opposed to entity rights—
the question of whether it does so unduly is a matter for the Senate as a whole.
Further on, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee says that it considers that one of the issues we should be cognisant of is the use in the bill and its accompanying memoranda and second reading speech of criteria such as `higher public policy interests' which, as it says:
... are not susceptible to objective definition, to justify the intrusion on such rights. The Committee considers that, if such an approach is to be adopted in the future, the criteria should be better developed and defined, and seeks the Treasurer's advice on the development of this approach. 
In the absence of a better developed definition of criteria such as `higher public policy interests', the Committee does not consider that the bill provides a useful precedent for future legislation intended to abrogate legal professional privilege.
One of the reasons that I am going to be moving my second reading amendment is to signal to the Senate that there are moral circumstances, which might be regarded as approximating these, in which the government has sought to set aside a standard legal protection. If that is so and if this bill is to prove a precedent for future action then it does behove the Treasurer and his officers to develop a better defined set of criteria whereby the corporate veil will be ripped away in certain circumstances. I do think it important that the Senate is aware of past history where for the first time something is introduced and then later on it is repeated in other bills, with the first introduction used as a precedent. This is an important issue because there are other areas which properly are moral circumstances worthy of being treated in this manner.
The Democrats will support any measure that may increase the chance of justice being obtained for the many victims of asbestosis that accords with good process and rights. Our question is: why stop at these victims? If such laws are good enough for James Hardie, they are good enough for the churches and the tobacco companies too. What about the vastly greater number of victims of child sexual assault or the vastly greater number of victims of tobacco poisoning? I am sure senators can come up with other classes of victims as well. If legal professional privilege deserves to be lifted for particular moral circumstances, that principle needs to be properly developed for all appropriate moral circumstances and it also needs to be properly circumscribed.
In the past three years, the Democrats have participated in over 60 parliamentary reports and committee inquiries aimed at ensuring Australia has the toughest possible rules regulating corporate responsibility. The conduct of companies like HIH and James Hardie illustrates that, given the opportunity, some businesspeople do try to bend laws and do try to avoid their full moral obligations. By maintaining and toughening corporate governance rules and corporate governance law the Democrats have contributed, with other parties in the Senate, to minimising the opportunities for corporations to avoid their responsibilities. Tough and responsible laws that ensure Australian companies and their directors are kept honest never do get as much publicity as they deserve, but in so many ways they are much more important in the long term than any public grandstanding or random corporate bashing. 
The Democrats have affirmed that we would support any changes to federal or state laws that were identified by the report of the commission of inquiry into James Hardie as being necessary. Our intention is to assist in providing full political and parliamentary support for the victims of James Hardie to ensure they receive the fullest compensation and the best process of justice that they can. We do have a very strong record of trying to lift the standards for corporate responsibility and of trying to keep the rogue elements of the business community in check without creating unnecessary constraints on the vast majority of businesses who do the right thing. We used our links with the Netherlands parliament and government to increase the pressure over there on James Hardie Industries to meet its obligations to the many workers affected by asbestosis. We did that by having questions asked by a member of the Democrat family in the Netherlands.
Companies like James Hardie and others manufactured most of the asbestos products that have been used in thousands of commercial and private buildings in Australia. Regardless of what is said in the face of prospective litigation, all know about the effect these products have on the health of employees and on members of the wider community. Unfortunately, James Hardie shirked their corporate and social responsibilities. James Hardie defended their first asbestosis death case in Sydney in the 1930s. However, it was not until 1978—years after other companies had done so—that James Hardie finally put a warning on its asbestos products. The Democrats will be supporting the bill and will introduce a second reading amendment. I seek leave of the Senate to table that letter from James Hardie.
Leave granted.
—I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
	(a)	notes and strongly condemns the conduct of the James Hardie Group as identified in the Jackson Inquiry; 
	(b)	also notes that over the past 50 years tobacco companies have knowingly supplied and promoted a deadly product that kills over 15 000 Australians a year; and
	(c)	calls on the Government to consider abrogating legal professional privilege for tobacco companies in respect of civil disputes”.",SENATE,<title>JAMES HARDIE (INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-12-08,"—I am very pleased to offer my support for the government's James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. As we have already heard today, this bill is about equipping the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, with the powers necessary to ensure it gets access to all relevant information in James Hardie's possession so that it may undertake a thorough and effective investigation into matters arising out of the New South Wales special commission of inquiry into James Hardie and the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation. The bill, as the second reading speech outlines, will also facilitate proceedings that may arise from these investigations and may be brought by ASIC or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. I welcome these developments.
There is little doubt about the community's attitude towards companies that shirk their corporate responsibilities, towards companies that swindle victims by shifting assets offshore to avoid paying compensation and towards companies that seek to pervert investigations into their actions by preventing investigating authorities' access to documents in their possession. The case concerning James Hardie is a particularly clear one, and one that has rightly been at the centre of community concern and action for a number of years now. This is a company that has sought, through a number of different means, to avoid facing up to its corporate responsibilities and to avoid compensating its own victims—those living with diseases caused by the asbestos products that it, James Hardie, manufactured. This is a company that, throughout the proceedings of the NSW special commission of inquiry, sought to prevent access by the commission to documents in its possession. This bill ensures that such actions by James Hardie will not be possible in the pending ASIC and possible DPP investigations against it. 
As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech:
... the bill will expressly abrogate legal professional privilege in relation to certain materials, allowing their use in investigations of James Hardie and any related proceedings. This means that authorised persons, including ASIC and the DPP, will be able to obtain materials that would otherwise be subject to legal professional privilege and use them for the purposes of James Hardie investigations and proceedings.
As I have already said, I welcome this legislation. For a number of years now I have taken a keen and close interest in the James Hardie case and more particularly in the journey and the hard-fought fight by Hardie's victims of asbestos disease for the compensation they so rightly deserve and are owed by the company. I have spoken about the issues concerning asbestos related diseases and about James Hardie Industries numerous times in the Senate. In fact, I first raised my concerns about James Hardie's inadequate funding of the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation back in November 2003. 
Following that speech I received a letter from Mr Greg Baxter, the Executive Vice-President, Corporate Affairs, of James Hardie Industries, who sought to refute numerous claims I made in my speech. My speech referred to a number of quotes made by Mr Peter Gordon from the law firm Slater and Gordon in an advertorial featured in the Herald Sun on 25 November last year. In his letter dated 28 November 2003 Mr Baxter put to me:
Mr Gordon also claims that James Hardie set up a company with “clearly inadequate funding to deal with compensation...” This is also incorrect. The Foundation that was established by James Hardie was vested with all of the assets of the two former subsidiaries that had manufactured asbestos containing products, as well as an additional $90 million beyond any legal obligation owed by these subsidiaries. This additional amount enabled the Foundation to be established with assets that actuarial advice indicated would be sufficient to meet all expected future claims.
As I said subsequently, and I will repeat it today, what a joke of a claim that has proven to be. In February this year, the New South Wales Carr Labor government launched a special commission of inquiry into the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, the fund set up by James Hardie to compensate asbestos victims. At page 7 of his report, under section 1.4, Commissioner Jackson QC stated:
The Foundation's funds are being quickly used up in the payment of current claims against Amaca and Amaba—
the two subsidiary companies referred to by Mr Baxter in his letter to me—
In my opinion, they will be exhausted in the first half of 2007 and it has no prospect of meeting the liabilities of Amaca and Amaba in either the medium or the long term. 
Indeed, the commission of inquiry proved Mr Gordon's claims correct after all. In doing so the commission totally debunked Mr Baxter's claim and left him and his argument with no credibility whatsoever. Mr Baxter's letter, full of mistruths and disingenuous statements as it was, did indeed make one fair point. In closing Mr Baxter wrote in his letter:
We believe it is not only important that the facts about James Hardie and asbestos are widely known and well understood, we think it is also imperative that a comprehensive solution is developed to address the broader issues now confronting the wider community.
Well, indeed! Thank goodness the Carr Labor government set that course in train. We continue to wait for James Hardie to catch up to and to commit to the spirit of the conclusion contained in Mr Baxter's letter to me last year. Indeed, this legislation and other investigations will hopefully bring the company, kicking and screaming as it may be, to the party. The reason that this legislation is before the Senate and that community agitation about this issue has been so high for so long is obvious: asbestos is killing Australians in relatively large numbers. People are dying slow and painful deaths because of this product and the company that manufactured it. Any reasonable person can see that compensation is owed to affected parties. The legislation is part of a concerted effort to see that compensation is paid to those who deserve it.
Over the past 75 years, millions of Australians have been exposed to asbestos at work or through their jobs, at home, at schools and at many other public places around the country. More than 2,500 asbestos caused deaths occur in Australia each year now. Sadly, this number is on a steep incline and will continue on that course for some time. Due to the long latency period between the exposure to asbestos fibres and the manifestation of asbestos related diseases, which is often up to 30 years or more, the epidemic of these diseases is yet to peak in Australia. It is expected that this will occur in or around 2023, so we as a society and a community have another 20 or so years until we have hit the peak of the problem. As many as 45,000 persons, it is expected, may die from asbestos related diseases in Australia over the next two decades if effective medical treatments are not found.
Asbestos is the known cause of numerous diseases which include, but certainly cannot be limited to, the following: lung diseases, including asbestosis, pleural plaques and lung cancer; mesothelioma in a number of strands; cancer of the gastrointestinal tract; cancer of the larynx; cancer of the bowel; and from time to time other organs and systems are believed to be the sites of malignant change due to asbestos.
For the information of those who may be listening on radio and those unfamiliar with the history of this product, I would like to submit some background information about it to the Senate. Asbestos is a generic term applied to some mineral silicates of the serpentine and amphibole groups, whose characteristic feature is to crystallise in fibrous form. Until the late 1960s, Australian industry used both types of asbestos at rates of 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Subsequently, the use of chrysotile increased to approximately 95 per cent while the use of blue and grey asbestos declined to five per cent. Asbestos is one of the most useful and versatile minerals known to man, mainly because of its unique properties: flexibility, tensile strength, insulation from heat and electricity, and chemical inertness. It is the only natural mineral that can be spun and woven, like cotton or wool, into useful fibres and fabrics. Over the years, more than 3,000 asbestos products and their uses have been identified. 
Most Australian homes contain asbestos products in one form or another. Asbestos has been used in fencing, asbestos pipes, thermal insulation, fireproofing, paints and sealants, textiles such as felts and theatre curtains, gaskets, and in friction products such as brake linings and clutches. During the peak building years—the fifties, sixties and seventies—asbestos found its way into most public buildings, including hospitals, schools, libraries, office blocks and factories. Workplaces such as ships' engine rooms and power stations were heavily insulated with sprayed limpet asbestos. As such, asbestos diseases can no longer be considered as a problem isolated to the miners of the product. Occupational exposure to lethal asbestos among former workers of the asbestos manufacturing industry, government railways, electrical commissions, wharves, building industry, and Defence personnel in the Navy, Army and Air Force, is now producing lung cancers, mesothelioma, asbestosis and pleural diseases of quite significant proportions. Tragically, asbestos diseases not connected to occupation are also now emerging among those in the broader community.
James Hardie is a company highly responsible for this situation and it must be brought to account. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the hard work and dedication of the community sector and the trade union movement in forwarding us to this position today. The legislation before the Senate and the wider campaign against James Hardie would not have been possible if it were not for the tremendous work of victims and victims support groups, other non-government organisations, individual trade unions and the trade union movement more widely, or, indeed, the commitment of the New South Wales Carr Labor government. Other organisations and authorities, including numerous local governments and even state governments, through their plans to boycott James Hardie products, have made and will continue to make an impact on the company. I commend their actions. 
One other thing I would like to point out to the Senate is that James Hardie knew as a company the health risks of asbestos exposure as far back as the 1930s. People at James Hardie conspired to keep that a secret from the broader community and from health authorities for a generation. We should not only be seeking justice for those that have contracted asbestos related diseases; justice goes further than simply compensating the victims. What the government really needs to do is to look back to those people who conspired to keep the danger of asbestos from public knowledge for a generation, because it is those people who are ultimately responsible for the deaths that we are going to see—the agony and the pain that people are going to suffer—over the next 20, 30 and 40 years.
It is only through the concerted effort of all governments that this company will finally be brought, kicking and screaming, to the table and that all victims will have the chance of seeing the compensation they deserve and are owed. Again, I welcome the legislation before the Senate. I congratulate the government for it. I look forward to the investigations and proceedings to take place into James Hardie and its personnel in the not-too-distant future. Most importantly, I look forward to seeing all of James Hardie's victims adequately and fairly compensated.
Senator MURRAY (Western Australia) (6.48 p.m.)—I seek leave to incorporate Senator Andrew Bartlett's speech in the second reading debate on this bill.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>JAMES HARDIE (INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-08,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise today to speak to the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004.
This Bill abrogates legal professional principle from the James Hardie Group and their advisors in respect of the investigations surrounding the James Hardie restructure.
Like most Australians, I've been personally outraged by the conduct of James Hardie as it has been revealed in the Jackson Inquiry.
James Hardie was one of the major manufacturers of asbestos products that have been used in thousands of commercial and private buildings in Australia. Like the tobacco companies, they knew about the effect these products would have on the health of employees and on members of the wider community.
James Hardie through decades of improper conduct shirked their social and corporate responsibilities whilst earning massive profit from asbestos and its related products.
James Hardie defended its first asbestosis death case in Sydney in the 1930s. However, it was not until 1978, years after other companies had done so, that James Hardie put a warning on its asbestos products.
The Jackson Inquiry found that the fund established to pay asbestos claims, had, at 30 June 2004, assets of $179.2m but the estimate of future claims is about $1.5 billion in net present value terms.
The degree of impropriety of the Directors and Senior Management in separating James Hardie from the fund is still to be revealed. It seems clear that the NSW Courts have been defrauded and it is also obvious that James Hardie thought they could just walk away from their obligations without facing any sanctions. However, the Australian public and their Parliament will not let them get away with it.
We think James Hardie should fund its liabilities in full. This should be unconditional.
The Democrats will always support any legislation like this that will increase the prospect of real justice. It feels particularly important when the justice is for the victims of an insidious product like asbestos. We have all seen the terrible consequence of asbestosis. It's a horrific disease.
It puts into context the Australian Democrats record on corporate governance. We are committed to ensuring better insolvency laws so that artificial bankruptcy and company restructures can't be used to avoid legitimate debts.
In the past three years, the Democrats have participated in over 60 Parliamentary Reports and Committee Inquiries aimed at ensuring Australia has the toughest possible rules regulating corporate responsibility. The conduct of companies like HIH and James Hardie illustrates that, given the opportunity, some business people will try to bend laws and avoid their moral obligations.
By maintaining and toughening corporate governance rules the Democrats have minimised the opportunities for corporations to avoid their responsibilities. The Democrats believe that the companies that act inappropriately or illegally are in the minority. Australia's tough laws ensure that we generally have a high standard of corporate responsibility but there is more to do.”
The Democrats will spend the next three years of Parliament continuing their push for stronger corporate responsibility laws including:
	passing our Corporate Code of Conduct Bill which imposes environmental, human rights and labour standards on Australian companies overseas ;
	encouraging Australian companies to develop codes of ethics;
	greater disclosure of, and incentives for, ethically and socially responsible investments;
	greater disclosure of executive salary packages at the time they are negotiated, with shareholders given the power to veto the most excessive salaries;
	further improvements in the transparency of political donations;
	the requirement to declare if Directors are subject to patronage; and
	better insolvency laws so that artificial bankruptcy and company restructures can't be used to avoid legitimate debts. 
The Democrats corporate responsibility achievements in the Senate include:
	Laws that requires companies to disclose their impact on the environment;
	the toughest possible standards of corporate governance and company disclosures;
	improved tax concessions for charities and the not-for-profit sector;
	the promotion of family friendly work practices including paid maternity leave;
	maintaining laws protecting against unfair dismissals;
	laws that allows superannuation members to chose ethical investments;
	laws that requires fund managers to publicly prove they are `ethical'.
Tough and responsible laws that ensure Australian companies, and their directors, are kept honest never get much publicity but, in so many ways, they are far more important than the easy task of public grandstanding and corporate-bashing.
We have affirmed they would support any changes to Federal or State laws that were identified by the report of the Commission of Inquiry into James Hardie and our intention to provide full political and parliamentary support for the victims of James Hardie to ensure they receive full compensation and justice.
The Party also decided to back this up with financial support to help the campaign of the asbestos victims. The Australian Democrats have committed to giving financial support to help the victims of James Hardie and that will occur as soon as possible. The party has debts arising from the federal election. We have prioritised available funds towards debts we have a legal obligation to pay and will make all other payments, including a donation to an asbestos victims organisation, as soon as sufficient funds become available in the new year.
The Australian Democrats have the strongest record on lifting the standards for corporate responsibility and keep the rogue elements of the business community in check, without creating unnecessary constraints on the vast majority of businesses who do the right thing,
We used our links with The Netherlands Parliament and Government to increase the pressure on James Hardie Industries to meet its obligations to the many workers affected by asbestos by having questions asked by a member of the Democrats party in the Netherlands.
This government should take up the recommendations and the findings of the Jackson inquiry in New South Wales and fix the problems in the Corporations Law that allow James Hardie to walk away from their obligations to workers and their families in this country.
The Democrats will be supporting the Bill. We have introduced a second reading amendment that calls on the Government to extend the concept of the removal of legal professional privilege to tobacco companies.",SENATE,<title>JAMES HARDIE (INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-08,"—Last week was the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster. It is often described as the worst industrial accident in history. It was in fact a corporate crime of enormous magnitude—a crime that continues now with Union Carbide and its parent company, Dow Chemical, attempting to avoid liabilities to the victims of Bhopal. 
The James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004 we are debating today seeks to address another terrible corporate crime—a corporate crime that has affected thousands of Australians and will continue to affect many more into the future. Unlike the Bhopal disaster, James Hardie's negligence did not happen in one day; it is a creeping, silent crime that has affected workers and their families across the country and it is a crime that has continued over decades.
The Greens support this bill because it will allow ASIC and the DPP to access materials obtained by the New South Wales commission of inquiry that would otherwise be subject to legal professional privilege and then to use those documents to investigate whether James Hardie has breached the Corporations Act. Any action that can be taken to ensure James Hardie is brought to justice will be supported by the Greens.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2004-12-08,"—In my adjournment speech tonight I wish to outline just a little of Australia's contribution to rebuilding Iraq. In doing so, I would like to read from an email forwarded to me by the Western Australian President of the Australian-American Friendship Group in Western Australia. The email is from a Mr Ray Reynolds, who is apparently a medic in the Iowa Army National Guard currently serving in Iraq, and Mr Reynolds appears to be feeling somewhat jaded and disenfranchised as he writes:
As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They—
that is, the media—
have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened. I am sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two week leave back home. And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I would pass this on to you. This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that your paper is producing.)
	Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations.
	School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war.
	Over 1,500 schools have been renovated and rid of the weapons stored there so education can occur.
	The port of Umm Qasr was renovated so grain can be offloaded from ships faster.
	The country had its first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August.
	Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time ever in Iraq.
	The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before the war.
	100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed, compared to 35% before the war.
	Elections are taking place in every major city, and city councils are in place.
	Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city.
	Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets.
	Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defence police are securing the country.
	Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side with US soldiers.
	Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever.
	Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs.
	An interim constitution has been signed.
	Girls are allowed to attend school.
	Textbooks that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years.
Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about but they hope their children will. We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these facts. If you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening. 
It is signed:
Ray Reynolds, SFC Iowa Army National Guard
234th Signal Battalion
Being a somewhat ageing politician, I am not going to stand here and swear that somewhere in Iraq is a Ray Reynolds, completing the last few weeks of his tour of duty with the Iowa Army National Guard. Maybe there is, maybe not—that is what I thought. But I will stand here and say that I forwarded the letter to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia and asked for validation of Mr Reynolds's claims and was assured of the genuineness of the claims in that email.
The department was also kind enough to supply me with some further data regarding Australia's specific contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq:
Australia has committed $126m to Iraq's rehabilitation and reconstruction:
	We have deployed over 30 technical experts to assist in reestablishment of Government services and return of a sovereign Iraq Government since March 2003
	committed $45m to reconstruction priorities, with a particular focus on rehabilitation of agriculture sector and food security
	directed assistance to improve water/sanitation, food supply/distribution, donor coordination, economic management, legal, oil and defence policy, capacity training for police and officials from the Trade, Foreign Affairs and Agriculture ministries and war crimes investigations
	we have allocated $25m to UN and World Bank trust funds (including approx. $5m for elections assistance)
I am here to tell you, Mr Deputy President, at first hand that the coalition's intervention in Iraq has had positive outcomes for which the people of Iraq are very grateful. The data goes on:
	the Coalition of the Willing has put an end to Saddam's continuing defiance of the UN Security Council's demands that Iraq verifiably terminate its illegal WMD and long-range missile programs
	the Coalition of the Willing has ended Saddam's sponsorship of terrorism in the Middle East, and
	the Coalition of the Willing has ended Saddam's reign of terror and has given Iraqis the hope of a democratic future
I feel very comfortable standing here telling you of these things, Mr Deputy President, because I have been to Iraq and I have personally witnessed these outcomes and the result of the outcomes. I have witnessed the girls all over Iraq going back to school. I have seen some of the rebuilding of the 2,500 schools that are now teaching over six million children. I have visited Sulaimaniya University, where the staff rejoice at their new found freedom to impart knowledge, as they always intended to do, free now from the constraints of life under the evil and prolonged dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. And as a result of the involvement of the coalition of the willing and the contribution of the Australian government, all the universities in Iraq are open for business.
With respect to human rights and the judiciary, I was able to see how Iraqis enjoy unprecedented freedoms of expression, movement, assembly and religion. Iraqi women now have rights, and minorities are protected. An independent judiciary and human rights ministry has been established, and 260 mass graves have been identified.
With respect to health, education and employment, young Ray Reynolds, the medic in the Iowa Army National Guard, is correct—a vaccination campaign recently completed reached over 90 per cent of all Iraqi children. And he is correct about the role of the coalition in assisting Iraq on its path to democracy and political transition. In August, an interim national council was elected to oversee the work of the Iraqi interim government. Preparations, with the support of the UN, are currently under way for the elections in just a few weeks time, and more than 600 core personnel are now employed by the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq. Iraqis are registering to vote in all of the 85 per cent of voter registration centres that are now open. 
It was my great pleasure earlier this week to welcome the newly appointed Iraqi Ambassador to Australia, Mr Ghanim al-Shibli, to the inaugural meeting of an informal Australian-Iraqi parliamentary friendship group. Nearly 50 colleagues have expressed interest in this group, which is expected to be formally recognised following the establishment of the new Iraqi parliament as a consequence of January's elections.
Young Ray Reynolds is right: the real story of what is happening in Iraq—the advances that are being made, the freedoms that have been restored, the evil that has been ousted—is not being told at home. There is too much of a focus on the outrages that are still being committed. Yes, `still' being committed, not being committed because of the coalition's presence in Iraq, because outrages such as we have recently seen went on for years under Saddam Hussein and a few have continued to be perpetrated by Saddam's outlaw remnant forces. It is these outrages that have drawn the attention of the media, not the fact that the kids are going to school and whole townships now have electricity, potable water and basic sewerage; not the fact that there are no freshly dug mass graves and that every day represents another step along the path to a free and democratic Iraq. None of that appears to be newsworthy.
What Australia and Australian personnel are doing in Iraq and for Iraq is a reason for great pride. Wherever you are, Mr Ray Reynolds, may I wish you a merry Christmas. Keep up the good work. I and many of my fellow Australians are aware of, grateful for and respectful of your contribution and that of your nation to a better Iraq and thus a better world. May I take this opportunity to send that Christmas message to our own troops and service personnel who are serving in Iraq and other parts of the world. It is a better world because our troops are doing just that.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Adjournment,33,1
