"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-08-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:35):  Mr Deputy President Marshall, it is a pleasure to see you in the chair again.


I would like to indicate my support for this bill. And I do share the concerns of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Milne, in relation to private members' time—it has been hard fought for. I think there are broader issues about question time as well. With a record number of crossbenchers, we need to have a fairer system in place so that crossbenchers can fairly participate in the debates in this chamber and the processes of this chamber, including question time and private members' time. I look forward to discussing that with my colleagues and with the whips of the major parties as well, so that we can head off some of the problems that are emerging.


In relation to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, I indicate my support for this bill. I will also be supporting the amendments proposed by both the Australian Greens and the opposition, in the sense that they are relatively similar and I believe either option will be an improvement to this bill. In particular, I want to express my support for the amendments proposing greater scrutiny of projects over a certain monetary threshold. I believe this is an important amendment and will help to ensure accountability and transparency. I also want to acknowledge the good work that the infrastructure assistant minister, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, has done. I think that what he has said about ensuring value for money on road projects is refreshing; I think that that is actually a good initiative on his part and, if he is successful, as I hope he will be, in improving the processes and the value-for-money criteria, then he will be doing this country a great service. But I also think that having greater accountability and transparency in respect of road funding is a good thing.


I will keep my remarks brief because time is of the essence when it comes to this bill. It has already been delayed, which is of significant concern to local councils, and further delays could jeopardise funding for vital projects, particularly in respect of Roads to Recovery. I acknowledge the many, many phone calls and text messages I have exchanged with Felicity-ann Lewis, the President of the Australian Local Government Association, from South Australia, who is doing a great job. I pay tribute to her persistence, to her interest and to her advocacy in respect of this issue on behalf of local government. I think all of my colleagues in this place are supportive of the Roads to Recovery program and want to see it extended, given that the previous funding ended in June and that some councils have begun new projects based on promises that the funding would continue. We must ensure this legislation passes as a matter of urgency. However, I do want to address a fundamental inequality in the way that funds are allocated. 


South Australian local government currently manages 11 per cent, or 75,000 kilometres, of the nation's local road network and receives just 5.5 per cent of identified local roads grant funding, despite the fact that South Australia has about 7.2 per cent of the nation's population. As such, South Australia receives the lowest funding per capita of all states and territories, at just $23.23 per capita. South Australia also has the lowest funding spent per kilometre, with Queensland and Western Australia receiving almost twice as much. Victoria receives 2.25 times as much funding. New South Wales gets nearly three times as much. By contrast, Tasmania, which has about two per cent of Australia's population, receives $72.40 per capita, over five times the funding to South Australia. 


To address this inequality, the supplementary local road fund was established; but, despite the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, this supplementary account, which would have brought South Australia up to 7.9 per cent of the fund—an improvement but still not quite good enough—has not been included in the current budget, and that is fundamentally wrong. I urge the Hon. Jamie Briggs, the assistant minister for infrastructure, and the Hon. Christopher Pyne, the most senior South Australian in the cabinet, to fight for South Australia in the same way that Nick Minchin, Alexander Downer and Amanda Vanstone fought for South Australia when they were in the cabinet. I just hope that they have the same level of resolve when it comes to their home state of South Australia.


What this means is that South Australian councils will miss out on about $18 million for 2014-15, with some individual councils missing out on as much as $1 million each. So, while I support this bill, I call on the government to renew their commitment to infrastructure by reinstating the supplementary fund or at least by reallocating the existing funds on a more equitable basis. Improving Australia's roads needs a national approach, and funding should be fairly distributed across the country. 


As I said, I support this bill. I look forward to debating the amendments in the committee stage but I want to make it clear that, whilst I support the opposition's and the Greens' amendments in terms of improving transparency and accountability, I do not want to see this bill ultimately delayed; I want to make sure that the funding for the Roads to Recovery program is flowing by next week. We cannot afford to have gridlock on a program that is obviously urgent, a program that both sides, both major parties, support. If we do not get the funding flowing by next week, then we are showing signs of that malaise, that gridlock, which has been so toxic in American politics. Let us not bring that to our shores.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (09:41):  I thank all senators for their contributions on this important piece of legislation, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, particularly Senator Xenophon. The government are committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, and the changes in the bill will help us achieve the recently announced budget infrastructure initiatives.


The amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are sensible and necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. The bill provides funding certainty—funding that is critical to local government by continuing the vitally important Roads to Recovery program. The Roads to Recovery program, as many of us here know, lapsed on 30 June 2014. No payments can be made to local governments until this bill has passed, although we have committed $2.1 billion over the next five years to the program, including a doubling of funding to each and every council in the 2015-16 financial year. That is what is at stake with this legislation. 


The current nation building act, established by the former minister, Mr Anthony Albanese, made no provision for the Roads to Recovery program to continue beyond 30 June. The shadow spokesperson for infrastructure claims to be committed to local government and to this program, but he has failed local government by failing to provide for this vital program to continue on his watch. Without the passage of this bill, local councils stand to lose the $2.1 billion that I referred to in funding for this vital Roads to Recovery program. 


The opposition spared no time in criticising the government's decision to pause the indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local government for three years to help bring the budget back to surplus. This was a decision not taken lightly by the government. It is no secret that everyone is contributing to fix the economic mess left by the previous, Labor government. Australia's debt is already costing us billions of dollars in interest payments. This year alone, we are paying $12 billion in interest costs. Wouldn't it be nice if this could go to local councils as more funding through Financial Assistance Grants or to the Roads to Recovery program? But it cannot—a lost opportunity because of the reckless mismanagement by those opposite. 


Labor failed to come clean with councils about their own agenda to block the flow of the $2.1 billion that I mentioned to local councils for the upkeep of their local roads—money that local councils completely rely upon. If the opposition were serious about local council funding, they would not have voted against this bill in the House of Representatives. I say that again for the benefit of those listening to us: if Labor were serious and honest with the Australian public, they would not have voted against the bill in the House of Representatives, which is what they did.


During the winter recess we saw Labor claim that this program has been held up by the government's actions. But both Labor and their allies the Greens are yet to support the bill. In fact, as I have said, they voted against it in the House of Representatives yet were unable to point to one single element of the bill that, in their view, was unacceptable. It was just plain old deliberate obstructionism. They were playing politics—and they continue to do so.


The primary intent of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—which Mr Albanese failed to provide for when he was the minister, creating an expiration date of 30 June 2014. That is why we are in the problem we are in. Mr Albanese proposes a private member's bill to fix the problem. Let us not forget that the shadow spokesperson is on record as saying legislation is not needed for the program. This private member's bill, which the government has not yet seen or been consulted on, is a media stunt to respond to the outrage expressed by local councils right across Australia. Again, this is clear evidence that the Labor Party are just plain playing politics. We know it is a media stunt because Mr Albanese attempted to suspend standing orders in the House on Tuesday to introduce a bill but actually had no paperwork to back it up. The Australian public, local councils and this Senate chamber have now seen exactly what he stands for—legislation by media release and nothing more. He made Labor vote against the bill in the House, and local councils around Australia were understandably outraged. The only way the Labor Party and the shadow minister can save any face is to talk of introducing his own legislation to save the program. If he now accepts that legislation is necessary, he should quit the theatrics and the politicking and support the government's legislation.


Labor has also been claiming that the bill contains amendments that are unacceptable to the opposition. Yet the main purpose of the bill is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—the bill that they themselves voted against in the House without being able to point to one single clause, paragraph or enactment of a bill that is now described as unacceptable. The bill also changes the name of the act to remove the politicisation of the Infrastructure Investment Program from within the act. Mr Albanese seems desperate to preserve his legacy and is playing a childish tactic of attempting to ensure that the name 'Nation Building Program', which he gave to this act, is retained. What he is doing right now, with roads running into disrepair, is the complete opposite of what he wants to call the bill.


The government has also included a few other minor amendments in the bill to reduce duplication, to streamline the operation of the act and to reduce red tape consistent with our red tape reduction agenda. The amendments proposed by the opposition in the Senate, which the government deems unacceptable, include wanting to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program in the act. These projects are already funded under the act and budgeted for and, as such, including a new separate part is a completely unnecessary duplication. Mr Albanese has briefed the crossbench that, unless the heavy vehicle program is named specifically in legislation, it will not continue. Let's be clear, this government is committed to that program and is spending more on the heavy vehicle program than Labor ever did. The budget papers clearly demonstrate this. Mr Albanese himself did not find it necessary to make significant amendments when he corrected the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. He did one minor thing at that time. He only changed the definition of 'road' in legislation because that is all that was needed to establish the program. So why is he now proposing eight pages of amendments just on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program?


Labor and the Greens also want to complicate and inappropriately create an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill when in fact this act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements of Infrastructure Australia. This clearly makes no sense. If Labor was serious about looking after local councils and cutting red tape, it would simply pass the bill unamended. I ask Labor to point to just one aspect of the bill that is unacceptable. This is a simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program and to fund our local government authorities for that purpose—to change the name of the bill and to tidy up other aspects of the act consistent with the government's red tape reduction agenda. That is all that it does.


It is true that we were forced to withdraw the legislation from the Senate in the final sitting of parliament before the winter recess because it was clear that it would not have passed without major unacceptable amendments proposed by Labor and their allies the Greens. Many of the proposed amendments are unacceptable to the coalition as they are either not directly relevant to the bill or will add needless bureaucracy and red tape to the operation of programs for local councils.


Today we are hopeful that Labor and Greens senators will do the right thing by local councils and the right thing by the communities within those councils. As a government we will continue to stand up for local communities rather than playing petty games which affect the everyday lives of commuters, particularly on roads in regional Australia. The bill reinserts a power for the minister to determine the Roads to Recovery list, which is essential for the program to be able to function. This power was removed from the act when it was amended in 2009 by the previous Labor government. Clearly, the opposition had little tolerance for the Roads to Recovery program.


The bill renames the act to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the Land Transport Infrastructure Funding Program. This means that when a funding program ends or its name changes in the future there will no longer be a need to amend the legislation and it will therefore be a reduction in the administrative burden. This removes the politics from the act. The opposition has claimed the bill was entirely about removing the nation-building branding of the former government and nothing more. This government is about substance and certainly not slogans. The bill is needed to extend the Roads to Recovery Act and that is what we are trying to do with this quite simple and straightforward piece of legislation.


I urge the crossbenchers to think very carefully about the way they will vote on the amendments particularly. You can vote to continue the Roads to Recovery program, which I trust that you will do, by rejecting the amendments proposed by Labor and the Greens. Local government will certainly thank you for that. The government will thank you for that. We will not have to see the unnecessary toing and froing of the bill and we will guarantee the much needed funding flowing expeditiously to local governments so they can manage their roads properly and safely. Alternatively, you could vote to support the various amendments by the Labor Party and the Greens, but you will be alone in doing so and will contribute to the uncertainty that now confronts local governments and local authorities as to where they are going to get their funding to do the road maintenance that their communities so desperately need.


Let me be very clear. As I have said, this is a very simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program, to change the name of the legislation, and to tidy up some small and other aspects of the act consistent with our red-tape reduction agenda, and that is all it does. Why is that so offensive? Why has that become so controversial? This bill simply amends the act which was in place under Mr Albanese. Mr Albanese did not see it necessary to add a separate section on heavy vehicle projects. Mr Albanese did not have a so-called transparency clause that makes the minister direct Infrastructure Australia and his department, but then Mr Albanese did not have a transparent Infrastructure Australia either, and he funded many, many projects that came nowhere near Infrastructure Australia's priority list and ignored others on that priority list. Mr Albanese says that the government has no new projects. If the government has no new projects, why does he now insist on Infrastructure Australia assessing all the projects he previously committed to? Is he doubting whether he chose projects that do not demonstrate value for money?


The two major areas where Labor and the Greens will seek to add to the bill are in relation to Infrastructure Australia's functions and in relation to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I want to be very clear: the Australian government stand by their promise to ensure infrastructure projects over $100 million are assessed by Infrastructure Australia, and Infrastructure Australia will publish its justification for recommending projects for government funding. We will be introducing amendments in the house that specifically deal with this, and I am on the record to say precisely that. There is no need to delay funding to local councils for Roads to Recovery by attempting to create additional roles for Infrastructure Australia in this bill. They should be in the Infrastructure Australia Act where, of course, we all know they belong.


We are also committed to heavy vehicle safety. We agree that the program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program created by the Labor Party, is an important and successful program for heavy vehicle safety. In fact, we were so impressed with their program that we are extending it and providing more money for it than they ever, in fact, did. The coalition government are also helping those in the heavy vehicle sector by providing an enormous program of works, the largest infrastructure program ever to ensure safer roads for use by heavy vehicles and those that share the roads with them. Let me list a small sample of other initiatives that the government are pursuing to improve heavy vehicle safety. Firstly, a review of the National Heavy Vehicle Accreditation Scheme and of heavy vehicle inspection regimes. Secondly, mandatory load proportioning or anti-lock braking systems for all model prime movers. Thirdly, state, territory and Commonwealth governments are working collaboratively with industry to determine research and trials for the next generation of braking control systems.


In relation to heavy vehicle safety, may I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Ricky Muir who over recent weeks has been instrumental in seeking continued government support for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I pause to congratulate him on that very important contribution. My home state of Western Australia with B-doubles and very heavy vehicles certainly appreciates that input. It is a measure of the importance of this program for the Australian community that it attracts support from others in this chamber, and it is refreshing to talk to senators in this chamber who are willing to work constructively to secure clear and positive outcomes that benefit all Australians. Senator Muir, well done.


In summary, the bill streamlines and enhances the operation of the act to the benefit of states, territories and the Commonwealth by removing unnecessary duplication. It provides clarity with one set of funding conditions and approval processes for the majority of projects funded under the act. The bill also assists the government's deregulation agenda by repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. There are no regulatory or financial impacts on businesses, or on the not-for-profit sector, from the amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, or from the repeal of the spent legislation. The bill is compatible with human rights as it does not raise any human rights issues.


The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry on 6 March 2014. The committee's report, which came down on 24 March, supported the legislation in its current form. So, let's talk no more of seeking to divert the parliament's course of providing strong funding for local governments and actually delivering on that funding. We have suspended private member's business today, not lightly, but with due consideration to the fact that local councils are desperately needing this money.


I commend the bill to the house. I commend this bill to all senators, and I urge you to think about those communities that need the support of their councils and their councils' funding to deal with this roads issue. I thank the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2014-08-28,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:07):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7495 revised:


(5) Schedule 1, item 14, page 7 (after line 21), after section 4A, insert:




4B


Consultation with Infrastructure Australia



(1) This section applies to:


   (a) a Black Spot Project; or


   (b) a Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Project; or


   (c) an Investment Project; or


   (d) a Transport Development and Innovation Project.


(2) Before the Minister approves the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project, the Minister must, if capital expenditure on the project is $50 million or more, require Infrastructure Australia to give to the Minister an evaluation of the project so that the Minister can decide whether to approve the project.


(3) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project under subsection (2) must:


   (a) contain a cost benefit analysis of the project; and


   (b) specify the priority that Infrastructure Australia would give the project in relation to priorities specified in its current Infrastructure Plan; and


   (c) set out any other matter that Infrastructure Australia considers relevant to the project.


(4) In determining whether to approve the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project (irrespective of whether capital expenditure on the project is less than, equal to or more than $50 million), the Minister must have regard to:


   (a) Infrastructure Priority Lists and Infrastructure Plans developed by Infrastructure Australia under the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to the extent relevant to the project; and


   (b) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project under subsection (2) (if applicable);


   (c) any other advice given by Infrastructure Australia that relates to the project.


(5) Subsection (4) does not limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard in determining whether to approve the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project.




4C


Cost benefit analyses to be made public



(1) The Minister must ensure that the following information about a Black Spot Project, Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Project, Investment Project or Transport Development and Innovation Project is made available on the Department's website, if Commonwealth funding is provided for the project:


   (a) a description of the project;


   (b) when the project is to start and is likely to be completed;


   (c) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project under subsection 4B(2) (if applicable);


   (d) any advice given by Infrastructure Australia in relation to the project as mentioned in paragraph 4B(4)(c).


(2) The information must be published no later than 14 days after the Commonwealth first informs a recipient of the funding that Commonwealth funding will be provided for the project.


(6) Schedule 1, item 14, page 7, after proposed section 4C, insert:




4D


Cost benefit analyses of other projects



(1) Infrastructure Australia must give to the Minister a cost benefit analysis of a land transport infrastructure project if:


   (a) Commonwealth funding is provided for the project (under this Act or any other law) on or after the commencement of this section (whether the provision of the funding was agreed to, approved or announced before, on or after that commencement); and


   (b) capital expenditure on the project is $50 million or more; and


   (c) Infrastructure Australia is not required to give a cost benefit analysis of the project to the Minister under another provision of this Act.


(2) The Minister must ensure that the cost benefit analysis is made available on the Department's website.


These amendments amend the bill so that for any project of $50 million or more in capital expenditure, the minister must have regard to the Infrastructure Australia evaluation of the project. The evaluation of the project must include a cost-benefit analysis, the priority of the project as per Infrastructure Australia's infrastructure plan and any other relevant matter, and the evaluation must be made available on the department's website. If there is any Commonwealth funding for the project, the department website must make information available with the description of the project, time lines, the advice by the Infrastructure Australia and the evaluation. 


We have suggested the $50 million benchmark because this was the benchmark that was in the recommendation of the Productivity Commission report in the public infrastructure, which was undertaken this year. In the report, they stated:


All governments should commit to subjecting all public infrastructure investment proposals above $50 million to rigorous cost–benefit analyses that are publicly released …


We think that moving these amendments to this bill is a very good opportunity to put this recommendation into legislation. Accountability and making sure that investment in transport infrastructure is cost-effective is incredibly important because, when you are investing in transport, we have got a limited budget. We have got to make sure that they are being spent in the most appropriate way possible. That is what this amendment is seeking to achieve with these important investments that are going to be made into our transport infrastructure.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:09):  Labor opposes Green's amendment (5). Labor has opposition amendment (7), which is a copy with slight changes. Labor supports $100 million as the mandatory threshold for Infrastructure Australia evaluation. Black spots, heavy vehicles and transport innovation projects are never anywhere near $50 million, let alone $100 million. The $50 million is almost the entire annual allocation to these entire programs, let alone individual projects. This is the point that the government has made and which the opposition has accepted in drafting this alternative amendment. Labor supports the majority of the content in principle but we prefer our amendment. 


The transparency provision proposed new (4c) is the same as opposition (5). We prefer that amendment and we will vote accordingly. In relation to Greens amendment (6), Labor does not support it but agrees with its intent. However, the amendment appears to duplicate other provisions and is not clearly drafted. Labor has an alternative amendment relating to Infrastructure Australia's assessments or projects which it will support.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:11):  As is my practice, I would like to commence by setting out what the government's voting intentions are. I am very pleased to hear that the opposition are opposing the Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7495. The bad news is that opposition amendments (5) and (7) will also be opposed by the government. 


In my summing-up, I think I set out the significance of why we are opposed to that, and Senator Cameron has gone a long way towards setting out very good reasons why Greens amendment (5) should be opposed. The amendments require the minister—in talking about the broad thrust of all of the amendments, (5) and (7) of the opposition's also—to consult with Infrastructure Australia prior to approving a project under the act, including Infrastructure Australia providing an evaluation for projects with a capital expenditure of $100 million or more. The evaluation is to include a cost-benefit analysis of the program. 


Interestingly, the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill, recently passed, had a mechanism that would have enabled Infrastructure Australia to provide advice on projects over the $100 million threshold, but the amendments moved by the opposition and the Greens actually delete it. They did not want the minister to have directional powers over Infrastructure Australia. Yet, in order to achieve the outcome that they want here, the opposition and the Greens require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia to give him information. 


We need to be clear—either it is acceptable for the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia or it is not. The amendments that are being proposed here require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia. Having said that and having spelt out the reasons for our opposition, I confirm again that we will be opposed to each of these Greens amendments as similar as they are to opposition amendments (5) and (7) on sheet 7477.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:13):  I had a question regarding this for Senator Johnston. In terms of the cost-benefit analysis and the inclusion of that in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill—given the importance of the cost-benefit analysis, the commitment to the cost-benefit analysis for projects over $100 million, what really is the problem with including it in this bill? The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill is an overarching bill pulling together funding for transport. I really cannot see the problem of including the cost-benefit analysis in this bill. It really seems to fit here and this is where it belongs.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2014-08-28,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:17):  I move amendment (7) on sheet 7495:


Schedule 1, item 20, page 9 (line 9), omit ""or safety"", substitute "", safety, integration or environmental sustainability"".


This amendment incorporates into the purposes of what is to be funded whether it is appropriate to approve a project. There is a whole list of criteria currently in the bill, matters to which the minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an investment project. One of them, in the existing proposed bill, is the extent to which the project would improve the efficiency, security or safety of transport operations. This amendment would change that so that it became 'efficiency, security, safety, integration of environmental sustainability' of transport operations—so, including the terms 'integration' and 'environmental sustainability'.


We think this would bring it into line with what is basically standard practice across the country and would reflect all economic, social and environmental criteria. For example, the Victorian Transport Integration Act has a vision statement that says that the aspiration of Victorians for an integrated and sustainable transport system is that it contributes to an inclusive, prosperous and environmentally responsible state. I think including those things—transport integration, making sure that our transport systems are working effectively together, all supporting each other—is a very important concept when you are talking about what we should be investing in for transport. And environmental sustainability, as part of a trio of looking at environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social responsibility, really should be there in the purposes for any investment in transport infrastructure.

When you introduce phrases like that into the day-to-day administration of what should be a simple funding regime, as this bill seeks to do, you really do open a bit of a Pandora's box in terms of administration on the ground and in terms of budgetary positions and compliance issues. These phrases now, rightly or wrongly—and I do not criticise the importance of them—do carry with them some responsibility to get things right. All I am saying is that in this instance this is inappropriate. It makes it more complex to administer. And I do not think that is what we are about.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:21):  Again, I would have thought that the responsibility to get things right in terms of where you are putting your transport investment dollars is something that any legislation should be doing. So, I wonder what problems the government has with that responsibility to get things right and making sure that the investment in transport is being spent in the most effective way in terms of economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and social issues.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:22):  I am advised that in section 11 of the bill says:


The matters to which the Minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an Investment Project include, but are not limited to, the following matters:


…   …   …


(c) the results of any assessment of the economic, environmental or social costs or benefits of the project;


The point about that is that by injecting this in where you want to do so, I think you are substantially adding a cost burden to the assessment of these programs.

17A


Consultation with Infrastructure Australia



(1) This section applies to an Investment Project, if capital expenditure on the project is $100 million or more.


(2) Before the Minister approves the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project, the Minister must require Infrastructure Australia to give to the Minister an evaluation of the project so that the Minister can decide whether to approve the project.


(3) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project must:


   (a) contain a cost benefit analysis of the project; and


   (b) specify the priority that Infrastructure Australia would give the project in relation to priorities specified in its current Infrastructure Plan; and


(c) set out any other matter that Infrastructure Australia considers relevant to the project.


(4) In determining whether to approve the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project, the Minister must have regard to:


   (a) Infrastructure Priority Lists and Infrastructure Plans developed by Infrastructure Australia under the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to the extent relevant to the project; and


   (b) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project under subsection (2); and


(c) any other advice given by Infrastructure Australia that relates to the project.


(5) Subsection (4) does not limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard in determining whether to approve the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project.




27B


Subsection


18(1)



   Omit ""a Nation Building Program National"", substitute ""an Investment"".


Opposition amendments (5) and (7) go to amend the issue of prior consultation with the experts at Infrastructure Australia. It is about transparency of advice to government. We believe this is an important element that is central to the much-called-for proper governance in project selection. The Land Transport Infrastructure Act is the sole enabling act that governs the terms under which the infrastructure minister can authorise expenditure of Commonwealth funds on road and rail projects. No other act does this—certainly not the Infrastructure Australia Act, which has a different purpose.


The Infrastructure Australia Act establishes a body of experts who provide advice to government on infrastructure policy and projects. Infrastructure Australia looks at energy and water as well. It looks at best practice project procurement, it looks at what the nation lacks and suggests what it needs, and it flags future needs, assesses project value and flags emerging issues in the sector. It primarily has a strategic focus.


We believe this is an appropriate amendment. There is no reason to expect that a government seeking to amend the act will return to this parliament in the next six years. This is the only time the Senate will have a certain chance to ensure that ministers must seek expert advice from Infrastructure Australia before spending on road and rail projects valued at more than $100 million.


Item seven requires the minister to require an evaluation by Infrastructure Australia prior to approving funds for an infrastructure investment project valued at more than $100 million. Such an evaluation needs to include a cost-benefit analysis, Infrastructure Australia's view on project priority and other views Infrastructure Australia considers relevant. Item five provides that if the project is funded the evaluation must be published on the department's website for all taxpayers to see, within 14 days of notice of funding. The amendment is consistent with the Productivity Commission's call for much-improved infrastructure projects selection, assessment and transparency. 


These amendments implement explicit coalition election policy. The coalition had policy about these issues—that is, transparency and cost-benefit analyses. We want to ensure that that promise is not broken, that it does not become another broken government promise. It certainly is about ensuring we do not have the pork-barrelling that has been used in the past by the coalition, using scarce taxpayers money.


This aligns with the government's election commitments on infrastructure as elucidated in the coalition's policy to deliver the infrastructure for the 21st century. What it says in the coalition policy is that to ensure more rigorous, transparent assessment of taxpayer-funded projects we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis. Labor's amendment here does nothing more than implement the exact commitment the coalition made to the Australian people at last year's election. We would expect the coalition to abide by that election promise and support these amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:27):  This amendment purports to give Infrastructure Australia powers to evaluate specific projects that are not appropriate for inclusion in this bill. This is not the enabling legislation for Infrastructure Australia's functions. The Infrastructure Australia legislation has a section on responsibilities, which Labor and the Greens recently passed. Now they wish to make what appears to the government to be a back-door amendment to Infrastructure Australia's powers and, interestingly, to provide the minister with powers of direction over Infrastructure Australia. The 17A heading is 'Consultation with Infrastructure Australia'. The opposition should acknowledge that the heading should say 'Ministerial Directions over Infrastructure Australia', because that is exactly what this amendment is seeking to achieve. It is terribly unclear, may I say, in furtherance of what I have already said, what matters should be included in this evaluation that the opposition is proposing.


The provision would need to prescribe the matters that must be covered in an evaluation, as those matters are not specified in the Infrastructure Australia Act, for the purposes of the general evaluation function—that is, it needs to be made clear what is the intended relationship with the scheme for evaluations under the Infrastructure Australia Act. This amendment does not even go close to doing anything like that. So it is inappropriate that any provisions purporting to give Infrastructure Australia power should be provided for in this bill, which has a completely different purpose, as I have sought to establish.


The correct place for provisions relating to Infrastructure Australia functions and powers is in its own enabling legislation. The opposition stated that it wishes the government to stand by its election commitment, and has repeated that again this morning, and on Infrastructure Australia assessing proposals of over $100 million. To ensure the government does this, it proposed amendments to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. The government said:


The government will require all Commonwealth-funded projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia to ensure the best use of available taxpayer monies.


We will require Infrastructure Australia to publish justifications for all its project recommendations.


That is what we promised to the people at the last election, and we stand by that.


It is important that this bill not be further delayed by the undermining tactics of this amendment. The opposition had the opportunity to include these changes and those relating to the heavy vehicle program when in government. The question must be asked: it was just 12 months ago that the opposition had the capacity to make these amendments to this bill, so why did they not do so?


Under the former minister, Infrastructure Australia had no independence and simply prioritised projects based on how developed a business case was and not on whether it had any sustainable merit. The former government did not apply this government's level of transparency to their investments. There is no better example than that there was no cost-benefit analysis done for the NBN, the biggest single infrastructure project in Australia's history. After designing their plans for the NBN on the back of a beer coaster, Labor initially told us that the NBN would cost $43 billion and then revised it up to $44 billion. But the NBN strategic review, released in December last year, showed that the network would actually cost $73 billion.


Let's be very clear: we do not want to hold up money, vital resources and funding from going to local governments any longer. Let's just let this bill do what it clearly sets out to do, and that is to fund the Roads to Recovery program.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:31):  I have to respond to some of the issues that Senator Johnston has raised. First of all, let's be clear about the delays to this bill. The government itself delayed this bill coming to the Senate for 155 days. The bill passed the lower house on 24 March and it was not brought here until yesterday. So there was a delay of 155 days that the government itself imposed on this bill. Do not come here pontificating about delays when it sat there for 155 days.


Again I say that the government have made a commitment to the public for accountability and cost-benefit analyses. This is about accountability, cost-benefit analyses and holding the government to their election promise. If you do not support this then you can add this to the vast number of premises that you have trashed since you have come to government.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:33):  I thank the senator for his contribution. The first fact that all of those listening to this debate need to understand is that in the House of Representatives the Labor Party opposition voted against the bill. The Labor Party voted not to give vital money for the Roads to Recovery program to local government. They voted against it. The reason this legislation is here is that, when in government, the Labor Party sunsetted the provision of funding to local government. They put the booby-trap in the legislation when they were in power, clearly anticipating they would be where they are now. The fact is that we need to get this funding to local government. Let's get on with it.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:33):  Again, I cannot understand where the government are going on this. It is clear that once this bill is passed it does not have to come back here for at least six years. It does not have to come back here again for the next two half-Senates. This is something that is simply holding the government to account for its election promises. It is about accountability. It is not about obstructionism from anyone. We are prepared to accept the bulk of this bill without amendment because it ensures that we have proper land transport infrastructure projects being brought forward. But they can only be brought forward if there is accountability and transparency. That is a promise this government made when it went to the election. That is what this amendment delivers on. It is about accountability. It is about transparency.


We know the history of the coalition in government. We know that they always have to have a leash on National Party projects that are simply not sustainable, that are about pork-barrelling and that deliver nothing but an election boost for the local National Party member. We want infrastructure to be a nationally important issue. Labor in government did more than any other government on infrastructure spending and infrastructure support. We have never had a history of being obstructionist. We are not being obstructionist on this; we simply want your promise kept—the promise that you would be accountable and transparent. That is what this is about, not delay.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:36):  We need to underline the fact that we promised and are committed to ensuring scrutiny of projects above $100 million. Infrastructure Australia, under a different legislative framework, is already getting on with the job. To be clear, we will introduce amendments next week—and I am on the record now for good reason—to the Infrastructure Australia Act which will increase the level of transparency, as we said we would. In this context, we said we would get Infrastructure Australia to provide justification for its advice in a transparent, open and visible way—and we will, as we promised.

 (New South Wales) (10:36):  With the greatest respect, Senator Johnston, this is a con job. We you have just outlined is an absolute con job. This act is where the money is spent and this act is what determines what the projects are. To say that the Infrastructure Australia Act should be changed is wrong. It is not dealing with the issue. This is where the money is spent. This is where you should be accountable. This does not have to come back again for six years, and there will be no arguments about not moving forward on key projects, provided they are accountable, provided a cost-benefit analysis has been done, provided they are transparent. To run what you have just run is a false argument. It is taking people up a blind alley. This is where the action is and this is where we should make the amendments to ensure your accountability. What we as Labor say is that if we do not get it here than we have lost accountability on the coalition. That would be a national disaster.

   Commonwealth contribution
 means so much of the funding payment as was used to meet the acquisition cost.





   consideration or value
 means the greater of:





   (a) the consideration received by the funding recipient for the sale or disposal (but not deducting any costs associated with that sale or disposal); and





   (b) the market value of the interest at the time of the sale or disposal.

   Omit ""6, 7"", substitute ""7, 7A"".



These are amendments relating to formalisation of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program. Amendment (8) will elevate this important program and give it the parliamentary approval that it currently lacks. It will ensure that the specific program criteria is oversighted by the parliament, is in legislation and cannot be changed without parliamentary approval. This is an important program that is improving safety, not just for truck drivers but for all road users. The first four of these items add the heavy vehicle safety program to definitions in the act in a manner consistent with the existing program. Item (1) inserts 'heavy vehicle safety program' into the Act's definition of an eligible funding recipient. Item (2) inserts the HVSPP into the Act's definition of approved purposes. Item (3) inserts a definition reference to the HVSPP, and item (4) inserts a reference to the project approval instrument for the HVSPP. Item (8) inserts a new Part 7 (a) to the Act that outlines the essential elements of the HVSPP in a manner consistent with other programs under the Act.


It is important to note that the heavy vehicle amendments moved here are slightly reworked against the amendments moved in the House in March. The opposition listened carefully to the technical points raised by the government in that debate, and we have resolved those points in the amendments moved here today. We trust that the government will acknowledge these changes, rather than raising the same points here, because that would be inaccurate. Specifically, the concerns raised about additional record-keeping being required by funding recipients have been addressed by removing this provision. Conditions of fund payment, auditing and inspection requirements remain as per now with the current requirements reflecting Parts (3) and (6) of the Act, the current source of funding for this program.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (10:52):  I will just respond to Senator Cameron. I take it that by moving amendments (8), (1), (4) and (9) on 7477 the opposition is adopting the Greens amendment? This is very similar to Greens amendments (8), (1), (4) and (9) on 7495. We will be opposing these amendments. They propose a definition for heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects to allow the amendments to support amendment (7) to have effect, as we have dealt with. These amendments provide for heavy vehicle projects. This provision is totally unnecessary and I do believe that the opposition understands that.


It still insists on eight pages of amendments to provide for a separate section on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, which is a program that is already provided for under legislation. Creating an entirely new section on heavy vehicle projects duplicates existing provisions in parts 3 and 6 of the current act. Parts 3 and 6 are being combined in this bill to reduce red tape, to reduce duplication and to streamline the operation of the act. But it is important to understand the government sees heavy vehicle administration in public policy as a very important responsibility and an important program. It has committed more funding to that program than ever the opposition did when it was in government.


These amendments create cumbersome, burdensome and expensive red tape. The opposition and their allies in the Greens are about creating regulatory burdens and not reducing them. There is not a regulation that they have ever seen that they did not want to like or add into legislation. That is what they are doing here. This group of amendments does not value-add one iota in terms of heavy vehicle safety and productivity. It just creates more process and compliance burdens.


Heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects are already catered for in the current legislation. These provisions place additional reporting obligations on funding recipients, on top of the audit and financial reporting already required. Road accident data is already collected by the bureau of infrastructure and regional development, which is a well-respected research organisation. If these amendments were to be supported, funding recipients will have to do all of this work, effectively repeating the data collection that is already taking place. What is the point of that? If the desire is to make mum-and-dad trucking businesses work longer hours for absolutely no benefit, then this should be supported. Please, do not support it. Please, crossbenchers, do not support these amendments. We do not want to increase the burden, particularly to small and medium enterprises and family businesses.


The opposition talks about being committed to productivity, but here we have evidence that what they want to achieve actually heads in the opposite direction, ensuring project proponents are doing the work that is already being done by government. I have heard claims that unless heavy vehicle projects are given their own section in the act there is no guaranteed funding. The opposition has been predictably and habitually misleading in dealing with this bill, providing crossbenchers with the string of erroneous so-called facts on the bill. The facts are these. This bill is about a very minor amendment to a very successful act; extending—as I have said on several occasions—much-needed funding to the Roads to Recovery program; changing the name of the act; and, reducing red tape. It is very, very simple.


The Greens and the opposition have colluded on these pointless amendments to jam up the operation of the progress of this vital funding. I have no doubt the crossbenchers are somewhat drawn in two different directions, and, as time goes by, they are coming to grips with a multitude of legislation and process. I want them to be very, very careful that what is happening here is understood by them. This bill is simple. It is about funding local government. What is being sought in these particular amendments, with respect to the heavy vehicle program, are entirely pointless and misleading.


To ensure that the program would receive funding under legislation, all Mr Albanese needed to do was to amend the definition of 'road' in this act and that is exactly what he did. In 2008, he introduced the AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill to add to the definition of 'road' in section 4. I quote:


(va) a facility off the road used by heavy vehicles in connection with travel on the road (for example, a rest area or weigh station);


So what this amendment seeks to do has been done. Mr Albanese knew that it was not necessary to include it in a full, separate section. It was necessary then and it clearly is not necessary now.


The government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate legislation or status in the legislation. If the heavy vehicle program were to be included, then, for consistency, and to ensure no doubt about the status of those other programs, we would probably also need to include them in the legislation. That is the incongruous nature of these misconceived amendments. This could potentially add up to 40 pages of unnecessary process to the bill. The government is committed to reducing red tape, not creating it. These other programs include the Bridges Renewal Programme, the managed motorways program, the regional roads program and the national highways program. Not one of these is named in the legislation.


Simply naming a program in legislation does not guarantee its funding. Funding is appropriated by a parliament through the budget process. In this case, we are absolutely committed to funding projects under the heavy vehicle program and money was appropriated for that program by the parliament in July. If the opposition amendments were to be agreed to, funding to this program would be held up because the guidelines under which applicants are applying would be inconsistent with the legislation. Applications for the fourth round close on 28 August—that is, today.


Changing the status of this funding round will create uncertainty for the applicants as well as waste time and money for those applicants, for local and state governments and for our hardworking officers inside the federal government. Having said that, I hope I have established, particularly with the crossbenchers, that these amendments are completely counterproductive to common sense and to achieving what the bill achieves—that is, the funding of local governments for the Roads to Recovery program.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:00):  I have to say that every time I hear the government talk about removal of red tape the warning signs go up. For this government the removal of red tape is to remove protections—remove protections for working people and remove checks and balances on the operation of businesses that need to be checked and balanced. Red tape to this government is simply about removing a role for government and letting the market rip. That is the removal of red tape for this government. 


This will not make the bill cumbersome. It will not make it burdensome. The paperwork issue was addressed. What we have here is Senator Johnston basically reading the same speech that was made in the lower house, the same speech that was made in the other place, even though section 86R has been removed.




Senator Johnston:
  We're consistent.




Senator CAMERON:
  No, Senator Johnston, it is not about consistency; it is about sloppiness, because you have not dealt with this issue. The issue of 86R has been removed. This is about ensuring that we elevate this important program and give it parliamentary approval. It is about ensuring that we have oversight. It is about improving safety not just for the truck drivers but for all road users. If you want to abandon the safety of truck drivers and the safety of road users on the ideological agenda of this government to remove red tape and to remove protections then that will be a very detrimental situation.

But, given that the opposition's amendments are being considered first, we will be supporting them. Elevating the importance of heavy vehicle productivity, particularly heavy vehicle safety, is critical and really deserves to be in this bill in order to give it the emphasis that it requires.


I do have a general question to Senator Johnston, which I probably should have asked earlier. It is of relevance to funding for heavy vehicle projects, as it is of relevance to funding for other road projects. I refer to a comment that Senator Lambie was reported as saying on radio yesterday morning—that, in the negotiations with the government over this bill, she had secured an extra $200 million for roads in the west of her state as part of supporting this bill. I want to ask Senator Johnston whether that in fact was the case.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-08-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:35):  Mr Deputy President Marshall, it is a pleasure to see you in the chair again.


I would like to indicate my support for this bill. And I do share the concerns of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Milne, in relation to private members' time—it has been hard fought for. I think there are broader issues about question time as well. With a record number of crossbenchers, we need to have a fairer system in place so that crossbenchers can fairly participate in the debates in this chamber and the processes of this chamber, including question time and private members' time. I look forward to discussing that with my colleagues and with the whips of the major parties as well, so that we can head off some of the problems that are emerging.


In relation to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, I indicate my support for this bill. I will also be supporting the amendments proposed by both the Australian Greens and the opposition, in the sense that they are relatively similar and I believe either option will be an improvement to this bill. In particular, I want to express my support for the amendments proposing greater scrutiny of projects over a certain monetary threshold. I believe this is an important amendment and will help to ensure accountability and transparency. I also want to acknowledge the good work that the infrastructure assistant minister, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, has done. I think that what he has said about ensuring value for money on road projects is refreshing; I think that that is actually a good initiative on his part and, if he is successful, as I hope he will be, in improving the processes and the value-for-money criteria, then he will be doing this country a great service. But I also think that having greater accountability and transparency in respect of road funding is a good thing.


I will keep my remarks brief because time is of the essence when it comes to this bill. It has already been delayed, which is of significant concern to local councils, and further delays could jeopardise funding for vital projects, particularly in respect of Roads to Recovery. I acknowledge the many, many phone calls and text messages I have exchanged with Felicity-ann Lewis, the President of the Australian Local Government Association, from South Australia, who is doing a great job. I pay tribute to her persistence, to her interest and to her advocacy in respect of this issue on behalf of local government. I think all of my colleagues in this place are supportive of the Roads to Recovery program and want to see it extended, given that the previous funding ended in June and that some councils have begun new projects based on promises that the funding would continue. We must ensure this legislation passes as a matter of urgency. However, I do want to address a fundamental inequality in the way that funds are allocated. 


South Australian local government currently manages 11 per cent, or 75,000 kilometres, of the nation's local road network and receives just 5.5 per cent of identified local roads grant funding, despite the fact that South Australia has about 7.2 per cent of the nation's population. As such, South Australia receives the lowest funding per capita of all states and territories, at just $23.23 per capita. South Australia also has the lowest funding spent per kilometre, with Queensland and Western Australia receiving almost twice as much. Victoria receives 2.25 times as much funding. New South Wales gets nearly three times as much. By contrast, Tasmania, which has about two per cent of Australia's population, receives $72.40 per capita, over five times the funding to South Australia. 


To address this inequality, the supplementary local road fund was established; but, despite the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, this supplementary account, which would have brought South Australia up to 7.9 per cent of the fund—an improvement but still not quite good enough—has not been included in the current budget, and that is fundamentally wrong. I urge the Hon. Jamie Briggs, the assistant minister for infrastructure, and the Hon. Christopher Pyne, the most senior South Australian in the cabinet, to fight for South Australia in the same way that Nick Minchin, Alexander Downer and Amanda Vanstone fought for South Australia when they were in the cabinet. I just hope that they have the same level of resolve when it comes to their home state of South Australia.


What this means is that South Australian councils will miss out on about $18 million for 2014-15, with some individual councils missing out on as much as $1 million each. So, while I support this bill, I call on the government to renew their commitment to infrastructure by reinstating the supplementary fund or at least by reallocating the existing funds on a more equitable basis. Improving Australia's roads needs a national approach, and funding should be fairly distributed across the country. 


As I said, I support this bill. I look forward to debating the amendments in the committee stage but I want to make it clear that, whilst I support the opposition's and the Greens' amendments in terms of improving transparency and accountability, I do not want to see this bill ultimately delayed; I want to make sure that the funding for the Roads to Recovery program is flowing by next week. We cannot afford to have gridlock on a program that is obviously urgent, a program that both sides, both major parties, support. If we do not get the funding flowing by next week, then we are showing signs of that malaise, that gridlock, which has been so toxic in American politics. Let us not bring that to our shores.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (09:41):  I thank all senators for their contributions on this important piece of legislation, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, particularly Senator Xenophon. The government are committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, and the changes in the bill will help us achieve the recently announced budget infrastructure initiatives.


The amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are sensible and necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. The bill provides funding certainty—funding that is critical to local government by continuing the vitally important Roads to Recovery program. The Roads to Recovery program, as many of us here know, lapsed on 30 June 2014. No payments can be made to local governments until this bill has passed, although we have committed $2.1 billion over the next five years to the program, including a doubling of funding to each and every council in the 2015-16 financial year. That is what is at stake with this legislation. 


The current nation building act, established by the former minister, Mr Anthony Albanese, made no provision for the Roads to Recovery program to continue beyond 30 June. The shadow spokesperson for infrastructure claims to be committed to local government and to this program, but he has failed local government by failing to provide for this vital program to continue on his watch. Without the passage of this bill, local councils stand to lose the $2.1 billion that I referred to in funding for this vital Roads to Recovery program. 


The opposition spared no time in criticising the government's decision to pause the indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local government for three years to help bring the budget back to surplus. This was a decision not taken lightly by the government. It is no secret that everyone is contributing to fix the economic mess left by the previous, Labor government. Australia's debt is already costing us billions of dollars in interest payments. This year alone, we are paying $12 billion in interest costs. Wouldn't it be nice if this could go to local councils as more funding through Financial Assistance Grants or to the Roads to Recovery program? But it cannot—a lost opportunity because of the reckless mismanagement by those opposite. 


Labor failed to come clean with councils about their own agenda to block the flow of the $2.1 billion that I mentioned to local councils for the upkeep of their local roads—money that local councils completely rely upon. If the opposition were serious about local council funding, they would not have voted against this bill in the House of Representatives. I say that again for the benefit of those listening to us: if Labor were serious and honest with the Australian public, they would not have voted against the bill in the House of Representatives, which is what they did.


During the winter recess we saw Labor claim that this program has been held up by the government's actions. But both Labor and their allies the Greens are yet to support the bill. In fact, as I have said, they voted against it in the House of Representatives yet were unable to point to one single element of the bill that, in their view, was unacceptable. It was just plain old deliberate obstructionism. They were playing politics—and they continue to do so.


The primary intent of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—which Mr Albanese failed to provide for when he was the minister, creating an expiration date of 30 June 2014. That is why we are in the problem we are in. Mr Albanese proposes a private member's bill to fix the problem. Let us not forget that the shadow spokesperson is on record as saying legislation is not needed for the program. This private member's bill, which the government has not yet seen or been consulted on, is a media stunt to respond to the outrage expressed by local councils right across Australia. Again, this is clear evidence that the Labor Party are just plain playing politics. We know it is a media stunt because Mr Albanese attempted to suspend standing orders in the House on Tuesday to introduce a bill but actually had no paperwork to back it up. The Australian public, local councils and this Senate chamber have now seen exactly what he stands for—legislation by media release and nothing more. He made Labor vote against the bill in the House, and local councils around Australia were understandably outraged. The only way the Labor Party and the shadow minister can save any face is to talk of introducing his own legislation to save the program. If he now accepts that legislation is necessary, he should quit the theatrics and the politicking and support the government's legislation.


Labor has also been claiming that the bill contains amendments that are unacceptable to the opposition. Yet the main purpose of the bill is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—the bill that they themselves voted against in the House without being able to point to one single clause, paragraph or enactment of a bill that is now described as unacceptable. The bill also changes the name of the act to remove the politicisation of the Infrastructure Investment Program from within the act. Mr Albanese seems desperate to preserve his legacy and is playing a childish tactic of attempting to ensure that the name 'Nation Building Program', which he gave to this act, is retained. What he is doing right now, with roads running into disrepair, is the complete opposite of what he wants to call the bill.


The government has also included a few other minor amendments in the bill to reduce duplication, to streamline the operation of the act and to reduce red tape consistent with our red tape reduction agenda. The amendments proposed by the opposition in the Senate, which the government deems unacceptable, include wanting to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program in the act. These projects are already funded under the act and budgeted for and, as such, including a new separate part is a completely unnecessary duplication. Mr Albanese has briefed the crossbench that, unless the heavy vehicle program is named specifically in legislation, it will not continue. Let's be clear, this government is committed to that program and is spending more on the heavy vehicle program than Labor ever did. The budget papers clearly demonstrate this. Mr Albanese himself did not find it necessary to make significant amendments when he corrected the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. He did one minor thing at that time. He only changed the definition of 'road' in legislation because that is all that was needed to establish the program. So why is he now proposing eight pages of amendments just on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program?


Labor and the Greens also want to complicate and inappropriately create an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill when in fact this act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements of Infrastructure Australia. This clearly makes no sense. If Labor was serious about looking after local councils and cutting red tape, it would simply pass the bill unamended. I ask Labor to point to just one aspect of the bill that is unacceptable. This is a simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program and to fund our local government authorities for that purpose—to change the name of the bill and to tidy up other aspects of the act consistent with the government's red tape reduction agenda. That is all that it does.


It is true that we were forced to withdraw the legislation from the Senate in the final sitting of parliament before the winter recess because it was clear that it would not have passed without major unacceptable amendments proposed by Labor and their allies the Greens. Many of the proposed amendments are unacceptable to the coalition as they are either not directly relevant to the bill or will add needless bureaucracy and red tape to the operation of programs for local councils.


Today we are hopeful that Labor and Greens senators will do the right thing by local councils and the right thing by the communities within those councils. As a government we will continue to stand up for local communities rather than playing petty games which affect the everyday lives of commuters, particularly on roads in regional Australia. The bill reinserts a power for the minister to determine the Roads to Recovery list, which is essential for the program to be able to function. This power was removed from the act when it was amended in 2009 by the previous Labor government. Clearly, the opposition had little tolerance for the Roads to Recovery program.


The bill renames the act to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the Land Transport Infrastructure Funding Program. This means that when a funding program ends or its name changes in the future there will no longer be a need to amend the legislation and it will therefore be a reduction in the administrative burden. This removes the politics from the act. The opposition has claimed the bill was entirely about removing the nation-building branding of the former government and nothing more. This government is about substance and certainly not slogans. The bill is needed to extend the Roads to Recovery Act and that is what we are trying to do with this quite simple and straightforward piece of legislation.


I urge the crossbenchers to think very carefully about the way they will vote on the amendments particularly. You can vote to continue the Roads to Recovery program, which I trust that you will do, by rejecting the amendments proposed by Labor and the Greens. Local government will certainly thank you for that. The government will thank you for that. We will not have to see the unnecessary toing and froing of the bill and we will guarantee the much needed funding flowing expeditiously to local governments so they can manage their roads properly and safely. Alternatively, you could vote to support the various amendments by the Labor Party and the Greens, but you will be alone in doing so and will contribute to the uncertainty that now confronts local governments and local authorities as to where they are going to get their funding to do the road maintenance that their communities so desperately need.


Let me be very clear. As I have said, this is a very simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program, to change the name of the legislation, and to tidy up some small and other aspects of the act consistent with our red-tape reduction agenda, and that is all it does. Why is that so offensive? Why has that become so controversial? This bill simply amends the act which was in place under Mr Albanese. Mr Albanese did not see it necessary to add a separate section on heavy vehicle projects. Mr Albanese did not have a so-called transparency clause that makes the minister direct Infrastructure Australia and his department, but then Mr Albanese did not have a transparent Infrastructure Australia either, and he funded many, many projects that came nowhere near Infrastructure Australia's priority list and ignored others on that priority list. Mr Albanese says that the government has no new projects. If the government has no new projects, why does he now insist on Infrastructure Australia assessing all the projects he previously committed to? Is he doubting whether he chose projects that do not demonstrate value for money?


The two major areas where Labor and the Greens will seek to add to the bill are in relation to Infrastructure Australia's functions and in relation to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I want to be very clear: the Australian government stand by their promise to ensure infrastructure projects over $100 million are assessed by Infrastructure Australia, and Infrastructure Australia will publish its justification for recommending projects for government funding. We will be introducing amendments in the house that specifically deal with this, and I am on the record to say precisely that. There is no need to delay funding to local councils for Roads to Recovery by attempting to create additional roles for Infrastructure Australia in this bill. They should be in the Infrastructure Australia Act where, of course, we all know they belong.


We are also committed to heavy vehicle safety. We agree that the program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program created by the Labor Party, is an important and successful program for heavy vehicle safety. In fact, we were so impressed with their program that we are extending it and providing more money for it than they ever, in fact, did. The coalition government are also helping those in the heavy vehicle sector by providing an enormous program of works, the largest infrastructure program ever to ensure safer roads for use by heavy vehicles and those that share the roads with them. Let me list a small sample of other initiatives that the government are pursuing to improve heavy vehicle safety. Firstly, a review of the National Heavy Vehicle Accreditation Scheme and of heavy vehicle inspection regimes. Secondly, mandatory load proportioning or anti-lock braking systems for all model prime movers. Thirdly, state, territory and Commonwealth governments are working collaboratively with industry to determine research and trials for the next generation of braking control systems.


In relation to heavy vehicle safety, may I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Ricky Muir who over recent weeks has been instrumental in seeking continued government support for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I pause to congratulate him on that very important contribution. My home state of Western Australia with B-doubles and very heavy vehicles certainly appreciates that input. It is a measure of the importance of this program for the Australian community that it attracts support from others in this chamber, and it is refreshing to talk to senators in this chamber who are willing to work constructively to secure clear and positive outcomes that benefit all Australians. Senator Muir, well done.


In summary, the bill streamlines and enhances the operation of the act to the benefit of states, territories and the Commonwealth by removing unnecessary duplication. It provides clarity with one set of funding conditions and approval processes for the majority of projects funded under the act. The bill also assists the government's deregulation agenda by repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. There are no regulatory or financial impacts on businesses, or on the not-for-profit sector, from the amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, or from the repeal of the spent legislation. The bill is compatible with human rights as it does not raise any human rights issues.


The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry on 6 March 2014. The committee's report, which came down on 24 March, supported the legislation in its current form. So, let's talk no more of seeking to divert the parliament's course of providing strong funding for local governments and actually delivering on that funding. We have suspended private member's business today, not lightly, but with due consideration to the fact that local councils are desperately needing this money.


I commend the bill to the house. I commend this bill to all senators, and I urge you to think about those communities that need the support of their councils and their councils' funding to deal with this roads issue. I thank the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (12:09):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator NASH:
  The government is committed to improving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and we acknowledge the importance that good hearing has for social, education and health outcomes. Ensuring children are healthy and school ready is a core priority for this government. We recognise the importance of hearing in assisting children to be both ready to go to school and able to learn, to get the best outcome from their education experience. This is an important area for this government. To close the gap on Indigenous health outcomes this needs to be a priority across governments and requires bipartisanship. This is too important an issue to be developing policy on the run. We will continue to work with our colleagues in the states and territories and the opposition to progress action to improve ear health services for Indigenous Australians as a priority. Supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to be healthy, including good hearing, is a key priority to improve short- and long-term outcomes for Indigenous children, families and communities. I indicate that we will not be supporting the motion.

  I take from the minister's comments that the government will not be supporting this motion. I am extremely disappointed to hear that. As far as her comments about policy on the run are concerned, I am quite shocked that the Assistant Minister for Health would say that, given that since I started here, nine years ago, I have been talking about Aboriginal health and Aboriginal ear health. The Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Hear us: inquiry into hearing health in Australia, which has acclaim throughout the hearing community, was really clear. It contained a whole section on Aboriginal ear health. This has been on the agenda for a significant period of time. The government cannot claim that this is policy on the run.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:17):  I am in continuation from yesterday evening. I finished yesterday evening by making the point that the contributions made by other senators were, in fact, extraneous to the particular regulation that we were considering. Indeed, I think I used the analogy of the Empire State Building for Senator Cameron's contribution, indicating that for every story or scenario there was a major flaw. That, regrettably, was the case yesterday and, of course, it remains the case today. For every story and for every cameo, his argument was majorly flawed—be it death; be it the caring responsibilities; be it injury as a result of a crime. All those issues are more than appropriately canvassed in this regulation, and it will be the professionals of the Department of Human Services that will be making the determinations, not the job service providers, as incorrectly asserted by the honourable senator.


I finished off last night by saying that I would then make the rest of my contribution on the positive side as to what the regulation actually does—not what had been asserted previously. I indicate to the Senate that what the instrument does do is give decision makers in Centrelink—and I stress Centrelink—and on appeals tribunals much clearer guidance on what the government thinks is reasonable for them to take into account when deciding whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their mutual-obligation requirements. For example, the sudden serious illness or hospitalisation of the job seeker's child or partner, the recent death of an immediate family member or the job seeker being recently subjected to criminal or domestic violence would all clearly be exceptional circumstances beyond the job seeker's control. To assert otherwise is to assert that the people in the Department of Human Services would take an absolutely unprofessional and unreasonable approach to these potentially real-life situations.


The instrument also makes it clear that paid work, attending a job interview, medical incapacity or unforeseeable and unavoidable caring responsibilities are all grounds for finding that a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. These are not necessarily exceptional circumstances, but so long as the job seeker gives prior notice, where it is possible for them to do so, they provide a reasonable excuse for the job seeker for not meeting their requirements. It is similar to the circumstance of being in actual employment: if you are sick one morning and you cannot go to work, the reasonable thing to do is to communicate with the relevant person at the workplace and indicate that to them, if at all possible, in advance. Similarly, we say to welfare recipients that in the event you cannot attend an appointment you are required to attend, because of sickness—like someone in the workforce—you simply make contact in advance and say: 'Regrettably, I am ill today' or 'On the way the car broke down and so I can't make it'. You make immediate contact, rather than giving that advice well after the event. The requirement to give prior notice, when possible, is also reasonable, I would suggest.


It is important to note—and this is the one point that rounds all this off—that the legislative instrument is not exhaustive. It is clear in the primary legislation that this regulation is only a guide and cannot limit the matters that the decision maker is able to take into account in determining whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. In those circumstances, having cleared that up—and I will be kind this afternoon and say that they were inadvertent misrepresentations of the regulation yesterday—and having now explained what the regulation actually will do, as opposed to all the false assertions made about it, I commend the regulation to the Senate and encourage honourable senators to vote against the disallowance.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Social Security (Reasonable Excuse – Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1)</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,13,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:23):  I have listened carefully to what Senator Abetz has said and he has not convinced me and he will certainly not convince the charities in this country who will face the full burden of this regulation and various other bills. What Senator Abetz has tried to do is to focus in isolation on the regulation. By doing that, he ignores other aspects of the social security legislation that come together to make it really tough on Australians who are unemployed and amongst some of the most disadvantaged people in this country.


In fact, what this is about doing is punishing job seekers. It is setting up this dole bludger argument, which is based on the government's ideology, and the government's argument that if you cannot get a job, you really should not participate in society. It is the antithesis of everything the experts in this area tell you. Simply focusing on penalties and simply focusing on penal provisions against some of our poorest Australian citizens is just outrageous.


The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination is the legislative instrument the minister must make to determine a non-exhaustive list of matters that decision makers must consider in applying the persistent noncompliance test under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill and the determination are inextricably linked. For Senator Abetz to try to argue it differently is disingenuous and misleading. But that is what we expect from this government. It is a government of broken promises, a government brought to power, based on lies, and a government that seems determined to punish the poorest people in this country.


See, the government wants the determination viewed in isolation. That is because, on the face of it, it seems innocuous—but it is not. When viewed in the big picture of employment service reforms that the government is trying to make, its dangers become clear. The government's package of reforms in this area is designed to disenfranchise and punish the unemployed of Australia. It includes the following measures—and you have to take this determination into account with all of these issues. Firstly, the determination that sets out what a decision maker must take into account in determining whether someone has a reasonable excuse for noncompliance under the Social Security Act; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill, which seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, in relation to the imposition of eight-week penalties on job seekers who are receiving a participation requirement for the serious failures; next is the Exposure Draft of the Employment Services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements, which is the Job Services Australia tender document, which sets out the government's intentions in relation to the Job Services Australia program from 1 July 2015; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill, which seeks to strengthen the compliance arrangements for job seekers in receipt of activity-tested income support arrangements; and, the changes to Newstart for job seekers aged under 30 that will see them off income support for a continuing six-month cycle until they either get a job or turn 30.


All of these bills have to be read together to understand what this regulation and determination that the government has brought in really means. You have to look at what all of these acts do. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill was introduced by the coalition on Wednesday, 4 June 2014. The bill seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. Under current job seeker compliance provisions contained in the act, job seekers in receipt of participation payment—defined as Newstart and defined for some people as youth allowance, parenting payments and special benefits—may incur an eight-week non-payment period penalty for serious failures consisting either of refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance with their participation obligations.


Currently, the act provides that such non-payment penalties may be waived if the job seeker begins to comply with a serious failure requirement—currently Work for the Dole, job search training or undertaking more intensive searches. These are the issues that have to be dealt with. The non-payment may also currently be waived if the job seeker does not have the capacity to comply with any such serious failure requirement and would be in serious financial hardship if the non-payment were not ended. What we have here is a government that want the unemployed, who are on $36 a day at the moment, to suffer a further penalty. As if having to live on $36 a day is not problem enough for some of our most disadvantaged Australians; the government wants to penalise them even more. It is because they have this dole bludger mentality, this ideology that if you do not have a job you are some kind of inferior Australian. They do not understand these issues. They do not understand the difficulty some Australians have in getting a job. They just don't get it. They want to penalise people on $36 a day, take all support away from them and leave them destitute and reliant on charity.


There are a number of concerning aspects of the legislation, which has to be read in conjunction with the determination. Job seekers will be unable to re-engage during the eight-week non-payment period. Once you have been penalised, that is it—you have lost your payment. You cannot come and say, 'Look, I really want to get on top of this problem I have,' or, 'I've got on top of my problem and I want to re-engage.' You are gone for eight weeks, with absolutely no payments. No evaluations have been done on whether these changes are likely to be successful. The majority of people affected by the changes will have a vulnerability indicator already noted on their Centrelink records, meaning that they are disadvantaged in some way, including whether they have a mental illness or psychiatric problems, are homeless, have recently been discharged from prison, have had a recent traumatic relationship breakdown or have suffered from cognitive or neurological impairment. Indigenous job seekers are also over-represented amongst those who will be penalised. These are the people who need more help in our community, not penal provisions—not forced onto charity, not abandoned by the government. They should be supported and assisted.


The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1) sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters which decision makers must consider in determining whether or not a reasonable excuse exists in relation to a job seeker's serious failure under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, being either refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance, before imposing a nine-week non-payment period. The proposed determination changes what constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purpose of the legislation. What is concerning is the discretion acknowledged to exist in determining whether circumstances directly prevent a job seeker from complying with requirements. The concept of 'directly prevent' is a new requirement introduced by the government and obviously narrows the discretion of the decision maker in deciding whether or not an excuse is reasonable. Also concerning is the removal of factors which currently must be taken into account when deciding whether a person has a reasonable excuse. These are: that the person did not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing, or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge; the literacy and language skills of the person; an illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature; a cognitive or neurological impairment of the person; a psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person; a drug or alcohol dependency of the person; unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person; that the person was subjected to criminal violence (including domestic violence and sexual assault); that the person was adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative; and, the person's recent imprisonment or release from imprisonment. 


The government has argued that some of the above factors will still be considered in determining 'reasonable excuse'. However, on the government's proposal, job seekers would have to prove that the circumstances directly prevented them from meeting the requirement and that they gave prior notice, under the requirements of section 42UA of the act. The secretary will no longer be required to take the above factors into consideration when deciding whether a job seeker has a reasonable excuse. The department is going to be handing responsibility for the decision making as to whether or not a serious failure has occurred and whether or not there was a reasonable excuse for it from Centrelink to Job Services Australia and to their provider staff. The major concern with this is that the JSA staff may not be aware that they have a wide discretion in making a decision as the delegate of the secretary and might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed under 'reasonable excuse' in the government's new determination.


The minister's own Exposure draft for employment services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements states on page 41: 


The Employment Provider will also determine whether the Job Seeker had a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at their initial appointment in accordance with legislation and guidelines.


This clearly demonstrates that what the minister was arguing is false, that what the minister was arguing is not correct. The providers themselves who have looked at this package of legislation—not just the determination—have expressed concern in relation to these changes, including that it will change the dynamic of the relationship between job seeker and provider, with the provider becoming—to use one of the PM's famous terms—the baddie. They do not want that, but that is what this package of legislation does and that is why we must disallow this determination.


Jobs Australia has further concerns. One of their key considerations is the fact that the department will be handing responsibility for decision making from Centrelink staff to Job Services Australia provider staff. What level of guidance and support will be provided no-one yet knows, but one concern arising from that is that the JSA staff may not be made aware that they have wide discretion in making a decision as delegates of the secretary. They might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed in the determination.


Who knows what the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill will seek to do. It is part of an attack package on the most vulnerable Australians. Obviously, the government thinks that the harsh measures so far have not gone far enough.


The proposed Newstart changes demonise young job seekers. They punish job seekers for not being able to find work rather than focusing on job creation so that there are actually jobs out there for people. The changes force them to live on fresh air for a continuing six-month cycle. The government wants them to find it so hard that they do not bother with income support. This is a cost-cutting approach using the most vulnerable people in this country. Not only will job seekers have to fall back on parents and families, if they have parents and families; they will have to fall back on charity. 


This determination is one aspect of big picture of this government's action today in this area. I emphasise that you cannot deal with the determination in isolation from the other aspects of the government's social security attack measures. It is all about punishing and further disadvantaging vulnerable people who are already doing it tough. Yesterday when I was outlining the issues associated with this determination, I went to the statement of compatibility with human rights. One of the key bills that this determination will integrate with is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014. What did the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights say about it? It said this:


Based on the information and analysis provided the committee does not consider that the statement of compatibility adequately demonstrates that the proposed amendments are needed for the purpose of meeting a pressing and substantial concern, that there is a rational connection between the measure and the identified objective and that the measure is a reasonable and proportionate one for the achievement of that objective. 


That was scrutiny of the parliament. The joint human rights committee have said that the bill is not reasonable and it is not proportionate. 


When you are looking at this determination, you have to take into account the other aspects of the draconian legislation against the poor and needy in this country. I do not understand for a minute how this could happen or how people could treat their fellow Australians in this manner. When you take all of those bills and this determination together, we are penalising people who are surviving on $36 a day. You must look at the whole package that is in place so that you understand the implications of the determination. This is a horrible set of measures against the poor, the underprivileged and the weakest people in our community. It simply shows that this government is completely out of touch. It is completely out of touch with the needs of the unemployed in the country, it is completely out of touch with the availability of work for the unemployed in this country, it is completely out of touch with the challenges that the unemployed face and it simply ignores the already tough set of measures that are there to ensure compliance. 


No-one wants people to rort the system, but this is not designed to stop people rorting the system; this is an ideological attack on the poorest people in the country. It is an ideological attack because the coalition do not have a clue what it is like to be unemployed or have one of your family unemployed. They do not know what it is like to battle to put food on the table on $36 a day. They think you need to impose more penalties on the poorest people in this country. We should not support this determination. By supporting this determination, you are basically saying the package of bills is okay. The package of bills is not okay. We need a decent society and we need a package of bills that looks after the poorest and does not penalise them.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Cameron be agreed to.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:17):  I am in continuation from yesterday evening. I finished yesterday evening by making the point that the contributions made by other senators were, in fact, extraneous to the particular regulation that we were considering. Indeed, I think I used the analogy of the Empire State Building for Senator Cameron's contribution, indicating that for every story or scenario there was a major flaw. That, regrettably, was the case yesterday and, of course, it remains the case today. For every story and for every cameo, his argument was majorly flawed—be it death; be it the caring responsibilities; be it injury as a result of a crime. All those issues are more than appropriately canvassed in this regulation, and it will be the professionals of the Department of Human Services that will be making the determinations, not the job service providers, as incorrectly asserted by the honourable senator.


I finished off last night by saying that I would then make the rest of my contribution on the positive side as to what the regulation actually does—not what had been asserted previously. I indicate to the Senate that what the instrument does do is give decision makers in Centrelink—and I stress Centrelink—and on appeals tribunals much clearer guidance on what the government thinks is reasonable for them to take into account when deciding whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their mutual-obligation requirements. For example, the sudden serious illness or hospitalisation of the job seeker's child or partner, the recent death of an immediate family member or the job seeker being recently subjected to criminal or domestic violence would all clearly be exceptional circumstances beyond the job seeker's control. To assert otherwise is to assert that the people in the Department of Human Services would take an absolutely unprofessional and unreasonable approach to these potentially real-life situations.


The instrument also makes it clear that paid work, attending a job interview, medical incapacity or unforeseeable and unavoidable caring responsibilities are all grounds for finding that a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. These are not necessarily exceptional circumstances, but so long as the job seeker gives prior notice, where it is possible for them to do so, they provide a reasonable excuse for the job seeker for not meeting their requirements. It is similar to the circumstance of being in actual employment: if you are sick one morning and you cannot go to work, the reasonable thing to do is to communicate with the relevant person at the workplace and indicate that to them, if at all possible, in advance. Similarly, we say to welfare recipients that in the event you cannot attend an appointment you are required to attend, because of sickness—like someone in the workforce—you simply make contact in advance and say: 'Regrettably, I am ill today' or 'On the way the car broke down and so I can't make it'. You make immediate contact, rather than giving that advice well after the event. The requirement to give prior notice, when possible, is also reasonable, I would suggest.


It is important to note—and this is the one point that rounds all this off—that the legislative instrument is not exhaustive. It is clear in the primary legislation that this regulation is only a guide and cannot limit the matters that the decision maker is able to take into account in determining whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. In those circumstances, having cleared that up—and I will be kind this afternoon and say that they were inadvertent misrepresentations of the regulation yesterday—and having now explained what the regulation actually will do, as opposed to all the false assertions made about it, I commend the regulation to the Senate and encourage honourable senators to vote against the disallowance.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:23):  I have listened carefully to what Senator Abetz has said and he has not convinced me and he will certainly not convince the charities in this country who will face the full burden of this regulation and various other bills. What Senator Abetz has tried to do is to focus in isolation on the regulation. By doing that, he ignores other aspects of the social security legislation that come together to make it really tough on Australians who are unemployed and amongst some of the most disadvantaged people in this country.


In fact, what this is about doing is punishing job seekers. It is setting up this dole bludger argument, which is based on the government's ideology, and the government's argument that if you cannot get a job, you really should not participate in society. It is the antithesis of everything the experts in this area tell you. Simply focusing on penalties and simply focusing on penal provisions against some of our poorest Australian citizens is just outrageous.


The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination is the legislative instrument the minister must make to determine a non-exhaustive list of matters that decision makers must consider in applying the persistent noncompliance test under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill and the determination are inextricably linked. For Senator Abetz to try to argue it differently is disingenuous and misleading. But that is what we expect from this government. It is a government of broken promises, a government brought to power, based on lies, and a government that seems determined to punish the poorest people in this country.


See, the government wants the determination viewed in isolation. That is because, on the face of it, it seems innocuous—but it is not. When viewed in the big picture of employment service reforms that the government is trying to make, its dangers become clear. The government's package of reforms in this area is designed to disenfranchise and punish the unemployed of Australia. It includes the following measures—and you have to take this determination into account with all of these issues. Firstly, the determination that sets out what a decision maker must take into account in determining whether someone has a reasonable excuse for noncompliance under the Social Security Act; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill, which seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, in relation to the imposition of eight-week penalties on job seekers who are receiving a participation requirement for the serious failures; next is the Exposure Draft of the Employment Services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements, which is the Job Services Australia tender document, which sets out the government's intentions in relation to the Job Services Australia program from 1 July 2015; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill, which seeks to strengthen the compliance arrangements for job seekers in receipt of activity-tested income support arrangements; and, the changes to Newstart for job seekers aged under 30 that will see them off income support for a continuing six-month cycle until they either get a job or turn 30.


All of these bills have to be read together to understand what this regulation and determination that the government has brought in really means. You have to look at what all of these acts do. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill was introduced by the coalition on Wednesday, 4 June 2014. The bill seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. Under current job seeker compliance provisions contained in the act, job seekers in receipt of participation payment—defined as Newstart and defined for some people as youth allowance, parenting payments and special benefits—may incur an eight-week non-payment period penalty for serious failures consisting either of refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance with their participation obligations.


Currently, the act provides that such non-payment penalties may be waived if the job seeker begins to comply with a serious failure requirement—currently Work for the Dole, job search training or undertaking more intensive searches. These are the issues that have to be dealt with. The non-payment may also currently be waived if the job seeker does not have the capacity to comply with any such serious failure requirement and would be in serious financial hardship if the non-payment were not ended. What we have here is a government that want the unemployed, who are on $36 a day at the moment, to suffer a further penalty. As if having to live on $36 a day is not problem enough for some of our most disadvantaged Australians; the government wants to penalise them even more. It is because they have this dole bludger mentality, this ideology that if you do not have a job you are some kind of inferior Australian. They do not understand these issues. They do not understand the difficulty some Australians have in getting a job. They just don't get it. They want to penalise people on $36 a day, take all support away from them and leave them destitute and reliant on charity.


There are a number of concerning aspects of the legislation, which has to be read in conjunction with the determination. Job seekers will be unable to re-engage during the eight-week non-payment period. Once you have been penalised, that is it—you have lost your payment. You cannot come and say, 'Look, I really want to get on top of this problem I have,' or, 'I've got on top of my problem and I want to re-engage.' You are gone for eight weeks, with absolutely no payments. No evaluations have been done on whether these changes are likely to be successful. The majority of people affected by the changes will have a vulnerability indicator already noted on their Centrelink records, meaning that they are disadvantaged in some way, including whether they have a mental illness or psychiatric problems, are homeless, have recently been discharged from prison, have had a recent traumatic relationship breakdown or have suffered from cognitive or neurological impairment. Indigenous job seekers are also over-represented amongst those who will be penalised. These are the people who need more help in our community, not penal provisions—not forced onto charity, not abandoned by the government. They should be supported and assisted.


The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1) sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters which decision makers must consider in determining whether or not a reasonable excuse exists in relation to a job seeker's serious failure under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, being either refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance, before imposing a nine-week non-payment period. The proposed determination changes what constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purpose of the legislation. What is concerning is the discretion acknowledged to exist in determining whether circumstances directly prevent a job seeker from complying with requirements. The concept of 'directly prevent' is a new requirement introduced by the government and obviously narrows the discretion of the decision maker in deciding whether or not an excuse is reasonable. Also concerning is the removal of factors which currently must be taken into account when deciding whether a person has a reasonable excuse. These are: that the person did not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing, or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge; the literacy and language skills of the person; an illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature; a cognitive or neurological impairment of the person; a psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person; a drug or alcohol dependency of the person; unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person; that the person was subjected to criminal violence (including domestic violence and sexual assault); that the person was adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative; and, the person's recent imprisonment or release from imprisonment. 


The government has argued that some of the above factors will still be considered in determining 'reasonable excuse'. However, on the government's proposal, job seekers would have to prove that the circumstances directly prevented them from meeting the requirement and that they gave prior notice, under the requirements of section 42UA of the act. The secretary will no longer be required to take the above factors into consideration when deciding whether a job seeker has a reasonable excuse. The department is going to be handing responsibility for the decision making as to whether or not a serious failure has occurred and whether or not there was a reasonable excuse for it from Centrelink to Job Services Australia and to their provider staff. The major concern with this is that the JSA staff may not be aware that they have a wide discretion in making a decision as the delegate of the secretary and might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed under 'reasonable excuse' in the government's new determination.


The minister's own Exposure draft for employment services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements states on page 41: 


The Employment Provider will also determine whether the Job Seeker had a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at their initial appointment in accordance with legislation and guidelines.


This clearly demonstrates that what the minister was arguing is false, that what the minister was arguing is not correct. The providers themselves who have looked at this package of legislation—not just the determination—have expressed concern in relation to these changes, including that it will change the dynamic of the relationship between job seeker and provider, with the provider becoming—to use one of the PM's famous terms—the baddie. They do not want that, but that is what this package of legislation does and that is why we must disallow this determination.


Jobs Australia has further concerns. One of their key considerations is the fact that the department will be handing responsibility for decision making from Centrelink staff to Job Services Australia provider staff. What level of guidance and support will be provided no-one yet knows, but one concern arising from that is that the JSA staff may not be made aware that they have wide discretion in making a decision as delegates of the secretary. They might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed in the determination.


Who knows what the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill will seek to do. It is part of an attack package on the most vulnerable Australians. Obviously, the government thinks that the harsh measures so far have not gone far enough.


The proposed Newstart changes demonise young job seekers. They punish job seekers for not being able to find work rather than focusing on job creation so that there are actually jobs out there for people. The changes force them to live on fresh air for a continuing six-month cycle. The government wants them to find it so hard that they do not bother with income support. This is a cost-cutting approach using the most vulnerable people in this country. Not only will job seekers have to fall back on parents and families, if they have parents and families; they will have to fall back on charity. 


This determination is one aspect of big picture of this government's action today in this area. I emphasise that you cannot deal with the determination in isolation from the other aspects of the government's social security attack measures. It is all about punishing and further disadvantaging vulnerable people who are already doing it tough. Yesterday when I was outlining the issues associated with this determination, I went to the statement of compatibility with human rights. One of the key bills that this determination will integrate with is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014. What did the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights say about it? It said this:

That was scrutiny of the parliament. The joint human rights committee have said that the bill is not reasonable and it is not proportionate.

I do not understand for a minute how this could happen or how people could treat their fellow Australians in this manner.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:50):  In speaking to the second reading of the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2014, I indicate that Labor will be supporting this bill and that Labor supports the establishment of a retail corporate bond market in Australia. A well-performing and efficient retail corporate bond market will provide an alternative source of funding for Australian companies and increase competitive pressure on lending rates to businesses. This bond market is a significant source of funds for many Australian financial and non-financial corporations. Correspondingly, this financing activity provides investment opportunities for Australians and non-residents. Indeed, the establishment of a deep and liquid retail corporate bond market in Australia was a key priority for the former Labor government and was subject to some significant and ongoing work over a number of years.


On 26 September 2008, the Minister for Financial Services, Mr Bowen, established the Australian Financial Centre Forum, the AFCF, to progress the government's initiative to position Australia as a leading financial services centre in the region. Mr Mark Johnson was the chairman of this partnership of government and industry, which also comprised six senior financial sector representatives, a Treasury task force and a reference group. The AFCF looked at a broad range of policy settings including, but not limited to, financial sector regulation; taxation; improving Australia's skill and talent pool through education and immigration policies; and promotion of Australia's financial services industry.


The final report, known colloquially as the Johnson report and formally as the Australia as a financial centre: building on our strengths report was handed down in November 2009 and included examination of the lack of liquidity and diversity in Australia's corporate bond market. It also discussed why this lack of liquidity was a significant weakness in the overall assessment of Australia's financial system. At the retail level, it was considered that one action the government could take to overcome this weakness was to introduce regulatory changes that could assist with developing the market. 


In December 2010, as part of its Competitive and Sustainable Banking System initiative, the former Labor government signalled it would be introducing changes to facilitate the development of a deeper and more liquid corporate bond market in Australia. These changes included launching the trading of Commonwealth government securities on financial markets to be accessible to retail investors and reducing the regulatory burden associated with issuing corporate bonds to retail investors, including streamlining disclosure requirements and prospectus liability regulations. 


The bill that is before the Senate today seeks to reduce the regulatory burden of companies offering relatively simple, or so-called 'vanilla', corporate bonds to retail investors, while at the same time ensuring that appropriate standards of consumer protection are maintained. The bill increases offerings of corporate bonds to retail investors in Australia by streamlining the disclosure regime for issuers; changing the civil liability regime in respect to retail corporate bonds; and clarifying the application of the requirement to take 'reasonable steps' in respect of misleading and deceptive statements and omissions in disclosure documents relating to retail corporate bonds.


This bill follows the passage of the former Labor government's legislation to facilitate retail trading in Commonwealth government securities, CGS, in 2012. Having an active retail market in Commonwealth government securities is an important step in establishing a wider retail corporate bonds market by providing a visible pricing benchmark for retail investors in corporate bonds. This bill will deliver on the former Labor government's commitment to reduce regulatory burdens and barriers for offers of corporate bonds to retail investors. 


The bill contains three major elements. First, under current arrangements, the issuance of corporate bonds to retail investors requires the provision of a full prospectus. Under the changes in this bill, the issuance of certain corporate bonds to retail investors will require the provision of a two-part simple corporate bond prospectus. Second, under current arrangements, simple retail corporate bonds, like other bonds, can be traded directly but are not able to be traded as depository interests. Under this bill, simple corporate bonds will be able to be traded using simple retail corporate bonds depository interests. Third, under current arrangements, directors and proposed directors of a body making an offer have liability for any misstatement in, or omission from, the disclosure document whether or not that director was involved in a contravention of subsection 728(1). This bill makes changes so that directors and proposed directors of a body making an offer have liability for any misstatement in, or omission from, the disclosure document only where they are involved in a contravention of subsection 728(1).


Labor had introduced the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2013 which lapsed. Schedule 1 of that bill is virtually identical to the bill we are debating today. There is one minor change between schedule 1 of Labor's 2013 bill, which lapsed, and proposed section 713A paragraph 22 of the new bill. The old bill specified that securities must be for a fixed term of not more than 10 years. This has been changed to a fixed term of not more than 15 years in the new bill.


The measures in this new bill are another major initiative that the former Labor government was delivering on in its long-term commitment to encourage the development of a deep and liquid bond market in Australia. The measures provide companies with another source of fundraising and signal that it is their time to contribute to the development of Australia's corporate bond market. 


We often hear much rhetoric from those on the opposite side of the chamber about red tape and regulation. Here is an example of good measures of the former Labor government to reduce red tape and the regulatory burden. We are pleased that the new government has continued the good work of Labor in office and, with that, Labor will be supporting this bill.

 (Tasmania) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Singh today relating to data retention and to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.


Senator Brandis has made it very clear today that it is orthodox cabinet process for the leader to override the Attorney-General on his signature policy and to leave it until right at the last minute to tell the Attorney-General he is doing so. We all know that Senator Brandis has staked his career and his 'freedom agenda' on this particular signature policy, so what did he find to say when he was confronted with this reality—that the Prime Minister had rolled him on his signature policy? On Sky News on 6 August, Senator Brandis said:


Well you know what this business is like … you win a few, you lose a few.


What has Senator Brandis won? In his almost 12 months in the role of Attorney-General for this country he has won nothing. On the other hand, what has he lost? He has lost his credibility, he has lost all respect and he has been completely rolled by the Prime Minister on a signature policy that he had staked his career as Attorney-General on. He lost all that on one of his first pieces of legislative reform, a favour that he wanted to do for his friends in the IPA and for his friend—or the Prime Minister's friend—Andrew Bolt. 


One of the chief duties of a politician and of a legislator is to explain one's program and to persuade the public about its value in that constant battle of ideas. So how has the Attorney-General fared in this endeavour? What is his record of victory in that marketplace of ideas? Has he demonstrated the levels of competence in public life that are the basic requirement of the political trade and, indeed, that of an Attorney-General. Let us turn to that first signature policy, a key reform, which, in many ways, Senator Brandis very much staked his career on: the repeal and removal of protections against racist hate speech in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. 


For many people, this may not seem a worthy goal, but for Senator Brandis and his ideological gang, including the IPA, it certainly was. How did he proceed in the implementation of it? There is no doubt that, on that first question of explaining what he was doing to the Australian people, he had had some measure of success in the end. For Senator Brandis, the primary right that needed to be defended was, as he so clearly explained, the right for bigots to be bigots. After this statement, it became very clear what he intended. He had explained himself and his program; but, after their understanding of that explanation, the community issued a resounding rejection of it.


He had failed in that other important test—that of persuasion. He had completely failed it. There were some 5,000 submissions on his flawed consultation process and the majority of them were a complete and utter rejection of what Senator Brandis highlighted as his signature policy. Why? Because we know what Senator Brandis was trying to do in his freedom agenda: he was trying to allow the rights of bigots to have more precedence in this country than the rights of victims of racist hate speech. So he fell very fast and hard on that first hurdle—the hurdle of persuasion. 


But then in the most recent foray of his political endeavours, he has not even been able to reach the second hurdle. Anybody who watched Senator Brandis attempt to explain metadata on Sky News might be tempted to conclude that he has never actually used the World Wide Web or been familiar with the difference between an IP address and a website name. We all know that Senator Brandis likes spending taxpayers' money on books and expensive bookshelves, so my advice to Senator Brandis is that maybe he should pick himself up a copy of the 'dummies guide to the internet', and then perhaps he will not need the communications minister to clean up his mess. Maybe he should recognise that his embarrassing performance in that regard and, indeed, his embarrassing performance in relation to racial hate speech were a rejection of his role as an Attorney-General.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:15):  I rise to take note of the motion moved by Senator Singh. What the opposition have demonstrated with the presentation that Senator Singh just made is that they are prepared to just make it up as they go along. Senator Singh characterises the policy around 18C as Senator Brandis's signature policy. It was a policy that the government took to the last election. I think quite rightly and quite genuinely Senator Brandis put out a consultation paper to the community to allow community consultation and comment, yet now Senator Singh wants to complain that the government actually took notice of that consultation process. Senator Singh put statistics on the table about the reaction to it. I think a good government will take note of community consultation. It will take note of current circumstances that exist when proposing pieces of legislation. 




Senator Singh:
  I thought it was about counter-terrorism laws.




Senator COLBECK:
  Yes, it is also about counter-terrorism laws. The government quite rightly made the decision that it did not want the issue of 18C to be a distraction to what is a very serious issue for this country with respect to dealing with the issue of counter-terrorism. I think it was a wise decision. 


What a good government does is take note of the consultation process it might have publicly and also take note of the views that are held within its party room. It does not, as the previous government did over six years, run a chaotic top-down process where decisions were not taken as part of cabinet. We heard Senator Brandis say during question time that the decision with respect of 18C was made in cabinet and announced subsequent to the cabinet meeting, as it should have been. 


I also know that members of the government consulted broadly amongst the party room. There are members of this government who have expressed publicly their concerns about the government's proposals on 18C. They were in close contact with their communities about the proposals of 18C. They utilised the very wise process that Senator Brandis put in place around the exposure draft to consult with their communities. They brought that feedback back to the government through the party room, through their direct consultations with Senator Brandis and, I am sure, through their direct consultation with the Prime Minister, his office and other members of the executive. That is a good, considered government process. When the collective wisdom of the cabinet came together to discuss the issue, they took all of those matters into account. I think that is quite a wise process. Why would you not do that? You have a strong view in the community. You have a range of views within the party room. The process is put out for public consultation. An exposure draft of the legislation is put into the community to talk about. At the end of the day, after gathering all of that information together,  you make a decision based on the consideration of all of the circumstances that were in play at the time. 


Despite those who might want to downplay the threat of terrorism in this country, it is a significant threat. Anyone who has a good knowledge and understanding of these issues is expressing that view right now. To take away a distraction to that, alongside the process of good and sound community consultation, only make sense, and the characterisation that the opposition has portrayed around this decision today quite clearly does not stack up. They imply that it is a signature policy of Senator Brandis, but it was a policy that the government took to the last election and we have made a wise decision on that policy in cabinet.

Senator FAULKNER 

(
New South Wales
) (
15:15
):  After such a long time struggling to become a cabinet minister, of course Senator Brandis must have been delighted to have been appointed as our Attorney-General. As all of us in this place know, Senator Brandis has an absolutely towering view of his own capacity and his own importance. He certainly convinced a lot of us of his potential, and he had only really been stymied by former Prime Minister Howard, who he had allegedly described as a lying rodent but defended himself by saying he only called him a rodent. When Senator Brandis was elevated to cabinet, many of us, myself included, thought he would make a pretty reasonable job of it. I said something very positive in The Sydney Morning Herald about him last July:


There is no doubt George is a capable and effective politician. He's one of the Liberals' best, but he does take himself very seriously at times.


I got the last bit right but I got the rest of it quite wrong —Senator Brandis has been a complete disappointment. He has made an absolutely, utterly, ham-fisted botch of being Attorney-General of Australia. For someone who is so full of himself, it must have been a truly terrible revelation for him to have come face to face with the fact that he is just not up to the job. He does not understand the detail of the legislation that he is responsible for. Take mandatory metadata retention. The Attorney-General does not even know what it is that his legislation would make ISPs retain. That is hardly a surprise, seeing as he does not seem to understand at all how the internet works. He said that what people were viewing on the internet would not be included but that the web address they communicated to would be. Of course it would have been better for the Attorney to consult with the communications minister, who knows something about the internet, but the communications minister had to learn about what the government was up to in The Daily Telegraph. This was excruciatingly humiliating for Senator Brandis, and that interview he did on Sky News was so bad, he was so out of his depth, that even members of the Labor Party told me they felt sorry for him. I did not share their view, but it was certainly extraordinary.


The U-turn on 18C reforms will always be an unforgettable legacy of this Attorney-General. An exposure draft on that was released without even checking with the cabinet—a disaster of a draft, made worse by Senator Brandis's public admission in this chamber that it was a licence for bigotry: 'People have the right to be bigots,' he said. Then, on 4 August, he was telling the public via Peter van Onselen that he still wanted to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, but on 5 August he was standing next to Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, who dumped him and his proposal. But he claims today that that is orthodox cabinet process. I say very generously to Senator Brandis, 'George, you've really got to lift your game. You are embarrassing yourself, you are embarrassing your party.' It is a fact of life that Senator Brandis is nowhere near as good as he thinks he is, as Senator Williams knows. George Brandis should stop being a complete clown. That is what the public think about him. He should step up or step down. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS

 (
New South Wales

(

):  Metadata and security is a very serious issue. As Senator Faulkner would be well aware, the government has put more than $600 million towards our security. Senator Lines is in the chamber and obviously, like a naughty student, she has been summoned to the principal's office for six of the best because of her comments yesterday. This is not a political game to be played—it is a very serious issue. There are some 100 Australians here in our nation assisting people overseas in areas like northern Iraq and Syria, where we see these inhumane and despicable actions being carried out and put on the internet for people to view. It is a serious issue and it is not a time to play politics. As you know, Mr Deputy President, the Australian Labor Party aligns with the government when it comes to the security of Australians. It is an issue first and foremost for anyone who sits in either of the chambers here in Canberra. It is quite amazing what those in ISIL are doing. We do not want that to grow. We do not want to have Australians—especially young Australians—being indoctrinated into participating in these disgraceful activities around the world. We need to keep our country safe.


When we talk about metadata and the retention of knowledge that helps our agencies like ASIO and the Federal Police, it takes me back to several years ago when five people were charged. Three were found guilty and locked up. Their goal was to shoot up those training in Holsworthy Army base. Thankfully, through the great work of our agents, that did not occur, and those culprits were charged, found guilty and locked up. What a terrible tragedy that would have been if something like that did occur. That is why it is important that the metadata be secured.


Metadata is information produced by the communication systems. When you are using, for example, mobile phones, the data notes whom you call, time of your discussion and how regularly you call that person. These details are great information for our agents to monitor and keep our nation safe. That is what this is all about. Metadata should be retained for the proposed two years. As David Irvine, the Director-General of ASIO, has said, 'Unless metadata storage practices are changed, law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts will be severely hampered.' We do not want to see those law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts severely hampered in this place. I do not think any one of us wants to see that. Our security agents have also been very clear that they do not want industry to be required to keep records about Australians' web-browsing. As part of our work to keep Australians safe from terrorism, consultations are starting with telecommunications providers about continuing to retain metadata. Our law enforcement agencies must have all the tools at their disposal to track down criminals and keep the community safe. That is what is most important here. It is not a political joke. It is not a political football to be kicked about. It is about keeping Australians safe and returning the world to peace.


I am alarmed when people like Senator Lines think we are using this as a deterrent from looking at budget questions. If that were the case, why isn't this a motion to take note of answers to budget questions? Why aren't there more questions about the budget? That is ironic in itself. Here we are, answering questions on metadata and security. It is a very serious issue.


As far as 18C goes, the government will not proceed with the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 at a time when the threat to Australia from extremists is real and growing. That is most important We need to be a united country, to work together, to forward information—whatever people hear or see—to our agents and our police because we need to keep Australians safe. We need to do our utmost, working with our colleagues and our allies around the world, to see that we do our best to keep our nation safe.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  Wasn't August a big month for Senator Brandis? First up, we had Senator Brandis finally falling on his sword with respect to his proposed 'rights to be bigots' reform to the Racial Discrimination Act. Then, minutes later, in the same press conference, we had the Prime Minister and Senator Brandis bumbling over the government's new mandatory data retention laws and its lack of a definition for metadata. The press conference was followed by one of the most excruciating interviews since Mike Willesee sliced John Hewson into hundreds of pieces of birthday cake over 20 years ago. That interview was on Dr Hewson's proposed 15 per cent GST. From the answers of the Leader of the Government in the Senate today, it appears the Liberal-National coalition is still as lost on the topic of the GST as it was under Dr Hewson. But I digress and return to the Brandis bungles.


Firstly, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the thousands of Australians and hundreds of organisations who rose up to speak against these changes. The voices of the people have been heard loud and clear across the country and the world. This backdown, this broken election promise, is a win for tolerance in this country. It is a win for our multicultural Australian society. Thankfully, the proposed ill-conceived changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act now rest where they always truly belonged—on the scrap heap. The Attorney-General spent months here in the Senate stating that the government were about protecting the right of bigots. No-one has the right to be a bigot, Senator Brandis—not Andrew Bolt, not the racist who dropped anti-Semitic leaflets in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. It is still a concern that the Abbott government appears to have left this reform in the top drawer. It is not good enough. Even the proposal of these reforms and the bungled explanations from the Attorney-General signalled a green light to racism.


I also want to comment on the ongoing Brandis bungle on data retention. What is metadata? Despite the policy announcement and the huge fanfare, at present the government does not have a clear definition of metadata or 'megadata', as one confused journalist said in a recent interview—a slip of the tongue that is symptomatic of this government's absolute failure to explain anything that it is doing. For if the press cannot even get a simple phrase correct and if the government does not have a clear definition of that phrase, how does Senator Brandis expect the Australian people to understand what it all means? The really concerning thing in the data retention debate is that we are dealing with vitally important national security issues.


As a responsible party of government, the Labor Party has a natural inclination to support the government of the day in its ventures to keep Australia safe. However, if the government are incapable of structuring a coherent argument, how can you expect the Labor Party to work through these complex national security matters with them? It would not be responsible of the opposition, the Labor Party, to give the government a blank cheque on their reforms. These reforms are complex, but the Abbott government, through its Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, has been particularly confused in its explanations of these policies. It is important that the government understands the details of its policies. There are very serious matters at stake. It is also vital that the proposed reform to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is not kept in the top drawer by the Liberal and National parties for another day.


We have the new senator from Queensland, Senator McGrath, who has said that he will cross the floor and vote for Senator Day's private senator's bill on these reforms. Senator McGrath is of course from Queensland, the home of outspoken Senator Macdonald and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I hope Senator Brandis holds firm and does not introduce this reform, and I hope Senator Brandis holds firm and breaks his election commitment, because I believe this reform offends the Australian spirit. I believe this reform offends Australia's notion of a fair go for all. It the election commitment to reform the Racial Discrimination Act is so dispensable, if the definition of metadata is too hard to explain, then no-one should believe Senator Abetz when he says that the government has no intention of changing GST distribution.


Question agreed to.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (15:36):  I present three government responses to committee reports as listed at item 15 on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Senate Education and Employment References Committee Report Effectiveness of the National Assessment Program
—
Literacy and Numeracy





June 2014





List of acronyms



ACARA - Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority


APIP - Accessible Portable Item Protocol


COAG - Council of Australian Governments


NAP - National Assessment Program


NAPLAN - National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy


PISA - Programme for International Student Assessment


SCSEEC - Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood


WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines


The Australian Government Department of Education welcomes the Report on the Inquiry into the Effectiveness of the National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy. A response to each recommendation in the report is provided below. The Department has sought the views and input of ACARA in preparing these responses.




Recommendation 1:
The committee recommends the quick turnaround of test results should receive the highest priority in the design of NAPLAN Online with achievable and measurable targets built in to the system.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees in principle with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to delivering National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) test results faster, as this will enable schools and parents to quickly access the diagnostic elements of the test, and develop appropriate intervention strategies to support and extend students' literacy and numeracy capabilities.




Current situation



All education ministers have agreed in principle that the return of individual student results for diagnostic purposes is beneficial to improve student learning and the faster the results return to teachers the better.


The Australian Government is working cooperatively with the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), and the states and territories to achieve faster turnaround of NAPLAN test results to students, teachers and parents.


The Australian Government believes it is important that the use of NAPLAN item level data should be used to inform teacher classroom practice and that states and territories actively develop assessment literacy skills amongst their teachers.


Since September 2013, negotiations about the release of individual student results and the individual student reports to parents have been held with all stakeholders. The Australian Government encourages all states and territories to reduce the time it takes to return individual student reports to parents.


ACARA is scheduled to release National Summary Information (preliminary results), previously known as the NAPLAN Summary Report, in a web-based format on 18 August 2014. This information will provide preliminary national, state and territory level results four weeks ahead of the time that the Summary Report was released in 2013. In addition, the majority of states and territories will deliver results back to schools and parents sooner. It is expected that in 2015 turnaround times will continue to be reduced.




NAPLAN online



A key element of the rationale for delivering NAPLAN testing online is that there will be a significant reduction in the time taken to provide feedback to schools, students and parents. Faster turnaround of results is a key goal in the planning and design of NAPLAN online.


It is intended that the design and process mapping for the online delivery of NAPLAN maximises the use of technology to automate existing processes that will reduce the time taken. Over time this will provide more information on student performance leading to richer reporting on student performance.




Recommendation 2:
 The committee recommends that when designing adaptive testing for NAPLAN Online the needs of students with disability are taken into account.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all students, including those with disability, continue to be taken into account in the design of NAPLAN testing online. Student assessments should be designed to cover a broad range of abilities that enables the strengths and weaknesses of students to be measured. For NAPLAN testing, disability is defined as per the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992.


At the individual student level, NAPLAN provides a measure of literacy and numeracy skills relative to his or her peers. This measure can then be used to monitor student progress, enable longitudinal tracking of student achievement, and inform strategies for improving literacy and numeracy achievements. To achieve this, tests must yield comparable data, so that students' results can be compared and placed on a scale relative to each other. For a test to yield comparable data, tests must be standardised, and students must as far as possible undergo the same test experience.


In the case of students with disability, this may entail adjustments to the standard way a test is delivered and undertaken. Adjustments are intended to enable access to the tests on an equivalent basis to students without disability, so that the adjusted test measures the student's literacy or numeracy performance, rather than measuring the impact of the student's disability or disabilities on their test experience (which an unadjusted test would show).



The current NAPLAN testing regime achieves the above through the National Protocols for Test Administration 2014 (the Protocols) and in particular the Adjustments for Students with a Disabilitysection, consistent with the Disability Standards for Education 2005, which set out the rights of students with disability and the obligations of school authorities in relation to education under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.



The Protocols (available atwww.nap.edu.au) allow for:


a range of permitted adjustment types (each supported by evidence bases that isolate the effect of the adjustment and demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjustment)


to be applied singly or in combination


on a case by case basis dependent on individual student needs


as determined by the school together with the relevant Test Administration Authority, the parent/carer and the student


exemption of students with significant intellectual and/or functional disabilities, who are unable to access the tests within the guidelines for adjustments



Examples of the application of these adjustments can be found in a set of 'scenarios' published on the National Assessment Program (NAP) website www.nap.edu.au.




NAPLAN online



The needs of students with disability will be taken into account in the design of adaptive testing and the test development and delivery systems. To this end, ACARA is working closely with stakeholders, expert advisers and service delivery partners, as well as its working, advisory, and reference groups that support the test development process.


Adjustments for students with disability in the online environment will be guided by the Protocols adapted for the online context. As far as possible, online assessment for each student with accessibility requirements will replicate the arrangements currently in place for that student in daily classroom assessment activities.


Research commissioned in 2013 (which included a review of online accessibility options in use for online assessment in other jurisdictions) is informing work in this area. Further research on the adaptation of the accessibility aspects of the Protocols to the online environment is planned.




Technical specifications



In addition to the measures outlined above, there are specific business requirements which will need to be met in the design of the NAPLAN online test authoring and test delivery systems:


ACARA has specified compliance with all legislative requirements as well as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG2.0 Level AA, in the business requirements for the NAPLAN online component of the test delivery system under development.


In addition, the systems will meet the Accessible Portable Item Protocol (APIP) Standard—a data model for standardising the interchange file format for digital test items, which provides a test delivery interface with all the information and resources required to make a test and an item accessible for students with a variety of disabilities and special needs.


Test items will be developed in accordance with item specifications, which will include accessibility and usability requirements (including provision of adjusted or alternate content where an online interaction is by its nature inaccessible to a particular user group, for example because it is graphically-based, as determined by APIP).




Recommendation 3:
 The committee recommends that when designing adaptive testing for NAPLAN Online the needs of students from a non-English speaking background are taken into account.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all students are taken into account for in the design of NAPLAN testing online, including those with non-English speaking background.


NAPLAN is designed as a standardised assessment - all students across Australia sit the same tests for their year level. The tests are designed in such a way that the questions, administration conditions, scoring procedures and analysis are consistent for all students. This allows for a comparable understanding of performance across the country.


The tests identify whether all students have the literacy and numeracy skills that provide the critical foundation for their learning. While it is recognised that all students do not have the same cultural and language background, competency in Australian English is essential for all students to allow them to participate fully in Australian society. This is particularly important for students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island heritages who may not speak English as their first, second or third language, as well as migrant and refugee students.


As NAPLAN literacy assessments are tests of student ability in standard Australian English, specific adjustments are not made for students with a non-English speaking background. The literacy demands of the numeracy tests should not, however, exclude a student with a non-English speaking background from accessing the numeracy tests.




Test development



NAPLAN tests are developed collaboratively by the states and territories, and the Australian Government and the non-government sectors. The development of NAPLAN test items is extensively quality assured through highly specific and rigorously applied processes, continuous quality control and auditing. ACARA has in place a rigorous test development process and uses expert panels to develop and review test items.


As part of the test development process, all proposed test items undergo quality assurance that takes cultural background into account. In preparing the assessments, test developers must ensure NAPLAN tests are not culturally biased against any student group, including students from a non-English speaking background. The development process involves ACARA working with specialist item writers under contract, and supported by expert review and recommendations from officials from all states and territories, including assessment and curriculum specialists. This process ensures that no questions in the NAPLAN tests require direct personal knowledge of a topic outside the curriculum for respective year levels.


NAPLAN tests are standardised and serve a national comparability purpose. The test development process is designed to ensure that test content is aligned to the curriculum expectations of each state and territory, with testing to be based on the Australian Curriculum from 2016. The development process includes having each state and territory review all proposed test items for cultural and language appropriateness.


The consideration of students from non-English speaking and diverse cultural backgrounds will continue in the development of NAPLAN test items in an online environment.




Recommendation 4:
 The committee recommends that ACARA closely monitor the use of NAPLAN results to ensure results are published to assist the Government to deliver extra, targeted funding to schools and students who need more support, rather than the development of league tables.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation.


ACARA's strategic directions are set by ACARA's Charter, (available at http://www.acara.edu.au/about_us/about_us.html), determined by the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC). Amongst other matters, the Charter vests responsibility with ACARA for:


collecting national data (including on individual schools) for the purpose of accountability and reporting, research and analysis, and resource allocation as directed by SCSEEC


analysing data, as required by education ministers and their departments, to support system management and policy.


ACARA undertakes a role in monitoring how NAPLAN results are used in the public domain.



The Australian Government supports the fair and responsible publication of NAPLAN results, and does not support the development of league tables. A key purpose of NAPLAN is to provide information for all Australian governments to underpin school improvement and target funding where it is most needed in Australian schools.The My Schoolwebsite (www.myschool.edu.au) allows users to compare schools with statistically similar groups of students, providing contextual information to support fairer and more meaningful comparisons. If the performance information is separated from the contextual information, meaning and fairness are diminished.


Under the Australian Government's Students First policy, school autonomy and the Independent Public Schools initiative will enable principals to have more support and freedom to make decisions for the benefit of their school. It is intended that this policy will provide capacity for principals to apply funding to support those students who need help to improve their literacy and numeracy skills. This reform reflects international evidence that in seeking to improve schools, the autonomy of the principal to make informed decisions supports student outcomes.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 1:
 The Australian Greens recommend that, if publication of individual school results on the 
My School
 site continues, the Government remove the functionality that enables ranking and comparisons of individual school results.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


The Australian Government supports the fair and responsible publication of NAPLAN results. A key purpose of NAPLAN is to provide information for all Australian governments to target funding where it is most needed in Australian schools.



My School is a unique online tool that promotes transparency in education by providing parents, schools, governments and the wider community with high quality, nationally comparable data on the performance and progress of Australian schools.


The My School website was purposely designed to minimise the construction of crude league tables which create unfair and indefensible comparisons of Australian schools.


While the My School website allows users to compare statistically similar schools, it provides contextual information to support fairer and more meaningful comparisons of schools than publication of performance information without providing information about key factors that impact the performance of schools. The My School website does not include rankings of schools.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 2:
 The Australian Greens recommend that in the event that functionality for the ranking and comparisons of individual school results is removed from the 
My School
 website but improper and detrimental use of NAPLAN data continues (such as the creation of league tables) the Government remove the school-level data, in accordance with their prior policy position.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


As outlined in the response to the Australian Greens Recommendation 1, the Australian Government does not support the development of simplistic league tables. The My School website was purposely designed to minimise the construction of crude league tables which create unfair and indefensible comparisons of Australian schools.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 3:
 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government clarify the purpose of NAPLAN testing, particularly with regard to its use as a diagnostic assessment, and adapt the structure and any publication of the data to align with the stated purpose.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


The purpose of NAPLAN is clearly articulated. As the largest and most significant program within the NAP, NAPLAN provides data on student learning in literacy and numeracy and these data are used to inform the development of strategies to improve literacy and numeracy skills of students in all schools across Australia.


NAPLAN results provide a baseline for monitoring student and school progress, enables longitudinal tracking of student achievement, and can be used to inform strategies for improving the literacy and numeracy achievements of students.


NAPLAN testing allows Australian governments to identify whether all students have the literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge which provide the critical foundation for other learning and for their productive and rewarding participation in school and the community. NAPLAN results provide reliable, comparable information on how students, schools and school systems are performing against national standards, including national minimum standards in each of the assessed areas.


The following NAPLAN results are published to support this purpose.


National, state and territory NAPLAN results are published in a preliminary and National Report each year.


Schools receive comprehensive data packages on NAPLAN results, and states and territories have developed programs for data analysis to support teachers in using and interpreting NAPLAN data to improve student outcomes.


Parents/carers receive an individual student report on NAPLAN results which enable them to see how their child is progressing against national standards, including the national average and middle 60 per cent of students for the year level.


Information on NAPLAN results at the school level is published on the My School website, which is updated each year.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 4:
 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government provide further support and training for teachers and schools to analyse the NAPLAN data and devise 
individual educational programs to assist students to ensure the resources used to run the tests and create the data are not wasted.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation. Teacher professional development is the responsibility of state and territory governments.


The Australian Government's submission to this Inquiry outlined the support and training available for teachers in jurisdictions to analyse and use NAPLAN data to support those students. All states and territories have developed programs for data analysis to support teachers in using and interpreting NAPLAN data to improve student outcomes. For example, see page 16 of the Department's submission to the Inquiry (Submission 69 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations).


NAPLAN results are an important resource for teachers to be able to target their teaching practice to the needs of their students. The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers require teachers to be able to assess, provide feedback and report on student learning. For the Graduate standard, this includes an expectation that teachers can 'demonstrate the capacity to interpret student assessment data to evaluate student learning and modify teaching practice.' (Standard 5)


The national approach to the Accreditation of Initial Teacher Education Programs in Australia: Standards and Procedures require universities to demonstrate how they will be preparing their students to meet the Graduate teacher standard. The data produced by NAPLAN tests are rich and detailed and can be of great value in informing teaching practice and student learning. Analysis of the data down to the level of each test question (item), for each student, can help teachers identify the gaps in learning of particular students. It can also highlight areas where classroom strategies are succeeding or may need adjustment.


As part of their ongoing teacher professional development, increasing the assessment literacy capabilities of teachers is fast becoming an essential 21st century skill for teachers. This means that teachers need training and support in ways to interpret and analyse data to inform and change their practice, if needed in extending the achievement of all students. As well as improving the outcomes of lower achieving students, it can be applied to supporting and extending higher achieving students.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 5:
 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government consult with schools to determine the best time of year to hold the annual tests in light of discussions around the purpose of the testing.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


The timing of NAPLAN tests was agreed by education ministers in July 2006. Moving the tests to May allowed diagnostic information to be provided to teachers and parents earlier in the year than had previously been the case with state and territory literacy and numeracy tests. This assists with planning needed interventions sooner and using assessment to improve teaching and learning.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 6:
 The Australian Greens recommend that NAPLAN Online uses the advantages of the medium to test a broader scope of knowledge within literacy and numeracy, more accurately reflect classroom learning styles and incorporate questions which encourage lateral and creative thinking from students.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation.


Work is underway to determine the scope and scale of the test delivery system features when NAPLAN goes online and this is being undertaken in consultation with state and territory governments and the non-government school sector. Further research on the development and use of technically enhanced items, including multimedia stimulus material, is being conducted by ACARA with the intention of including these item types as part of the NAPLAN full-cohort testing program over time.


Evidence shows that tailored test design, which comprises multi-stage branching tests, provides better alignment of tests to the ability of each student. Tailored test design 'branches' students through test pathways depending on their ability level, ensuring that high performing students are adequately challenged and that low achieving students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge. For the latter group of students, the test design significantly enhances the testing context and student engagement. The increased number of items in this test design also provides an opportunity to broaden and enhance the coverage of the Australian Curriculum in NAPLAN testing.




Other assessments



All Australian governments support additional assessments that focus on lateral and creative thinking through instruments such as the Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA), which in 2015 will incorporate collaborative problem solving in its test design.


The NAP sample assessments are currently under review and the longer-term future directions of the program post-2015 are being developed by ACARA for consideration by education ministers.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 7:
 The Australian Greens recommend that ACARA actively consults with teachers and academics experienced in teaching students from language backgrounds other than English to scrutinise the tests for cultural assumptions and inappropriate content and styles of questioning.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation. As this recommendation overlaps Committee Recommendation 3, please refer to that response.

Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works report:


Public works on Christmas Island October 2011




Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake an assessment of water flows to determine what happens to treated wastewater that leaves the Christmas Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, and the potential risks to the freshwater supply.



Supported. Water Corporation, Western Australia, which operates and manages the water and wastewater infrastructure on Christmas Island, had completed a geotechnical survey and prepared a Catchment Management Strategy for Christmas Island. Based on the findings of the geotechnical survey, Water Corporation considers that the discharge from the Wastewater Treatment Plant is not posing any risks to the freshwater water supply on the island.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake an assessment of the Christmas Island water supply to determine whether any water supply areas are affected by contaminants from the Island
'
s landfill site.



Supported. The landfill is considered a risk to the water source as it is situated in the greater catchment area. Water Corporation has put in place catchment management strategies to manage the risk, including frequent sampling, monitoring, inspections, operational strategies and ongoing communications with the Shire of Christmas Island as they are responsible for waste management on the island. Water Corporation monitors the groundwater surrounding the landfill and undertakes analysis for hydrocarbons, pesticides, metals and bacterial contaminants. At this stage the landfill has not had any measurable impact on the quality of the drinking water on Christmas Island.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has provided funding of $1.2 million to the Shire of Christmas Island for development of a waste management strategy and implementation of capital works to the Christmas Island Waste Management Facility. The first stage of the project, which involved an assessment of existing waste disposal and management strategies on the Island, and an analysis of the options available for total solid waste management, was completed in 2013.




Recommendation 3





The Committee Recommends that that the Australian Government examine alternatives





for disposal of solid waste from the Christmas Island Wastewater Treatment Plant.



Supported. Water Corporation presented its report Christmas and Cocos Islands Biosolids Strategy 2031 as part of its 2012-13 annual report. The preferred sludge management option for Christmas Island is composting. Composting will be implemented gradually over the next ten years.




Recommendation 4





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection review existing medical facilities and services at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (North-west Point), with a view to ensuring that all detainees have full access to all medical services in an appropriate and suitable medical centre environment.



Noted. The Australian Government considers that all detainees at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) have access to appropriate medical services which are delivered in suitable medical facilities.


The Government notes that in June 2013 the Health Services Provider at Christmas Island IDC received accreditation against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioner Standards for Health Services in Australian Immigration Detention Centres. Among other matters, the accreditation process included consideration of the clinic facilities.


In addition, during 2013-14 the Government allocated further resources to improve the medical facilities and to increase the range of health services available at Christmas Island IDC. This includes enhancements to pathology and imaging services, use of telemedicine facilities and expanded use of visiting specialists. These measures will further reduce the amount of time Irregular Maritime Arrivals spend in Australia before their rapid onward transfer to an Offshore Processing Centre in Nauru or Papua New Guinea




Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government design and construct a fit-for
­purpose medical centre for the Construction Camp Alternative Place of Detention on Christmas Island, which will include (but not be limited to):




a sufficient number of discrete and appropriately sized consultation and examination rooms or suites
;




appropriate client waiting areas;




a secure drug store and dispensary;




separate waiting and consultation areas for mental health care and counselling services;




adequate storage for all medical supplies; and




suitable kitchen and ablution facilities for staff.





The medical facility should be attached to existing administrative areas and/or compound entrance or exit to facilitate access and egress for staff, while still allowing access for detention centre clients. Detention centre management, medical staff and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection
'
s Detention Health Advisory Group must be consulted regarding the design of any proposed medical facility.



Noted. The Construction Camp Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) clinic was renovated in early 2013. These works included the incorporation of adjacent buildings into the clinic complex, in order to provide an appropriate amount of consultation, storage, kitchen and ablution space for detainees and staff. These works also included additional access and egress points for staff.


In addition, during 2013-14 the Government allocated further resources to improve the medical facilities and to increase the range of health services available at Christmas Island IDC. This includes enhancements to pathology and imaging services, use of telemedicine facilities and expanded use of visiting specialists. These measures will further reduce the amount of time Irregular Maritime Arrivals spend in Australia before their rapid onward transfer to an Offshore Processing Centre in Nauru or Papua New Guinea.




Recommendation 6





The Committee recommends that that the Australian Government, as an urgent priority and outside of the normal Budget process, construct new headquarters for the Australian Federal Police on Christmas Island.



Not supported. The Government has not been able to fund a new station for the Australian Federal Police on Christmas Island.


Funding from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development operating budget for the Territories enables repairs and maintenance work to be undertaken to keep the station operational.


On 17 January 2012, AFP Occupational Health and Safety staff travelled to Christmas Island to conduct a review of the station. The review found no immediate threat to officer safety. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development will continue to monitor the situation and undertake repairs as appropriate.


Comcare inspected the building in February 2014 and concluded that the remedial works previously undertaken require further attention. An engineering assessment will be conducted over the coming months to establish the scope of works.

The Australian Government Department of Education welcomes the Report on the Inquiry into the Effectiveness of the National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy. A response to each recommendation in the report is provided below. The Department has sought the views and input of ACARA in preparing these responses.




Recommendation 1:
The committee recommends the quick turnaround of test results should receive the highest priority in the design of NAPLAN Online with achievable and measurable targets built in to the system.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees in principle with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to delivering National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) test results faster, as this will enable schools and parents to quickly access the diagnostic elements of the test, and develop appropriate intervention strategies to support and extend students' literacy and numeracy capabilities.




Current situation



All education ministers have agreed in principle that the return of individual student results for diagnostic purposes is beneficial to improve student learning and the faster the results return to teachers the better.


The Australian Government is working cooperatively with the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), and the states and territories to achieve faster turnaround of NAPLAN test results to students, teachers and parents.


The Australian Government believes it is important that the use of NAPLAN item level data should be used to inform teacher classroom practice and that states and territories actively develop assessment literacy skills amongst their teachers.


Since September 2013, negotiations about the release of individual student results and the individual student reports to parents have been held with all stakeholders. The Australian Government encourages all states and territories to reduce the time it takes to return individual student reports to parents.


ACARA is scheduled to release National Summary Information (preliminary results), previously known as the NAPLAN Summary Report, in a web-based format on 18 August 2014. This information will provide preliminary national, state and territory level results four weeks ahead of the time that the Summary Report was released in 2013. In addition, the majority of states and territories will deliver results back to schools and parents sooner. It is expected that in 2015 turnaround times will continue to be reduced.




NAPLAN online



A key element of the rationale for delivering NAPLAN testing online is that there will be a significant reduction in the time taken to provide feedback to schools, students and parents. Faster turnaround of results is a key goal in the planning and design of NAPLAN online.


It is intended that the design and process mapping for the online delivery of NAPLAN maximises the use of technology to automate existing processes that will reduce the time taken. Over time this will provide more information on student performance leading to richer reporting on student performance.




Recommendation 2:
 The committee recommends that when designing adaptive testing for NAPLAN Online the needs of students with disability are taken into account.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all students, including those with disability, continue to be taken into account in the design of NAPLAN testing online. Student assessments should be designed to cover a broad range of abilities that enables the strengths and weaknesses of students to be measured. For NAPLAN testing, disability is defined as per the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992.


At the individual student level, NAPLAN provides a measure of literacy and numeracy skills relative to his or her peers. This measure can then be used to monitor student progress, enable longitudinal tracking of student achievement, and inform strategies for improving literacy and numeracy achievements. To achieve this, tests must yield comparable data, so that students' results can be compared and placed on a scale relative to each other. For a test to yield comparable data, tests must be standardised, and students must as far as possible undergo the same test experience.


In the case of students with disability, this may entail adjustments to the standard way a test is delivered and undertaken. Adjustments are intended to enable access to the tests on an equivalent basis to students without disability, so that the adjusted test measures the student's literacy or numeracy performance, rather than measuring the impact of the student's disability or disabilities on their test experience (which an unadjusted test would show).



The current NAPLAN testing regime achieves the above through the National Protocols for Test Administration 2014 (the Protocols) and in particular the Adjustments for Students with a Disabilitysection, consistent with the Disability Standards for Education 2005, which set out the rights of students with disability and the obligations of school authorities in relation to education under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.



The Protocols (available atwww.nap.edu.au) allow for:


a range of permitted adjustment types (each supported by evidence bases that isolate the effect of the adjustment and demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjustment)


to be applied singly or in combination


on a case by case basis dependent on individual student needs


as determined by the school together with the relevant Test Administration Authority, the parent/carer and the student


exemption of students with significant intellectual and/or functional disabilities, who are unable to access the tests within the guidelines for adjustments



Examples of the application of these adjustments can be found in a set of 'scenarios' published on the National Assessment Program (NAP) website www.nap.edu.au.




NAPLAN online



The needs of students with disability will be taken into account in the design of adaptive testing and the test development and delivery systems. To this end, ACARA is working closely with stakeholders, expert advisers and service delivery partners, as well as its working, advisory, and reference groups that support the test development process.


Adjustments for students with disability in the online environment will be guided by the Protocols adapted for the online context. As far as possible, online assessment for each student with accessibility requirements will replicate the arrangements currently in place for that student in daily classroom assessment activities.


Research commissioned in 2013 (which included a review of online accessibility options in use for online assessment in other jurisdictions) is informing work in this area. Further research on the adaptation of the accessibility aspects of the Protocols to the online environment is planned.




Technical specifications



In addition to the measures outlined above, there are specific business requirements which will need to be met in the design of the NAPLAN online test authoring and test delivery systems:


ACARA has specified compliance with all legislative requirements as well as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG2.0 Level AA, in the business requirements for the NAPLAN online component of the test delivery system under development.


In addition, the systems will meet the Accessible Portable Item Protocol (APIP) Standard—a data model for standardising the interchange file format for digital test items, which provides a test delivery interface with all the information and resources required to make a test and an item accessible for students with a variety of disabilities and special needs.


Test items will be developed in accordance with item specifications, which will include accessibility and usability requirements (including provision of adjusted or alternate content where an online interaction is by its nature inaccessible to a particular user group, for example because it is graphically-based, as determined by APIP).




Recommendation 3:
 The committee recommends that when designing adaptive testing for NAPLAN Online the needs of students from a non-English speaking background are taken into account.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all students are taken into account for in the design of NAPLAN testing online, including those with non-English speaking background.


NAPLAN is designed as a standardised assessment - all students across Australia sit the same tests for their year level. The tests are designed in such a way that the questions, administration conditions, scoring procedures and analysis are consistent for all students. This allows for a comparable understanding of performance across the country.


The tests identify whether all students have the literacy and numeracy skills that provide the critical foundation for their learning. While it is recognised that all students do not have the same cultural and language background, competency in Australian English is essential for all students to allow them to participate fully in Australian society. This is particularly important for students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island heritages who may not speak English as their first, second or third language, as well as migrant and refugee students.


As NAPLAN literacy assessments are tests of student ability in standard Australian English, specific adjustments are not made for students with a non-English speaking background. The literacy demands of the numeracy tests should not, however, exclude a student with a non-English speaking background from accessing the numeracy tests.




Test development



NAPLAN tests are developed collaboratively by the states and territories, and the Australian Government and the non-government sectors. The development of NAPLAN test items is extensively quality assured through highly specific and rigorously applied processes, continuous quality control and auditing. ACARA has in place a rigorous test development process and uses expert panels to develop and review test items.


As part of the test development process, all proposed test items undergo quality assurance that takes cultural background into account. In preparing the assessments, test developers must ensure NAPLAN tests are not culturally biased against any student group, including students from a non-English speaking background. The development process involves ACARA working with specialist item writers under contract, and supported by expert review and recommendations from officials from all states and territories, including assessment and curriculum specialists. This process ensures that no questions in the NAPLAN tests require direct personal knowledge of a topic outside the curriculum for respective year levels.


NAPLAN tests are standardised and serve a national comparability purpose. The test development process is designed to ensure that test content is aligned to the curriculum expectations of each state and territory, with testing to be based on the Australian Curriculum from 2016. The development process includes having each state and territory review all proposed test items for cultural and language appropriateness.


The consideration of students from non-English speaking and diverse cultural backgrounds will continue in the development of NAPLAN test items in an online environment.




Recommendation 4:
 The committee recommends that ACARA closely monitor the use of NAPLAN results to ensure results are published to assist the Government to deliver extra, targeted funding to schools and students who need more support, rather than the development of league tables.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation.


ACARA's strategic directions are set by ACARA's Charter, (available at http://www.acara.edu.au/about_us/about_us.html), determined by the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC). Amongst other matters, the Charter vests responsibility with ACARA for:


collecting national data (including on individual schools) for the purpose of accountability and reporting, research and analysis, and resource allocation as directed by SCSEEC


analysing data, as required by education ministers and their departments, to support system management and policy.


ACARA undertakes a role in monitoring how NAPLAN results are used in the public domain.



The Australian Government supports the fair and responsible publication of NAPLAN results, and does not support the development of league tables. A key purpose of NAPLAN is to provide information for all Australian governments to underpin school improvement and target funding where it is most needed in Australian schools.The My Schoolwebsite (www.myschool.edu.au) allows users to compare schools with statistically similar groups of students, providing contextual information to support fairer and more meaningful comparisons. If the performance information is separated from the contextual information, meaning and fairness are diminished.


Under the Australian Government's Students First policy, school autonomy and the Independent Public Schools initiative will enable principals to have more support and freedom to make decisions for the benefit of their school. It is intended that this policy will provide capacity for principals to apply funding to support those students who need help to improve their literacy and numeracy skills. This reform reflects international evidence that in seeking to improve schools, the autonomy of the principal to make informed decisions supports student outcomes.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 1:
 The Australian Greens recommend that, if publication of individual school results on the 
My School
 site continues, the Government remove the functionality that enables ranking and comparisons of individual school results.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


The Australian Government supports the fair and responsible publication of NAPLAN results. A key purpose of NAPLAN is to provide information for all Australian governments to target funding where it is most needed in Australian schools.



My School is a unique online tool that promotes transparency in education by providing parents, schools, governments and the wider community with high quality, nationally comparable data on the performance and progress of Australian schools.


The My School website was purposely designed to minimise the construction of crude league tables which create unfair and indefensible comparisons of Australian schools.


While the My School website allows users to compare statistically similar schools, it provides contextual information to support fairer and more meaningful comparisons of schools than publication of performance information without providing information about key factors that impact the performance of schools. The My School website does not include rankings of schools.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 2:
 The Australian Greens recommend that in the event that functionality for the ranking and comparisons of individual school results is removed from the 
My School
 website but improper and detrimental use of NAPLAN data continues (such as the creation of league tables) the Government remove the school-level data, in accordance with their prior policy position.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


As outlined in the response to the Australian Greens Recommendation 1, the Australian Government does not support the development of simplistic league tables. The My School website was purposely designed to minimise the construction of crude league tables which create unfair and indefensible comparisons of Australian schools.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 3:
 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government clarify the purpose of NAPLAN testing, particularly with regard to its use as a diagnostic assessment, and adapt the structure and any publication of the data to align with the stated purpose.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government does not agree with this recommendation.


The purpose of NAPLAN is clearly articulated. As the largest and most significant program within the NAP, NAPLAN provides data on student learning in literacy and numeracy and these data are used to inform the development of strategies to improve literacy and numeracy skills of students in all schools across Australia.


NAPLAN results provide a baseline for monitoring student and school progress, enables longitudinal tracking of student achievement, and can be used to inform strategies for improving the literacy and numeracy achievements of students.


NAPLAN testing allows Australian governments to identify whether all students have the literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge which provide the critical foundation for other learning and for their productive and rewarding participation in school and the community. NAPLAN results provide reliable, comparable information on how students, schools and school systems are performing against national standards, including national minimum standards in each of the assessed areas.


The following NAPLAN results are published to support this purpose.


National, state and territory NAPLAN results are published in a preliminary and National Report each year.


Schools receive comprehensive data packages on NAPLAN results, and states and territories have developed programs for data analysis to support teachers in using and interpreting NAPLAN data to improve student outcomes.


Parents/carers receive an individual student report on NAPLAN results which enable them to see how their child is progressing against national standards, including the national average and middle 60 per cent of students for the year level.


Information on NAPLAN results at the school level is published on the My School website, which is updated each year.




The Australian Greens 
Recommendation 4:
 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government provide further support and training for teachers and schools to analyse the NAPLAN data and devise 
individual educational programs to assist students to ensure the resources used to run the tests and create the data are not wasted.





Australian Government Response



The Australian Government notes this recommendation. Teacher professional development is the responsibility of state and territory governments.


The Australian Government's submission to this Inquiry outlined the support and training available for teachers in jurisdictions to analyse and use NAPLAN data to support those students. All states and territories have developed programs for data analysis to support teachers in using and interpreting NAPLAN data to improve student outcomes. For example, see page 16 of the Department's submission to the Inquiry (Submission 69 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations).

Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works report:


Public works on Christmas Island October 2011




Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake an assessment of water flows to determine what happens to treated wastewater that leaves the Christmas Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, and the potential risks to the freshwater supply.



Supported. Water Corporation, Western Australia, which operates and manages the water and wastewater infrastructure on Christmas Island, had completed a geotechnical survey and prepared a Catchment Management Strategy for Christmas Island. Based on the findings of the geotechnical survey, Water Corporation considers that the discharge from the Wastewater Treatment Plant is not posing any risks to the freshwater water supply on the island.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake an assessment of the Christmas Island water supply to determine whether any water supply areas are affected by contaminants from the Island
'
s landfill site.



Supported. The landfill is considered a risk to the water source as it is situated in the greater catchment area. Water Corporation has put in place catchment management strategies to manage the risk, including frequent sampling, monitoring, inspections, operational strategies and ongoing communications with the Shire of Christmas Island as they are responsible for waste management on the island. Water Corporation monitors the groundwater surrounding the landfill and undertakes analysis for hydrocarbons, pesticides, metals and bacterial contaminants. At this stage the landfill has not had any measurable impact on the quality of the drinking water on Christmas Island.


The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has provided funding of $1.2 million to the Shire of Christmas Island for development of a waste management strategy and implementation of capital works to the Christmas Island Waste Management Facility. The first stage of the project, which involved an assessment of existing waste disposal and management strategies on the Island, and an analysis of the options available for total solid waste management, was completed in 2013.




Recommendation 3





The Committee Recommends that that the Australian Government examine alternatives





for disposal of solid waste from the Christmas Island Wastewater Treatment Plant.



Supported. Water Corporation presented its report Christmas and Cocos Islands Biosolids Strategy 2031 as part of its 2012-13 annual report. The preferred sludge management option for Christmas Island is composting. Composting will be implemented gradually over the next ten years.




Recommendation 4





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection review existing medical facilities and services at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (North-west Point), with a view to ensuring that all detainees have full access to all medical services in an appropriate and suitable medical centre environment.



Noted. The Australian Government considers that all detainees at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) have access to appropriate medical services which are delivered in suitable medical facilities.


The Government notes that in June 2013 the Health Services Provider at Christmas Island IDC received accreditation against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioner Standards for Health Services in Australian Immigration Detention Centres. Among other matters, the accreditation process included consideration of the clinic facilities.


In addition, during 2013-14 the Government allocated further resources to improve the medical facilities and to increase the range of health services available at Christmas Island IDC. This includes enhancements to pathology and imaging services, use of telemedicine facilities and expanded use of visiting specialists. These measures will further reduce the amount of time Irregular Maritime Arrivals spend in Australia before their rapid onward transfer to an Offshore Processing Centre in Nauru or Papua New Guinea




Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the Australian Government design and construct a fit-for
­purpose medical centre for the Construction Camp Alternative Place of Detention on Christmas Island, which will include (but not be limited to):




a sufficient number of discrete and appropriately sized consultation and examination rooms or suites
;




appropriate client waiting areas;




a secure drug store and dispensary;




separate waiting and consultation areas for mental health care and counselling services;




adequate storage for all medical supplies; and




suitable kitchen and ablution facilities for staff.





The medical facility should be attached to existing administrative areas and/or compound entrance or exit to facilitate access and egress for staff, while still allowing access for detention centre clients. Detention centre management, medical staff and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection
'
s Detention Health Advisory Group must be consulted regarding the design of any proposed medical facility.



Noted. The Construction Camp Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) clinic was renovated in early 2013. These works included the incorporation of adjacent buildings into the clinic complex, in order to provide an appropriate amount of consultation, storage, kitchen and ablution space for detainees and staff. These works also included additional access and egress points for staff.


In addition, during 2013-14 the Government allocated further resources to improve the medical facilities and to increase the range of health services available at Christmas Island IDC. This includes enhancements to pathology and imaging services, use of telemedicine facilities and expanded use of visiting specialists. These measures will further reduce the amount of time Irregular Maritime Arrivals spend in Australia before their rapid onward transfer to an Offshore Processing Centre in Nauru or Papua New Guinea.




Recommendation 6





The Committee recommends that that the Australian Government, as an urgent priority and outside of the normal Budget process, construct new headquarters for the Australian Federal Police on Christmas Island.



Not supported. The Government has not been able to fund a new station for the Australian Federal Police on Christmas Island.


Funding from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development operating budget for the Territories enables repairs and maintenance work to be undertaken to keep the station operational.


On 17 January 2012, AFP Occupational Health and Safety staff travelled to Christmas Island to conduct a review of the station. The review found no immediate threat to officer safety. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development will continue to monitor the situation and undertake repairs as appropriate.


Comcare inspected the building in February 2014 and concluded that the remedial works previously undertaken require further attention. An engineering assessment will be conducted over the coming months to establish the scope of works.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-08-28,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (15:40):  I move:


That the Senate recognises that it is in Australia’s national interest to maintain liquid fuel refining capability.


Three small words: liquid fuel security. They might be unfamiliar to many, but liquid fuel security underpins the Australian way of life. It is essential to drive our children to school. It is essential so we can shop for fruit and vegetables and it is necessary to guarantee travel to anywhere for any reason. 


Liquid fuel security underpins our industry. Liquid fuel security underpins our farming sector. Liquid fuel security underpins our manufacturers and our food processors. What is more, liquid fuel security is the linchpin of what makes Australia secure. Our army, our air force, our navy and our various other defence and national security organisations must have security of liquid fuel. Retired Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn AO said recently: 'Without fuel we don't survive.' 


This discussion today is not about division. It is not about political point-scoring. It is about bringing this issue to the forefront of public debate. It is about unifying all in this place to, firstly, recognise the importance of liquid fuel security, and then to come up with a plan. 


We must have a plan. We have reached a crossroad. By the end of next year, 90 per cent of our transport fuel, whether refined or crude, will be imported. In the year 2000—just 14 years ago—that figure was closer to 60 per cent. By no later than 2030 that figure is anticipated to be 100 per cent. But these are projections, and things can change with a plan. 


This morning I was looking at the end-of-month stock holdings of various fuels as reported by the government. As of June this year we had 30 days worth of LPG in storage, 19 days of petrol, 17 days of aviation fuel and 12 days of diesel. This highlights two problems: the first is our dependence on imported fuel; and the second is our poor preparedness and capability to respond to any crisis. 


These two crucial issues call for a national liquid fuel security plan. It might seem as if I am overemphasising the importance this issue has for Australia, but this is not the case. The International Energy Agency says on this topic that it requires member nations to have 90 days of net import oil holdings. This includes oils with which you could not run a car, truck or plane on. It includes things like bitumen, lubricating oils, heating oils et cetera. Even including these oils—oils which do not all assure transport energy security—latest figures suggest Australia only has 52 days of reserves. That is below the 71 days recorded in previous reports. A high percentage of these fuels are imported from overseas. A high percentage are also still at sea, not even on our shore. I and many Australians believe a risk assessment must be conducted. To do this, we would need to assess the whole supply chain all the way back to the Middle East.


While Singapore is an oil-refining hub, we cannot presume it is rock solid. As senators would be aware, events in the ASEAN sphere are quite dynamic. Small regional issues can suddenly have huge implications for our nation. When I talk about the risks associated with importing fuel from Singapore, I am not talking about 1960s-style gunboat diplomacy with its associated blockades. If the disruption was a targeted one, as opposed to a consequence of regional instability, many nations could simply put pressure on the owners of the shipping companies or even the nations who have provided the vessel with a flag. Nations receiving foreign aid, for instance, could be used as leverage.


On the matter of supply lines, Dr Vlado Vivoda of Griffith University warned:


Our supplies are essentially subject to the security of supply lines that bring petroleum products from international markets, particularly from Singapore, which we are becoming increasingly reliant on.


The second issue which any plan would have to focus on is our preparedness and capability to respond to any crisis which disrupts our supply chain. By no means do I purport to have the answers, but I have plenty of questions.


In the year 2000, Australia had seven refineries. Coming into 2016, Australia will have only four. By modern standards, these refineries are admittedly quite small but nonetheless are doing a great job. Caltex, Mobil, BP and Vitol—the new owner of the Shell refinery in Geelong—are the four owners. These refineries alone have served us well. However, in the event of a crisis, would their capabilities be sufficient? Will the storage of liquid fuel be sufficient? Based on the current figures—and depending on the nature of the crisis—absolutely not. Considering Australia has 52 days of net import oil holdings, one might consider that this is the norm by world standards. But the International Energy Agency information for May 2013 indicates that Korea has 240 days, the UK has 220 days, the US has 209 days and even New Zealand has 103 days, almost double what we currently have.


This is a crucial issue. Next week I will call for an inquiry. This is an issue I want the government, the opposition, the crossbench and all stakeholders—all Australians—to recognise and address. I will use Air Vice Marshall John Blackburn AO's words to sum up my contribution to this debate on liquid fuel security. He said: 'We alone amongst all developed oil-importing countries rely completely on commercial market forces for our transport energy security. This is no less perilous than contracting out our Defence Forces or outsourcing our food supply.'

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:49):  I thank Senator Madigan for introducing this motion and for his contribution. He referenced the work of John Blackburn, who has been a very well-informed and powerful voice in this area. Senator Madigan may not be aware that he, in fact, was here in Parliament House just two days ago, briefing the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on these very issues. We talked through a whole range of aspects of Australia's fuel security, so I understand Senator Madigan's concern.


The fact is that in Australia at the moment we still have four refineries operating, as Senator Madigan said. The challenge for Australia is to look not just at the supply side, as important as that is. It is also to look at how we reduce the demand side. The important areas to understand are where we are using energy, where the alternative sources are and, importantly, how quickly we are using energy and how we can reduce supply demand. Even things such as inquiries into climate have identified that car emissions and car use of fuel as we make cars more efficient can cumulatively cause a substantial reduction in the demand for liquid fuels. So part of the whole the equation is not just looking at the supply side but understanding how we can work with car manufacturers on the standards we put on imported cars to make sure that the fuel consumption of cars not only benefits the environment but reduces the demand for liquid fuels such that we balance up that issue between supply and demand.


Australia currently exports both crude oil and refined products, and it imports both crude oil and refined products from a wide range of sources. One of the advantages Australia has is that it is an energy-producing nation. One of the things that Australia has been good at for many years is fuel source innovation. In looking at supply, we need to consider the roles of unconventional oils, natural gases, natural gas liquids and even biofuels as well as the role of traditional petrochemicals.


In relation to the market, we have seen throughout the world's history that, even in times of calamity or conflict, there can be responses by governments to work through what would otherwise be considered failures of the market. Where commercial shipping has failed ships, we have seen ships taken up from trade—governments have, essentially, taken over or nationalised supply lines. There are areas where you can overcome issues with insurers through governments paying premiums and looking at ways to make sure that we do have continuity of supply. As Senator Madigan has indicated, Singapore is a hub; but we also have liquid fuels coming from places like Japan, as well as from the Middle East via Singapore. There are alternatives that the government can look at, but Senator Madigan's point about the need for a suitable risk analysis is well made and was brought out just this week in the briefings that I was discussing.


One of the issues for refinery capacity within Australia is that the scale in Australia makes it very difficult for commercial viability for companies to invest in new refining capability here or to sustain capability in the face of product that they can bring in and make available to the consumer at a lower price. One of the problems with the simple reaction, which is that we should just mandate more production capacity here, is that it starts to distort the market. We already know the price pressure that consumers quite rightly highlight in relation to petrol prices and other liquid fuels. If we were to mandate or in some way regulate a capacity on the commercial market it would drive up prices for Australian consumers. So it is a balancing act to try to understand what the supply chain is, the parts where there are weaknesses and how we can work constructively with industry to make sure that we have both reliability and security of supply whilst making fuels available for Australian consumers, whether they be farmers or people in the cities who need that fuel for their daily life. That needs to be  done in a way that does not drive up prices but achieves the outcome that the government is looking for. We understand the factors that have led Senator Madigan to put forward this motion. Studies have been done and there is currently a process underway in which Mr Blackburn and others have been advocating for further risk studies. I cease my remarks there.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:55):  Labor supports this motion. As last year's inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics into the refining industry found, having:


… domestic refining capacity is a worthwhile complement to imports as part of having reliable, mature and diverse supply chains for liquid fuels.


The energy sector is a major employer, providing work directly and indirectly for over 100,000 Australians. We know that the growth in employment in the domestic oil-refining sector is declining. That is concerning. The people employed in the sector are highly skilled, productive and loyal. When closures occur we should always do what we can to assist workers to find other work. This should always be a priority for both industry and government. This industry should not be abandoned. The domestic refining industry continues to play an important role in complementing our imports.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-08-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (15:56):  I commend Senator Madigan for putting forward this motion. It is a very important issue and one that shows that, yet again, we as a nation are not addressing an important issue with the gravity it deserves. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. It is an issue that I have been interested in for many years. When I was a member of the South Australian parliament I was very critical of the way that the Port Stanvac oil refinery was shut down by Mobil about 10 years ago. The state government did a very bad deal in handling the shutdown of that refinery. It was mothballed with no capacity for alternative competition to move into the refinery. We have had the situation in my home state of South Australia where fuel supplies are precarious. If something goes wrong with a ship, if it has been delayed at sea or breaks down, we could face a fuel crisis in South Australia with huge economic and social consequences.


Let us put this in perspective. Refining in Australia has been in in free-fall for several years—it is down 30 per cent in two years and will continue to drop—as local refiners find themselves stranded with obsolete facilities and unable to compete with huge refineries overseas. Shell closed its Sydney refinery at Clyde in 2012. Caltex's closure later this year of its Kurnell refinery in Sydney means that Sydney will, for the first time since the 1920s—that is 90 years—be reliant entirely on imported fuel. BP has announced it will close its Bulwer refinery in Brisbane in mid-2015. South Australia lost its sole refinery in 2003—that is 11 years ago. These closures mean the loss of thousands of jobs—a huge challenge for each of those families. Senator Madigan and I have been campaigning relentlessly about manufacturing jobs in this country. These are manufacturing jobs we are losing.


Today we are talking about fuel security in addition to job security. Australia will be left with four remaining refineries: BP's Kwinana unit in WA; Shell's Geelong refinery, which was this year sold to Vitol of Switzerland; Caltex's Lytton refinery in Brisbane, which recently announced more than 100 job losses as it seeks to cut costs and stay open; and ExxonMobil's Altona refinery in Melbourne. An NRMA report in February found that Australia will source 90 per cent of its liquid fuel needs from overseas by 2015 and predicted that by 2030 that will become a complete dependence on offshore sources of fuel. The contraction in Australia's liquid fuel supplies is not a surprise. It has been long expected and the dynamics driving it are well understood. Yet no Australian government has adequately assessed or planned for the obvious risks to our economy and society of a disruption to overseas fuel supplies.


I endorse strongly endorse the comments of Senator Madigan in relation to the national security implications of this. If there is a conflict—if sea lanes are disrupted in an increasingly uncertain world—where does that leave us as a nation? It will bring us to a standstill. We are drifting towards a very insecure future, bobbing on a sea of risks and uncertainties in the global fuel market.


And yet it seems to be business as usual. Our national dependence on liquid fuels outsourced to pitiless fuel multinationals. Surely, it is time for the federal government to assert the national interest and plan for a minimum fuel-refining capacity in this country and for minimum fuel supplies. The United States and other countries do it; we have been absolute mugs when it comes to this. I am not sure if Senator Madigan can assist me, but I think the level of fuel supplies we have at the moment is for weeks and not the months that we actually need. The NRMA report, Australia's liquid fuel security, released in February this year, found we would be left high and dry if there were a significant disruption to overseas shipping lanes, refining capacity or oil production. It warned that Australia would have about three weeks of fuel on hand, if supplies were halted for whatever reason, from 2015.


That is a national scandal. If demand were high—as in a run on fuel supplies in an emergency—stocks would scarcely last a week, the NRMA warned. Senator Madigan gently reminded me that we nearly ran out of diesel last year, and in his home town of Ballarat there was a diesel fuel shortage. I did not go to the joint standing committee briefing, but I previously received a one-on-one briefing with Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn, the author of that report. I commend him for the tremendous work he is doing. This is what he had to say: 


If this happens, then Australians will suffer food shortages, will not have adequate access to medical services or pharmaceutical supplies, will not be able to get to work and, if the problem lasts for more than a  few weeks, many will no longer have work to go to.


This motion that has been introduced by Senator Madigan deserves our strong support; it deserves not just our words but action from the Australian government. We cannot put our heads in the sand on this issue; we must act decisively on our fuel supply. The NRMA suggests we need at least 30 per cent of our fuel refined here in Australia if we are to avoid the worst effects of unforseen crises in shipping, the oil sector or global refining capacity. Why isn't the government looking at this?


Since 2005 I have been warning of Australia's limited refining capacity, when a secret South Australian government report warned that my home state was regularly running dangerously low on fuel. These are the issues that need to be dealt with. I hope Senator Madigan will raise it again. As I do on many other issues, I will work collaboratively with Senator Madigan on this issue because it deserves to be at the forefront of the government's attention; it has not been to date. If we do not tackle the issue sooner rather than later, it will lead to a national emergency and it will have calamitous consequences for our economy and our society. This issue will not go away—we must tackle it as a nation. I again commend Senator Madigan for raising this issue.


Question agreed to.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-08-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:04):  This relates to legislation I introduced back in 2012, which is still on the Notice Paper and which needs to be debated and dealt with. The aim of the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 is to detect and reduce money laundering in Australia's more than 5,400 poker-machine venues. Back in 2012, when I first introduced this bill to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, reports were emerging of a Melbourne hotel that had failed to act on suspicions of money laundering through its poker machines. Records showed an individual and his family were claiming winnings of up to $40,000 per week. Anyone who knows anything about poker machines will tell you these odds are nigh-on impossible.


The report—by Adam Shand and Chip Le Grand of the Australian—was just the tip of the iceberg of the use by criminals of poker machines for money laundering. Unfortunately, the parliament did not support the bill on that occasion; and, unfortunately and predictably, the problem has not gone away. If anything it has gotten worse. The government's money laundering intelligence agency, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre AUSTRAC, recently detected a 'significant increase' in the number of suspicious activity reports in relation to the use of gaming machines, according to a report this month in News Ltd publications by Frank Chung. AUSTRAC chief executive John Schmidt said: 


AUSTRAC has undertaken focused regulatory activities in the pubs and clubs sector around suspicious-matter reporting over the past few years. 


By consulting with our partner agencies in law enforcement, AUSTRAC has been able to identify patterns of behaviour that potentially constitute money laundering in hotels and clubs operating electronic gaming machines.


Regulatory engagement with the licenced venues, including sharing examples of risky patron behaviour, has helped to improve awareness and identification of potential money laundering activity.


AUSTRAC went on to say:


This work, coupled with the provision of specific guidance to industry, has created greater awareness of the money laundering risks in the industry and has resulted in a significant increase in suspicious-matter reporting being received by AUSTRAC.


I applaud the work of AUSTRAC and its partners in law enforcement, including the AFP, as well as cooperating licensed venues.


A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police told News Ltd that the AFP was targeting money laundering, including in gaming machine venues. That person said:


The methods by which money may be laundered are varied and can range in sophistication. Organised criminal syndicates use a variety of methods and avenues, including matters involving the gaming sector. 


The next comment by the AFP is crucial to understanding why it is essential that parliament look again at this bill that I have introduced again. The AFP spokesperson said:


Both state and federal police can lay charges under money laundering legislation. It is also important to note that the regulation of poker machines is a matter for states and territories.


The AFP enforces money-laundering offences but it can only charge an organised crime figure or group with money-laundering offences if the crime has been detected in the first place. This bill, if passed, will dramatically improve the ability of AUSTRAC and the AFP to detect money laundering through poker machines. Improved detection will lead to more arrests and charges and, in the long run, less money laundering in Australia's suburban poker machine lounges and through our casinos.


The AFP spokesperson also put their finger on the single biggest obstacle to the reform of the gaming machine sector in the country; that is, state governments. State governments are hopelessly compromised via the more than $4 billion in taxes that they raise each year from poker machine operators. But I do not suggest for one minute that they want to see any of those taxes coming from money-laundering activities nor do I suggest that the poker machine sector or the industry itself would want to see any money coming from money-laundering activities, which is why I am gobsmacked that they do not support this very sensible and measured piece of legislation.


According to the current laws, gambling venue owners are supposed to report suspicious transactions, but there is no legal obligation. State governments cannot be trusted to curb the excesses of this industry and have failed to curb the extent of money laundering in their own backyards, although it is preferable for it to be undertaken through federal law. 


Industry sources, reported in TheSydney Morning Herald several years ago, have estimated that approximately $2 billion a year is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips each year nationally. The ability to load up poker machines with large amounts of cash, as well as the often lax regulations surrounding payouts, mean that launderers can and do get away with it. Criminals are attracted to poker machine venues because they are so commonplace. There are about 5,400 venues in Australia and many are darkly lit, anonymous places with very little face-to-face contact with staff or other customers.


The bill is even more necessary now than when I first introduced it in 2012. In that time, the number of poker machines has continued to expand, expanding the opportunities for criminals to use them for money laundering. One of the most recent assessment of poker machine numbers in Australia, based on state and territory figures from last July, indicates that Australia has about 200,000 poker machines across 5,400 venues. Combined, they reaped almost $13 billion in losses from Australians each year—forty per cent of that, parenthetically, is from problem gamblers, according to the Productivity Commission. I will not now go into the significant damage that that causes individuals, because the focus of this bill is in relation to money laundering.


This bill proposes to ensure that the extent of money laundering is restricted and that it is made much more difficult. Money laundering through poker machines can be achieved by one of two ways. Separately or in combination, criminals can load up thousands of dollars into a machine, up to but not above the trigger for payouts to be made by cheque. It is $10,000 in NSW, as I understand it. They then play a few games, usually losing a few dollars, and then cash out their credits with the venue—laundering the money in the process. Depending on the regulations in each state, careful so-called playing can ensure that the criminal walks out with thousands of dollars in clean—that is, laundered—money.


A second option for criminals, usually used in combination with the first, is to wait around venues until a gambler wins a prize. Depending on the regulations, winnings over a certain amount are issued by cheque to make sure that gamblers have a cooling-off period while the cheque is processed so that they do not gamble away their winnings. Instead, criminals approach gamblers and offer to buy the cheques off them for cash, often at a discount, which the gambler can then use to continue playing. The launderers then cash the cheques, which have been signed over by the original claimant and do not carry the name of the criminal.


This bill aims to address these practices through requiring that payouts over $1,000 are made by cheque and are threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Such transactions require a report made to AUSTRAC in the approved form under the act, allowing AUSTRAC to monitor and record such activity for the purposes of reducing money laundering and other prohibited actions. This reporting usually includes relevant personal details of the so-called winner and details of the transaction itself. 


The bill also requires that any cheques or credits for winnings that are transferred into another name are also threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and also requires the details of the new recipient of the cheque or credit to be reported to AUSTRAC. Failure by venues to comply with the act can result in a significant penalty.


It is important to note that because of the miserly nature of poker machine payouts, these changes will not be an undue burden on venues. There are not going to be that many transactions in a typical day that will be affected by this, but it will make a difference with the criminals who are laundering up to $2 billion a year of drug money that is made through organised crime and various illegal activities through poker machine venues. Poker machines rarely pay out in large amounts and instead are generally programmed to provide smaller, interspersed wins. Creating these two new definitions of threshold transactions will allow AUSTRAC access to information relating to larger wins and will lead to a fine-grain view of patterns and habits vital to uncovering criminal activity.


I am not suggesting that this will put an end to that criminal activity, but it is going to make it a lot harder and a lot more cumbersome for the criminals. It will make their lives just that little bit more miserable. It will mean that they will have to work a lot harder to try to launder money. It will mean that there is a higher risk of detection because of what they will have to do to get around what is being proposed. Under these proposals, each cheque drawn triggers a report to AUSTRAC and the AFP. Armed with the information on suspected money launderers, AUSTRAC and the AFP can then apply anti-money-laundering offences.


The bill, if passed, will also act as a deterrent to criminals who will no longer be able to use the machines to launder large amounts of cash. The bill also amends the act so that the controller of a poker machine venue will be considered to be providing a designated service under the act. This will mean that the controllers of poker machine venues will be required to abide by the laws surrounding threshold transactions. AUSTRAC already has regulations in place relating to some forms of gambling, including sports betting and casinos. These additional safeguards are a way to plug a loophole in the law, as well as protecting problem gamblers and venue owners.


Poker machines cause great harm in our communities. The poker machine sector is clearly wary of regulations. They fought and succeeded in stymying moves in the last parliament to limit the damage done to problem gamblers via $1 bets and mandatory precommitment, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Such measures, if adopted, would have made a real difference to many people's lives. Now, unfortunately, it appears that the poker machine lobby, the poker machine barons, will resist these simple measures to curb money laundering via poker machines. Clubs Australia Executive Director, Anthony Ball—Anthony, if you are listening, cheerio to you—has called this bill a 'waste of the time and resources of our federal parliament'. Mr Ball went on to say: 


This bill has been rejected by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee for Gambling Reform, and its introduction would only heap further regulatory burdens on clubs, which already have significant anti-money laundering compliance measures in place despite their low risk profile.


Mr Ball reckons that anyone attempting to launder money through poker machines would have to be the world's dumbest criminal due to the presence of CCTV cameras and existing identification requirements, saying, 'The only criminal who would try to do this is one who was desperate to get caught.' What nonsense. Mr Ball clearly, incredibly, has no understanding of what is going on in the venues he is meant to represent. He should pick up the phone and call AUSTRAC or the AFP.


By contrast, Adam Masters—one who does not have a vested interest in this issue—who is a researcher with the Transnational Research Institute on Corruption at the Australian National University, has said that lowering the threshold for reporting to AUSTRAC to $1,000 would 'definitely have an effect' on the profitability of money-laundering operations. Mr Masters, a former 25-year veteran with the AFP and a former team leader for Interpol in Australia, predicted the bill would impose 'minimal administrative burdens on venues'. The poker machine sector already fleeces close to $13 billion from Australians each year. It must not be permitted to impede what I believe is sensible reform, what Mr Masters from the Australian National University says would impose a minimal administrative burden on venues but would make a difference in terms of money-laundering operations, make it harder for the criminals to launder their money. 


The bill is an essential step towards bringing the scourge of money laundering in poker machine venues into sharp focus and allowing police and AUSTRAC to enforce the law. I urge my Senate colleagues to support it when it next comes before the Senate for a vote.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:17):  I rise to speak on Senator Xenophon's Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012. The government does not support this bill. This bill seeks to introduce amendments to existing legislation that will increase the regulatory demand on an already heavy regulated sector. 


Electronic gaming machine venues, such as casinos, hotels and clubs, must already comply with strict obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Depending on a venue's size, requirements under the existing act already include: having a program to identify, mitigate and manage money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk; identifying customers for transactions involving $10,000 or more; and reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more. All gaming venues are already required to report suspicious matters to AUSTRAC. 


The purpose of this bill is to amend the current act to lower the reporting threshold for gaming machine payments to $1,000. It also seeks to include the cashing of transferred cheques for amounts in excess of $1,000 in the definition of 'threshold transaction'. Under this bill these transactions would then have to be reported to AUSTRAC.


The government believes that the current regulatory framework, in place since 2006, provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to the level suggested would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues. During the passage of the original legislation, the appropriate threshold for reporting was extensively analysed. The government believes that this is an issue of balance and that the balance is currently struck in the right place. The outcome of that original analysis was to set the threshold at its current level of $10,000. There is simply no evidence that this needs to be amended, as currently proposed.


While we will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously, and that is why Minister Keenan recently announced changes to the customer due diligence obligations of regulated entities. These changes are designed to strengthen Australia's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. The announced changes apply to electronic-gaming venues, and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.


The ongoing work of gaming venues in customer due diligence, reporting threshold transactions and suspicious matters is of central importance. The government knows this and understands this and is acting on it. We believe AUSTRAC already works closely and collaboratively with industry and holds regular meetings with both state gaming regulators and industry associations to ensure that matters of concern are discussed and actioned where necessary, and also that all obligations under the act are understood. AUSTRAC has run a number of awareness campaigns over the last few years to increase awareness of the risk of money laundering through the use of electronic-gaming machines. As a result of these campaigns there has been a significant increase in the number of suspicious matter reports. In 2013-14, there were 381 suspicious matter reports, with a total value of $10.1 million. Compare this to 2012-13, when there were only 135, with a total value of $3.4 million. This indicates that education and awareness campaigns are working and are already having a significant effect in identifying money laundering through electronic gaming machines. These crucial measures assist law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate possible money laundering and other criminal activity connected to gaming venues in Australia.


I want to also touch on the excellent work of AUSTRAC in this area. I was very heartened to hear Senator Xenophon acknowledge the wonderful job that the organisation is doing. AUSTRAC, as the primary body responsible for tracking money laundering within Australia, plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and security of all Australians. For many years I had very close involvement and association with AUSTRAC. I have seen first-hand the wonderful job that that organisation does on behalf of all Australians.


AUSTRAC's role is to protect the integrity of Australia's financial system and to contribute to the administration of justice through countering money laundering and terrorism. They do excellent work in conjunction with Australia's other law enforcement agencies to counter the financing of terror and organised crime. AUSTRAC continues to work collaboratively with businesses and law enforcement to assess money laundering threats in Australia. These joint efforts improve our ability to prevent, deter and prosecute money laundering.


The government, through the Attorney-General's Department, is also currently undertaking a statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This very important review is estimated to be complete early in the new year. It will follow an on-site visit and mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force. The Financial Action Task Force is the world standard-setting organisation for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing. Australia, pleasingly, is currently the president of the Financial Action Task Force. This already reflects our position as the world leader in anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing.


Contrary to Senator Xenophon's assertions of undue influence on the government in relation to this matter, the government does believe that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small business.




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Reynolds has said that I made assertions that the government was subject to undue influence by the industry. I do not think that I actually said that. I will stand corrected, but I think that she has jumped the shark on that one.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Reynolds, I have to apologise. I was talking to the Leader of Opposition Business about the running order. I am sorry I completely missed it.




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I just ask that Senator Reynolds withdraw that comment. I have not accused the government of undue influence in relation to money laundering.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I do withdraw my comments. If I have misinterpreted the comments that Senator Xenophon made in relation to the organisation's influence on the government, I apologise.


The government believes that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering. Lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small businesses. This government is absolutely committed to reducing red tape in Australia by $1 billion each year and not increasing it. This commitment was realised in the first parliamentary repeal day in March this year and through other measures such as the National Gambling Regulator. The National Gaming Regulator and its associated measures duplicated the roles of state and territory regulators and foisted a huge, unnecessary and expensive red-tape burden on hospitality venues. While the government will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously. That is why Minister Keenan has announced changes, as I have previously stated, to the customer due diligence obligations. We believe that these changes will apply to electronic gaming venues and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.


Ongoing customer due diligence by gaming venues and the reporting of threshold transactions and suspicious matters where required are crucial measures that assist law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate possible money laundering and other criminal activities connected to gaming venues. AUSTRAC, with law enforcement and business, are continually assessing money laundering threats in Australia to improve joint efforts to prevent, deter and prosecute money laundering.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:27):  Senator Xenophon, we will continue to have these discussions in this chamber, as you well know. You will be bringing back your range of issues around gambling in Australia, as you need to do and as I know you will.


The bill before us is the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 [2013]. I am disappointed that we did not have the chance to consider this bill in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and that I could not refer to the evidence that we had received in committees that we have served on in the past on a range of gambling bills. I did go back and checked out the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, to which this bill and three others went. They brought down their report in June 2013. Quite disappointingly, considering the amount of discussion that Senator Xenophon has brought to us today and in statements over the last year and a half to two years on this issue, when this bill was brought to the joint select committee there were only two submissions. It was probably one of the bills that attracted the least interest in the wider community. Perhaps they were scared away by the legal nature of it. Perhaps they did not want to get involved in the discussions of AUSTRAC and the various processes there. It is really difficult to get a sense of where the rights of the argument are when you only have two submissions, as anyone would know. These submissions came from Clubs Australia and the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Unfortunately, whenever we get into these discussions, these two groups—who both have knowledge, who both have a passion and who both make public statements expressing concerns about problem gambling—consistently do not agree.


On this bill, there was again a great divide in the evidence they presented. The church antigambling group pointed out their worries about the process and about their inability to communicate effectively with people in positions of authority. They expressed their concerns about the sorts of issues Senator Xenophon was raising—the problems of money laundering and the extra pressure that puts on people. They had already identified the problem of compulsive gamblers and the awful consequences for them and their families—and no-one knows more about those issues than the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Those were the issues they raised. 


Understandably, the submission government received from Clubs Australia talked about the existing processes—just outlined here again by Senator Reynolds—the existing provisions under the act and the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill. They talked about the kinds of regulations and restrictions that already existed. Then, as we consistently hear in this debate, they emphasised what the impost on them, their businesses and their staff would be of any kind of restriction or any kind of regulation. Once again, then, as has consistently been the case in this debate, we have two groups who do not agree—two groups who, I think, far too often talk at each other rather than to each other and too often speak with third parties instead of with each other.


The Labor Party is not willing to support the bill as it is written—and Senator Xenophon knows that. We are concerned that there continues to be conflicting evidence. I take your point absolutely, Senator Xenophon, about the academic research you brought to us today—which I have not read and which was not with your bill—from the well-regarded researcher you named in your contribution. I put a great deal of value on that sort of work and would like to see it continue, especially since one of the main things that has came out of our debates over the last two years is the absolute need for more independent research—that is something that everyone agrees on, I think. When we get such research, we need to discuss it from all perspectives. We need to see how the data supports the different arguments about what the impacts would be, for example, of a reduction in the amount of money that could be gambled—that thousand-dollar limit. In that context, and referring also to the evidence from AUSTRAC and the work that has already been done, we could objectively assess the claims that we hear: that there are strict regulations in place, that clubs are already regulated, that they have responsibilities which they regularly review, and that they try to ensure that their processes for discharging those responsibilities are clearly set out and transparent. 


That is the argument that is going on. Clubs Australia—and, to an extent AUSTRAC—are saying that the way they are implementing the current legislation is effective. I do not believe that any piece of legislation should ever be sacrosanct. I think it is very important that, as questions are raised and as the process attracts interest, there should be an opportunity to go back and review what is going on. I think Senator Xenophon's bill highlights exactly that kind of discussion point. 


The government position has been put by Minister Andrews, that he was moving away from the work that had been done by the previous government—options for various trials and the concept of having a central regulatory point. Senator Reynolds outlined that in her contribution. The government's position was that they wanted to start anew, that they would like to move forward in a reasonable and effective way to consider the important issues of gambling. That received some media attention at the time. Certainly we had a discussion in this place about what was happening—the change from what the previous government had put in place. The budget then took away money that had been allocated by the previous government in this area, replaced by a promise from the incoming government that they would take us down a reasonable and responsible path towards finding some solutions. I say, 'Let's get on this path.' Let us get on this path so the kinds of issues that Senator Xenophon is talking about can be dealt with. Let us look at the evidence that has come forward and let us undertake engagement so that we can understand exactly what is going on in this disputed space. 


I shared a number of weeks on the community affairs committee with Senator Xenophon and other senators, all of whom were genuinely concerned about problem gambling in Australia. There was no doubt about that. There was no difference between the senators. In hearing them talk about the issue, you would not have been able to tell which party they belonged to or which group they represented. Certainly they took a genuine interest in these issues. We sat there for a number of hearings. First we heard, 'The sky is blue', and then we heard, 'The sky is black'—nothing, there was no agreement. As I said, what we have is an unresolved dispute. 


We now have a commitment from the new government to put in place this new, responsible process to look at gambling issues in our community. Well, we have been waiting—because there are many of us who would like to walk down this path together with the government in a responsible and responsive way. So far there has not been a lot of action. 


Certainly I believe the issue that Senator Xenophon has raised in this bill, which is the opportunity for criminal behaviour and money laundering to occur in our clubs, specifically around gaming machines, is a real issue. We need to see whether it is accurate and can be backed up by evidence and then balance that against the kinds of arguments we have heard pretty consistently from the clubs industry, which is about what impact bringing in yet another level of regulation would have on their business, their viability and the pleasure they provide to a number of people. If we are going to have a responsible, cooperative approach, then I stress this one paragraph we received from the government which talks about this new process 'engaging all stakeholders'. This has to happen. If you have heard me speak on this issue before, Mr Acting Deputy President, then you would know it has been the major process I have put on the table: we must engage all stakeholders. So far, I do not think we have been able to come up with any kind of common approach in this area. 


In hindsight, whilst our Senate community affairs process followed the standard model where we invite people to put in submissions, we call for public hearings, we have them, we put all the evidence together and then we talk about where we will go with our report—and I would think it is a very similar process to that of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform—we did not get the people together at any of these hearings. We heard sequential pieces of evidence from witnesses who were putting forward their own views. It should be done with everyone together, with the senators, so that we can see how people are interacting and responding to particular positions. 


In this case, the kinds of evidence that Senator Xenophon has concerns about is money laundering, the ease with which this could happen and the fact that, under the current provisions of the act, AUSTRAC would not be able to gather evidence into their process for consideration. I think it probably would be more useful to hear those voices together, not speaking over each other—which sometimes happens when we get excited in these processes—but face-to-face so that we can ask questions in an engaging way rather than one where we hear the evidence, we close it off, we sit down and we do not have a chance to say, 'What do you think about that?' So perhaps in the responsible and reasonable way that the government has said they are going to move forward on the gambling issue, we could look at having some cooperative process whereby we get people who care about the issue together. 


I would be particularly interested to hear more about the evidence that Senator Xenophon has just put forward, because if that kind of information has been put forward by researchers it would be useful to see the reaction to it by people who one would expect from previous experience would not share a similar consideration. This could be such a process, and I think many people would like to be engaged in it. Again, I stress that the difference is not the concern about people who are damaged by problem gambling. The difference is certainly not any concern about whether there should or should not be illegality in our registered clubs—and I think that is clear. In fact, in their submission to Senator Xenophon's Senate select gambling reform bill, Clubs Australia were very quick to point out that they actually take their legal responsibility particularly seriously and that they already have a relationship with AUSTRAC that is focused on ensuring that there are minimal opportunities for the kinds of issues Senator Xenophon describes in terms of people being able to launder money—money that would have been obtained in an illegal way and then put into legal tender so that it could be used in other ways. 'Cheque change' is one process whereby you can cash a cheque and then use that money in other ways. The clubs were clear that it was not common practice in their business. We need to see what evidence they have for that view, as opposed to the concerns about what could happen. 


The other thing that was raised—and this widens the whole thing—is that Senator Xenophon's bill is particularly about gambling machine venues, and we heard that consistently. I know that a series of the bills put forward by Senator Xenophon at the time were looking mainly at the area of gambling machines. If these things are occurring and there is an opportunity for people to invest money and for it to be used in ways that are illegal or inappropriate then surely that should exist across the board in all gambling areas. My experience of the gambling world is walking through a casino, and my observation of the activities while on those walk-throughs is that there are a whole range of temptations for people who want to be involved in gambling—and they are not just in the machine area where people can win significant amounts and then get into the kind of temptation that Senator Xenophon has specifically pointed out in his bill around gambling machines. 


As Senator Xenophon well knows, this debate will continue into the future in whatever way it will do so. At this stage, we are not supporting the bill in its current form. What we are supporting is that there needs to be continued action, because the problem has been identified. The reasonable and responsible response has yet to be identified. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:04):  This relates to legislation I introduced back in 2012, which is still on the Notice Paper and which needs to be debated and dealt with. The aim of the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 is to detect and reduce money laundering in Australia's more than 5,400 poker-machine venues. Back in 2012, when I first introduced this bill to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, reports were emerging of a Melbourne hotel that had failed to act on suspicions of money laundering through its poker machines. Records showed an individual and his family were claiming winnings of up to $40,000 per week. Anyone who knows anything about poker machines will tell you these odds are nigh-on impossible.


The report—by Adam Shand and Chip Le Grand of the Australian—was just the tip of the iceberg of the use by criminals of poker machines for money laundering. Unfortunately, the parliament did not support the bill on that occasion; and, unfortunately and predictably, the problem has not gone away. If anything it has gotten worse. The government's money laundering intelligence agency, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre AUSTRAC, recently detected a 'significant increase' in the number of suspicious activity reports in relation to the use of gaming machines, according to a report this month in News Ltd publications by Frank Chung. AUSTRAC chief executive John Schmidt said: 


AUSTRAC has undertaken focused regulatory activities in the pubs and clubs sector around suspicious-matter reporting over the past few years. 


By consulting with our partner agencies in law enforcement, AUSTRAC has been able to identify patterns of behaviour that potentially constitute money laundering in hotels and clubs operating electronic gaming machines.


Regulatory engagement with the licenced venues, including sharing examples of risky patron behaviour, has helped to improve awareness and identification of potential money laundering activity.


AUSTRAC went on to say:


This work, coupled with the provision of specific guidance to industry, has created greater awareness of the money laundering risks in the industry and has resulted in a significant increase in suspicious-matter reporting being received by AUSTRAC.


I applaud the work of AUSTRAC and its partners in law enforcement, including the AFP, as well as cooperating licensed venues.


A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police told News Ltd that the AFP was targeting money laundering, including in gaming machine venues. That person said:


The methods by which money may be laundered are varied and can range in sophistication. Organised criminal syndicates use a variety of methods and avenues, including matters involving the gaming sector. 


The next comment by the AFP is crucial to understanding why it is essential that parliament look again at this bill that I have introduced again. The AFP spokesperson said:


Both state and federal police can lay charges under money laundering legislation. It is also important to note that the regulation of poker machines is a matter for states and territories.


The AFP enforces money-laundering offences but it can only charge an organised crime figure or group with money-laundering offences if the crime has been detected in the first place. This bill, if passed, will dramatically improve the ability of AUSTRAC and the AFP to detect money laundering through poker machines. Improved detection will lead to more arrests and charges and, in the long run, less money laundering in Australia's suburban poker machine lounges and through our casinos.


The AFP spokesperson also put their finger on the single biggest obstacle to the reform of the gaming machine sector in the country; that is, state governments. State governments are hopelessly compromised via the more than $4 billion in taxes that they raise each year from poker machine operators. But I do not suggest for one minute that they want to see any of those taxes coming from money-laundering activities nor do I suggest that the poker machine sector or the industry itself would want to see any money coming from money-laundering activities, which is why I am gobsmacked that they do not support this very sensible and measured piece of legislation.


According to the current laws, gambling venue owners are supposed to report suspicious transactions, but there is no legal obligation. State governments cannot be trusted to curb the excesses of this industry and have failed to curb the extent of money laundering in their own backyards, although it is preferable for it to be undertaken through federal law. 


Industry sources, reported in TheSydney Morning Herald several years ago, have estimated that approximately $2 billion a year is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips each year nationally. The ability to load up poker machines with large amounts of cash, as well as the often lax regulations surrounding payouts, mean that launderers can and do get away with it. Criminals are attracted to poker machine venues because they are so commonplace. There are about 5,400 venues in Australia and many are darkly lit, anonymous places with very little face-to-face contact with staff or other customers.


The bill is even more necessary now than when I first introduced it in 2012. In that time, the number of poker machines has continued to expand, expanding the opportunities for criminals to use them for money laundering. One of the most recent assessment of poker machine numbers in Australia, based on state and territory figures from last July, indicates that Australia has about 200,000 poker machines across 5,400 venues. Combined, they reaped almost $13 billion in losses from Australians each year—forty per cent of that, parenthetically, is from problem gamblers, according to the Productivity Commission. I will not now go into the significant damage that that causes individuals, because the focus of this bill is in relation to money laundering.


This bill proposes to ensure that the extent of money laundering is restricted and that it is made much more difficult. Money laundering through poker machines can be achieved by one of two ways. Separately or in combination, criminals can load up thousands of dollars into a machine, up to but not above the trigger for payouts to be made by cheque. It is $10,000 in NSW, as I understand it. They then play a few games, usually losing a few dollars, and then cash out their credits with the venue—laundering the money in the process. Depending on the regulations in each state, careful so-called playing can ensure that the criminal walks out with thousands of dollars in clean—that is, laundered—money.


A second option for criminals, usually used in combination with the first, is to wait around venues until a gambler wins a prize. Depending on the regulations, winnings over a certain amount are issued by cheque to make sure that gamblers have a cooling-off period while the cheque is processed so that they do not gamble away their winnings. Instead, criminals approach gamblers and offer to buy the cheques off them for cash, often at a discount, which the gambler can then use to continue playing. The launderers then cash the cheques, which have been signed over by the original claimant and do not carry the name of the criminal.


This bill aims to address these practices through requiring that payouts over $1,000 are made by cheque and are threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Such transactions require a report made to AUSTRAC in the approved form under the act, allowing AUSTRAC to monitor and record such activity for the purposes of reducing money laundering and other prohibited actions. This reporting usually includes relevant personal details of the so-called winner and details of the transaction itself. 


The bill also requires that any cheques or credits for winnings that are transferred into another name are also threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and also requires the details of the new recipient of the cheque or credit to be reported to AUSTRAC. Failure by venues to comply with the act can result in a significant penalty.


It is important to note that because of the miserly nature of poker machine payouts, these changes will not be an undue burden on venues. There are not going to be that many transactions in a typical day that will be affected by this, but it will make a difference with the criminals who are laundering up to $2 billion a year of drug money that is made through organised crime and various illegal activities through poker machine venues. Poker machines rarely pay out in large amounts and instead are generally programmed to provide smaller, interspersed wins. Creating these two new definitions of threshold transactions will allow AUSTRAC access to information relating to larger wins and will lead to a fine-grain view of patterns and habits vital to uncovering criminal activity.


I am not suggesting that this will put an end to that criminal activity, but it is going to make it a lot harder and a lot more cumbersome for the criminals. It will make their lives just that little bit more miserable. It will mean that they will have to work a lot harder to try to launder money. It will mean that there is a higher risk of detection because of what they will have to do to get around what is being proposed. Under these proposals, each cheque drawn triggers a report to AUSTRAC and the AFP. Armed with the information on suspected money launderers, AUSTRAC and the AFP can then apply anti-money-laundering offences.


The bill, if passed, will also act as a deterrent to criminals who will no longer be able to use the machines to launder large amounts of cash. The bill also amends the act so that the controller of a poker machine venue will be considered to be providing a designated service under the act. This will mean that the controllers of poker machine venues will be required to abide by the laws surrounding threshold transactions. AUSTRAC already has regulations in place relating to some forms of gambling, including sports betting and casinos. These additional safeguards are a way to plug a loophole in the law, as well as protecting problem gamblers and venue owners.


Poker machines cause great harm in our communities. The poker machine sector is clearly wary of regulations. They fought and succeeded in stymying moves in the last parliament to limit the damage done to problem gamblers via $1 bets and mandatory precommitment, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Such measures, if adopted, would have made a real difference to many people's lives. Now, unfortunately, it appears that the poker machine lobby, the poker machine barons, will resist these simple measures to curb money laundering via poker machines. Clubs Australia Executive Director, Anthony Ball—Anthony, if you are listening, cheerio to you—has called this bill a 'waste of the time and resources of our federal parliament'. Mr Ball went on to say: 


This bill has been rejected by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee for Gambling Reform, and its introduction would only heap further regulatory burdens on clubs, which already have significant anti-money laundering compliance measures in place despite their low risk profile.


Mr Ball reckons that anyone attempting to launder money through poker machines would have to be the world's dumbest criminal due to the presence of CCTV cameras and existing identification requirements, saying, 'The only criminal who would try to do this is one who was desperate to get caught.' What nonsense. Mr Ball clearly, incredibly, has no understanding of what is going on in the venues he is meant to represent. He should pick up the phone and call AUSTRAC or the AFP.


By contrast, Adam Masters—one who does not have a vested interest in this issue—who is a researcher with the Transnational Research Institute on Corruption at the Australian National University, has said that lowering the threshold for reporting to AUSTRAC to $1,000 would 'definitely have an effect' on the profitability of money-laundering operations. Mr Masters, a former 25-year veteran with the AFP and a former team leader for Interpol in Australia, predicted the bill would impose 'minimal administrative burdens on venues'. The poker machine sector already fleeces close to $13 billion from Australians each year. It must not be permitted to impede what I believe is sensible reform, what Mr Masters from the Australian National University says would impose a minimal administrative burden on venues but would make a difference in terms of money-laundering operations, make it harder for the criminals to launder their money. 


The bill is an essential step towards bringing the scourge of money laundering in poker machine venues into sharp focus and allowing police and AUSTRAC to enforce the law. I urge my Senate colleagues to support it when it next comes before the Senate for a vote.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:17):  I rise to speak on Senator Xenophon's Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012. The government does not support this bill. This bill seeks to introduce amendments to existing legislation that will increase the regulatory demand on an already heavy regulated sector. 


Electronic gaming machine venues, such as casinos, hotels and clubs, must already comply with strict obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Depending on a venue's size, requirements under the existing act already include: having a program to identify, mitigate and manage money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk; identifying customers for transactions involving $10,000 or more; and reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more. All gaming venues are already required to report suspicious matters to AUSTRAC. 


The purpose of this bill is to amend the current act to lower the reporting threshold for gaming machine payments to $1,000. It also seeks to include the cashing of transferred cheques for amounts in excess of $1,000 in the definition of 'threshold transaction'. Under this bill these transactions would then have to be reported to AUSTRAC.


The government believes that the current regulatory framework, in place since 2006, provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to the level suggested would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues. During the passage of the original legislation, the appropriate threshold for reporting was extensively analysed. The government believes that this is an issue of balance and that the balance is currently struck in the right place. The outcome of that original analysis was to set the threshold at its current level of $10,000. There is simply no evidence that this needs to be amended, as currently proposed.


While we will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously, and that is why Minister Keenan recently announced changes to the customer due diligence obligations of regulated entities. These changes are designed to strengthen Australia's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. The announced changes apply to electronic-gaming venues, and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.


The ongoing work of gaming venues in customer due diligence, reporting threshold transactions and suspicious matters is of central importance. The government knows this and understands this and is acting on it. We believe AUSTRAC already works closely and collaboratively with industry and holds regular meetings with both state gaming regulators and industry associations to ensure that matters of concern are discussed and actioned where necessary, and also that all obligations under the act are understood. AUSTRAC has run a number of awareness campaigns over the last few years to increase awareness of the risk of money laundering through the use of electronic-gaming machines. As a result of these campaigns there has been a significant increase in the number of suspicious matter reports. In 2013-14, there were 381 suspicious matter reports, with a total value of $10.1 million. Compare this to 2012-13, when there were only 135, with a total value of $3.4 million. This indicates that education and awareness campaigns are working and are already having a significant effect in identifying money laundering through electronic gaming machines. These crucial measures assist law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate possible money laundering and other criminal activity connected to gaming venues in Australia.


I want to also touch on the excellent work of AUSTRAC in this area. I was very heartened to hear Senator Xenophon acknowledge the wonderful job that the organisation is doing. AUSTRAC, as the primary body responsible for tracking money laundering within Australia, plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and security of all Australians. For many years I had very close involvement and association with AUSTRAC. I have seen first-hand the wonderful job that that organisation does on behalf of all Australians.


AUSTRAC's role is to protect the integrity of Australia's financial system and to contribute to the administration of justice through countering money laundering and terrorism. They do excellent work in conjunction with Australia's other law enforcement agencies to counter the financing of terror and organised crime. AUSTRAC continues to work collaboratively with businesses and law enforcement to assess money laundering threats in Australia. These joint efforts improve our ability to prevent, deter and prosecute money laundering.


The government, through the Attorney-General's Department, is also currently undertaking a statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This very important review is estimated to be complete early in the new year. It will follow an on-site visit and mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force. The Financial Action Task Force is the world standard-setting organisation for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing. Australia, pleasingly, is currently the president of the Financial Action Task Force. This already reflects our position as the world leader in anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing.


Contrary to Senator Xenophon's assertions of undue influence on the government in relation to this matter, the government does believe that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small business.




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Reynolds has said that I made assertions that the government was subject to undue influence by the industry. I do not think that I actually said that. I will stand corrected, but I think that she has jumped the shark on that one.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Reynolds, I have to apologise. I was talking to the Leader of Opposition Business about the running order. I am sorry I completely missed it.




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I just ask that Senator Reynolds withdraw that comment. I have not accused the government of undue influence in relation to money laundering.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I do withdraw my comments. If I have misinterpreted the comments that Senator Xenophon made in relation to the organisation's influence on the government, I apologise.


The government believes that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering. Lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small businesses. This government is absolutely committed to reducing red tape in Australia by $1 billion each year and not increasing it. This commitment was realised in the first parliamentary repeal day in March this year and through other measures such as the National Gambling Regulator. The National Gaming Regulator and its associated measures duplicated the roles of state and territory regulators and foisted a huge, unnecessary and expensive red-tape burden on hospitality venues. While the government will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously. That is why Minister Keenan has announced changes, as I have previously stated, to the customer due diligence obligations. We believe that these changes will apply to electronic gaming venues and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.


Ongoing customer due diligence by gaming venues and the reporting of threshold transactions and suspicious matters where required are crucial measures that assist law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate possible money laundering and other criminal activities connected to gaming venues. AUSTRAC, with law enforcement and business, are continually assessing money laundering threats in Australia to improve joint efforts to prevent, deter and prosecute money laundering.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:27):  Senator Xenophon, we will continue to have these discussions in this chamber, as you well know. You will be bringing back your range of issues around gambling in Australia, as you need to do and as I know you will.


The bill before us is the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 [2013]. I am disappointed that we did not have the chance to consider this bill in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and that I could not refer to the evidence that we had received in committees that we have served on in the past on a range of gambling bills. I did go back and checked out the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, to which this bill and three others went. They brought down their report in June 2013. Quite disappointingly, considering the amount of discussion that Senator Xenophon has brought to us today and in statements over the last year and a half to two years on this issue, when this bill was brought to the joint select committee there were only two submissions. It was probably one of the bills that attracted the least interest in the wider community. Perhaps they were scared away by the legal nature of it. Perhaps they did not want to get involved in the discussions of AUSTRAC and the various processes there. It is really difficult to get a sense of where the rights of the argument are when you only have two submissions, as anyone would know. These submissions came from Clubs Australia and the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Unfortunately, whenever we get into these discussions, these two groups—who both have knowledge, who both have a passion and who both make public statements expressing concerns about problem gambling—consistently do not agree.


On this bill, there was again a great divide in the evidence they presented. The church antigambling group pointed out their worries about the process and about their inability to communicate effectively with people in positions of authority. They expressed their concerns about the sorts of issues Senator Xenophon was raising—the problems of money laundering and the extra pressure that puts on people. They had already identified the problem of compulsive gamblers and the awful consequences for them and their families—and no-one knows more about those issues than the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Those were the issues they raised. 


Understandably, the submission government received from Clubs Australia talked about the existing processes—just outlined here again by Senator Reynolds—the existing provisions under the act and the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill. They talked about the kinds of regulations and restrictions that already existed. Then, as we consistently hear in this debate, they emphasised what the impost on them, their businesses and their staff would be of any kind of restriction or any kind of regulation. Once again, then, as has consistently been the case in this debate, we have two groups who do not agree—two groups who, I think, far too often talk at each other rather than to each other and too often speak with third parties instead of with each other.


The Labor Party is not willing to support the bill as it is written—and Senator Xenophon knows that. We are concerned that there continues to be conflicting evidence. I take your point absolutely, Senator Xenophon, about the academic research you brought to us today—which I have not read and which was not with your bill—from the well-regarded researcher you named in your contribution. I put a great deal of value on that sort of work and would like to see it continue, especially since one of the main things that has came out of our debates over the last two years is the absolute need for more independent research—that is something that everyone agrees on, I think. When we get such research, we need to discuss it from all perspectives. We need to see how the data supports the different arguments about what the impacts would be, for example, of a reduction in the amount of money that could be gambled—that thousand-dollar limit. In that context, and referring also to the evidence from AUSTRAC and the work that has already been done, we could objectively assess the claims that we hear: that there are strict regulations in place, that clubs are already regulated, that they have responsibilities which they regularly review, and that they try to ensure that their processes for discharging those responsibilities are clearly set out and transparent. 


That is the argument that is going on. Clubs Australia—and, to an extent AUSTRAC—are saying that the way they are implementing the current legislation is effective. I do not believe that any piece of legislation should ever be sacrosanct. I think it is very important that, as questions are raised and as the process attracts interest, there should be an opportunity to go back and review what is going on. I think Senator Xenophon's bill highlights exactly that kind of discussion point. 


The government position has been put by Minister Andrews, that he was moving away from the work that had been done by the previous government—options for various trials and the concept of having a central regulatory point. Senator Reynolds outlined that in her contribution. The government's position was that they wanted to start anew, that they would like to move forward in a reasonable and effective way to consider the important issues of gambling. That received some media attention at the time. Certainly we had a discussion in this place about what was happening—the change from what the previous government had put in place. The budget then took away money that had been allocated by the previous government in this area, replaced by a promise from the incoming government that they would take us down a reasonable and responsible path towards finding some solutions. I say, 'Let's get on this path.' Let us get on this path so the kinds of issues that Senator Xenophon is talking about can be dealt with. Let us look at the evidence that has come forward and let us undertake engagement so that we can understand exactly what is going on in this disputed space. 


I shared a number of weeks on the community affairs committee with Senator Xenophon and other senators, all of whom were genuinely concerned about problem gambling in Australia. There was no doubt about that. There was no difference between the senators. In hearing them talk about the issue, you would not have been able to tell which party they belonged to or which group they represented. Certainly they took a genuine interest in these issues. We sat there for a number of hearings. First we heard, 'The sky is blue', and then we heard, 'The sky is black'—nothing, there was no agreement. As I said, what we have is an unresolved dispute. 


We now have a commitment from the new government to put in place this new, responsible process to look at gambling issues in our community. Well, we have been waiting—because there are many of us who would like to walk down this path together with the government in a responsible and responsive way. So far there has not been a lot of action. 


Certainly I believe the issue that Senator Xenophon has raised in this bill, which is the opportunity for criminal behaviour and money laundering to occur in our clubs, specifically around gaming machines, is a real issue. We need to see whether it is accurate and can be backed up by evidence and then balance that against the kinds of arguments we have heard pretty consistently from the clubs industry, which is about what impact bringing in yet another level of regulation would have on their business, their viability and the pleasure they provide to a number of people. If we are going to have a responsible, cooperative approach, then I stress this one paragraph we received from the government which talks about this new process 'engaging all stakeholders'. This has to happen. If you have heard me speak on this issue before, Mr Acting Deputy President, then you would know it has been the major process I have put on the table: we must engage all stakeholders. So far, I do not think we have been able to come up with any kind of common approach in this area. 


In hindsight, whilst our Senate community affairs process followed the standard model where we invite people to put in submissions, we call for public hearings, we have them, we put all the evidence together and then we talk about where we will go with our report—and I would think it is a very similar process to that of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform—we did not get the people together at any of these hearings. We heard sequential pieces of evidence from witnesses who were putting forward their own views. It should be done with everyone together, with the senators, so that we can see how people are interacting and responding to particular positions. 


In this case, the kinds of evidence that Senator Xenophon has concerns about is money laundering, the ease with which this could happen and the fact that, under the current provisions of the act, AUSTRAC would not be able to gather evidence into their process for consideration. I think it probably would be more useful to hear those voices together, not speaking over each other—which sometimes happens when we get excited in these processes—but face-to-face so that we can ask questions in an engaging way rather than one where we hear the evidence, we close it off, we sit down and we do not have a chance to say, 'What do you think about that?' So perhaps in the responsible and reasonable way that the government has said they are going to move forward on the gambling issue, we could look at having some cooperative process whereby we get people who care about the issue together. 


I would be particularly interested to hear more about the evidence that Senator Xenophon has just put forward, because if that kind of information has been put forward by researchers it would be useful to see the reaction to it by people who one would expect from previous experience would not share a similar consideration. This could be such a process, and I think many people would like to be engaged in it. Again, I stress that the difference is not the concern about people who are damaged by problem gambling. The difference is certainly not any concern about whether there should or should not be illegality in our registered clubs—and I think that is clear. In fact, in their submission to Senator Xenophon's Senate select gambling reform bill, Clubs Australia were very quick to point out that they actually take their legal responsibility particularly seriously and that they already have a relationship with AUSTRAC that is focused on ensuring that there are minimal opportunities for the kinds of issues Senator Xenophon describes in terms of people being able to launder money—money that would have been obtained in an illegal way and then put into legal tender so that it could be used in other ways. 'Cheque change' is one process whereby you can cash a cheque and then use that money in other ways. The clubs were clear that it was not common practice in their business. We need to see what evidence they have for that view, as opposed to the concerns about what could happen. 


The other thing that was raised—and this widens the whole thing—is that Senator Xenophon's bill is particularly about gambling machine venues, and we heard that consistently. I know that a series of the bills put forward by Senator Xenophon at the time were looking mainly at the area of gambling machines. If these things are occurring and there is an opportunity for people to invest money and for it to be used in ways that are illegal or inappropriate then surely that should exist across the board in all gambling areas. My experience of the gambling world is walking through a casino, and my observation of the activities while on those walk-throughs is that there are a whole range of temptations for people who want to be involved in gambling—and they are not just in the machine area where people can win significant amounts and then get into the kind of temptation that Senator Xenophon has specifically pointed out in his bill around gambling machines. 


As Senator Xenophon well knows, this debate will continue into the future in whatever way it will do so. At this stage, we are not supporting the bill in its current form. What we are supporting is that there needs to be continued action, because the problem has been identified. The reasonable and responsible response has yet to be identified. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:45):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The progress report on the Implementation and Administration of the National Disability Insurance Scheme was written by the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS, of which I am a member, and I commend the secretariat for their assistance. I also want to commend the staff of the National Disability Insurance Agency, service providers, carers, and of course the people with a disability who have worked so hard to see the NDIS dream become a reality.


The NDIS represents a milestone in Australian history. It was designed and launched by the previous Labor government in recognition of the fact that people with a disability deserve a fair go. They deserve the opportunity to actively take part in work, school and community life, and they deserve the individual support needed to do this. This is exactly what NDIS offers—a unified system that identifies and prioritises the needs of the individual; a system that promises Australians with a disability, their families and their carers more control over their lives, more certainty over their care and more opportunities to contribute productively to the nation.


The NDIS report before us today logs the first steps toward the full rollout of this landmark initiative and gauges how we are progressing. It is the result of evidence the committee gathered from public hearings in the Barwon, Hunter, South Australian and Tasmanian trial sites in April and May. Today, I would like to talk about the progress of the rollout in Tasmania, which on 31 March was on track to support 1,000 Tasmanians with a disability aged between 15 and 24 in its first year. This is a particularly important trial that will inform future NDIS rollouts across the country on how we can best support our young people with a disability as they transition from school to work or further training. From 2016, the rollout will be opened up to other people with a disability. It is predicted that it will support more than 10,000 Tasmanians in the future.


The report notes the success of the Tasmanian rollout in effective planning, objectives being met, dramatically reduced waiting lists and great feedback from participants. It also recognises that the groundwork for these great outcomes was laid very early on. This was helped by comprehensive data from both the state government and the gateway service for people with disabilities. It meant that tailored consent processes and early planning measures could be devised well in advance of launch.


Another great strength of the Tasmanian rollout has been its effective engagement strategy which has resulted in strong relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. In fact, the committee believes the Tasmanian engagement strategy offers a good model for other areas to replicate. The report also notes that, with the exception of those seeking housing and respite services, there are no waiting lists for the Tasmanian trial site.


The most worthwhile achievement outlined in the report is that the Tasmanian rollout is meeting the needs of its participants. In fact, 95 per cent of those surveyed indicated strong satisfaction in the process and outcomes they have had to date through the trial. This is an impressive statistic indeed, but perhaps the words of Mr John Coyle tell the more important human story. Mr Coyle is the father and full-time carer of three children, two of whom have severe intellectual difficulties. Here is what he said about the experience of his family with the NDIS rollout in Tasmania:


With the advent of the NDIS we are given a lot more individual control.


We go armed with the funding; so, when we approach a service provider, we are spoken to differently, we can tailor our situation and my children's development can be targeted … That was non-existent before …


The NDIS is probably a godsend for us and I hope it continues. Now I have one-on-one support for my daughter, I can be the carer for my son.


I commend this report to the Senate, congratulate all involved with this rollout and acknowledge what a superb success it has been. By the time the full scheme starts in 2018, more than 460,000 Australians with disability will take part in the National Disability Insurance Scheme—and all Australians will benefit.


NDIS is a groundbreaking program that will ensure a more inclusive, more productive Australia for all of us. To my colleagues on the other side, I urge that you maintain your support for this vital initiative into the future.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-08-28,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:38):  In our first week of sittings following the winter recess, I am grateful for the opportunity to reflect on a very significant international event that Australia had the privilege of hosting just last month. I am speaking of AIDS 2014, the premier international gathering that brings together renowned experts working in the HIV field around the globe, along with policy and decision makers, those who are living with the reality of HIV in their lives as well as others with an interest and commitment to ending HIV.


The conference is held every two years and is widely acknowledged by those working in HIV research and policy as the pre-eminent gathering of experts. Australia should be proud to have hosted such a prestigious event and for the opportunity to share with delegates our nation's success in the fight against HIV, which has always been a strongly community-driven effort. 


The conference, held in Melbourne from 20 July to 25 July convened around 14,000 delegates, including around 1000 media representatives. I was enormously pleased to have the opportunity of attending several days of the conference to discuss Australia's efforts in this field with those from other countries and to learn from each other's stories. I did so in my capacity as chair of the Parliamentary Friends of HIV/AIDS, Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. 


There were presentations from renowned scientific and medical experts, policy makers and those recognised as driving forces in campaigning to end discrimination against those suffering from HIV and AIDS. There were also high-profile speakers who provided keynote addresses during the days of the conference, including former Justice of the High Court Michael Kirby, former President of the United States of America Bill Clinton and musician Sir Bob Geldof, whose commitment to improving health and lives in Africa is particularly well-understood and well-documented.


This year, of course, the conference began on a particularly sombre note. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a tragedy for many nations around the world, not least our own, with the loss of 38 of our fellow Australians. This senseless tragedy also had a direct bearing on the AIDS 2014 conference. Six of those lost aboard MH17 were en route to Melbourne to participate in the conference. Among them were the World Health Organization's media officer, Glenn Thomas, as well as Dr Joep Lange, a former president of the International AIDS Society who had been involved in the fight against HIV from the very beginning. His work was crucial in the development of the antiretroviral therapy that is integral to the treatment of HIV today. Dr Lange was also a key force in the development of methodologies to prevent mother-to-child transmission. His passing, and that of his partner, Dr Jacqueline van Tongeren, is an incalculable loss to the field of HIV research globally. 


The opening session of the conference paid tribute to these and three other Dutch delegates who lost their lives in the tragedy. The conference proceeded inspired by the spirit of their dedication to ending the HIV epidemic around the world. 


The opening plenary address given by the Hon. Michael Kirby was all at once moving, insightful, elegant and engaging. I would encourage my fellow senators to obtain a copy and read it, because there are clear messages in it for all of us. The standout message is a simple one—'We are in this together.' Just as HIV-AIDS does not discriminate between classes, races or geographic boundaries, Michael Kirby clearly articulated that not one side of politics has a monopoly on wisdom and compassion when it comes to the fight against AIDS.


Australia's initial response to AIDS—which came at a time when we knew very little about the condition and fear and panic abounded in some quarters—was forged in an atmosphere of bipartisanship. It is a credit to both major parties that they had within them people of the calibre of the then Minister for Health, Labor's Neal Blewett, and his opposition counterpart, Dr Peter Baume, who worked together to develop Australia's response, which is now widely acknowledged as being one of the more effective in our global community. 


I say this particularly in an international context because, as we know, there were some countries in the 1980s, when the disease first emerged, where political parties used fear of HIV-AIDS as a political weapon. There are still countries where this is the case, and I will come that shortly. I am pleased that this approach has endured for the past three decades through governments of both political hues. 


As a political conservative myself, I am particularly grateful to Michael Kirby for shining light on the fact that conservatives have played a leading role in the fight against HIV-AIDS, because it is not a point that is usually underlined in much of the commentary on the issue. But as Michael Kirby's speech pointed out, it was President George W Bush in the United States who established the PEPFAR Fund and who in retirement continues to provide leadership and promote the Global Fund that has helped save millions of vulnerable lives, especially in Africa. 


As was also pointed out, a conservative, conviction politician, such as our present Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, is also well placed to talk to certain political leaders at forums, such as CHOGM or the G20, to persuade them to take real action in their own countries to abandon the politics of fear in this area. They are more likely to be persuaded by him than by their political opponents was the suggestion. Given the Prime Minister's long record of commitment to the fight against HIV-AIDS, I am sure it is an opportunity he will not overlook. 


For all the progress that has been made in this country, both in the medical fight against HIV and the fight against discrimination, there remains an alarming number of countries in our world that continue to pursue policies that cause great harm to many of their citizens.


Many Australians would be shocked to learn that around four out of every five countries who are members of the Commonwealth, which itself accounts for 30 per cent of the world's population, still view homosexuality as a criminal offence. The Commonwealth comprises 53 nations. Of these, 42 continue to criminalise homosexuality. Tomorrow, 29 August, is Wear It Purple Day, which is an opportunity to show support for young LGBTI people in the fight against bullying and discrimination by wearing an article of purple clothing. I hope that in doing that we can also pause for a moment to think about these issues in a global context, because, while the fight to eliminate bullying and discrimination in our own country goes on, the global fight is a much bigger and more daunting challenge. To illustrate that point, it is helpful to consider Commonwealth countries by region. In Africa, 16 Commonwealth countries criminalise homosexuality. In the Americas, it is 11 countries. The situation is dire in Asia, where every member country of the Commonwealth, eight in total, continues to punish homosexuality. Even in our own Pacific region, only four nations—ourselves, New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu—have decriminalised homosexuality. The other seven Commonwealth nations in our region continue to have anti-homosexuality statutes on their books.


While these laws are often not enforced in Pacific nations, especially in the manner in which they are in Africa and the Americas, that is of no comfort. The continued existence of these laws inhibits progress towards genuine equality, such as the introduction of anti-discrimination laws. Even if they exist in name only, these discriminatory laws nonetheless need to be removed. As some commentators have noted, it is richly ironic that the existence of these laws in many Commonwealth countries is not because of something indigenous to their cultures but through the import of British laws criminalising homosexuality that existed in the past but no longer exist. Likewise, there are religious influences at play in some of these countries. But, again, in many cases these are influences imported from Europe, which is now the only region among Commonwealth countries that is entirely free of laws that criminalise homosexuality. For those who are interested, I encourage you to read an excellent survey of this issue by Paula Gerber: 'Living a life of crime: the ongoing criminalisation of homosexuality within the Commonwealth'.


Australia has always been influential in Commonwealth affairs. We took a leading role in the Commonwealth's fight against apartheid in South Africa. We took a leading role in the fight against the atrocities and injustices of Mugabe's Zimbabwe during John Howard's time in office. The fight to rid Commonwealth nations of laws that discriminate against their LGBTI citizens, like those battles of the past, is ultimately a fight for equality, and it is one where Australia can and must again play a leading role. I am confident that this effort is one that will enjoy the support of all Australians. This nation's enlightened approach to fighting both discrimination and the scourge of HIV/AIDS and our geographic proximity to some of the worst perpetrators of discrimination should see us taking a leading role.
