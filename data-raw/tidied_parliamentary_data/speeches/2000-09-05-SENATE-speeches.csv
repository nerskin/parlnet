"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—Madam President, yesterday I had a question from Senator Faulkner on missing computers in the Department of Defence. The Minister for Defence made it clear yesterday that he has insisted that the department tighten its security in relation to computer equipment. The government takes the loss and theft of departmental equipment very seriously. I am advised that investigations indicate that the 14 missing computers contained only low level material and therefore do not have significant national security implications. I can assure the Senate that internal security procedures in Defence have been tightened and this issue will continue to be pursued.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Defence: Missing Computer Equipment</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-05,"—We are dealing with an opposition amendment, to which the government has also proposed an amendment. The opposition amendment is proposed to ensure that troops will never be deployed against a peaceful protest. To achieve this objective, we are placing the tightest possible restrictions on the Commonwealth in using its constitutional powers to call out troops in domestic security situations. While the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000 currently also provides that the Chief of the Defence Force must not deploy troops to `stop or restrict any lawful protest or dissent', the opposition are concerned that the bill does not go far enough to ensure that the Defence Force can never be used in circumstances of peaceful protest. This is because the bill leaves open the possibility, even if it is only a hypothetical one, that troops could be used in response to a protest which is peaceful but unlawful—for reasons which may be wholly technical in nature.
We believe our amendment will effectively ensure that the defence forces will never be used against any peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. While our goals are similar to those of the Australian Greens on this issue, we do have problems with the formulation of the amendment proposed by Senator Brown, which would prevent the defence forces being deployed to restrict peaceful protest or civil disobedience. We believe this formulation is too imprecise and open-ended. Our amendment makes it clear that protest ceases to be peaceful where there is a reasonable likelihood of death or serious injury to persons. To this opposition amendment, the government seeks to add the words `or serious damage to property'. We have thought long and hard about the government's amendment. We have sought detailed elaboration of this proposal from the government in the course of the Senate debate and have pressed the government for numerous assurances in relation to the significance and intent of and the need for the amendment. We have discussed the amendment widely within the opposition, and we have considered it in caucus.
In determining whether this amendment is acceptable to us, we have considered the expression `serious damage to property' in the context of the bill as a whole. To have a call-out at all, certain conditions need to be present: not only domestic violence but violence of a kind that poses a threat to the capacity of the relevant state or territory to protect either itself or the Commonwealth; either a request for a call-out by the relevant state or territory or consultation between the Commonwealth and that state or territory; and the fact that the Governor-General must be satisfied—on the unanimous advice of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence—that these conditions have been met. Given these preconditions for a call-out, it is clear that serious damage to property must be occurring in the context of a situation which the police forces of the state or territory are already unable to control. This would clearly not be the case with, for example, a protest march or an industrial dispute where a window might be broken or a car tyre might be slashed. State and territory police are quite capable of handling matters such as those. Even during the most protracted industrial dispute in recent history, the waterfront dispute, at no stage could it have been said that any violence was beyond the capacity of the relevant police force to control. 
In response to opposition requests in the course of this debate, the government has stated that it considers that serious damage to property, in the context of the bill, contemplates damage such as damage to infrastructure, such as power stations, dams and telecommunication facilities; damage to hospitals; and damage to transport infrastructure, such as airports and railways. The government has also undertaken to set out these examples in the revised Manual of Land Warfare, and it has agreed to table the manual in the Senate. The manual has the status of general orders binding the defence forces. All of the government statements can be drawn on by the courts in any subsequent legal interpretation of this legislation.
The bill contains other restrictions which further constrain the way in which the defence forces may be utilised in the context of serious damage to property occurring. Once a call-out has occurred, the Chief of the Defence Force must utilise the Defence Force in a manner that is reasonable and necessary. The Chief of the Defence Force must ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, the Defence Force cooperates with the relevant state or territory police force and is not used for any particular task, unless a member of the police force requests in writing that the Defence Force be so used. In exercising powers relevant to serious damage to property, the authorising ministers must declare a general security area and publicise the fact.
Again and again in this debate, we have pointed out that no restrictions currently apply to the defence forces if they are called out under the executive power or under section 119 of the Constitution. It was because the bill does put in place those safeguards for the first time that we indicated we would support the passage of the bill. So, for the reasons that I have outlined, the opposition have determined that we are satisfied with the government's explanation of the need for its amendment and with the assurances it has given about circumstances in which the defence forces might conceivably be called upon to control violence involving a reasonable likelihood of serious damage to property. On that basis, the opposition will be supporting the government amendment, and I have indicated previously our strong commitment to the amendment that stands in my name on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—Following on from Senator Faulkner's comments, the government position, as I stated last night, is in relation to serious damage to property. What is contemplated by that term is damage to infrastructure such as power stations, dams, telecommunications facilities and hospitals; damage to transport infrastructure such as airports and train stations; wanton damage; and looting of property. It would also include damage such as the destruction of a moored oil tanker or drilling facility. These are some examples, and I undertake to include them in a supplementary explanatory memorandum in the other place, which I think will take it even further than I said last night. That will be done in the other place.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-05,"—There are a couple of things I should mention. First of all, no matter what you think of Senator Brown—and I think many things of Senator Brown—it should be noted that he is not here at the moment and that this is a subject about which he feels very strongly. This opposition amendment and the government's amendment to the opposition's amendment are things he feels particularly strongly about. I am sure we will hear from him when he returns from the funeral he has gone to—he should be back in about half an hour—but it is a pity that we are going to finish up with this amendment before he gets here. Business is often rearranged in this place because people cannot be here, and it is a pity, particularly on this amendment, that we have not rearranged this business a bit.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-05,"—I am aware that we are in a committee stage debate, but let me say I think the point Senator Bourne makes is a perfectly reasonable one. I was going to indicate to the committee at a later stage in the debate that Senator Brown told me he would be back in the Senate at around 4 o'clock this afternoon. He probably gave similar advice to Senator Bourne. I was going to inform the committee of that if there was the necessity; I was going to see whether Senator Brown was in attendance before the question was resolved. I accept Senator Bourne's point and would certainly have made the same point myself if it had been required. It is appropriate in this circumstance, given that Senator Brown extended the courtesy at least to me and to Senator Bourne of noting his unavoidable unavailability for that period of time. I am assuming, from the timetable he has indicated, that he may well be joining us. I have given up making predictions now about how long Senate committees might debate matters like this, but it is a proper point that Senator Bourne makes in the context of Senator Brown wanting to make a further contribution. He certainly indicated to us that he intended to do so.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-05,"—Thank you, Senator Faulkner, for making that clear. I think it is very sad that the opposition is agreeing with the government's amendment. The government's amendment is something that can be used far beyond what the government has indicated, if anybody wanted to. The fact that the opposition has now agreed to that amendment obviously means that there is now absolutely no hope whatsoever that this bill will not go through—it may go through tomorrow, but it will probably go through today. That is a very sad thing. I would certainly not agree with the government's amendment. I have even been looking at the opposition's amendment, and I wonder whether that amendment, even unamended, actually goes as far as the opposition says it does. I wonder whether it achieves what the opposition thinks it achieves. There are no strong definitions and it could be used, as far as I can see, pretty well under any circumstances. Who can tell whether circumstances will be such that anybody could be called out for anything. That is the question. It will not just be those three ministers who call out the troops in the first place; it will keep going down the line once they are called out. Where they are used will not be a matter for the Prime Minister, the defence minister and the Attorney-General. Where they are used will be a matter for somebody much closer to what is happening on the ground. I seriously question whether the opposition's amendment would achieve very much at all. I certainly do not think the government's amendment achieves very much at all.
It is as if we are debating a bill where troops have never been used in a civilian situation in Australia. Of course they have. We all know they have, and we all know they can be used again under exactly the same rules we are acting under now. The problem in the past has been to define exactly what those rules are. The question in relation to that definition comes down to how far those troops can be used against Australian citizens and how far they can be used where a situation may turn out to be violent against Australian citizens. That is the question we are defining. I do not think that is going to come up in the Olympics, I do not think it is going to come up at CHOGM and I do not think it is going to come up anywhere else in the very near future. I do not think Australia is about to become that dangerous a place; I would be astounded if it did. I think we can wait a couple of months and get this right. I do not think this is getting it right. This means that the opposition will now have the government's support for their amendment and therefore the opposition will vote for the bill. That is very sad. It is something that we should all regret, but I can see that it has happened. I will not be voting for it.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—I believe that there is the possibility that the source of the government's amendment to Labor's R3—which effectively speaks to the use of troops to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action—goes back quite some time, and I will be hoping to draw some comments from the minister in relation to some articles that appeared in the Australian in February and March of last year. In the Australian on Tuesday, 16 February 1999, Robert Garran, a defence writer, quoted the Chief of the Defence Force, Chris Barrie, as saying:
The Australian Defence Force must take a broader role that includes `constabulary' activities to deal with terrorists and other non-State threats to Australia's security.
The article goes on to say:
Future, military forces would have to provide the `widest range of military options to governments,' which would have to structure their forces against a broader range of threats than solely wars against other States.
It continues:
The challenge will be to design a force that is centred around the primary role of defending or deferring attacks against Australia or its interests, but which possesses strategic reach so it can be deployed quickly to operate at other levels of conflict.
There is a clear inference there that the Australian defence forces are being prepared `to operate at other levels of conflict'. Is the purpose behind the government's amendment to be able to deploy those troops against the citizens of Australia in such a way as was described in this article as `constabulary'? My understanding of the word `constabulary' is that it means `the role of the police force'. Is the government now intending to turn the Australian defence forces into a third level of police force? We have our state police. We have the Australian Federal Police. Is it the minister's intention to actually turn the ADF into a third police force?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—Just briefly, I think Admiral Barrie was referring then to the role of the ADF overseas. In fact, what he was not saying was that there was a greater role for the ADF in becoming a third police force. That certainly was not the case. I can assure the Senate and Senator Harris that there certainly was no intention there that the ADF become another police force. What Admiral Barrie was talking about was an overseas role, in peacekeeping in particular, which we have just seen in East Timor in a very effective way.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—The government's amendment is actually structured around section 51G(a) of the bill; and  the Labor Party's amendment is to delete that amendment and replace it with their preferred amendment. In the debate on this amendment the minister has continually referred to the level or the seriousness of damage to property. But I put to the minister that the call-out provisions in 51A(1)(b) state:
(b) if the domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur ...
We have got two options for calling out the Australian defences forces: either by the government through the three ministers or through the Governor-General of his own volition or at the request of a state. What I am looking for from the minister is an unequivocal assurance that that in relation to industrial relations the government will not countenance in any way, shape or form the mobilisation of the Australian defence forces under section 51A, which says `or is likely to occur'. I am seeking a clear commitment from the government, because I believe the bill in its present form under that section would allow the government to call out the defence forces against an industrial action, irrespective of whether there is serious damage to property.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—What this bill does is provide safeguards and constraints which do not exist at the moment. You must remember that. There are no constraints or restrictions like those you see in this current bill, and that is why this bill is good law: it is going to provide a transparent piece of legislation which will provide those constraints and checks and balances. What the opposition has moved—and on the basis of the opposition accepting the government's amendment we can support the opposition's amendment—says at 51G that you cannot have a situation where the Defence Force can be used to `stop or restrict any lawful protest or dissent'. What the opposition amendment is saying is that the Defence Force cannot `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons'—and we have added that provision in relation to property. 
You have that safeguard that, if any action is to be taken, there is that qualification contained in the opposition amendment. As well as that, there also has to be the satisfaction that domestic violence is occurring or that it is likely to occur. That, too, is a substantial qualification, because you cannot go in without that happening. In relation to the various call-outs, there is a Commonwealth call-out in section 51A, a state one in section 51B and a territory one in section 51C. Senator Harris has referred specifically to section 51A, and you have to look at the whole section there in order to appreciate the hurdles that have to be negotiated before action can be taken. In the first part of subsection 1 of section 51A authorising ministers have to be satisfied that:
(a)	domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur in Australia; and
(b)	if the domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur in a State or self-governing Territory—the State or Territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence; and
(c)	the Defence Force should be called out and the Chief of the Defence Force should be directed to utilise the Defence Force to protect the Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence.
No more, no less. Finally, the various other aspects of the bill apply. The call-out order should specify what that Commonwealth interest is. Those hurdles have to be negotiated but, having done that, you still have section 51G to deal with. Section 51G, if it is passed, will contain the amendment proposed by the opposition with the addition proposed by the government, which places a further qualification on the activities of the ADF. I fail to see how those senators opposing this bill can believe that that is not a preferable situation to the current situation, which does not have that. That is why the Senate committee preferred the legislation that we have before us rather than the vacuum which exists at the moment.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-09-05,"—I would like to ask a question of Senator Ellison. Minister, I recall that in late 1997 there was a significant union protest here about the building, mostly out at the front of Parliament House. It was a protest, I believe, against Minister Reith's industrial relations program at that time. A small breakaway group from that largely peaceful protest ended up damaging the front doors to the building, spilling into the foyer and trashing the gift shop. It seems to me, under the amendments that have been passed thus far to this bill, it might be argued from the opposition benches that that was a general and generic industrial relations dispute not warranting the intervention of the defence forces.
However, there is no question to my mind that, under the definitions of those things that constitute damage to property, it could be reasonably argued that that scenario—that damage to Parliament House, one of the nation's significant icons and certainly a Commonwealth building—would warrant the calling out of troops. Can you confirm for me that, if this legislation, as it has been proposed and as it has evolved over the last few days, had been in place in late 1997 and if it had been enforced, that particular, largely peaceful, protest—which nonetheless resulted in damage to Commonwealth property and which was ultimately quelled properly and rightfully by a combination of Parliament House security officers and the Federal Police—would in fact be one of those circumstances where the intervention of the military, the calling out the troops, would have been possible and/or probable?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,—Can I say unequivocally that the incident Senator Greig refers to that happened in 1997 would not have come within the criteria of a call-out under this proposed legislation. Where that incident would fail entirely to qualify in relation to this proposed legislation is that the violence or potential violence which was occurring was totally within the control of the territory authority. There is no way in the world that that incident could be the subject of a call-out in the view of this government. ,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-09-05,"—As a follow-up question, I ask: under what parameters is that line crossed? When would a scenario of that nature be deemed to warrant the intervention of the military? It seems to me that that was a scenario where there were—or it was my perception that there were—points of aggression. Certainly some of the television imagery presented that, although that can be misleading sometimes. It concerns me that, if Minister Reith, for example, were to be one of those people in charge of calling for the intervention of the military, that may well have happened. I guess my general question is: in dealing with the difficulties and vagaries of definitions, when is that line crossed? You argue, Minister, that you are unequivocal—you say that that particular circumstance was not one which would have warranted a call-out; how can we be so certain about this as we evolve and as it appears the Senate will implement this legislation? How do we cement this in concrete? What is that point at which we say yes or no to the military? How can you be so certain that the circumstances we had then did not warrant a call-out but that they may not warrant it in the future? My concern when we are dealing with words and concepts is how we cement this in legislation to the point that the community can feel there is an essential safeguard?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—I do not think I can put it any clearer than I have. Perhaps I could put it this way: through the Temporary Chairman, I ask Senator Greig where he thinks that incident even got close to being beyond the capability of the territory authorities. Where did it even get close to being a situation where the territory was unlikely to be able to protect Commonwealth interests? That incident was handled appropriately by the authorities. It was within the capability of the authorities. There was no question of the authorities concerned not being able to address that situation. I think Senator Faulkner quite correctly pointed to some demonstrations which were well within the capability of the authorities concerned—the state or territory police. In fact, Senator Brown said, `What about these demonstrations in the last century in Australia, which could well have involved the military?' There were none. I would be so bold as to say there are no demonstrations that I am aware of which would come to a point where a call-out would be warranted. In all those situations, the state or territory authorities are well capable of dealing with them. That is a crucial aspect of this bill.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-05,"—If I can address this matter before you put the question, please, Mr Temporary Chairman. This is the issue that both Senator Bourne and I tried to raise a little earlier in the committee, in that Senator Brown is not here. He has indicated the significance to him of this question before the chair. This is not an easy matter to deal with, given that, obviously, we want to move this committee stage along. I wonder if we could put this question a little later. I accept that the debate has concluded on it, although I have no doubt that, in future contributions, Senator Brown may care to address it, unless there is more creativity elsewhere. This is sensitive to that fact that, in the circumstances, we ought to be a little bit flexible. Perhaps advice from the Clerk would be a useful way of proceeding.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-05,—I think in the circumstances that will not hold up the committee's deliberations. I certainly want to move on; I think other senators want to. But I think we are also saying that there are special circumstances here with a senator who has indicated a genuine interest. I think it may in fact save time in the long run to be a little generous at this time. ,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—I will go along with that, although I would ask senators to bear in mind that we have had a lengthy committee stage. The government has taken all concerns and questions seriously, as can be seen by the length of time we have spent on some issues—especially last Thursday. But I take on board the points made by Senators Bourne and Faulkner, and would agree that we could perhaps deal with this later. But I would ask other senators to bear in mind that we do have a time aspect to consider. Senator Brown is here now, so we can hear from him before we put the question about the amendment.
—To bring Senator Brown up to date, I was about to put the question that the government amendment to the opposition amendment be agreed to. It was suggested that there might be a need for a delay in the consideration of that vote until you arrived, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—I thank the committee for waiting. I am very grateful for that, because this is a very important matter. It grieves me greatly that we are about to see this amendment passed, given the numbers. Following the debate last night, I need to say that the capitulation on this legislation has gone from bad to worse. I know there have been contributions this afternoon, but I reiterate that we are now in a situation where, under this legislation, the politicians in Canberra can call out the Army to front up to citizen dissidents—this means people who oppose the government, including peaceful demonstrators—and, with this very amendment, the commander of the armed forces so sent in can use all force necessary, including the right to kill, to defray what he or she in their mind thinks might be a situation which threatens serious injury or death or, now, even presents a serious injury to property. What that is is left unspecified and undefined in this legislation. 
If you have a group of citizens protesting on the verge of Parliament House they are threatening property, because they are trampling the lawns. If you have a group of citizens protesting in a city they are a threat to property, because the crowd can be forced back against windows and break those windows. So protestors in the country can indeed be a threat to life and limb. As I said last night, if there is a protest against Australia being turned into a nuclear waste dump—because this government is, remember, essentially in favour of that proposal by Pangea—with British nuclear fuels, or if the situation is that the site is in Western Australia but the state government does not want it and has held the police at bay from a crowd of 10,000 or 50,000 people surrounding that site, the troops can be sent in. I put it to both Labor and Liberal that, in those circumstances, there need be no violence. If you have a crowd of that size in the desert, you can guarantee that inherent in that is a threat of serious injury or death, and certainly there is a threat to property. Whose property? It does not specify whether it is the crowd's property, the Crown's property or Pangea's property, but somebody is going to lose their backpack. To legitimise the deployment of Australian troops for the first time on Australian soil against Australian citizens, it has to be in the mind of the military commander that this threat exists.
I remind Labor that in the Manual of Land Warfare, which is to be replaced after the passage of this legislation through the parliament—which the government has now but will not show to us and which we have had to capitulate to the government on because it does not want the new manual used in evidence—the troops are repeatedly lined up against dissidents and agitators. Let me remind the committee again what a `dissident' is in the Oxford English Dictionary: it is somebody who dissents. Effectively what we have here is a provision for the armed services of Australia to be used as a de facto police force for some future government which does not have the scruples of governments that we are used to and which wants to insist on its political way.
Earlier this afternoon I spoke at the memorial service for Claudio Alcorso, a great Australian and a great Tasmanian who died last week. Claudio came to Australia from the depredations of fascist Italy in the 1930s and, unfortunately for him, he was in New South Wales, not in Victoria, when war broke out. He was deeply antifascist, and I remember him telling me the story of the 13 professors in Italy who refused to sign an oath of allegiance to Mussolini and lost their jobs. Out of the thousands in Italy, the 13 good ones were the ones who were punished. Claudio was interned in the prison camp at Hay in Western New South Wales simply because he was Italian—no test of allegiance, no test of dissidence, just a presumption of guilt. When the court which did give him his day during the war to put his case said that he should be released, that decision was overturned by the Army intelligence officers. So he spent 2½ years locked up because the rules were thrown aside in that contingency. He wrote of:  
... the need to safeguard the supremacy of our courts. We have good reasons for believing that our judiciary is competent and honest and that it can be trusted. The Aliens' Tribunal—which in the context of war emergency acted with special caution—unanimously recommended my release, yet its verdict was overruled by the Army. In different circumstances and new emergencies it could happen again. The verdicts of our courts, subject to the right of appeal, must be final and binding. 
Another reason for writing about my internment, a somewhat rancorous one, was to highlight the ignorance, incompetence and prejudice of our Intelligence Service. Forty-five years later I found that the mentality of the Service has not changed. 
It took me almost two years to obtain my files from various archives. I would not have obtained them but for the Freedom of Information Act 1982, and then I had to appeal to the Administrative Tribunal to obtain papers marked by Intelligence `not to be released'. The hearing was scheduled for May 1987. 
The Intelligence Service, with the same monolithic mentality I met during the war, opposed my appeal under all the grounds allowed by the Act, including the one that `release of certain documents might endanger the life or physical safety of persons'. From the first of three preliminary meetings of the Tribunal I protested that this objection was absurd and offensive. Six months later, at the very last moment before the formal hearing, they withdrew it. True to their credo of being above normal social and legal mores, they gave no reason for the withdrawal nor a word of apology to a 74-year-old citizen with a record of lawful and peaceful life, whom they had wantonly claimed might commit or instigate murder. 
Wise men throughout history have pleaded to forgive and forget. But autocratic, dogmatic individuals and institutions are enemies of free communities. My love for freedom means that I am capable of feeling hatred for those who would destroy it. 
What we are talking about here is, in postwar Australia, a 74-year-old citizen being denied records for a false internment in a wartime situation, because it was claimed he might wantonly commit or instigate murder. 
We have here a set of rules which says that in peacetime—that is what the committee is dealing with—given certain conditions, it will be up to the Army to determine whether there might be an outbreak of murder or danger to life and limb. Can we not learn from the past? Do the experience and the wisdom of Claudio Alcorso not tell us something? How can Labor be supporting this amendment which says that under certain conditions the troops may fire on Australian citizens not only if they think there is a threat to life and limb but also if they think there is a threat to property.
We are moving into an age where property rules all. It is an age of materialism where those who have the money have the power. Parliament is the instrument for standing for the rights of everybody equally, not for enhancing, endorsing and putting backstops behind those people, their power and their property, but that is what this bill does. As Senator Ellison said last night, this bill is to cover all contingencies—that is, this bill is there to cover the fertility of political imagination in future circumstances which we cannot gauge here and to allow that imagination to deploy Australians against Australians in a way we have never seen in the past. What we should be doing is putting in safeguards here, but what the government and, very sadly, the opposition are doing together is opening the door wider.
You have heard me say that if this bill were about the threat of terrorists, it would be a very different matter. We need to be able to deal with that problem swiftly for the defence of Australians, but that is not what this is about. The door has opened much wider. This is about putting down civil disobedience and civil dissent, and that means political differences in circumstances we do not know about yet. Was there violence or the potential for violence during the Vietnam moratoria? Yes, there was. Was there a threat to property during the Franklin River blockade, which by the way was illegal? Yes, there was. Is there a threat to property in current protests by young Australians standing up for the great forests of this country? Yes, there is. Time and again, that is what is complained of by the job-shedding woodchip corporations, and I could go on.  
This is a very, very grave mistake that the government and the opposition are making here. This is an antidemocratic move, a failure to defend democracy, by the government and the alternative government, and it has been left to the crossbenches and the different array of political beliefs in this corner of the chamber to say, `No, you should not be doing this.' No doubt behind the presidium there are those who would at this moment use the power correctly, arguing, `We need this power because our imagination can put us across to a position where it would be good to have it and have it defined.'
If this legislation were simply about defining how the military might behave in a grave emergency which threatened Australia on our own soil, again I would have no trouble with it. But Labor and Liberal have both turned down amendments in the course of this debate which would have simply and clearly said, `Politicians cannot ever use the armed services against Australians who dissent, whether they be workers on strike or whether they be peaceful protesters.' But the arguments have fallen on deaf ears. I ask the Labor Party: have you met with Admiral Barrie? Have you met with other representatives of the armed services? If so, what was the outcome of those talks? I ask the government the same questions. Neither of you, whoever your advice has come from, has thought of the civil dimension and your responsibility to uphold a century of tradition in this country which has kept the Army well and truly out of such civil affairs.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Ellison's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—I move:
Omit all words after ""action"".
This amendment will have the effect of removing the government's amendment that has just been passed. My reason for moving this amendment is that I have enormous concerns regarding the use of defence forces in Australia relating to industrial action.
—Before you continue, Senator Harris, do you have that amendment in writing, please?
—I do not.
—I am going to require it in writing at some stage, because nobody has seen it. 
—If the Chairman will bear with me, I will do that now. I would like to look at the history of where troops have been used against civilians. We do not have to look too far to find some examples. The example of Mexico is very pertinent to the situation that we are in now. During the summer and autumn of 1968, approximately 150,000 Mexican university and high school students staged a four-month strike. The strike included a number of clashes between students, riot police and armed forces. On the night of 2 October 1968—only 10 days before the Olympic Games were due to open in Mexico City—fighting broke out between the students and the riot police in the city. The police were reinforced with about 1,000 troops, who opened fire on the students.
—This is Mexico, is it?
—Yes. This is Mexico, but it is an example of troops firing on unarmed civilians in the country in which they live. This is not make-believe; this is reality. It is the reality that we also face here in Australia if Labor's amendment is allowed to continue as amended by the government. The troops opened fire on those peaceful university and high school students, and it is estimated that 28 or 29 were killed and between 200 and 500 were wounded. Amongst those university and high school students there were also civilians, including women and children.
It is absolutely and totally unacceptable that in Australia we should have a situation where troops would be allowed to fire on Australian people. Another example is Northern Ireland in January 1972. During a civil rights protest the crowd, who had just been standing by, were first of all sprayed with dye from water cannon and then chased by the demonstrators. On that occasion it was again the troops who opened fire, insisting that they were firing on snipers, but they were actually firing upon people who were in the area and who were just standing by. These people were not demonstrators and were not going to inflict substantial damage to buildings; these people were lawfully on the streets and were running away to get out of the area. They were opened fire on by the troops. On that occasion, 16 people were wounded. This is exactly the scenario that possibly we are going to end up with here in Australia.
Another example is China in 1989 and Tiananmen Square—the world was appalled at what happened there. Again the army, which crushed pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square, was used.
—That is a communist country, you goose! It happens all the time.
—I had the opportunity to actually travel to China 11 months later, and the citizens in Beijing were still not allowed to go anywhere near Tiananmen Square. These are some of the examples that have happened around the world. I hear Senator McGauran saying that these examples happened overseas. Let us have a look then at when troops in Australia have fired on Australian citizens, and the obvious example of that is the Eureka Stockade. That was not in another country; that was here in Australia.
—Was there a democracy then?
—That was over taxes, too—you had better watch it, Senator McGauran!
—At that time there was a dispute between the miners and the government. As Senator Stott Despoja so aptly pointed out, that was over government taxes. In that instance, there was a total of 22 people killed and a number of people were wounded as well. I am going to quote from a report on the battle—it was defined as a battle:
The order of attack was given, and the detachment of the 40th Regiment led by Captain Thomas, the chief officer in command, made a quick advance upon the double breastwork which formed the stronghold of the insurgents. After several volleys had been fired on both sides, the barrier of ropes, slabs and overturned carts was crossed, and the defenders driven out or driven into the shallow holes which the place was spotted with, and in which many were put to death in the final heat of the conflict either by bullet or by bayonet thrust.
Here we have a very graphic report of what can happen when the armed forces in a country are put against the civilians of that country, irrespective of the circumstances. There is no justification under any circumstances relating to industrial action whatsoever for the armed forces to be used against the people of this nation. The purpose of my amendment is to bring Labor's amendment back to its original intent that would stop that completely. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—First, let me comment on Senator McGauran's interjection on Senator Harris's speech, when he said in reference to China and Tiananmen Square, `That's a communist country, you goose!' Let me point out to the chamber that it is a communist country that Senator McGauran's government sees with great favour—in fact, with such favour that it gives it special treatment in terms of trade and commerce and turns its back on the gross abuse of civil liberties throughout China. Because big Australian companies want to trade, the government has token talks on the side once a year, to prevent the embarrassment of Prime Minister Howard, when he meets his opposite number, having to raise concerns about the way that communist country abuses human rights—not least, the rights of some 1,000 monks and nuns who are currently imprisoned in Tibet, their rights taken away simply because they want to free Tibet and have protested peacefully.
So, while it is unimaginable and unthinkable—and certainly beyond the imagination of Senator McGauran—that any government in Australia could abuse these new powers to send the troops in against Australian citizens, we have governments right now in Australia who are prepared to turn their back on governments elsewhere who do just that—and are prepared, in fact, to sit with them at dinner, because it is in the interests of trading and prosperity.
During the Franklin blockade, I was in jail at Christmas 1982 and was brought before the courts there for taking part in an unlawful protest—which, by the way, has ended up saving Tasmania hundreds of millions of dollars as well as leading the way to prosperity on the west coast through Strahan in the world heritage area, which attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year now. During that blockade, along with hundreds of others, I was arrested and put in jail, held on bail because I would not agree to the bail condition not to go back to the Franklin River. The charges were later dropped, and everybody who was charged and jailed at that time had no charges proven against them when they pleaded guilty.
Some days after being in jail, I was brought by the police to a cement block cell with a single electric bulb above a table with two chairs—the sort of thing that you read about overseas—and the then chief superintendent of police in Tasmania said to me across the table, `There is going to be violence in the Franklin blockade; we have intelligence that there is going to be violence. You have to get out of this jail and go and call the blockade off.' That moment is seared into my memory. But, standing on the principle that I must not be coerced and that I must rely on my friends who were totally committed to non-violence and must do whatever was best for the river wilderness under those circumstances, I demurred. In the event, the proposition put to me by the superintendent of police in Tasmania was patently false. Whether it was concocted or otherwise, to his mind, as a leader of the police force under those circumstances, there was going to be violence—and that authorised, in his mind, extraordinary actions.
We have in this bill the authorisation by the government and the Labor opposition of extraordinary actions by a future field commander if, in his mind, he sees the potential for violence to persons or property—violence real or imagined, real or false. That is not the point. The field commander has only to think that way and then he can act upon those thoughts. This is very dangerous legislation. It is ill defined and poorly written; it does not get down to the specifics which safeguard against impulsive, muddle-headed or downright malicious action at some future time in circumstances which are different from those which prevail at the moment.
I support this amendment because, if the words that Senator Harris has suggested are removed, we then end up with a clause like this. Remember that we are referring here not to the call-out; the politicians in Canberra have already called out the army in a situation that they see as civil crisis. We would now have this section reading that, in utilising the Defence Force in accordance with section 51D the Chief of the Defence Force—that is, the chief of the armed units called out—must not: 
(a) stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action.
—Full stop!
—Full stop. You can put in brackets there, because this is obviously what it means, `by Australian citizens'. What we will have here is the Labor Party, however, joining with the government and the Nationals in saying that the Defence Force chief must not stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of persons or serious injury to persons or property. These are weasel words; an exception which is a complete out—because in almost everything we do it can be imagined that there is a risk, if not to life and limb then certainly to property.
This is a final opportunity for the Labor Party to uphold its traditions, its beliefs: citizens have a right to protest, and workers have a right to strike. As Senator Faulkner said two days ago in this place, the Labor Party believes that never, ever, ever should the Australian Defence Force be allowed to be brought out against the citizens of Australia—never, ever, ever.
The Labor Party amendment means some-thing quite different. The `never, ever' has gone. We now have `except in circumstances where there is a risk ... a serious threat to property'. Quite extraordinary, isn't it? In other words, the Defence Force can be called out against Australian citizens under certain circumstances—but, when called out, the leader of that Defence Force is much less restricted in when to use force than are the politicians in making the initial call. So I support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-05,"—The Democrats will also be supporting this amendment. As I said earlier in this committee stage debate, we have had another look at the opposition's amendment. We think both the term `except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons' and the amendment about the risk to property, which now has been passed, widen the possibilities on the ground so far that there has been a very sad diminution of what we thought was a restriction.
The amendment would make it a much stronger restriction in that it would cut back the words of the opposition amendment: `to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action'. We believe that the stronger this is and the more restricted it is for the use of the troops who have already—as Senator Brown said—been called out, the better it is for Australia in the future. Let me just say one more time: we do not need this bill; we just do not need it. It is not that scary a place here, and I would rather that we were waiting and getting this right. This is one step towards getting it right, and we will be voting for it.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-09-05,"—I rise briefly to support the comments of my colleague Senator Bourne and also to congratulate my colleagues who have contributed to this debate, including Senators Woodley, Murray and, I believe, Greig. I would also acknowledge that this is a good amendment—through you, Chair, to Senator Harris. While others in the chamber—specifically, Senator McGauran—may not have appreciated what I thought was a valuable lesson of history in relation to examples where countries have seen armoury turned against their own citizens, certainly I think some of us are conscious of the points you were trying to make. We commend your amendment, which would at least curtail some of the appalling aspects of this bill.
I rise also because, like Senator Brown, I could not resist the irony in Senator McGauran's interjection in relation to China. Even in question time today, Senator Hill, representing the Minister for trade, boasted about our human rights record and said that it was second to none. He could not understand why some people—including my colleagues and I—have concerns about the meeting in Melbourne next week of the World Economic Forum. The fact is that the last regional meeting of the World Economic Forum was in April in Beijing. It produced a report, and 73 pages of that report talk constantly about business opportunities in China and about trading opportunities in the area. Yet there is only one reference to human rights, and only then as an issue that requires address—`an issue to be addressed' I believe is the terminology in the report. 
Clearly, among other things, that is where our concern for a forum such as the one next week stems from—the fact that we believe trading opportunities are being more highly prized or highly valued than human rights. I have to say that it is a little hard to stomach when Senator Hill suggests that our record is second to none when, if our record was so good, we would not be so scared of UN committees examining and scrutinising our record and policies in those areas. So worried is this government about the impact or the effect of the conference that will be held in Melbourne next week—and not only the World Economic Forum but also the Olympics and no doubt other events—that this government is rushing through legislation that is shameful and that is an attack on its citizens. The Democrats have made that clear, as have Senators Brown and Harris.
I join Senator Brown in making an appeal—a last-minute appeal—to members of the Labor Party. I thought, judging from Senator Cooney's comments in the debate, that there were members of the Labor Party with concerns—not concerns that are going to be addressed by the upcoming Labor amendment but much broader concerns that will still remain if this bill is passed by the chamber today. So my colleagues issue one last plea to the Labor Party—through you, Chair—to not pass this legislation. I have seen no evidence in the community of support for this legislation, and I would be very surprised if members in this place had received any correspondence, any emails, any lobbying from any organisation or any individual calling for this legislation to be passed at all, let alone passed even in amended form.
Having said that, Senator Harris, I recognise that your amendment might curtail some of the aspects of this legislation. But, as Senator Bourne has said, this is legislation that we should not even be debating in this country, let alone passing. I think the debate and the passing of this legislation, if that is to be the case, marks a pretty shameful day for this country—and I am most stunned by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-05,"—Let me again put the opposition's view on the record about this legislation. I think it is important that I say this. I have said it before in the committee stage, but let me say it again so there is no lack of clarity about it. What do the Labor Party believe in relation to this matter? What do we want? We want the tightest possible restrictions on the Commonwealth using its constitutional powers to call out troops in domestic security situations. That is what we want and that is what has governed our approach in this parliament and during the committee stage debate. We do not support Australia's defence forces being used against protest, against dissent, against assembly or against industrial action. I have made that clear. The amendment that we have here deletes the words `where that action does not pose a threat of death or serious injury to a person'.
I think senators need to examine the amendment that is before the chair. I have heard a number of speeches on this amendment in the committee stage where senators have indicated their opposition to the bill. I hear that. I have understood for some time that certain senators in this chamber are voting against this bill. But the opposition's approach has been quite different. We have said that we will support this bill under certain conditions. We have considered supporting the bill because the current situation is unsatisfactory. There are no constraints on the Commonwealth at the moment, and this seems to be hard to get across to certain senators. I appreciate that people have different views, but there are no constraints at the moment. As far as the opposition are concerned, we do not believe that that is a satisfactory situation. We are not satisfied, nor do we accept the status quo. That is why we have approached this legislation in the way we have. 
The Labor Party amendment before the chair at the moment, which Senator Harris from Pauline Hanson's One Nation party is attempting to amend, is the most important of Labor's amendments to this bill. I do not want any misunderstandings. I do not mind being criticised or having my party criticised if the criticism is on a reasonable basis and I am being criticised for the matter that is before the chair. But there is a misunderstanding here. We do not want—and we will not accept under any circumstances—troops being used against Australians who are exercising their democratic rights. That is utterly unacceptable, but that is quite possible with the current constitutional arrangements. That is why we have supported a legislative framework: to try to improve this unacceptable situation.
Arguments have been mounted by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens that this legislation has been brought forward in haste. Those comments are fair. There has not been adequate discussion or consultation, but it does not alter the fact that the current situation is unacceptable. We will not embrace the status quo when there are no constraints on government. Equally, we are not going to embrace a bill that is unsatisfactory in itself. That is why we have moved this amendment.
In relation to this legislation, we have attempted to define where the Commonwealth might and where the Commonwealth might not be permitted to use its constitutional powers. That is what we have tried to do. Be clear: we do not support this power being used against protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. We believe that the limits of this power should be clearly and carefully defined. That is the position of the Labor Party. We do not believe this power should be extended in any way to prevent or restrict the sort of protest and action that a number of senators in this chamber have canvassed. We want to ensure that Australia's defence forces, if they are used in this way, are used to protect Australians. That is what our motivation is here. That is what our intention is here. We do not want to see a situation where Australians are prevented from exercising their democratic rights. That is the position that we come to this debate with.
We are now dealing with an amendment that stands in the name of the opposition and that will have application if, and only if, the troops have already been called out. That is when this amendment applies. The troops are already on the street. That is the situation, and I am sure most senators—perhaps all senators—involved in this debate understand that the amendment before the chair applies when the troops are called out. In other words, they are already obligated in other parts of this legislation to use only reasonable and necessary force. But they are already on the ground, they are already called out and that is when this amendment has application. It is in that context that senators need to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of Labor's amendment to the bill and the impact of the amendment before the chair from Pauline Hanson's One Nation senator, Senator Harris, on this issue.
We are talking about a situation where the troops are out and where Australian citizens are being killed. The opposition have tried very hard to get the wording of the amendment right. We have worked very hard on the drafting. I hope we have done well. If it can be done better at a later stage through the review process, all the better. But we have done the best we can here to try and deal with a situation where the troops are on the street and where there is the likelihood of people being killed or seriously injured. The option for us is to pass the amendment in the form that Labor proposes or to accept the Pauline Hanson's One Nation senator's amendment and have a situation where, in those circumstances, the troops stand by. That is what we are debating, and that is why we will not accept the amendment.
I do not accept the questioning of the credentials or motivation of Labor on this issue. We have come to this with an open mind, and we have come to it with clean hands. That has been our approach, and we have considered supporting this legislation, if appropriate amendments are passed, because in our view—and I know it is not the view of others, but it is our view—the fact that there are no constraints on the government at the moment and no restrictions on the Commonwealth using its constitutional powers is not acceptable to us. It may be acceptable to you, but it is not acceptable to us. We are going to protect those individuals who want to protest, to take industrial action or to dissent in other ways. We want to do that, and we are going to do our best to ensure that we achieve it. 
That is Labor's approach. I have tried to outline it on a number of occasions as lucidly as I can. I do not want to waste the time of the committee again, and I will try and limit my contributions in the committee stage debate—as I have done in the past. But I want to be clear, and I want the committee to be clear, about the approach we are taking and why we are taking that approach. I commend the responsible approach of the opposition to this bill, and I seriously ask all senators in the chamber to consider the impact of passing the amendment to Labor's amendment that stands in the name of the Pauline Hanson's One Nation senator, Senator Harris.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—What an extraordinary performance, and what a failure of a performance that was. Why are the troops going to be on the street in the circumstances which Senator Faulkner just outlined? I will tell you why: Labor's amendment will allow them to be. Labor's amendment will allow them to be there against workers in Australia who are on strike. Labor's amendment will allow them to be there against protesters who dissent in this country. No wonder Senator Faulkner has gone into high dudgeon over this. He really has got himself into a corner, and Labor has got itself into a corner. Labor has gone arm in arm with the government into a situation where the troops are called out, because the halter was not put there in the first place. The amendments from the Democrats and the Greens—which would have ensured that the troops could be called out only in a situation of terrorism, not in a situation where communities are protesting in Australia against some matter—have already been voted down by Labor.
Labor, having opened the door to some future government—or even the present government—using the troops against Australians, is now opening it wider. If the best defence that Senator Faulkner can give is that an amendment happens to be moved by Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party then he has struck a new low in debate in this place. I disagree with many of the policies—including heartland policies—of One Nation, but a serious amendment like this deserves to be treated seriously, and it deserves to be debated on its merits. In my book, as a Green—at the total opposite end of the spectrum from One Nation—it also deserves to be supported, and Labor should be supporting it.
What it does is remove Labor's weasel words and the government's weasel words so that a commander in the field, when the troops have been brought out under this legislation, cannot use force—including the ability to kill—against Australian citizens and, as this amendment would ensure, cannot use force `to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action'. I cannot believe that Labor wants to water that down. I cannot believe that it has gone along with the government lock, stock and barrel in watering that down. And I cannot believe that Senator Faulkner would want to defend this legislation on the basis that it has been brought in here and we are doing the best we can. This matter is far too serious for that. We reiterate: if this were a bill against terrorism, you would have our support. But this is a double bill which allows Australian citizens who are protesting to be treated as terrorists. Who determines that? The Defence Force chief in the field, once the Army has been brought out under the conditions laid down by the big parties in this place.
So Senator Faulkner's submission did not impress me. It did not have a cogent argument. It did not defend his core submission that, under Labor, troops could never, ever be used against Australian workers or Australian citizens who are protesting. That is exactly what Labor is permitting here. As Senator Faulkner said, we are dealing here with a Defence Force chief making a decision, having been called out by the government of the day, about whether or not to use the force at his or her disposal against Australians who are protesting. And the Labor amendment says, `Yes, you can.' It does not say, `No, you cannot'; it says, `Yes, you can.' When the Defence Force chief picks up this act, as it will be—because it is going to go through, courtesy of Labor—and looks at section 51G, he will read that he must not `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action except'—there is the vital Labor-Liberal word—`where there is the reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons or property'. The exception is a devastating let-out. It is not a tightly controlled caveat, as Senator Faulkner would have us believe. You could drive a water cannon through it, as Senator Stott Despoja says. I had thought that Senator Faulkner's enthusiasm for the government's position was similar to that of a lobster offered a hot bath, but it now seems he is accepting the offer. It is not a lack of enthusiasm we see here; it is a lot of enthusiasm. I would ask Senator Faulkner, again, to tell the chamber whether the Labor Party has had consultations with the Defence Force over this matter and, if so, with whom? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-05,"—I would like to comment on what Senator Faulkner was talking about. First of all, in the time it would take to properly draft this bill, to have proper public discussion of it, to look at its constitutionality and to go through it properly—over a few weeks or months—I cannot see that we will come to the point where the question would arise, as Senator Faulkner said, of what you do if the troops are out and you have a situation where Australian citizens are being killed. It is not going to happen in the next couple of months. I hope it never happens. I cannot imagine a situation in Australia in which combined police forces and combined tactical response groups cannot control that situation.
Senator Faulkner says there are no constraints at the moment and that he does not accept the status quo. Of course there are constraints. The constraints are that the government does not know, and the defence department does not know, where the limits are. They do not know, if they do call out the troops, where the constitutionality of it lies and, because they may be punished, they are very careful about what they do when they call out the troops. Look at the times they have been called out in the past. What happened? Has there been the possibility of those troops using violence against Australians? No. Why has that been the case? Is it because we have a lovely, gentle Defence Force that does not like using violence against anybody? No, I do not think so. That is not what they are trained for. They are trained to be able to do that and to do it properly. So why have they not been asked to do that by the government or by their Defence Force commanders? There is a good reason. It is because this bill is necessary. We accept that this bill is necessary. A bill is necessary to codify how far defence forces can go when there is a possibility of using violence against Australians or anybody else. That is necessary. It is not necessary right now. It is not necessary in the next couple of months. It is not necessary before we work out how to do it properly, and we have not done that.
There are an awful lot more amendments to consider, and I imagine that almost all of them will go down. I would be absolutely astounded if any amendments, other than those of the government and the opposition, succeed here. They are not going to. It is as if we had a chamber with two halves. There is the half way up there near the chair, and there is the half way down here near us. All the amendments of that half will go through, and they will have no problem because they will vote with each other—a lot of their amendments I agree with. Then there is this half down here, and down here it is: `Nope. Sorry. Don't care what you say; I am not going to listen. Not only am I not going to listen but I'm definitely not going to vote for it. I don't care what's in it.' That is not a really good way to run a country. It is not a really good way to consider a bill—which we have been told is so vital to the future of Australia that we have to do it immediately. It is a very bad way to do it.
So there are constraints. There are constraints on the defence forces. And those constraints are there because this bill does not exist as legislation yet. It is not an act. It only exists as a bill. Once it becomes an act, that is when the constraints come off—that is, if somebody thinks, `Oh, yes, there is a reasonable likelihood of death or serious injury to persons.' As Senator Brown keeps telling us, this is way down the line. This is not the Prime Minister saying this; this is not the Minister for Defence saying this: this is not the Attorney-General saying this—it is way down the line when we decide whether this is possible. This also applies to property. That one has gone through now. Gee, guess who voted for that? That is when those constraints come off. I would disagree very strongly with Senator Faulkner on that. 
Senator Faulkner said that he wants to ensure that the Australian defence forces are used to protect Australians. Guess what? We all want to do that. At this end of the chamber, we think that the way to do that is to get this legislation right, and we have not done that, and we do not look like we are going to do that on this occasion.
I would just like to mention that Senator Faulkner said that we have two options here: we can vote either for the opposition's amendment or for Senator Harris's amendment to the opposition's amendment—we can do one or the other. There are actually three courses here, and the final course is: let's vote against this bill, and let's get it right, and let's bring it back when we are sure we have it right. Let's bring it back in a couple of months when there has not been murder and mayhem in the streets that the police cannot handle, that the TRG cannot handle, that combined police and TRGs cannot handle. Let's bring it back when we have agreement from a majority of Australians that what we have in the bill is what they want to see, that it is how they want to be protected. Let us ask Australians how they want to be protected. Then when we find out how they want to be protected—because they are not stupid—that is when we should bring up the bill.
When we have that bill right, when we have in that bill what people outside this chamber, outside this parliament, want to see in that bill, that is when we should be voting on the bill. We should not be doing it now. What Senator Faulkner said demonstrated to us why we should not be doing it now. We will certainly be voting for Senator Harris's amendment, because it makes this bill a little bit better. But, goodness me, there is an awfully long way to go yet. Really, the easy way to get over that is to not vote for this bill, to get the bill right, to do it later.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-09-05,"—My support for Senator Harris's amendment and my abhorrence of this bill stem largely from personal experience. I think it is quite unusual, although increasingly less so, to actually protest and march and make your point in the streets. Unlike most Australians, I am one of those who has done so on many occasions. I was thinking recently that I have been involved in student protests, agitating against the introduction of tertiary fees and university amalgamations. I have marched in opposition to black deaths in custody when to do so was a very unpopular thing. I have marched in several gay and lesbian rights marches with small groups of people and hostile onlookers, and I have been involved in industrial relations protests and marched against the introduction of regressive legislation in my home state. I have also marched in order to preserve and protect our ancient forests. I am not alone in that, but when thinking through those particular issues I am struck by the fact that it is so often `the usual suspects' who are involved in such movements.
I am also struck by the fact that I have experienced over time a considerable shift in attitude from the men and women of the police force—or the `police service', as they now like to be called—in terms of how they treat and deal with those people who are involved in such marches and protests. I recall very clearly the contempt and hostility I experienced from members of the police force in my home state in the early days of being involved in such protests. But I acknowledge that there has been a considerable shift in attitudes because of the very deliberate attempt within the forces to bring police service personnel up to community attitudes in the way they are trained to deal with the public and to be empathetic with public issues. There are a range of programs in my home state—and, I suspect, nationally—to make the police `citizens'.  As I think my colleague Senator Murray pointed out recently, the Army are trained to deal with the enemy, whereas the police force are trained to deal with the public, and that is a key point here. 
Additionally, my experience of members of the defence forces is somewhat different. By that I mean this: I wonder, Mr Temporary Chairman George Campbell, if you saw recently—on, I think, Four Corners—a program focusing on Townsville, a city in Australia which has a very high concentration of ADF personnel within it, and the level of violence against gay men that was being experienced in that community. There is no question, and the program made this point, that the kind of strongly macho high-testosterone attitude that prevailed in that town—partly because of the presence and existence of the ADF, a very macho institution—was in part responsible for the culture of violence that resulted.
It has been my experience that members of the defence forces—and I do not mean to tar them all with the same brush—are not the most tolerant people when it comes to those sorts of organisations, institutions and philosophies to which I subscribe. If you were a looking for a bunch of people who felt passionately about the environment, strongly about industrial democracy, tolerantly towards sexual equality and sensitively towards feminist issues, you would not, for example, go searching for them in the defence forces. Frankly, it scares the hell out of me that in the future Australian citizens protesting in favour of those kinds of things may be confronted particularly by young members of the ADF holding a gun and wondering whether or not they can fire at a bunch of people who they have been led to believe, socially and philosophically, are in fact the enemy. It worries me that many members of the defence forces are bred and enculturated in an environment where simplicity is the essence of their very being—where they are trained to understand or to believe that there is black and white, good and bad, friend and foe, for the simple purpose of being able to act quickly and to fire and to kill when necessary. It is a situation that we as citizens do not generally experience.
My abhorrence of this bill comes from the belief that it should never be the case that members of the defence forces are placed in that position. It must always be the case that such scenarios are dealt with by the police force. I again express my abhorrence of the entire nature of this bill and again make the point—to reiterate what Senator Bourne has said, in particular—that there would be no need for any of this to occur if Labor were to oppose the bill outright. It is not enough simply for Senator Faulkner and his colleagues to wring their hands and say they have done the best they could, because they have not. The best they can do is to oppose this bill outright. I join with Senator Stott Despoja in a final plea, particularly to those members of the Labor Party who I am sure would have a long history of being involved with protest movements and who would know exactly what it is like to be confronted with the authorities when in such a situation. There is considerable hostility and contempt for many of the causes that people, particularly on the Left, feel very passionately about. For that reason this bill should be utterly opposed and, equally, Senator Harris's amendment should be embraced.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-05,"—I would like to respond to what Senator Greig has said. I am sure he did not intend to make this inference, but just in case it came across to the people listening that the Labor Party somehow has not taken part in demonstrations, marches and movements that uplift the human condition, I would like to go through a few of them. You yourself, Mr Temporary Chairman George Campbell, would remember that monument at the corner of Victoria Street and Lygon Street—when you had the good sense to live in Melbourne—to the eight-hour day, a cause led by stonemasons and other good Labor men, at least in sentiment, in Victoria. This brought the eight-hour day to Victoria and later to Australia. You would remember the demonstrations during the great strikes of the 1890s when people from the Labor Party were foremost in what was achieved. You will remember the great disputes about conscription and the monuments to those causes in the Trades Hall in Melbourne. You will remember the efforts during the 1920s, during the Depression, and during and after the war—and on into Vietnam days, when, for example, the great Gough Whitlam led marches and you yourself , Mr Temporary Chairman, filled a great role in marching through the streets under the guidance of Dr Cairns. We even demonstrated after 1975 when that terrible tragedy in Australian history occurred and when democracy was trampled on in such a frightful manner. So the efforts have continued on to the present day to the demonstrations during the Springbok tour. And I could go on. 
I think Senator Brown would be generous enough to say that many a Labor person was present at the Franklin Dam protest. Among your many great achievements, Senator Brown, I think that is perhaps the greatest. But right throughout the history of Australia, both before Federation and since, the Australian Labor Party has had a very proud history, a very proud record, and it can hold its head up high in terms of its dissent, its marching and its demonstrations. At the same time, it has had occasions when it has ruled this country with such wisdom and at such times of crisis that that needs to be honoured. John Curtin, during the Second World War, was a towering figure. He saved Australia from invasion from the Japanese. All I want to say is this: if there is an inference that the Australian Labor Party has not done the high and noble thing over the years, that is just wrong. Senator Faulkner has put our case in this debate and put it with great force and great merit. I think tribute ought to be paid to him for that. But even apart from the present debate, it is wrong to suggest that throughout the history of this nation the Labor Party has not done great things in terms of the sorts of issues we are talking about now—that it has not dissented when it should have dissented and that it has not protested when it should have protested.
One of the great Labor figures, Lionel Murphy, was the person who handed down the decision in the Neal case. He said in his decision that protest and dissent are the right of everybody—and so they are. I just want to make it clear that, although Senator Greig has told us about his part in protests—Senator Brown does not have to tell us about his part in protests, because he is noted for the high purposes that he has pursued—we should keep in mind that the Labor Party, throughout the history of this country and before when we were a colony, has a very proud history and certainly nothing to be ashamed of.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—I thank Senator Cooney for that. I agree with what he has said: that the Labor Party and the labour movement have been involved in many great protests and movements in this country which have improved the lot of every citizen—workers' rights, democracy and, indeed, the environment. That is why this legislation and Labor's handling of this legislation sit so ill with our expectations: it seems to fly in the face of that history. I wonder how many of those people who have taken part in those protests would believe that, on this day in the year 2000, the Labor Party is supporting the government getting legislation through this place which will enable the troops, under certain circumstances, to be brought out against Australian citizens in many of the situations that Senator Cooney has just listed.
This is real legislation. This is legislation that is open to abuse by people in the future, and we ought not enable that. I am perplexed. I do not understand why Labor is supporting this legislation. Senator Bourne cogently argued that there is no rush for this legislation; that we should get it right. Senator Faulkner said that the government should not be rushing the legislation, but that Labor had done the best it could and he hopes it goes all right. That does not stand scrutiny. Firstly, Labor knows as well as everybody else in this place that this legislation has been on the books, has been mooted, for more than a year now. We all know that, if the government wants to get unpopular legislation of this nature through this place, the time to do it is on the eve of the Olympics. I guess the government cannot believe its luck that it now has Labor on side in the central thrust of this legislation, because that discounts the interest as far as the press gallery is concerned as well. 
If Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party believe that this is rushed and that there is room in here for mistakes, why didn't they support the sunset clause which would have made this bill inoperative straight after the Olympics? I do not think we are being told the whole truth here, and that is why I have asked Senator Faulkner to explain to the committee who has consulted the Labor Party in these turbulent last couple of weeks, in particular the last couple of days, and led it to change ground and slide more and more towards the government position? Who from the defence forces has Labor spoken to? Who from the government has Labor spoken to? Who from the community who is informed on these matters has Labor consulted? Who from the unions? Which are the unions that are saying, `Go ahead. This is good legislation'? Can we hear that from Senator Faulkner? I put the same questions to the government opposite, because I cannot see a coherent reason for Labor taking this point of view. 
I hear what Senator Cooney says: that Labor has a proud record of protest, not least against the trammelling of democracy and the infringement of rights of the ordinary citizen. But here we have Labor supporting just that, far from protesting against it. It has got the numbers in here to stop it, and it is not going to use those numbers. It supports the Howard government's prescription to, with a few changes, put this legislation through with no sunset clause, no assured review—in fact, Labor has voted that down—no clear statement that the defence forces cannot be used against citizens who are protesting or striking—Labor has voted that down—and no requirement that we see the new manual that will be used by the defence forces if and when they are called out. We ought to see that manual to inform us in this debate. Senator Faulkner has himself asked the government for definitions as a means of helping enlighten this debate, not least a definition of the very amendment we are dealing with. What is `serious threat of injury or death'? What is the likelihood of serious threat? What are the circumstances? I have asked the government to give us one circumstance—just one—that would apply where the troops in the field would get the order from the Chief of the Defence Force to go into action against Australian citizens. Do you know what? The government refuses, because this bill allows for every circumstance that Senator Cooney has just listed in this country's history.
Put into the hands of the wrong government, this legislation is extremely dangerous to democracy, to civil rights and to that thing which Australians—not just the larrikin element—revere in history: the refusal to be ordered around and dictated to by bigwigs, hobnobbers and people in authority who are dictating what is good for you and your family and those who come after you, because they know what is right for you. That goes against the Australian ethic. But I am afraid we are now in the realm of saying, `Well, some future government will be able to bring out the troops to enforce the idea that dissent should not be allowed if they do not want it.' 
I am not going to go back through the manual to the use of tanks and the ready-order-fire process that would be used against Australians if this situation arose; I am looking now at a page on intelligence tasks for the armed services in this situation. I read out earlier Claudio Alcorso's terrible experience. The intelligence tasks that would be given to the Army to aid the civil power include the raising and maintenance of intelligence records on dissident personalities and organisations. That means everybody who is speaking against this bill. We are dissidents. That means everybody listening to this debate who disagrees with the government on the matter. 
The manual says, `You can get records on those people. They are a matter for surveillance,' and on and on it goes. But, far from tightening and codifying the matter, the legislation opens the door and lifts restrictions. Senator Bourne is quite right: if it were codifying the use of the armed forces in certain circumstances, then we would have a debate. But it is not doing that. It is saying the Defence Force can be used for a political purpose by an Australian government in the future—in fact, by three ministers of an Australian government—when they believe dissent is getting out of hand, and dissent simply means opposition. It is as loose as that. That is why this legislation is appalling. It is undemocratic. I know this word gets used too much but I do not use it very often: this legislation is un-Australian.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-09-05,"—I would like to acknowledge Senator Cooney's contribution to this debate and how apt it is that he mentions former Prime Minister John Curtin, a good man who had to deal with a number of crises of conscience. I have a lot of respect for his efforts as Prime Minister and, indeed, for many things for which he stood. But when we are talking of a crisis of conscience or a man of unintentional contradictions, John Curtin is it—a man who went to jail to oppose conscription, yet implemented it; a man who was a pacifist but was a wartime Prime Minister.  
It is appropriate that the Labor Party should recognise, as Senator Cooney has done, their proud tradition of dissident and protest. It is one that most of us acknowledge. The Democrats share a contemporary history of protest with others down the end of this chamber. Senator Greig has listed some of the protests in which he has been involved. I think you would be hard pressed to find a Democrat senator, former or current, who has not been engaged in similar protest. 
When Senator Faulkner invokes the phrase `Pauline Hanson's One Nation', a lot of us are struck by the irony. We recognise perhaps one certain thing: that is, when you have the Greens, One Nation and the Australian Democrats agreeing on an amendment, that is probably an indication of widespread and broad ranging support for an amendment. But, as Senator Brown has pointed out, it is because it is a serious amendment. It is a good amendment that deserves support and respect, and it deserves to be passed.
But there is another irony in this debate in that some of the liveliest protests that we have seen in the last couple of years in Australian political life have been directed at Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I am not denying, just as Senators Greig and Brown have stated on the record, that I have vastly different views from One Nation on a number of policies, although I have to say to Senator Harris that it strikes me as odd that we get perhaps more support down this end of the chamber for issues in relation to biotechnology or GM foods than we do from the old parties these days. 
Nonetheless, Senator Harris is supporting an amendment that would curtail some of the worst aspects of this bill that people have rightly identified might involve Australian troops in breaking up the very protest to which Senator Harris and his party might be subjected. I ask Senator Harris through the chair: have there been protests against his party that have involved significant property damage or injury? 
I know that the government has responded on this matter beforehand by suggesting, `You would not see the troops being called out under those circumstances unless it was a situation that the police could not handle.' I ask the government: at what point is it determined that the police could not handle it? Who determines that the police cannot handle this situation? 
I believe Senator Greig was given an assurance by the government that incidents such as breaking into Parliament House or the gift shop or breaking down the doors to Parliament House, as we saw a number of years ago, would not necessitate a call-out of troops. But I do not know if the legislation and the constraints to which the opposition and the government refer are really that unambiguous. I acknowledge Senator Harris's constructive and positive role in this debate as well as the irony in this debate through his concern, along with that of the Democrats and the Greens, that this legislation is being implemented. Certainly, no-one denies the Labor Party's history of protest. I just wish it were a little more forthright on this occasion. 
I express again for the record my concern that the haste that is being applied to this legislation suggests that this government wants it through in time for the S11 protests next week. There will be people from all sectors of politics who support S11. I support the right of those demonstrators to be out there next week, and I might even join them. That does not mean I support protest that is violent, it does not mean I want to see injury—serious or otherwise—and it does not mean I want to see significant property damage, but I do not want to see legislation passed that allows troops potentially to be out breaking up those types of protests.
Senators in this place can talk about clean hands, but we are dealing today with the issue of blood on hands. We are talking about grievous legislation being passed today. Senator Bourne eloquently pointed out the constitutional issues, the precedent that this legislation sets, the fact that we have constraints and the fact that we need to legislate for better constraints but that we should be doing so in a very different fashion from the debate that we have entered into. But we are talking about blood on hands here. Let us get in perspective what our Army is trained to do, what it is supposed to do, and let us be very unambiguous about the fact that we are giving it powers to do that in a way that has never been seen before in this country and should not be allowed in this country.  
I have no doubt that Labor Party senators will invoke greats like John Curtin—and I have no dispute with the fact that he was a great wartime Prime Minister, a revered Prime Minister, and deservedly so in many circumstances. They will bring out the heroes. That is fine by me. They will talk about their legitimate history of protest. They will say that they have done the best they can and they will talk about their clean hands, but I think they protest a little too much when it comes to defending their position on this bill. If they really wanted to talk about their great history of opposition, dissent and protest, then they would be protesting where it counts in this place and they would be voting with the Democrats, the Greens and, indeed, One Nation to defeat the bill before us. Once again, we acknowledge the Labor contribution to this debate, but we hope they will reconsider their position.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—The debate regarding the One Nation amendment has covered a lot of aspects, but I would like to centre on one mentioned by Senator Bourne when she was speaking of the three alternatives that we could have in the progression of this legislation. I believe there is a fourth and it is a very simple process—that is, that One Nation, the Democrats and Senator Brown at his own decision clearly indicate to the Labor Party that, on the passing of the One Nation amendment, we would all support opposition amendment (R3) as amended. Senator Faulkner implied that, if the amendment I have proposed gets up, we go back to the status quo where there is no control on the Commonwealth. First of all, I do not believe that is correct; I believe there are constraints on the Commonwealth at the moment. I also believe that the commitment to support Labor's amendment would then put in place the controls that Labor desires. 
As this debate has progressed, it has become very clear that the bill will pass. So rather than detracting from the bill, I believe we are actually adding to the strength of the bill. The argument about whether the bill is going to pass or not is largely lost. I accept that fact with great sadness, but I will move amendments subsequent to this one which, if passed, would make the bill more acceptable. What I am clearly saying to the Labor Party—and it is up to my fellow senators on my right to also make the commitment—is that if they support this One Nation amendment to their amendment, we would support Labor's original amendment that says that the chief officer could not `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action'. Given that Labor have indicated they are going to support the bill, I believe that is the proper process for the use of the Australian defence forces in relation to industrial actions.
Question put:

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—I move government amendment No. 3 on sheet DG223:
(3)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 6 (after line 28), after subsection (8), insert:
Notice to State or self-governing Territory
	(8A)	As soon as is reasonably practicable after the order is made or revoked, an authorising Minister must arrange for the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory specified in the order to be notified of the making or revocation of the order. However, if this is not done, the validity of the making or revocation of the order is not affected.
This amendment arises from the committee in its report. It is quite straightforward. In that report, the committee recommended that the bill be amended such that the Commonwealth notify the state or territory of the call-out of the Defence Force under proposed section 51A as soon as the order is made. This amendment includes a new subsection (8A), which provides:
As soon as is reasonably practicable after the order is made or revoked, an authorising Minister must arrange for the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory specified in the order to be notified of the making or revocation of the order. 
A failure to notify will not, however, affect the validity of the making or revocation of the order. 
The bill, to remind senators, sets in place a regime for call-outs—51A being the Commonwealth initiated call-out, 51B being a state initiated call-out, and 51C being a territory initiated call-out. In state or territory call-outs you do not need that notice provision because an application would be made by the state or territory. So the committee turned its mind only to 51A, which deals with the Commonwealth taking action to protect its own interests, which the committee recognised it is duty bound to do so. 
The amendment proposed by the government needs to be considered with the subsequent amendment proposed by the opposition which deals with consultations with states or territories. This government amendment takes on board the constructive suggestions of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee in its consideration of this legislation. As has been stated previously by the government and the opposition, this legislation sets in place a framework for a call-out. This amendment is an important part of the framework, which I think adds protection to all Australians in the exercise of this power. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—Why then does the amendment have the final words `if this is not done'—that is, if the state or self-governing territory is not notified, the validity of the order to call-out the troops is not affected?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—Even the committee recognised that, where there is a Commonwealth call-out to protect its own interests, there may be a degree of urgency which does not afford that extent of consultation which people were seeking. This was even recognised in my own state of Western Australia where Dr James Thomson, a senior legal officer from the Western Australian Crown Solicitors Office—a man I know well and who is a very experienced legal officer—accepted that there may be occasions where the order has to be made as a matter of urgency and consultation cannot take place. Similarly, in relation to the notification of the order, events may happen so quickly in a Commonwealth initiated call-out that there is not an ability to do this. One would not want the Australian Defence Force to be placed in an invidious position because of circumstances and because of the speed at which those circumstances were occurring.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—The circumstances, as I have outlined, are where there are emergencies. Most emergencies in life do not really come along with notice attached. In the history of human affairs—no doubt in the past and probably in the future—things happen on the sudden and a crisis develops extremely quickly. This is not always the case, but it does happen—we all know that from our lives as average human beings. We cater for these events as best we can with protections and checks and balances in place for the Australian community, but we have to bear in mind that there may be occasions when things happen quickly and, if this provision cannot be met, that it does not invalidate the necessary actions which are required of the ADF.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—Let us look at the amendment a little more closely. It says:
As soon as is reasonably practicable after the order is made or revoked—
that is to call-out the troops by the three ministers—
an authorising Minister—
one of them—
must arrange for the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory specified in the order to be notified of the making or revocation of the order.
It then says:
However, if this is not done, the validity of the making or revocation of the order is not affected.
The intent that the government has put here is to consult with the state. There is no word `consult' in this amendment. It is a notification process. It does not call for consultation; it calls for notification. Why can't the state where the troops are being sent be notified?
Let me go back a step. One of the things that I have asserted all the way down the line is that a very important constitutional halter here to the misuse of this power by federal politicians is that the state or territory involved should request the troops. In other words, if their police forces are unable to cope, the first thing that the states and territories do—and this has been in practice—is call for assistance from adjacent states and territories, as far as police and tactical response groups are concerned. I agree with Senator Bourne: it is very difficult to see a situation in which that would not handle whatever the crisis was. During the last century, we did not have to go beyond that.
The government is foreseeing some situation in which we now will have to go beyond that. The minister says that it would be `an emergency situation'. An emergency situation and a call-out would take some time. This does not even say that a state should be consulted in the process of deciding whether or not to make that call-out. This simply says that a state might be notified after the call-out has occurred. But, if it is not notified, it does not matter. This is not coherent. Either there is an intention in this legislation to consult with states and territories before troops are called out on their patch of Australia, or there is not. The government is really saying here that there is not. If it notifies the state after the call-out has been made, well and good; if it does not, it does not matter. Modern communications are such that the state is going to know about it immediately, courtesy of the media in this country. I ask the minister again: what are the circumstances in which this provision would be used? And what are the circumstances of emergency in which it would not be possible to use this provision?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—I reiterate that, if you are talking about consultation, the opposition has an amendment that I understand is to be dealt with next by the committee and deals with consultation with a state or territory. As I said at the outset, you need to look at this amendment in conjunction with the opposition's amendment, which we will deal with next. That forms, if you like, a package of notification and consultation. So I make that point at the outset. The second part is that, in any notification, consultation is implied in that. But, if you are not happy with that, we still have the amendment that will be posed by the opposition and will square that off neatly. 
In relation to the circumstances that Senator Brown deals with, I can say quickly that you could have a range of instances where there might be some very quick action required. Say that you had a terrorist attack of significant proportion on an installation and the police were unable to respond and it was a Commonwealth interest—and remember that the order would have to specify the Commonwealth interest. If there were a substantial attack on, let us say, a domestic airport which had been destroyed with great loss of life and numerous hostages being held, immediate action might be required to deal with that. To rely on any bureaucratic process of notification might be totally inappropriate in those circumstances.
What we are saying here is that, as soon as it is reasonably practicable after an order is made—or revoked—you would notify the state. You would do that; and we are providing those checks and balances. But there may be an extreme situation where you cannot do that and it requires urgent and necessary action. If you had a terrorist attack of significant scale whereby the state or territory could not act to protect the Commonwealth interest, then action would be required. The Commonwealth government would be expected to act. If that procedure were not followed, we say that, because of necessity, we do not want to necessarily invalidate the actions which the community would want the government to take. We are not saying that you would just have scant regard for it; it is something which came about as a result of the recommendation by the Senate legislation committee, and it has to be looked at in conjunction with the opposition amendment that is being proposed that has that consultative element.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—Let us clear the air on this. The government and the opposition have been together, lining up these amendments: that so far is established. Well, so be it.
—That is not right. You've been told a lie.
—I did not say that at all.
—That is what the government has just indicated to the committee, Chair—through you, to Senator Faulkner. You can disabuse us of that; but that is the information we have on the record. The reason the Greens will be moving that you need the agreement of the state and territory is this: it is a very important halter on the abuse of this power by the Commonwealth. Chair, Senator Ellison just pointed out the position where there is some sort of disaster at an airport. He has left an important factor out here: the first people on the scene at that disaster will be the state police force involved and the tactical response group, in huge numbers. They are going to be there much faster than the Australian Defence Force. In a disaster like that, it will then be a matter of containing it and trying to give civil aid, as the term is. 
I cannot see that that situation—where there will obviously be consideration about whether the Australian Defence Force is used by the three ministers that this legislation requires—cannot involve the necessity for the state to be informed if the troops are sent in. Otherwise, you arrive at the situation that the New South Wales cabinet office expressed some concern about to the committee, whereby you could have a police force on the scene and have the Australian Defence Force brought onto the scene, with neither informed about the actions of the other.
It is plain commonsense that, before the Defence Force is brought out in that situation, the state should not only be notified and consulted with but also be in agreement with that action taking place. We believe that section 119 of the Constitution comes into play in such a situation and that there should be a request from the state—and obviously there would be.
Again, the worry that we have about this sort of amendment does not apply to the terrorist situation that Senator Ellison has brought up and which we are quite happy to deal with—because it has to be dealt with; it is compellingly serious. We are concerned that this government-Labor Party bill, or act that is emerging, allows for the troops to be brought out against Australian civilians. I want the minister to explain this: in circumstances where the troops are being sent in to look after a Commonwealth interest in a non-terrorist situation, why shouldn't the state or territory involved be consulted first; why shouldn't its agreement be sought and obtained first; and why shouldn't it, by law, have the right to be informed?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—In the latter circumstance, the government would envisage that there would be notice given to the state or territory. The situation is quite clear—as Senator Brown makes out—that, in that sort of instance where there was not the urgency of, say, a terrorist attack, there would be time and it would be reasonable for notification to be given to the state or territory. The government would envisage that that would be done—and I place that on the record.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,"—That is what is wrong with this. The government `would envisage that that would be done', but it is not prepared to legislate that as a requirement. That is the government's and the opposition's whole problem here: two totally different situations are being dealt with. Civilians are being dealt with in one; terrorists are being dealt with in the other. The government and the opposition have mixed them all in together and they treat both groups of people in the same way under this law. That is what is wrong with this legislation.
That is why the Democrats are absolutely right: we should be reviewing this and treating it on its merits. There should be two pieces of legislation: one for terrorists, and one for civil emergencies that involve Australians protesting or striking about something or other. But they are all mixed in together. So here we have the situation where the troops can be called out against a civilian protest—an insurrection, if you like—and you do not have to notify the state.
I put to the minister again the Pangea situation of the future where you do not have a state in consonance with a federal authority; you have a political dispute. The state does not want it, but the federal government says, `We're going to have it.' The police force is held off and the federal government sends in the troops. This provision allows it to do so without even notifying the state that is involved. It should not be. It is bad legislation. It opens the door to people who have wrong motivations. Senator Ellison, of course, indicates that it would be used in a correct and proper way. Chair, you cannot leave this to chance; you have to legislate very carefully on matters like this—but it appears that neither the government nor the opposition is prepared to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—Senator Ellison, in raising the example of an airport, possibly is beginning to bring out one of the reasons why the Commonwealth is in the predicament it is in at the moment and maintains that it requires this bill. There has been an enormous amount of debate about the constitutional validity of the bill. In referring to airports, Senator Ellison has highlighted one of the problems that the government's own policies have brought about—and that is that airports, having been sold off to private enterprise, are no longer Commonwealth property. If the government had not been following this policy of selling off its airports, then there would be no uncertainty as to the constitutional validity in relation to either a domestic or terrorist attack on an airport. Airports would have been Commonwealth property. The Commonwealth in such instances would have had the right to protect its airports. So, in relation to airports, the government itself has brought itself into this predicament where it may well find its legislation invalid. 
The other interesting thing is: what other influences have been brought to bear in relation to this bill? At the moment, the minister's amendment is about a report that has to be produced under proposed section 51A(8). Proposed section 51A, which we were dealing with earlier, is about calling on the Commonwealth to protect Commonwealth interests. I would like to go to another media statement that was made in the Australian. It is in a section that was written by the Australian's correspondent in Jakarta, and it goes to the role of the ADF and the Indonesian military. The article states:
The highest-ranking military exchanges ever between Indonesia and Australia opened in Jakarta yesterday with the politically sensitive task: to debate the armed forces role in civil and political affairs.
The article goes on to say:
The 70 military officials will navigate their way through what has become a highly contentious subject in Indonesia, especially since the demise of former president Suharto last year.
It goes on to say:
Opposition politicians and student groups have maintained a vigorous campaign to end the armed forces so-called socio-political role under which it has a guaranteed representation in the parliament of 38 seats.
So we have the ADF over in Indonesia in discussions with the Indonesian military on how they control their dissidents, industrial unrest and student protests. I believe it is totally inappropriate for our government to be even considering adopting any of the methods concerning the way the defence forces in Indonesia carry out their roles. In speaking to this amendment, I believe an amendment that I will propose on another date will actually remove any uncertainty in relation to the Commonwealth calling out the ADF to protect Commonwealth property in a state. As Senator Brown clearly indicated earlier, that should not be allowed to occur without consultation and the agreement of the state itself. We are again walking into constitutional uncertainty where the government continues to insist that the Commonwealth will have the right to override the rights of the states.

Involvement of State or Territory
	(3)	If paragraph (1)(b) applies:

(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 6 (line 16), after ""the order"", insert "", or in deciding whether he or she is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (3A)"". 
Let me briefly speak to the amendments, because they are important. They go to the question of consultation, which has been an issue of concern raised in this chamber, in the Senate committee and more broadly in other interested bodies outside the parliament, particularly state governments. In the view of the opposition, it is essential that the Commonwealth be obliged to consult with the relevant state government before it undertakes any action under this legislation. We believe that, if that does not occur, there will obviously be the distinct possibility of confrontation between the Commonwealth and state governments. In the view of the opposition, that is not acceptable. We would not tolerate such a situation. That is the motivation for my moving the amendments that are currently before the committee.
The Commonwealth should consult with the relevant state government. At the very least, of course, this would have the benefit of clearly ascertaining what a state might be contemplating. I think it is very important from the point of view that consultation could reveal that action by the Commonwealth might not be necessary at all. We heard a lot in the committee earlier about the national antiterrorist plan. I am sure senators will be making the point to the committee that it is important that the Commonwealth does not override the national antiterrorist plan in any way. The government has indicated that this bill will not change the operation of the plan. I do think it is important that that assurance be repeated in this debate. Obviously, that is an area of concern to state governments. In terms of debate on this amendment, which I commend to the Senate, I would ask Senator Ellison to put that assurance on the record for the benefit of those who are concerned about this important issue.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—I can assure the committee that the operation of the bill will not impinge on the operation of the national antiterrorist plan—and, more particularly, nor will any of the amendments proposed by the government; nor will any of those that have been passed that have been put forward by the opposition. So that assurance is pretty clear.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-05,—I would like to follow up on that.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-05,"—For a start, the national antiterrorist plan is not legislation. This bill reflects the national antiterrorist plan in the form of legislation. That is the very point that we in the government have been making—through you, Chair, to Senator Brown—and I believe the opposition has too. We do have in place a situation which needs a legislative framework. This reflects the national antiterrorist plan, which does not have a legislative framework without the passage of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-05,"—I would like to go to the essence of the Labor amendments we are debating. I will be opposing the amendments. The bill, as printed, states:
If paragraph (1)(b) applies, the Governor-General may make the order whether or not the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory requests the making of the order.
As Senator Faulkner has pointed out, Labor's amendments attempt to oblige the Governor-General to consult with the state. Labor amendment No. (1) states:
	(3)	If paragraph (1)(b) applies:
	(a)	the Governor-General may make the order whether or not the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory requests the making of the order—
which is a repeat of the bill. The Labor amendments add a paragraph, and this is where I have a problem with them:
	(b)	if the Government of the State or the self-governing Territory does not request the making of the order, an authorising Minister must, subject to subsection (3A), consult that Government about the making of the order before the Governor-General makes it. 
Exception to paragraph (3)(b)
	(3A)	However, paragraph (3)(b) does not apply if the Governor-Governor is satisfied that, for reasons of urgency, it is impracticable to comply with the requirements of that paragraph.
I believe that part of the Labor amendments is, in essence, exactly the same as what the government has printed in the bill. As well as being obliged to consult with the state, the Commonwealth should not be able to call out the Australian defence forces against the will of the state. At a later date, I will be moving subsequent amendments that will give that effect. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's report on the bill speaks very clearly about the unwarranted interference in state affairs.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-09-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Tonight I wish to speak briefly to the six-monthly report on the co-regulatory scheme for Internet content regulation tabled today by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. This report dates from a resolution of the Senate on 30 September last year arising out of a motion moved by me on behalf of the opposition and on behalf of Senator Stott Despoja of the Australian Democrats. That motion had a number of aspects. For tonight's purposes, we should note that the third aspect of that motion sought that the government revisit aspects of the act and table a report on the effectiveness and consequences of that act in the Senate at six-monthly intervals. The report under discussion tonight gives effect to that resolution.
At the outset, I should say the report is a useful addendum to material currently available in this area of Internet content regulation. The report addresses the following aspects: the background to the co-regulatory scheme for online content, the scope of the scheme, the utility of industry codes of practice, progress to date on community education, complaint investigation, liaison with law enforcement agencies, research and international liaison. In the debate in the Senate last September, the opposition argued that the effectiveness of the act should be analysed having regard to the objects of the act; the minister's second reading speech; relevant Hansard comments from the committee process, both in the chamber and in public hearings; and, finally, the relevant aspects of the second reading speech of the opposition. This suggestion does not appear to have been adopted by the authors of the report.
Whilst the report certainly addresses the matters outlined above and provides a chronological description of the activities of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and various local and international agencies, the report is deficient in that it offers little, if any, analysis of the effectiveness of the act. The report certainly addresses a range of activities and, in some respects, the outcomes of those activities, but its critical failure, if that is not too harsh a phrase, is its lack of analysis. I will give some examples. Firstly, chart 1 at page 15 of the report identifies the number of complaints per month concerning offensive material. In January there were 46; February, 30; March, 47; April, 34; May, 31; and June, 13. The striking feature of such a chart is the trend line which shows, from January to June—with one minor exception—a significant decline in the number of complaints, which started out from a relatively low base. Elsewhere, the report identifies a significant degree of awareness of the act amongst community and family groups. Accordingly, one would have assumed a higher degree of complaint from the outset, possibly growing over time. Chart 1 shows the reverse and, whilst it is too early to draw final conclusions, one would have expected a degree of comment from the report authors on the apparent lack of complaints about offensive material by members of the community across Australia.
Secondly, table 2 on page 18 shows that 81 of the 91 complaints concerning prohibited content posted outside Australia derive from North America—either Canada or the United States. Indeed, the US have 75 complaints and Canada, six. Accordingly, one questions much of the focus of the government's activity in this area and the worth of the apparently ongoing range of multilateral negotiations and the establishment of protocols involving many countries when it is patently clear that the overwhelming source of content is derived from North America. Again, one would expect some comment or analysis from the government as to the utility, perhaps, of direct negotiations with the United States concerning the sourcing of such content from the US. The report, again, fails to deliver on that score. Otherwise, the material contained in the report is useful and shows that the government is intending to focus a large amount of resources and activity in the fields of education, community awareness, community education and complaint referral to relevant police agencies. The opposition has no particular complaint about these aspects. Indeed, during these debates the opposition argued for a strong focus on end-user education and community awareness raising. The opposition will continue to review the effectiveness of this particular act. But one should say, at this early stage—the first six-monthly review—that the lack of analysis of the effectiveness of the act is a shortcoming.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-09-05,"—First of all, a commendation to Senator Bishop, who has summed up quite expertly the deficiencies in the report before us. He has also outlined the history in relation to the amendment that produced this six-monthly—I was going to say `analysis'—report. The Democrats are similarly concerned about the operation and effectiveness of the act. We voted against the legislation last year because of our concerns about the nature of the government's proposal. Firstly, we thought that that legislation was unworkable in a technological sense and exposed a lack of understanding by the minister and the government of the Internet in particular and, secondly, we found the wide-ranging scope of the legislation undesirable. I reiterate, for the record, that the Internet, by its very nature and design, should overcome barriers. It is designed to be a democratic medium. Therefore, circumventing or prohibiting anything online is extremely difficult. That is why, in that debate, both the opposition and the Democrats—and Senator Bishop has pointed it out—indicated the need to emphasise awareness campaigns, public education and the end-users' responsibility, especially when it came to monitoring offensive or questionable sites and especially in relation to minors accessing those sites. No-one in that debate—including the people who opposed the legislation—supported offensive, illicit or illegal material being provided online for children. But we also recognised that we cannot remove from the equation the need for parental guidance and education at all levels. I was very curious and would have liked to have seen more of an examination or an analysis, as Senator Bishop has said, of those complaints before the ABA and what they meant in relation to understanding the act and education about the Internet.
I understand and acknowledge that the report points out that there will be more research and that the ABA has commissioned the development of a community education strategy, and I certainly commend that. It is worth acknowledging that, in the first six months of the scheme's operation, the ABA received 201 complaints. Thirty-seven of the investigations were terminated, apparently due to a lack of information. Of the other 160 investigations, 93 resulted in a finding that the content in question was either prohibited or potentially prohibited. The report goes on to explain that much of the material found by the ABA to be prohibited was of a highly offensive and illegal nature. It says that some 80 per cent of the prohibited content found to be hosted in Australia involved a child or minor being depicted in an offensive way or in a paedophile activity. All of us in this chamber would condemn that kind of material and its availability online. My question to the government is one that we asked during that debate: why would not that material have been covered under the Crimes Act or other legislation that was currently operating—that is, before this legislation was brought into being?
Essentially, the laws were already equipped to deal with illegal information, whether it was online or in any other environment. That means if it was illegal offline it should be illegal online. So paedophile activity, et cetera, online—as we all agreed in that debate—should not be available; it should not be online; it should not be accessible to minors, et cetera. We agreed that point. But this legislation, we believe, does little to improve the way we are perceived in the international community, especially when it comes to developing e-commerce and looking at how we can become a nation that accepts technological advances and exploits those advances in a positive way. I ask how our laws were not already equipped to deal with information that was illegal. 
I share Senator Bishop's concern at the lack of analysis in this report and, once again, ask the government—plead with the government—to not replicate the situation where we are an international laughing-stock in relation to our legislation on regulation of information online. Let us not do it again. Let us not revisit similar aspects of that debate when we get to the debate about gambling online, for example, where we also recognise—and certainly the Senate Select Committee on Information Technology recognises—that prohibition will not work online.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-09-05,"—Senator Stott Despoja has invited me to respond to her last remarks. I would really love to do that, but that is not my intention tonight. I am sure there will be plenty of other opportunity to do so in that ongoing debate.
—You can read that article in the paper.
—Have you read that article? I suggest, Senator Bishop, you read it very thoroughly. You will find it incredibly informative. I am not speaking about that tonight. I rise tonight to speak about concerns of irrigators in the Macquarie Valley in north-west New South Wales and the representations they have made to me about the very vexed issue of water rights. Last week I did speak about what was happening in the Macquarie Valley with their Macquarie 2100 plan, where they had worked out, for that region of Australia, their way forward: how small communities could survive in this new millennium and how, if they planned properly in terms of agriculture and a wide range of services, they could deliver to the people in their region a lifestyle that has a very long tradition and also a very great future, particularly if we can develop partnerships between the local region and state and federal governments to support what they are doing.
But it is not helpful when particularly the state government comes in and undermines their livelihood by not keeping to agreements that they have made nationwide through the COAG process, and that is what I want to draw the attention of the Senate to tonight. There are enormous concerns about the way in which the Carr government in New South Wales is delivering—or not delivering—the reform of water rights across this state. There are enormous problems in a number of rural areas. In areas of limited water we are actually trying to balance the needs of agriculture with the needs of the environment. This has got to be done in a very sensitive and planned way and not in the very ham-fisted way the New South Wales government is going about it at the moment.
The irrigators are looking for financial security and, of course, they are also looking for the protection of the vital asset of water. This is particularly the case in the Macquarie Valley, because their main crop is cotton, which is a major user of the resource of water. In the last drought, in 1994, there was a draining of all the water out of the nearby rivers, all the water under the aquifers of north-west New South Wales, as they tried to keep the cotton crop alive during the water shortages that occurred. We have to set up systems in such a way that we do not run into that problem again. The intention of the Carr government to deliver water security is a most admirable one, but the way they are going about it is likely to ruin some vital industries in these areas. 
There is a limit to how much water can be used in agriculture if you want to balance the environmental and agricultural needs, and we have got to consider a range of problems associated with water use, such as loss of wetland, blue-green algae blooms, decline in native fish populations, and increased salinity and bacterial levels. All of these things have got to be managed in a reasonable way. That is why all state and federal governments came together in 1994, through the COAG agreement, and set out a comprehensive package of reform to encourage a situation where water is properly valued and used in the most sustainable manner. Unfortunately, the irrigators in the Macquarie Valley feel that they have been very unfairly treated and that they are unreasonably bearing a large proportion of the cost of this reform process.
During the winter recess I travelled to the Macquarie region in north-west New South Wales and met with representatives from Macquarie River Food and Fibre, which represents about 600 irrigators in the area. The representatives expressed the view that they are facing a crisis in water usage in their area. They have deep concerns about the NSW government failing to implement national competition policy in water reform in the balanced way intended by the COAG agreement of 1994. Irrigators were told in 1995 that there would be pain during the reform process as the water industry moved to full cost recovery in pricing, mobilisation of the resource and the reduction of irrigator allocations. But irrigators were told that this pain would be balanced by a gain: structural adjustment assistance during the reform process, followed by security of water property rights. I would like to emphasise that point of the promise of security of water property rights. I was told by the Macquarie River Food and Fibre group that the gains just have not happened. Irrigators in Macquarie and across the state are paying more for their water, they are competing for it and they have had their entitlement cut, yet they have no ownership, no certainty, over this crucial asset of water.
The New South Wales government have received $450 million from the federal government to date in competition payments. This must be one of the greatest sleights of hand of finance between federal and state governments that has ever occurred. The Carr government have taken the $450 million and they have not allocated one cent of it to water reform in the state. They have an obligation to use competition payments to ease the pain of individuals, regions and the whole industry from this reform process. Yet I was told no irrigator in the state has been paid for water taken from them in the last five years.
The water management bill now before the NSW state parliament sets a similar tone for the future. The bill allows for the further erosion of irrigators' water entitlements every five years. In the bill there is no requirement for irrigators to be paid for reductions in this asset which they have purchased, borrowed against and depend on for income. I was given the following interesting analogy to describe the problem: `It's like buying a taxi cab, borrowing the money to set up the business and then having your taxi licence taken away from you, but you still have to pay off the loan.' That is the exact position these people suffering this desperate plight in the Macquarie Valley of New South Wales are in.
If the state government is committed to its obligations to ensure security for the environment in the water reform process, it will not attempt to implement legislation which shifts onto the industry the responsibility for paying for the cost of providing water. Aside from being contrary to COAG, this is an inequitable outcome, where one portion of the community bears the cost of maintaining and improving our environment. It is also unsustainable as the irrigation industry cannot afford to lose its income-earning potential and have its assets eroded still further and expect to survive into the future.
What can be done to steer this reform process back on track? First, I am told there is another competition payment of around $150 million due to the state governments any day now from the federal government in return for the successful enactment of water legislation in line with COAG. Surely this money cannot be released until fundamental tenets of COAG, such as property rights, are addressed in the new New South Wales legislation. We need time to allow COAG to be revisited and for the industry to be included in the development of a national standard in terms of a sustainable property right. If they do not get this right and ensure the costs of the environment rest with the whole community, the only certain outcome of this reform will be a decline in regional economies, like the Macquarie Valley in north-west New South Wales. As the irrigation industry struggles to foot the bill, this will be followed very closely by a decline in the health of our environmental resources. 
On 22 June this year the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation, Richard Amery, presented the Water Management Bill 2000 to the state parliament. The bill is expected to be debated during the spring session. The final date for submissions commenting on the bill closed last Thursday. I urge the responsible minister, Richard Amery, and the state government to take a serious look at the plight they are creating for the irrigators in their state, particularly those in the Macquarie Valley. Many are struggling to survive this water reform process. The state government has received money from the federal government under the COAG agreement and it is not paying for this restructuring. This is money that has been taken by the Carr Labor government under false pretences and it is money that must be passed on to the irrigators immediately.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Irrigation</title>,Adjournment,16,1
