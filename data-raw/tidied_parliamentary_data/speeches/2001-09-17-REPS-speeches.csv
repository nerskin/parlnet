(5)	In inviting suppliers to tender for the provision of goods, are suppliers advised that they must offer ANZ goods.
(6)	If the Minister's Department or agencies within the portfolio do not have weighting criteria for determining the principles, will the Minister take steps to ensure that they provide an appropriate means to demonstrate their compliance with Commonwealth procurement policy.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Transport and Regional Services Portfolio: Procurement Policies</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,3,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2001-09-17,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
I am advised by my department as follows:
(1)	Taken collectively, the Department and portfolio agencies are low to moderate consumers of paper.
(2)	Within the transport and regional services portfolio, only the Department and the National Capital Authority (“the NCA”) are required (under Regulation 8 of the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997) to have regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.  Nonetheless, other major portfolio agencies, such as Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have drawn upon the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines in the establishment of their own procurement manuals.
Both the Department's Chief Executive Instructions and the NCA's Financial Management and Administration Manual require officers to observe the requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.  The Department is establishing a central contract advisory unit to oversee major procurement activity and to ensure the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines are followed.    The NCA has an administrative Tender Board which reviews, advises on and approves all tender recommendations for contracts in excess of $50,000.
(3)	The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines treat the core principles equally.  Neither the Department nor the NCA weight the core principles, but do use weighting systems, dependant upon the circumstances of each procurement activity, that achieve outcomes that are consistent with the core principles.  The primary focus is on achieving value for money, consistent with the other core principles.
(4)	See answer to question 3.  It should be noted that procurement by the Department and the NCA is generally sourced from within Australia and New Zealand.
(5)	In the case of the Department, not normally, but in appropriate procurement activities such a course of action would be taken.  In the case of the NCA, no.
(6)	Both the Department and the NCA currently have regard to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, which do not require weightings.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Transport and Regional Services Portfolio: Procurement Policies</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,3,1,answer
