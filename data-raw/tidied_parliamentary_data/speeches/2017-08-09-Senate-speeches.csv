"PRESIDENT, The",,2017-08-09,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Order! Yesterday, the Deputy President informed the Senate that I had received letters from Senators Burston and Lambie seeking appointment to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation and References Committees. For the positions to be nominated by any minority group or Independent senators, in accordance with the standing orders, two ballots will be held to determine which one of the two senators is to be appointed to each committee. 


Before proceeding to the ballots, the bells will be rung for four minutes. The ballots will be conducted consecutively, starting with a ballot for the legislation committee. 




The bells being rung—





Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, on a point of order: I would like to seek an assurance from both nominees that they will attend these committees if they're appointed to them.



The PRESIDENT:  That's not really a point of order, Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Is there a way of asking the question formally? I suspect we're not in session at the moment.



The PRESIDENT:  The purpose of speaking whilst the bells are ringing, really, is to clarify points in relation to the ballot. The point you have made is probably not relevant to the ballot we are about to have. It's a matter for committees to determine attendance, and individual senators.




The bells having been rung—




The PRESIDENT:  Order! The bells have been rung for four minutes. We will now proceed to the ballot for the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. Grey ballot papers will be distributed and you are asked to write on the paper the name of the candidate you wish to vote for, and I remind you the candidates are Senators Burston and Lambie. I invite Senator Burston and Senator Lambie to act as scrutineers. I remind senators to remain in their seats during the entire process. 




A ballot having been taken—




The PRESIDENT:  Order! The result of the ballot being Senator Burston 29 votes and Senator Lambie 37 votes. Senator Lambie is elected. Unless any senator wishes for me to ring the bells again, I propose to move straight into the second ballot. No senator requests for the bells to be rung, so we will proceed to the ballot relating to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Pink ballot papers will be distributed. I indicate that the two candidates are again Senators Burston and Lambie. Senators, could I just propose this question: if any senator—and it is awkward because I don't want people to have to declare as it is a secret ballot—wanted to change their vote then we would proceed to a ballot. If senators wanted to keep the same vote they had in the first ballot then it would make no sense in having a second ballot. However, I am in the hands of senators as to whether you want to proceed to a ballot or not. Maybe if I just ask the question of the two leaders: do we wish to proceed to a ballot? The candidates?




Senator Wong:
  It is a matter for the candidates if they wish to proceed to another ballot. 



The PRESIDENT:  There is ambiguity. We will conduct a ballot. 




A ballot having been taken—




The PRESIDENT:  Has every senator voted? I will ask the Clerks to collect the ballot papers. Again, I invite the candidates Senators Burston and Lambie to come forward to act as scrutineers. There being 28 votes for Senator Burston and 37 votes for Senator Lambie, Senator Lambie again is elected to the position on the committee.

Senator XENOPHON



(

) (
10:49
):  I would indicate, in broad terms, that my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore may have some questions on this, because she has worked very closely on this issue. I would be grateful if the minister could explain what these amendments do. On the record, it's a result of negotiations between various parties, including my office and that of Senator Kakoschke-Moore, in particular. 


This was an amendment I moved that was passed in the chamber with the support of the opposition and others on the crossbench to deal with credit betting, a very serious issue because that can fuel gambling addiction. I understand there were some technical issues with it. I think it important that the minister explain what those amendments do. And I know that Senator Kakoschke-Moore has been forensically looking at this and has some questions in respect of it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (10:49):  Colleagues, as Senator Xenophon has outlined, you will recall that, when the bill was last before the Senate, the Senate agreed to an amendment moved by the Nick Xenophon Team in relation to the banning of offering lines of credit. At that time, I indicated that the government supported the policy of banning the offering of lines of credit, but that it was our preference to pursue that issue via the National Consumer Protection Framework that we're developing with the states and territories. Nonetheless, the government understands that the will of the Senate is that the Commonwealth legislate this ban as part of the bill.


However, as Senator Xenophon alluded to, there were some unintended consequences that flowed from the original amendment that passed the Senate. Primarily, the drafting of that amendment captured the telephone credit betting activities of on-course bookmakers. Credit betting by small on-course bookmakers, as opposed to the large online corporate operators, has been a longstanding traditional practice at racecourses for decades. It forms an important part of the business of on-course bookmakers. The government's consultation with bookmaker associations revealed that the amendment that was passed would have had a serious detrimental impact on many of the around 500 on-course bookmakers who operate across Australia, all of whom are effectively small businesses. It's important that I acknowledge that my belief is that certainly wasn't the intent of the colleagues who supported that amendment.


The government undertook consultation on an alternative set of amendments, including with the Australian Bookmakers Association, Responsible Wagering Australia, Financial Counselling Australia and Tabcorp. I should also note that, on 27 April, state and territory gambling ministers agreed to the proposition which was put forward in the House by the government. Those consultations gave the government confidence that the government amendments, which the House of Representatives agreed to in June, will enact the spirit and intent of the original Nick Xenophon Team amendments whilst avoiding the unintended consequences.


In summary, the government amendment moved in the House will prohibit wagering operators from providing or offering credit to customers. It will prohibit operators from promoting or facilitating credit via a third party, such as small account credit contracts, also known as pay-day lenders, which was not captured in the original Senate amendment. It will provide criminal and civil penalties for contravention of the credit prohibitions—up to $675,000 per day for companies, which is higher than the original Senate amendment. It will provide an exemption for on-course bookmakers, all of whom operate as small businesses, to provide credit via telephone. It will allow a transition period of six months before the prohibition comes into effect to allow wagering operators and consumers to adjust their business and betting practices, and no time limit is placed on the recovery of debts. It will give authority to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to undertake a statutory review after three years to assess the effectiveness of these new provisions. Credit will not be permitted to be provided via online means by any wagering operator. This measure will deliver on the government's 2013 election commitment and its response to the 2015 illegal offshore wagering review to ban lines of credit being offered for online betting altogether.


I thank my Senate colleagues for their constructive engagement and cooperation with the government as we worked to develop these amendments. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of my colleague Minister Tudge who has taken primary carriage of this matter and who has worked hard to achieve the important reforms that are contained in the bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:54):  I thank the minister for that explanation. Again, Senator Kakoschke-Moore will have a number of questions in relation to it. Clearly, credit betting is very problematic when it comes to fuelling, accelerating and causing gambling addiction, but I understand that credit betting from on-course bookmakers—not the corporate bookmakers; the online bookmakers—is very different in terms of levels of harm and the safeguards that can be implemented with on-course bookmakers. The fact that there is that physical contact is quite different—and we acknowledge that.


Of course, I do not support credit betting at all, but I'm also trying to be pragmatic and I do not want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Having said that, I think that a compromise has been reached. Whilst not perfect, it has been done in good faith with the government. We want to see how effective it will be and there obviously needs to be continual review for those parts of the bill that we thought should have gone further. But, for those parts of the bill that did good work in this space in terms of dealing with online gambling and dealing with problem gambling from online betting, this bill is overall a beneficial bill and that is why we should not stand in its way.


Of course, we do want to go further. I am pleased that the minister has sought the advice of Financial Counselling Australia. I launched their report a couple of years ago on the impact of online betting, which was a trigger for introducing the legislation that I introduced, and Senator Kakoschke-Moore has worked with me very closely in terms of this. So we do not stand in the way of these amendments, but we think it is important to raise some concerns about loopholes in relation to the bill and the continual monitoring that needs to take place in respect of that. Having said that, we will not oppose this bill but we think that there are some legitimate questions to ask in terms of the ongoing monitoring of this bill as to its effectiveness.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (10:56):  Minister, I wanted to ask some questions around some of the exemptions that are provided for in the bill—in particular, the exemption that exists for where a wagering provider is not subject to these rules if they reasonably believe that their client is not based in Australia. A situation that comes to my mind could be where a customer creates an account for an online wagering provider, provides details that indicate that they are living in the US when in actual fact they're living in Australia. Can you provide the chamber with some more information about how the decision is made that the sports betting company has acted in good faith in providing credit to that customer whom they believed was outside of Australia?

Senator FIFIELD

If someone is seeking to misrepresent where they live or they're using a VPN that would indicate that they're located somewhere other than where they are, we do not believe that it's reasonable that the particular organisation is held liable for that when, after having taken appropriate due diligence, they believe that the person is not resident in Australia.

Is the government seeking to shorten that period of time? I'm just concerned that you could have a situation where a client is accessing credit for a period of up to 90 days before they are discovered as being a resident of Australia.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:01):  I have a few remarks on this revisiting of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. The Senate is again fiddling with it. The bill seeks to ban in-play gambling, in-play sports betting, with Australian providers and is operating under the deluded idea that other countries will somehow respect Australia's prohibition approach, even when they don't agree with it themselves and their preferred approach is to regulate, monitor and tax. I am led to believe that Australia is even contemplating taking a leaf out of China's book by IP blocking if that does not work. 


This is despite the evidence about online poker—which is my primary concern in relation to this legislation and is again caught up in this ban. Online poker is less harmful than other services that are allowed under the Interactive Gambling Act, like online sports betting. This was confirmed at a recent hearing of the inquiry into online poker which I established. Online poker is a game requiring considerable skill and results in very little problem gambling. Poker can, of course, be played in pubs, clubs, casinos and private homes but not online, unless on an overseas site, where consumer protections are far less utilised. This is absurd. I call on the government and other senators to commit to enacting the inquiry's recommendations in relation to online poker when the committee reports next month.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (11:03):  Senator Leyonhjelm, I am well aware of your view on this matter and of the inquiry that is underway. The only comment I would make is that this legislation is, in part, seeking to give effect to the original intent of the IGA, which did not envisage that poker would be legal in the form that some people had the view that it was. So part of the purpose of this legislation is to make clear the original intent of the original legislation.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:04): Labor has always maintained a strong stance to ensure appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community. The majority of people who bet enjoy it and gamble in a responsible manner. However, Labor also knows that gambling in our community can, in some cases, have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. That's why we have supported many elements of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. This bill is an important starting point that will go towards improving the protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment. 


With regard to the government's amendment, Labor's been very clear on its position when it comes to a ban on credit betting. We think a ban on credit betting is an important part of harm minimisation measures, especially in relation to problem gambling. It is very pleasing to see the government has picked up on this element of harm minimisation reform. However, I have to say, although we are pleased by this measure, we are disappointed the government was slow to act to ban credit betting. As part of the first tranche of reform, the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 fails to include a ban on credit betting, even though this has been coalition policy since August 2013. Unlike Labor, coalition senators also failed to support a Senate amendment prohibiting credit betting. 


I'd also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the consultation that has occurred in relation to the track-side bookmakers and the exemptions that will be provided in this bill for them. When it comes to that exemption, I understand my colleague in the other place the member for Franklin has sought some assurances from the government and the minister that the turnover of $30 million is an appropriate threshold to have this exemption for track-side bookmakers. It is, of course, only intended for track-side bookmakers that this occurs. So, if there is any way that any other of the gaming operators try to get through this loophole, we would expect the government to act on that. 


So, in relation to this bill, we are, on this side of the chamber, really pleased to see that, finally, we will get some harm minimisation for people in an online gambling environment. Consequently, we will be supporting the government's amendment. Thank you.

We are on the same page, particularly in relation to the issue of credit betting. It was always the government's intention to address that. We're proposing it, through the framework, with the states and territories, but we do recognise the will of the Senate on this matter, and the legislation in its current form will give effect to that.

 (South Australia) (10:59):  I now want to turn to the issue of payday lenders. I am seeking some clarification in relation to what the prohibition specifically applies to. Does this prohibition relate to payday lenders offering credit for gambling purposes in general or is the prohibition against wagering services providing a referral to a payday lender, to a client, in order to obtain credit to bet with?

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:01):  I have a few remarks on this revisiting of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. The Senate is again fiddling with it. The bill seeks to ban in-play gambling, in-play sports betting, with Australian providers and is operating under the deluded idea that other countries will somehow respect Australia's prohibition approach, even when they don't agree with it themselves and their preferred approach is to regulate, monitor and tax. I am led to believe that Australia is even contemplating taking a leaf out of China's book by IP blocking if that does not work. 


This is despite the evidence about online poker—which is my primary concern in relation to this legislation and is again caught up in this ban. Online poker is less harmful than other services that are allowed under the Interactive Gambling Act, like online sports betting. This was confirmed at a recent hearing of the inquiry into online poker which I established. Online poker is a game requiring considerable skill and results in very little problem gambling. Poker can, of course, be played in pubs, clubs, casinos and private homes but not online, unless on an overseas site, where consumer protections are far less utilised. This is absurd. I call on the government and other senators to commit to enacting the inquiry's recommendations in relation to online poker when the committee reports next month.

So part of the purpose of this legislation is to make clear the original intent of the original legislation.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:04): Labor has always maintained a strong stance to ensure appropriate harm minimisation measures are in place to protect and assist our community. The majority of people who bet enjoy it and gamble in a responsible manner. However, Labor also knows that gambling in our community can, in some cases, have devastating social, financial and emotional consequences. That's why we have supported many elements of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. This bill is an important starting point that will go towards improving the protections for those who choose to wager within an online environment. 


With regard to the government's amendment, Labor's been very clear on its position when it comes to a ban on credit betting. We think a ban on credit betting is an important part of harm minimisation measures, especially in relation to problem gambling. It is very pleasing to see the government has picked up on this element of harm minimisation reform. However, I have to say, although we are pleased by this measure, we are disappointed the government was slow to act to ban credit betting. As part of the first tranche of reform, the government's Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016 fails to include a ban on credit betting, even though this has been coalition policy since August 2013. Unlike Labor, coalition senators also failed to support a Senate amendment prohibiting credit betting. 


I'd also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the consultation that has occurred in relation to the track-side bookmakers and the exemptions that will be provided in this bill for them. When it comes to that exemption, I understand my colleague in the other place the member for Franklin has sought some assurances from the government and the minister that the turnover of $30 million is an appropriate threshold to have this exemption for track-side bookmakers. It is, of course, only intended for track-side bookmakers that this occurs. So, if there is any way that any other of the gaming operators try to get through this loophole, we would expect the government to act on that. 


So, in relation to this bill, we are, on this side of the chamber, really pleased to see that, finally, we will get some harm minimisation for people in an online gambling environment. Consequently, we will be supporting the government's amendment. Thank you.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  Australia is a close and longstanding partner to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a country that I have visited many times over the last decade and I have come to develop a great affection for. From the 25 to 30 June, I had the great privilege of representing the Australian government as one of four Australian observers to the 2017 PNG elections.


I would like to start by warmly congratulating Papua New Guinea on the successful conduct of their ninth election since independence. I also congratulate all 111 successful candidates who were elected, and also Peter O'Neill on his re-election as Prime Minister. I was accompanied by my Senate colleague, Senator Moore, and also MPs, Andrew Laming and Cathy McGowan. I spent my time between two provinces. The first was the Eastern Highlands and the second was the Gulf Province—two very rich and wonderfully diverse communities and societies with two very different approaches to democratic elections.


This observer mission demonstrates Australia's commitment to supporting Papua New Guinea's democracy and the observations of all four of us will inform Australia's ongoing support to strengthen PNG's electoral systems. Geographic proximity and also our deep historical ties have given Papua New Guinea a very special place in Australia's foreign relations, and our bilateral relationship is certainly one of the most complex and wide-ranging with any nation. We are increasingly working together to strengthen governance in line with PNG's own policy priorities. Australia's official development assistance to PNG last financial year was over $500 million.


Having supported Australian programs—this is myself—to encourage female candidates, but also to strengthen political parties in PNG, on a very personal level this election provided mixed results in both areas. It was wonderful to see the evolution of political party administration and professionalism in Papua New Guinea. I would like to congratulate my friend, Dr Alphonse Gelu, for his tireless commitment to this cause over many years. But it was personally very disappointing to see that not a single woman will now sit in the PNG's next parliament. For this election, Australia provided training for a quarter of all female candidates standing for election in Papua New Guinea. That is 42 out of 165 women who stood at this election.


I would like to take this time to commend the outgoing female members of parliament, Delilah Gore, Julie Soso and also Loujaya Kouza for the important contribution they have made to Papua New Guinea's democracy, and I have no doubt that they will continue the work in encouraging more women to stand, and be in a position to win, in five years' time.


Our longstanding support for the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission has also helped enable implementation of practical measures for women who are voting, and to do so in a way that is unimpeded by others at the booth. One of those in particular was the advent of a separate line for men and women going into the polling booth. I was very pleased to see at most of the polling places I went to that this was observed—in a number of different ways, but it was observed—and I think it was of benefit to a number of the women who were seeking to exercise a free vote.


Papua New Guinea is without question an endlessly fascinating and complex nation where locals will always tell you to expect the unexpected. On my return from Papua New Guinea, I was more convinced than ever that Australians would benefit from a bit more of the spirit of Papua New Guineans. That is, a spirit, a passion, for democracy. I think all of us here in Australia would be far better from a little bit more of that spirit of Papua New Guinea, and not being afraid of having robust and passionate debates of issues of importance and importance to our democracy.


The Papua New Guineans whom I know, my friends, all have wonderful senses of humour, a generosity of spirit, deep religious beliefs and a great love of and connection to family and to tribal lands. One of the things that I greatly admire in Papua New Guineans is that, over centuries, they have developed the ability to robustly and respectfully debate important issues within their communities but also then accept a consensus community decision. The tough subsistence living of so many, which I again witnessed on this visit, is unimaginable to most Australians today. But it does make Papua New Guineans an incredibly resilient and endlessly patient society. With over 1,000 tribes and 800 language groups, they also mostly manage cultural and ethnic diversity very well, albeit still with the occasional clan and tribal skirmishes. 


Ultimately, however, what unites the nation of Papua New Guinea is a deep love for family, community, rugby and participating in elections. It unites the entire nation. Despite the well-documented problems with the administration and conduct of the election, there has been a result, and PNG democracy will continue to survive, but I believe it will evolve in a very distinctly Papua New Guinean fashion. In a way, what I saw there was that it is evolving and adapting classical democratic concepts and processes and merging them with tribal traditions to meet their own needs and requirements in the 21st century. I definitely saw this in action in a number of communities in the Eastern Highlands. All of this is not to underplay the significants socio-economic challenges Papua New Guinea still faces. PNG society, like society elsewhere in the world, is changing. Urbanisation is putting strain on traditional cultural values and family and societal structures, norms and support. 


Responsibility for delivering this election lies with the Papua New Guinean government. In line with the Papua New Guinean electoral processes, and the expectations of the Papua New Guinean people, the PNG Electoral Commission was led by Commissioner Gamato, who I have to say had a very challenging role in delivering this election. Australia worked very closely with PNG to support the delivery of this election, including assisting the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission with wide-ranging logistical support and training of electoral staff. 


The Papua New Guinean terrain and the dispersal of communities mean that it is one of the most logistically challenging locations in the world in which to conduct an election. I was very proud, when I was up there, to see the ADF helping with transport. They transported over 90 tonnes of material, nearly 1,000 local election staff and over 600 members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force who were involved in election delivery. It was great to see over 200 Australian personnel up there, quietly but very effectively providing air assets to transport materials and people to over 18 airfields—some of the most challenging to get to in the world. 


I had the pleasure and the honour of meeting with the ADF personnel deployed on Operation Hannah, the ADF's contribution to supporting the PNG elections. I was honoured meet with Operation Hannah headquarters staff at Murray Barracks and thank them for the valuable work they were doing to contribute to Papua New Guinean democracy. The operation also, significantly for Australia, provided an environmental understanding for us in the lead-up to APEC 2018 and the Bougainville referendum, which we are committed to supporting. That the ADF was able to undertake such a significant operation overseas whilst simultaneously delivering effectively all other overseas operational deployments, but also Exercise Talisman Sabre, is a real testament to the enhanced operational capabilities of today's ADF. I congratulate them all. 


I would like to finish by thanking Heather Murphy from DFAT, who was my liaison officer throughout the observer mission. She succeeded in not losing a senator in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. I thank her very much for that and for her professionalism and commitment. I also thank the High Commissioner, Bruce Davis, and the Deputy High Commissioner, Bronte Moules, both of whom provide very professional and very wonderful support. They do Australia proud, they and their team, in their support of the Australian government in Papua New Guinea.


The Australian government looks forward to a productive working relationship with Prime Minister O'Neill and Papua New Guinea's new government and parliament. I wish the new government well. I will do all I can personally to support the Australian government's continued work with the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission to further strengthen electoral administration, particularly in relation to voter identification; to strengthen the integrity of the common roll; and, of course, to work with their women.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  Thank you, Senator Wong. That is a very important question, of course. Reports that North Korea has acquired the ability to develop a miniaturised nuclear device which may be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile are deeply unsettling. We need to be clear that responsibility for tension and instability arising out of the Korean Peninsula lies at the feet of the regime in Pyongyang, whose actions contravene international law, pose a serious threat to global peace, stability and the rules based order we seek to protect and advance. 


North Korea has been in flagrant violation of no fewer than six United Nations Security Council resolutions going back as far as 2006, which condemn its multiple missile launches and five nuclear tests—most recently its ICBM test on 28 July this year. North Korea has a chequered history of making and breaking promises to wind back its illegal nuclear weapons and missile programs. Since taking power in December 2011, Kim Jong-un has accelerated the development of these programs. 


If a North Korean intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile is capable of reaching the United States, then such a weapon is capable of reaching Australia and poses an unacceptable, existential threat to our country. Australia's policy, with respect to confronting this challenge, remains clear and consistent. Presently, North Korea is defiant; however, Pyongyang is deterrable, if the international community is determined and resolute. The collective way forward is to call on all countries to fully implement UNSC sanctions against North Korea. (Time expired)

Australia has sanctioned 37 people and 31 entities under our autonomous sanctions measures.

In fact, on 30 November, Australia was a co-sponsor of UN Security Council Resolution 2321, which placed additional UN sanctions on North Korea. We strongly support Resolution 2371, passed on 5 August, which places further significant restrictions on trade with North Korea, including on its exports of coal, iron, lead, and seafood. But all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with North Korea, must use their leverage.

So, as I said, we were a co-sponsor of Resolution 2321 last November. We are one of the nations that supported Resolution 2371, supported by almost all members of the United Nations, which was passed four days ago, which is the most comprehensive sanctions package against Pyongyang to date. As I was saying to you a moment ago, all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with North Korea, must use their leverage to place pressure on Pyongyang to change North Korea's calculations, and the Australian government calls upon them to do so. All nations, but most critically the P5, must defend the authority of the United Nations Security Council. We are constantly reviewing and extending our autonomous sanctions regime to complement and augment security council sanctions.

Senator Bilyk, I must say I entirely disagree with your view that the only recommendation that matters is the one which is currently under consideration. I don't agree with that at all.


If you read the Finkel report, if you read the recommendations, you will understand, Senator Bilyk, that they represent a comprehensive strategy to attack the twin issues of energy affordability and energy reliability. These are the issues that matter most to the Australian people, Senator Bilyk—reliability and affordability. In approaching the Finkel report, and in approaching the appropriate policy choices and policy responses to this problem, this government will be guided by pragmatism. We will be guided by engineering; we will be guided by the facts. One thing that we will not be guided by, Senator Bilyk, is ideology. It is because your side of politics was guided by ideology in its approach to energy policy that, during the period of the Labor government, electricity prices rose by 101 per cent over six years. Because your side of politics, Senator Bilyk, was guided by ideology not engineering, in the state of South Australia the Weatherill Labor government cannot even keep the lights on. The Turnbull government is determined to ensure that power in Australia is affordable and that supply is reliable. And that will shape our response.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Pratt today relating to a proposed postal survey concerning marriage equality.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Pratt, could you resume your seat. Could we have order in the chamber, please? If you are not participating in this current session, please resume your seat or leave the chamber. Thank you, Senator Pratt.




Senator PRATT:
  This Monday, the Liberal party room came to a decision that broke the hearts of hundreds and thousands of LGBTI Australians. Those in the coalition have decided to denigrate the LGBTIQ community by attempting to pass the plebiscite through this place yet again, and I thank my Labor colleagues and those on the crossbenches for again voting this ridiculous plebiscite plan down. Yet, in another slap to the face of our community and, indeed, all Australians, this government has decided that it's appropriate to spend some $122 million on a divisive, hateful and, frankly, illegitimate postal survey. This illegitimate postal survey is simply a result of the compromising position that this weak Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, finds himself in. What we have here is a situation where the government has needed to satisfy the extreme right wing of the coalition in a search for stability. Prime Minister Turnbull has decided to spend this ridiculous amount of taxpayer money on an illegitimate postal survey that members of his own government have not even gone to the extent of honouring the outcome of, in terms of how they will then vote in this place.


As my question highlighted, there are a great many things that $122 million of taxpayer money could be better spent on, and I'm particularly moved by the Facebook post of one Jackie Hodson, who has cystic fibrosis. When the previous version of the plebiscite was being considered, she posted the following on her Facebook page: 'It's going to cost roughly $160 million for the government to run the plebiscite to confirm what we already know—that the Australian society supports same-sex marriage. Here I am, 25 years old and fighting to breathe. I have battled cystic fibrosis since infancy, and now I'm facing a big, fat fight to stay alive on revolutionary medicine that is saving my life.' She says she's been lucky to be on the medicine Orkambi through a compassionate scheme. However, there are thousands of other children and young adults who need this drug now, and some will die while they wait. She goes on to say: 'I can't understand how we can justify letting innocent people die unnecessarily. How can we justify breaking the hearts of all our mums and dads, brothers, sisters, partners? How can the comparable cost of this plebiscite, a vote, be justified while denying me a lifeline—my only chance to marry the love of my life, have a family of my own and grow old? Both injustices need to end, and they need to end now. Love is love, and please let me breathe easy.' And she has asked people to share her Facebook post.


So there are a great many other priorities that this government could spend that money on. I would love to see that $122 million given to the PBS so that they can weigh up the decision of funding medicines like Orkambi or other important life-saving drugs. It is a ridiculous waste of priorities on the part of this nation to save the Prime Minister's skin, to gloss over their internal division—to spend this money on a wasteful postal plebiscite. That $122 million could go to a great many other worthwhile causes in our nation.


As Senator Brandis highlighted in his answer to my question, why has Mr Bill Shorten put up a plebiscite on the republican question? The simple fact is: to change that problem requires a change in our constitution, whereas marriage equality can be determined by this place and the other place by a simple vote. And you will not even bind your members to uphold its findings. (Time expired)

A plebiscite done by the government is bad for her friend who needs medicines, but two plebiscites run by the Labor Party are, apparently, okay. Senator Pratt, you certainly can't really seriously believe that argument. If you are right—and I don't think you are—on the argument about the cost, then it's doubly wrong for Mr Shorten to promise that twice.

But I do want to, particularly at this time, acknowledge the University of Queensland LNC, who did a survey of young people clearly showing that young people wanted the people of Australia to decide this issue. So I thank them for that. Senator Pratt justifies Mr Shorten having a plebiscite on something that requires not a plebiscite but a referendum to change the constitution. Again, Senator Pratt, through you, Madam Deputy President, Senator Pratt should be aware of that.


This is an issue which has been debated to death. I simply say again—and repeating the leader's comment to Senator Pratt, through you, Madam Deputy President: if Senator Pratt had voted for this plebiscite last year, the whole issue would have been over and done with by now. It would have been resolved six months ago.




Senator Brandis:
  11 February.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  On 11 February we would have had a resolution. Yet, it's Senator Pratt and her team, the Greens and Senator Xenophon—who should not be excused from this stupidity—who are determined to carry on this debate for political reasons, as Senator Brandis has mentioned. There is no policy purity at all in the Labor Party's position, or in the position of the Greens or Senator Xenophon, not that we ever expect any sort of decent policy from any of those people.


Senator Pratt, why do you object to the Australian people having a vote on this? Your leader wants the Australian people to have a vote on two particular issues, neither of which too many people are talking about. Here is something that so many Australians had so many different views about. It was an appropriate question to put to the people of Australia. Why don't you trust the people of Australia? Why didn't you allow this to go to a vote six months ago—and then we wouldn't be talking about this today. People who you say are concerned by the indecision wouldn't have been indecisive had you and your team—I say that through you, Madam Deputy President—agreed to have a plebiscite. It would have been resolved six months ago and we'd be moving onto the issues which are of real importance to the people of Australia—things like jobs; things like health, as you mention; things like education; and things like the economy generally—rather than wasting so much time on this, and now having to go through a postal plebiscite to get the views of the people of Australia.


It would have been much better to have a compulsory plebiscite. You people and your allies have chosen not to do that, so we will go to the postal plebiscite and we'll still get from that the views of the majority of Australian people, and I can't understand why that frightens you. I indicate, and I've indicated publicly before, that I will be voting no in the plebiscite, but if the majority of Australians say yes I will be voting yes when the bill comes before the parliament. I can't understand, Senator Pratt. Again, I feel for you that you are running such a contradictory argument.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-08-09,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:11):  Unfortunately over the course of this week we've seen yet another shambles from the Turnbull government, a government that is becoming very well known for the shambles that it creates every time it turns its hand to any form of policy. We're seeing it on energy policy, we're seeing it on housing affordability policy, we're seeing it on education—whether it be higher education or schools—policy and we're seeing it on employment policy. Everything it touches becomes a shambles. There is no difference with the marriage equality debate, where it's happening again, but, sadly, this is a debate in which the shambles the government is creating is going to see a lot of innocent people get very badly hurt.


Now, we know from opinion poll after opinion poll that the vast majority of Australians—I think it's in the order of 70 per cent—support marriage equality and just want to see it get done. We all know how polarised the political debate in our country has become about so many different issues over recent years, where we can't reach agreement and where the community is divided. This is an issue where the community has spoken loudly and clearly on over and over again. There are few issues you could find where you would get such a vast majority of community support as you could find with marriage equality. But rather than just get on with it, act and vote for it, as we do on every other issue—barring constitutional change—in this chamber, the government has chosen to use this as yet another opportunity to settle old scores, to turn on each other and knife each other, and to create yet another policy shambles.


The so-called solution that has come out of the coalition party room this week, headed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, is an absolute joke. Step 1 was to send back to the Senate the request to have an in-person, voting plebiscite, knowing full well that the Senate would vote it down—and that is what we did again today. The government knew that that was an absolutely futile exercise, that nothing had changed and the Senate was still going to vote against a plebiscite where people would turn up and vote. But that was step 1—send it back in there with this forlorn hope that something might have changed. Inevitably, this morning it was voted down by the Senate. So, step 1: a complete failure. 


Let's move onto step 2: a $120 million postal survey conducted by the census-fail organisation, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is a postal survey which will not only be incredibly expensive; it will be optional, it will be divisive, it will be ignored by many members of the coalition party room, when we end up getting to a vote anyway, it will be non-binding—so you've really got to wonder what is the point in having it happen—and we all know from a range of legal opinions that there is actually a real legal cloud over whether this postal survey is even legally permissible to conduct. We will have to wait to see what the High Court says. What an absolute shambles. Step 1, send it to the Senate where it will be inevitably knocked over; and, step 2, send it off to a postal survey which is riddled with holes and which many coalition MPs have said they will ignore the result of no matter what the result is. What an absolute shambles.


Focusing for a moment on the cost of this postal survey: $120 million. In the electorates that I represent, I can think of a large number of things where that money would be better spent. In Rockhampton, in Central Queensland, many people in the community want to see a flood levee built to prevent the town from flooding into the future. This postal survey would pay for three flood levees in the city of Rockhampton. But, instead of doing that, this government is happy to spend money on a postal survey which its own members of parliament will actually ignore. On the Gold Coast, the $120 million amounts to three times the cuts that Minister Steven Ciobo, the federal Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, has made to tourism spending. I can think of a lot of tourism businesses on the Gold Coast that could really benefit from some of that tourism funding being restored. But, instead of that, we're going to waste this money on a postal survey which the members of parliament will actually end up ignoring. 


In the short time that we’ve had available, I put out a request to Queenslanders to let me know their stories about what this postal survey will mean to them, and I have had quite a number of requests overnight from people. I will just read a couple of them in the time I have remaining. Angela, who has been with her partner, a female partner, for 20 years, said:


There's barely a cross word between us. We are still as madly in love today as we have ever been. We have two gorgeous children and two little grandchildren. We'd like to get married in front of our family and friends.


In the end she says:


We just want to feel equal. We just want to share that loving moment with those we love and who love us.


That's not a lot to ask, but, unfortunately, this government is making it harder and harder for them to experience that. From Audrey:


My story is like many others that struggle growing up. All through primary school and high school I wished and hoped that I wouldn't end up being gay. I hid my true self for so many years.


This government is getting in the way of these people having their relationships recognised. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  I, too, rise to take note of the Attorney-General's answer to Senator Pratt's question. We've just heard from the last two speakers on the other side a lot about values, compassion and legal equality. There are other values here that I think are very important. They talk about all those values as if they are the only people in this chamber who have those values. I support same-sex marriage and, if the plebiscite comes back, yes, I will certainly be voting for it. However, like my colleagues on this side of the chamber, a value that we honour and respect greatly is that of keeping our promises. We went to the last election with an absolute commitment that we would put this issue to the Australian people so that they could have their say. It was a very clearly commitment—and one that we have reaffirmed again this week that we will work to honour. I respect that. I participated in the seven hours of debate and discussion two years ago, and I understood the reason that our party room took that decision and it is a reason I still support. It is a way of having this issue resolved once and for all.


I listened to the hypocrisy on a whole range of issues wafting over this chamber to this side from those opposite, and I would like to address each of those issues. First of all, I will address their sudden concern about having plebiscites. This sudden concern comes in the same week that their Leader of the Opposition has proposed at least two plebiscites on issues that they would like to address, including one that we have already in recent times had a referendum on. I cannot recall the last time that those on the other side of the chamber showed any concern about fiscal restraint—putting this nation on a trajectory of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt—and yet they fall to the depths in here in this debate today and say that this will cause people's deaths. It's tacky, it's sad and I think it sells all Australians short.


But the thing that upsets me most about what those opposite have been promoting—in what is really just playing politics with this issue—is their distrust of the Australian people. Our founding fathers, our own founders, didn't enshrine a bill of rights in our Constitution, because they had faith in the people in this chamber that we would move with the times and we would represent, in a representative government, the contemporary will of the Australian people. But, to do that, plebiscites are conducted when we want to actually make sure that we've got the will of the people right. There is absolutely nothing wrong with and there is nothing to fear from Australians having their say.


Everywhere I go and I meet younger Australians, they tell me: 'We want to be heard. We want to have our say.' This is something that is important, particularly to under 30s. They want to have their say on this issue. I would have thought those in this chamber would have embraced the opportunity for younger Australians to have their say on this issue, to influence government policy, to talk to their family members, to talk to their parents and to find a voice electorally. That is not something to be afraid of. Those opposite have so little confidence that the Australian people can engage in a robust but respectful debate on an issue on which there is great diversity of opinion in the Australian community. I have to say, 'Shame on you,' to those opposite for not having confidence in the Australian people that we can any more discuss issues of great importance to our country. 


Our founders would be very disappointed in the fact that so many people in this chamber and in the other place do not have the confidence to go out, listen to what Australians have to say and then enact it. I remind all of us in this chamber that the only reason we are still discussing this here today—and not issues like electricity prices, jobs and all those other issues—is that the opposition played politics with it. At the last election, you did not have a position on this publicly. We did. We are delivering our commitment to the Australian people, and I am extremely proud of that. When you think about the implications of what you are doing—what you have done and what you did here again today—by denying Australians the opportunity to have their say in a proper plebiscite, in a full plebiscite, I think you should hang your heads in shame. You have done a great disservice to all Australians.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-08-09,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:21):  I will just pick up on what the previous speaker said about confidence. I would question that. It is more about competence. There has been no preparation in terms of what a postal plebiscite would look like in this country. If you look at the Northern Territory, for example—



An honourable senator interjecting—  




Senator McCARTHY:
  And let me tell you, Senator, you will need to hear this—we have 43 town camps, 72 remote Indigenous communities and 500 homelands. What consideration have you given to the over 100 Aboriginal languages and the translations that should take place? Earlier this year we heard the sister girls on the Tiwi Islands speak very passionately about the fact that it has been enormously difficult for them to be able to talk about the issues and to stand strong as members of the lesbian and gay community across Australia. In the previous debate in this Senate, in November, we discussed and debated the mental health issues and expressed directly concerns about the effect that any plebiscite, postal or otherwise, would have on the health and wellbeing of those in the LGBTI community. I can speak about the people of the Northern Territory and what they have said to me consistently, over the last 12 months in particular, as we have discussed this. 


Minister, you did not give a response at all about the cost of this. You played politics with this. One hundred and twenty-two million dollars is a considerable amount of money. This is where we look at, in terms of first nations peoples, the cuts to Aboriginal health and, in the LGBTIQ area specifically, the cuts of $800,000. The question that is coming forward is: where is your concern really, in all of this? We know for a fact, don't we, that this isn't about whether the Australian people should have a right to speak? This is about the Turnbull government's inability to lead this country in a comprehensive and confident way that lets the families of Australia know that this parliament cares—because you don't care. You do not care. You simply do not care. You have taken this parliament, and this country, down a path that is illogical and irresponsible, and basically you've wimped out on your role as government leaders of this country. 


An online poll of more than 2,000 people, just in the Northern Territory, showed that 72 per cent—almost three in four respondents—supported change to the Marriage Act. That was the front page of the Northern Territory News today. We in the Northern Territory know for a fact that this parliament can vote today. This parliament should vote today. We have heard time and time again of the unnecessary impact that this will have on families in this country as a result of the cowardice of the Turnbull cabinet and the Turnbull government. It should allow this vote on the floor of both the Senate and the House of Reps. Putting families through extraordinarily torturous trauma, which you have heard of personally from members in this house, where you are wilfully deaf and wilfully blind for your own purposes is not a justification that brings the right way in leading this country. It is a justification only for your personal goals—to hold onto what little team you have in your very divisive cabinet.


The questions that are coming through from families across Australia—and certainly, to my email, from the Northern Territory—are: will Australians living overseas be able to vote; what will the government do to ensure people are on the electoral roll; what are you putting in place to ensure the ABS doesn't repeat the mistakes of the census operation; how will you ensure Aboriginal people living remotely and in town camps will have a vote in this, the 50th year since the referendum of 1967?

Senator GALLAGHER:
  Labor has no option but to oppose this motion, because it claims that the Reef 2050 plan is being delivered early. This government is not delivering early for the environment or for the reef. This government is failing on climate change, and the Liberal National Party in Queensland voted against reef protections aimed at limiting tree clearing. The Liberal-National Party chose to protect its mates who want to bulldoze trees and native vegetation, rather than protecting Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef. It isn't the fault of the state government in Queensland that land-clearing regulations haven't been updated. This position that damages the reef by increased sediment run-off from land to the reef is being championed by the Liberal-National Party. The Queensland government put in legislation to strengthen land-clearing laws to halt the broadscale clearing of remnant vegetation which is destroying key wildlife habitat and contributing to climate change, but the Liberal-National Party voted against the legislation and reef protection. At the time, Labor in Queensland made it clear that the Liberal-National Party have abandoned the reef plan and that the Palaszczuk government remains 100 per cent committed to it. (Time expired)

The decision recognises Australia's significant efforts and investment in an early and effective implementation of the Reef 2050 Plan. Again, we're just asking to note that this is what the UN has said.

Senator RICE:
  The arrogance of Senator Macdonald and Senator O'Sullivan's motion today is gobsmacking. Yes, desperate lobbying by the Australian government has managed to avoid the down-listing of the Great Barrier Reef. But here's what the World Heritage Committee and advisory bodies also had to say:


Climate change remains the most significant overall threat to the future of the property. It is recommended that the Committee express its serious concern at the coral bleaching and mortality that occurred in 2016 … their scale serves to underline the severity of the threat to the property from climate change.


This government, hand in hand with the Queensland state government, will approve any coalmine, frack any basin and dredge any port if it means more money for their mates in the fossil-fuel industry. Right now, we're seeing them rush headlong into giving $1 billion of taxpayers' money away to the Adani coalmine. There is no plan from this government to deal with climate change, and therefore there is no plan from this government to protect the Great Barrier Reef. (Time expired)

  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Mr President, I thank the Senate for the opportunity to introduce the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Regional Australia) Bill 2017. The purpose of the Bill is to make three changes to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. First, the Bill adds a provision requiring the ABC to ensure that at least 35 per cent of the Corporation's expenditure in a financial year is applied in making payments to people in regional, rural or remote parts of Australia. 


Second, the Bill adds an additional item to be included in the annual report of the Corporation, namely, the amount of money applied in making payments to people in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia. Third, the Bill includes a transitional provision that applies if the Act does not commence on the first day of a financial year. In that event, the period from the commencement of the Bill to the end of the then current financial year is treated as if it were a financial year for the purpose of the amended provision.


At present, the ABC spends just 17 per cent of its revenue for the benefit of people working outside the capital cities where 35 per cent of the Australian population resides. Consistent with that imbalance, the ABC reflects the concerns and interests of people living in our capital cities at the expense of the population in regional, rural and remote Australia. The Bill seeks to restore the balance at the ABC between the city and the bush by requiring the ABC to direct 35 per cent of budget expenditure to the places where 35 per cent of the population resides.


Restoring the balance between the city and the bush at the ABC is not just a matter of justice and equity, Mr President, but also of recognising the unique contribution of the bush to Australian culture and values. Why should the cities get the lion's share of ABC funding when so much of our history and cultural identity is represented by the bush? It should also be said that the unique character of rural, remote and regional Australia owes much to the talented people who live in communities outside the major cities. The ABC would benefit from the creative input of those people, as would the audiences who support the ABC.


It seems to me that the national broadcaster should defend our national values and ABC management will be much better placed to achieve this objective if its programs reflect the values of a broad cross-section of the community, and not just the hopes and aspirations of people who live in the capital cities. Much of the material broadcast on the ABC is produced in rural, regional and remote parts of the rest of the world, especially in the United Kingdom, and it always struck me as rather odd that our national broadcaster has no problem recognising the appeal of this material except on its own doorstep.


One reason the national broadcaster fails to reflect a broad cross-section of the community in its programming is that increasingly the ABC is dominated by city people who naturally enough project city values. I was hardly surprised to learn just a couple of weeks ago from Jennifer Oriel at The Australian that research at the Sunshine Coast University found that 41.2 per cent of ABC staff surveyed voted for the Greens. While this figure may be representative of Greens voters in privileged parts of our capital cities, the Greens vote struggles to get to double figures in rural and regional Australia. This lack of diversity at the ABC is the reason that the bush is deprived of broadcasting funds.


If the ABC were a commercial broadcaster there might be some small justification for the failure to apply funds proportionally between the bush the capital cities. Commercial broadcasters need to make a profit which is impossible in areas of low density population. For example, free-to-air television news and current affairs budgets in the bush are just 10 per cent of capital city budgets. But the national broadcaster is supposed to serve the public interest as articulated in the ABC Charter, not commercial interests. The ABC should broadcast programs that contribute to the national identity and reflect Australia's cultural diversity. I contend that directing just 17 per cent of revenue to rural, regional and remote areas representing 35 per cent of our population is contrary to the ABC Charter and against the public interest. 


Mr President, I wonder whether the ABC is ignoring the bush as part of a wider agenda to compete with commercial broadcasters. Just last week Darren Davidson reported in The Australian that the ABC outbid the Australian Associated Press for a lucrative contract to supply an outdoor advertising company with syndicated news feeds. In the same article, the journalist reports other television broadcasters complaining that the ABC, with its $1.04 billion in base funding, is outbidding Channel Seven and Channel Nine networks and Foxtel for programming more suited to pay television services and commercial networks. If the ABC has so much money to spend, why not spend some of it in the bush?


The importance of a strong and independent public broadcaster cannot be overstated. People trust the ABC especially in times of emergency. We assume that what we see or hear on the public broadcaster has not been compromised by commercial interests. In the same vein, we expect to see or hear important news and to be entertained and educated without the frustration of interruption from commercial advertising. It is often said that the ABC is a public service we are entitled to access without direct cost. We value the fact that our ABC broadcasts programs that are not determined by advertisers looking for large audiences to sell their products and services. ABC content is not subject to the dictates of commercial interests, and commercial interests should not be allowed to starve regional, rural and remote Australia of the funds required to serve the public interest recognised in the ABC Charter. I commend the Bill to the Senate, Mr President.

 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:11):  At the request of Senators Chisholm, Watt, Ketter and Moore, I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


   (i) the enduring and lasting impact that Tropical Cyclone Debbie has had on communities in Queensland and northern New South Wales,


   (ii) that the cost of recovery for families, businesses and communities is a shared responsibility of local, state and federal governments and the insurance industry, and that each has an important role to play,


   (iii) that the Queensland Government has proposed $110 million in additional funding to support projects which will boost economic growth, help communities get back on their feet and assist in preventing further damage from future extreme weather events, including, South Rockhampton Flood Levee, the Whitsunday Coast Airport and the Shute Harbour Revitalisation, and


   (iv) that the Federal Government has chosen not to match this funding through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) Category D; and


(b) calls on the Prime Minister to review these decisions, and provide matched funding from either the NDRRA or from other appropriate sources to ensure these vital projects are supported.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (16:12):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.





Senator McGRATH:
  Before any reconsideration of category D funding by the Prime Minister, the government requires further information from Queensland. We are yet to receive that advice, and we call on the Queensland government to supply this information as soon as possible. It is important to note, however, that the coalition government is already funding 75 per cent of Cyclone Debbie's damage bill, currently estimated to amount to $683 million, and it has provided more than $16.8 million to individuals through Commonwealth-only disaster payments. Our disaster arrangements exist to alleviate damage caused as a direct result of a disaster, not fund new large-scale infrastructure projects. We have a responsibility to Australian taxpayers to ensure these vital funds are used appropriately.

The speech read as follows—



SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (CARING FOR PEOPLE ON NEWSTART) BILL 2017


Inequality is one of the greatest challenges we face; income inequality is growing in Australia and many people battle daily with meeting basic living expenses and poverty. 


Inequality creates significant negative effects on individuals' physical and mental wellbeing, societal cohesion and stability, and economic growth and productivity. 


Currently there are 2.99 million people (13.3% of the population) living below the poverty line in Australia, after taking account of their housing costs. 731,300 of these are children. 


Poverty and inequality have devastating impacts on life outcomes. Poverty undermines access to education and training, and educational outcomes are directly correlated with socio-economic status. Poverty limits access to safe, secure and appropriate housing, transport, employment outcomes, childcare, and many other aspects of full participation in society. Poverty is a daily challenge for many Australians, undermining their ability to have meaningful and productive lives. 


What is incredibly saddening is that the number of people falling into poverty is increasing and that those most likely to find themselves living below the poverty line are already facing the most disadvantage. We are a wealthy country and have the resources available to us to significantly reduce the existing rate of poverty, if only there was the political will to do so. 


No one in a country as rich as Australia should be living in poverty.


Of those on income support, 36.1% are living below the poverty line, including 55% of people receiving Newstart Allowance.


The Australian Greens want a stronger social safety net and adequate income support payments. 


A strong social safety net is the foundation of a more inclusive and productive society. 


We need visionary policy to overcome the underlying drivers of poverty, such as affordable housing, access to education and employment, and we need to ensure we have a strong social security system, that properly supports people, and is fit to meet the challenges we face in the 21st Century. 


A strong social safety net is a key part of addressing inequality. A social safety net ensures that when people fall on hard times there are supports in place to help them when they need it most. 


The changing nature of work – increasing part-time and casual employment, under-employment, short-term contracts and uncertain weekly incomes – means that we need a twenty-first century social safety net that is more flexible and responsive. Such a system is better suited to supporting people to maintain their financial resilience as they move in and out of work, and copes better with variable and uncertain income. 


This is why many modern and progressive societies are adopting more flexible and responsive social security systems as a way of ensuring their economies remain competitive, their communities stable, and their workers better able to respond productively to rapidly changing workplaces and technologies. 


Australia's income support system is complex, inadequate, punitive and difficult to navigate. The Greens are committed to developing a twenty-first century social safety net that supports a productive workforce and an inclusive community. Quite simply people who are unemployed and on Newstart are struggling to survive because the payment is inadequate and puts them below the poverty line, poverty itself, is a barrier to employment.


The evidence provided to the committee inquiry Bridging our growing divide: inequality in Australia. The extent of income inequality in Australia in 2014 showed that the level of the Newstart payment is too low. 


In conclusion, the report found that: 


It is clear that income is a key factor in determining the economic wellbeing most Australians. A low income or low transfer payments will often exacerbate the disadvantage suffered by a person and their dependants. Take the case of a retrenched worker who may be forced to live on savings or the Newstart allowance for a period of time. This may mean foregoing health services with out of pocket expenses, refinancing a mortgage or ending childcare or private school tuition for their children. A more prolonged period of unemployment may lead to despondency, mental health problems, marital breakdown and homelessness. 


Australia's key unemployment payment, Newstart, hasn't had a real, legislated increase in over two decades.


A single person on Newstart receiving the maximum payment has to live on $38.39 (including the energy supplement) a day. This is less than half the minimum wage. 


The Australian Greens have long been calling for an increase to Newstart and had a bill in the previous two parliaments to increase the single rates of Newstart and independent Youth Allowance. Leading community organisations, business and the community have all called repeatedly to increase this inadequate payment. Despite this, both Liberal and Labor governments have failed to act. 


Instead, the Government has successively hacked away at the income support system, reducing much needed support. Instead, the Government has deliberately and maliciously propagated myths and is demonising those accessing income support, without any compassion or understanding of the reality of living below the poverty line. 


The fact is, there are not enough jobs. According to the ABS in February 2017, there were 186,400 job vacancies in Australia while there were 743,700 people who were unemployed. Young people are more than twice as likely to be unemployed. 


Humiliating, demonising and attacking people makes life harder and helps to trap people in poverty, making it more difficult for people to re-enter the workforce. We recognise that single people living on Newstart and independent Youth Allowance are the ones who are typically the most disadvantaged by our current income support system. The maximum fortnightly payment of Newstart for a single person with no dependent children at the time of the Bill's introduction is $535.60; $338.60 less per fortnight than the maximum rate of payment for singles (including the Pension Supplement) on the age and disability pensions. The maximum fortnightly payment for Youth Allowance (living away from home) is $437.50; $98.10 less per fortnight than the rate of Newstart for a single person with no dependent children. 


The Social Security Amendment (Caring for People on Newstart) Bill 2017 will give effect to the Australian Greens' commitment at the last election to increase the single rate of Newstart and the single, independent rates of Youth Allowance by $110 per fortnight. 


For single Newstart recipients, it does this by introducing a Newstart supplement of $110 a fortnight. For single, independent Youth Allowance recipients, the maximum basic rates are increased by $110 a fortnight. 


It is not hard to imagine what people trying to live on these payments could do with the additional money. They will spend it and drive the economy at the same time. 


This change will bring relief to those on the very lowest rates of income support and assist them out of poverty.


The focus on singles is based on evidence that these households are the most at risk of poverty. The ACOSS report Poverty in Australia 2016 found that single people generally faced a significantly higher risk of poverty than couples (24.6% to 10.1%), while 33.2% of single parent families are living in poverty (compared with 11.3% of couples with children). This reflects, in part, the economies of scale available to people living with partners. 


The Bill will also index other social security allowance payments and pensions to the higher of Consumer Price Index (CPI), Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE) or the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI). This will ensure that the gap between pensions and allowance payments does not continue to widen. 


The call for an increase in the base rate of allowance payments has received widespread support from not only social services organisations but also from business groups, unions and various economists. 


In 2012, the Senate Education and Employment Reference inquiry titled The adequacy of the allowance payment system for jobseekers and others, the appropriateness of the allowance payment system as a support into work and the impact of the changing nature of the labour market found that the payment rate of Newstart was inadequate; this was in 2012, 5 years ago. Despite the finding, the Liberal and Labor parties refused to take action, the Greens then, and now, are the only party calling for a raise in this inadequate payment. 


As well as assisting people out of poverty, the key reasons for increasing the single rates of Newstart and independent Youth Allowance include: 


(a) the extended length of time that many recipients spend on the payments; 


(b) the cost of living pressures faced by those in receipt of the single rate of the allowances; and 


(c) the growing gap between the pension and allowance payment types due to different methods of indexation. 


This Bill will directly assist single people living on Newstart and independent Youth Allowance for an extended period of time by providing them with a more stable, adequate base income. 


The gap between the allowance and pension payments is increasing. Newstart Allowance is indexed to movements in the CPI in March and September each year and Youth Allowance is indexed to the CPI once a year in January. Pensions are indexed twice a year (in March and September) by the greater of the movement in the CPI or the PBLCI—an index designed to better reflect the price changes affecting pensioners—and the rate is also benchmarked to a percentage of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. 


This Bill will address this widening gap, by ensuring that these classes of payment are indexed by the same methodology and that they are in line with changes to both prices and wages. 


A $110 increase to the eligible payments will ensure a fairer and more straightforward social security system, and immediately help Australian people who are living in poverty on these income support payments. Better indexation will help maintain the value of an increase into the future. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

  It is very unusual for a motion to be supported by the Labor Party and Senators Bernardi, Gichuhi, Hanson-Young and Xenophon, but this cross-party group of South Australian senators are coming together to demand a real inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin. It is utterly clear that this government, under this Prime Minister, is not working to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. It is utterly clear, yet again, that the Deputy Prime Minister does not have the best interests of the basin at heart, as evidenced by his statements in the Shepparton pub that Senator Bernardi and others have spoken about, and it is clear that this Prime Minister, to date, has not been willing to do the right thing and make Mr Joyce do the right thing. I thank the Greens and Senators Bernardi, Gichuhi and Xenophon for their support.

  The government does not support this motion. Four separate inquiries are already underway to investigate the serious allegations made by Four Corners: the basin-wide review of compliance; the NSW independent investigation into specific allegations; the Australian National Audit Office audit into arrangements to implement water reform; and the referral of allegations to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, a body with the powers of a royal commission. A national judicial inquiry is unnecessary, expensive, would deliver no more than the four inquiries underway and will hold up the delivery of the plan for no identifiable benefit. The government remains committed to the delivery of the plan in full.

  I think it's a very important and unique show of voices from South Australian senators here today that we are all standing up for the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We at the bottom end of the river system know how hard it is to keep upstream states in line when it comes to sharing water fairly. To hear that some people—some rich, greedy, corporate irrigators—with a wink and a nod from the NSW government, are now stealing water from the river, is something that must be investigated. No-one has any faith in the Murray-Darling Basin Authority or NSW government investigating themselves. The reason we need a judicial inquiry is that the NSW government cannot be trusted and neither can Barnaby Joyce.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government opposes the motion. The calling into question a senator's eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senator's position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of his or her citizenship status. This would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty as to the composition of parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees and the committee secretariats in particular.

Senator DI NATALE:
  It's not this motion or, indeed, the Greens that are calling into question the eligibility of senators; it is the community and the scrutiny that has been occurring in the media for several months now. Calling into question the eligibility of senators is something that ordinary punters out there are doing right now. It's no wonder they have no faith in the system. There's a very straightforward process: an independent auditor to ensure that people in this parliament are eligible to stand. Where there are question marks, they will be referred to the High Court. 


At the moment, we are relying on our friends in the media to do the job that this Senate should be doing—transparency and accountability. What we have are question marks being raised over individuals when we could be doing it through a process endorsed by this Senate. That's why this is so critical. It's taken the Greens and the crossbench to shine a light where the major parties refuse it to be shone.

  It is an honour to be a senator, and it's your job and right to make sure you are entitled to be elected to be one. As somebody said, 'If the human headline can check it out and fix it, it can't be that hard!' That should stand for everybody else in this place and the other place. It is your job. Being ignorant of it not being applicable, doesn't hold water. Senator Lambie is right when she says, 'Out there, general trust and respect for politicians in this place is very low.' If you won't have the guts to get up there and suddenly say: 'Yes, I'll show you. I'm an Australian. I was born here. I've denounced my other citizenship,' then I think it's shameful that you hide behind that. It's not much for Senator Di Natale and the other crossbenchers to say: 'Listen, get your house in order.

The calling into question a senator's eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senator's position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of his or her citizenship status. This would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty as to the composition of parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees and the committee secretariats in particular.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:39):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator DI NATALE:
  It's not this motion or, indeed, the Greens that are calling into question the eligibility of senators; it is the community and the scrutiny that has been occurring in the media for several months now. Calling into question the eligibility of senators is something that ordinary punters out there are doing right now. It's no wonder they have no faith in the system. There's a very straightforward process: an independent auditor to ensure that people in this parliament are eligible to stand. Where there are question marks, they will be referred to the High Court. 


At the moment, we are relying on our friends in the media to do the job that this Senate should be doing—transparency and accountability. What we have are question marks being raised over individuals when we could be doing it through a process endorsed by this Senate. That's why this is so critical. It's taken the Greens and the crossbench to shine a light where the major parties refuse it to be shone.

Senator HINCH:
  It is an honour to be a senator, and it's your job and right to make sure you are entitled to be elected to be one. As somebody said, 'If the human headline can check it out and fix it, it can't be that hard!' That should stand for everybody else in this place and the other place. It is your job. Being ignorant of it not being applicable, doesn't hold water. Senator Lambie is right when she says, 'Out there, general trust and respect for politicians in this place is very low.' If you won't have the guts to get up there and suddenly say: 'Yes, I'll show you. I'm an Australian. I was born here. I've denounced my other citizenship,' then I think it's shameful that you hide behind that. It's not much for Senator Di Natale and the other crossbenchers to say: 'Listen, get your house in order. Otherwise, if we don't, we are treated like a joke.'

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:59):  At the request of Senator McCarthy, I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need to establish an independent national judicial inquiry through the Council of Australian Governments following allegations of theft and corruption in management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling Basin.


A healthy River Murray is vital to my state's future. Our communities and our economy depend on the river like no other state, and we see firsthand what happens when those upstream act inappropriately. That's why, historically, South Australia has fought so hard to achieve a Murray-Darling Basin Plan—to ensure the future health of the basin, which is essential to protecting the communities, the industries and the environment that depend on it. 


The explosive allegations aired on Four Corners two weeks ago were shocking to us, particularly those farmers and irrigators who consider the river their heartland. The allegations point to what we fear—that too many upstream continue to undermine a plan which is so important to protecting our river. These fears have only been validated by the arrogant, uncaring and dismissive response from this government, exemplified markedly by the man supposed to be in charge, as minister, of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. What did the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Barnaby Joyce, have to say? What did he say to political supporters over a beer in a Shepparton pub? He tried to paint the Four Corners investigation as an attempt to create 'a calamity for which the solution is trying to take more water off you'. That's the Deputy Prime Minister and minister for water dismissing allegations of theft and corruption as a calamity not for the river, not for the Basin Plan, but for those accused of the responsibility. It's like blaming the police for Ned Kelly robbing the bank. What's worse, he actually celebrated his ability to dismiss such allegations, to push them aside, saying 'I'm glad it's our portfolio, a National Party portfolio, because we can go out and say, ""No, we're not going to follow on that. We're not going to scare you.""' 


The next day, Minister Joyce dismissed reports of theft and corruption in the Murray-Darling Basin as modern-day cattle-rustling. He doesn't seem to understand that being federal minister for water isn't about promoting the interests of his mates in The Nationals by making light of potentially criminal or corrupt behaviour; it's about showing leadership on behalf of all people who rely on that river system. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised by Mr Joyce's response. He did, after all, campaign against the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, telling those suffering to move where the water is. And, even his own coalition colleagues expressed concern when he was given control of the water portfolio by Mr Turnbull. Tony Pasin, the Liberal member for Barker, said that he was 'concerned about the fact that we now have a deeper involvement by the National Party with respect to the implementation of the plan'. 


What have we seen from Mr Turnbull? We have seen the usual inability to stand up for anything he previously believed in and previously fought for. On this issue, like on so many others, he's again caved—on this occasion, to The Nationals and the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Turnbull's response to the allegations of corruption and theft was to announce a compliance review that can't compel witnesses to appear, that doesn't allow evidence to be taken under oath, that doesn't allow documents to be compelled and won't protect whistleblowers. He used to be a strong and passionate advocate for reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. He used to. But now he stands meekly behind Mr Joyce in rejecting any sensible response to these serious allegations. It is yet another act of weakness, yet another absence of leadership from Mr Turnbull.


Today in the parliament, senators from all parties in South Australia, bar one, jointly moved and supported a motion calling for a national judicial inquiry into the allegations of theft and corruption I've described. It comes after the South Australian Labor government and Senators Xenophon, Bernardi, Hanson-Young and I stood together on this issue. It speaks to the importance we place upon this. That South Australians from a wide set of political perspectives could unite on this issue shows a solemn depth of concern. The one party not supporting our collective call for an inquiry is the Liberals, who yet again are putting their National Party mates in other states ahead of the people they're elected to represent in this place and ahead of the people of South Australia.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (17:04):  Can I firstly make it very, very clear to this chamber that the federal government—and that includes every one of my colleagues in this place and the other place from South Australia—take the allegations that were made on the Four Corners program about corruption and the management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling catchment very, very seriously. But this should not be a competition about who is more outraged about the allegations. This actually should be about determining the validity of the allegations, determining the magnitude of any breaches, taking action against the authority or any person who's broken the law, and making sure that we put things in place so that this does not happen again. 


I have a question for those who are supporting this motion: what exactly is it that you want to investigate that's not being covered by the separate inquiries already underway? We have the NSW independent inquiry headed up by Ken Matthews, an eminent person who used to head up the National Water Commission, who's investigating the very specific allegations of the Four Corners program. We have the Murray-Darling Basin Authority basin-wide review into compliance with state-based regulations governing water use. It also should be noted that the MDBA has some very extensive powers for information gathering under the Water Act. 


We have the ANAO review into how the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is monitoring the performance of NSW regarding the protection of environmental water. And we have the NSW ICAC, where all allegations have been referred to. It should be noted that the NSW ICAC have the powers to compel the production of documents; they have the powers to compel a public authority or an official to provide evidence; they have the powers to enter property occupied by a public authority or an official to inspect or copy documents; they have the authority to obtain search warrants; they have the authority to use surveillance devices; and they have the ability to compel witnesses to answer questions—but, most importantly, they hold the majority of their hearings in public. They've jailed ministers and they've seen off a premier. They are an extraordinarily powerful organisation. I ask again: what is it that you are actually seeking to investigate that isn't currently being investigated by the four separate inquiries that I have just outlined?


All of these inquiries are underway and we're expecting the initial report from the NSW inquiry before the end of the month. The Murray-Darling Basin inquiry is required to report by December. The referrals to ICAC and the ANAO have already occurred. A royal commission—which is basically what those opposite and those people supporting this urgency motion today are basically asking for—will take months and months and months to establish and will cost tens of millions of dollars. I know that the communities that I represent and the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin want quick answers. They want quick resolutions. I seriously believe that they do not want us to be playing politics with this particular issue.


However, I must say that I was particularly pleased that, following these allegations, the South Australian Labor government has apparently rediscovered its desire for openness and transparency. A South Australian government minister said:


The Commonwealth Government needs to step in to ensure public confidence in an open, transparent and full investigation …


I assume this means that the South Australian government will ensure public confidence by allowing open, transparent and full investigations into many other issues, such as the abuse allegations at the Oakden aged-care facility, the land sale at Gillman or the ongoing scandals involving Families SA or the Department for Child Protection. 


The SA government can't credibly call for openness and transparency in New South Wales when it denies the very same openness and transparency in its own state. Only last month, the South Australian government actually voted down a bill to allow the South Australian ICAC to hold public hearings into the Oakden facility. When questioned why he supported transparency in this particular water inquiry but was quite happy to vote down transparency when it came to the inquiry into the Oakden facility, the Premier actually responded, 'It's just a separate matter that has different considerations.' He then went on to accuse the NSW ICAC of 'unfairly staining reputations' because it holds its hearings in public. I haven't heard those opposite calling out for the South Australian government to guarantee transparency in any of its actions. You know, you guys, you can't just be convenient; you have to be consistent if you're going to have any credibility in this space.


Most importantly, we need to get on with the job of delivering a plan. Nobody's interests are going to be served by the stalling of the plan—or, worse still, blowing it up. It's taken us 100 years to get to the table to agree to the actions that are needed to have a sustainable Murray-Darling Basin system, and we mustn't let all this fantastic work be derailed just because we decide that we're going to play a political game. Through cooperation and collaboration, we've got to where we are, and I have to say there's some really good news out there—great news. As of 30 June this year we had already recovered 2,083 gigalitres of water. That's in addition to the 600-plus gigalitres of water we've been able to secure through the STL adjustment mechanism. That's water that's been achieved through efficiency measures, which means it has not been taken out of productive use. It hasn't been taken out of the communities like the one that I live in, which is supported totally by the irrigation capacity that is delivered by the Murray-Darling Basin. I'd like to think that maybe somebody else who is going to stand up in this place actually has firsthand understanding and knowledge of the consequences of this plan not going forward. I doubt they do.


We also put in place the 1,500 gigalitre cap on buyback, to make sure we didn't continue to strip the very essence and ability from our communities and actually send them broke. We are on target to deliver our targets for 2019, when we said that we would have delivered 2,750 gigalitres of water for the sole use of the environment. That is a great track record. That is a good-news story, and I think it is very sad that we are standing here today jeopardising and potentially derailing what we have worked so hard together to try to achieve. 


What I would say to this place is: we are but five years into the 12 years of implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We are on track and have achieved a huge amount. We have achieved this because we have worked together, all jurisdictions—Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, the ACT and the Commonwealth—have worked together, and we are on track to deliver this plan that is so vitally important to every single community that lives along the river. It is also vitally important that we have a sustainable river system for those communities. We have worked together over the last five years to get to the place we are now. We have another seven years before we've delivered this plan in full. We sit here today on the edge of the cliff, deciding whether we are going to blow this plan up with politics or whether we are all going to get back together and make sure that we deliver this plan in full. 


I can give this chamber an absolutely unconditional guarantee that it is my sole objective to deliver this plan. I'm not going to play politics with it; I'm not going to play games. I actually want to sit down and deliver this plan, because I believe it is the fundamental responsibility of every single person in this place to honour the commitment of those that went before us. When the Labor Party and the coalition got together and decided that we were going to implement this plan, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for cooperation between the two major parties to deliver an outcome that was so terribly needed.


I find it extraordinary that we should even be considering not going back to the table and having a discussion about how we can get past this unfortunate situation that has been alleged by Four Corners. We need to deal with that, no question at all, but let's not play politics. We need to deliver this plan. We need to deliver this plan for the benefit of the river. We need to deliver this plan for the benefit of the communities that rely on this river. But most particularly, we need to deliver this plan for the broader benefit of all Australians. The food bowl of Australia exists in the Murray-Darling Basin. The economic activity that's generated within this particular area is massive, and every Australian benefits when the Murray-Darling Basin is doing what it can do best. We have seen massive water efficiencies and massive productive efficiencies occur through the delivery of the first five years of this plan. The opportunities to make this an absolute first-class, state-of-the-art food bowl for the world absolutely exist. I would like to think that everybody in this place will stand with me. Let's get back to the table and come up with an agreement so that we can put these allegations behind us, deal with them, and get on with delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, on time, on budget, for the benefit of every single Australian.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:14):  The millennium drought led some to conclude that drought was the new normal and the environment was facing catastrophe. The drought ended with widespread flooding. Dorothea Mackellar's 'Australia, a land of droughts and flooding rains' was never better demonstrated. However, during the drought, a plan was devised to release water from agriculture to save the environment. The result was one per cent science and 99 per cent politics. The plan calls for the return of 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment, with a further 450 gigalitres to be returned subject to certain conditions. Since it began in 2012, water rights have been purchased from farmers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, plus a small quantity from South Australia.


In the last parliament, I chaired a Senate inquiry into its effects, with hearings in each of the participating states. We found the loss of irrigation water was hurting rural communities. Farms no longer grew irrigated crops such as fruit or pasture. They required far fewer inputs and generated far less income. Workers had lost their jobs and moved away. Regional communities had fewer schoolchildren and volunteer firefighters, and customers in local shops. We also found a very poor understanding of the plan. Many people had an almost religious belief that the environment simply needs water, irrespective of whether it's in the right place at the right time or in the right quantities. It was even worse in South Australia. Its outrage over allegations that water is being misappropriated from the Darling and Barwon rivers in New South Wales is ridiculous, given that these rivers often run dry and only about six per cent of the water in these two rivers ever gets to South Australia.


Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the inquiry was hearing how 900 gigalitres of water taken from productive agriculture in Victoria and New South Wales evaporate in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert in South Australia. If Lake Alexandrina was allowed to remain open to the sea and subject to tidal influences rather than being kept closed by man-made barrages, it could be sea water that evaporates, not fresh water. Preserving an artificial environment at the expense of farming and rural communities seems very poor public policy. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was conceived in panic and is seriously flawed. Its intentions are laudable, but it is not Holy Writ. There's enormous scope for improvement.

 (

—
Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
) (
17:17
):  I have the list of speakers here for this item. Being a matter of urgency debate, people speak for different periods of time. I noticed that Senator Ruston is the speaker for the longest time on this list. The people of South Australia were listening intently, I am sure—we are being broadcast at the moment. They were listening for Senator Ruston to say one thing to this Senate—that she would join all of the other people from South Australia and all of other political parties who are calling on a judicial inquiry in respect to the theft and the corruption in New South Wales of water in the Murray-Darling Basin.


I just want to go through the number of political parties that are supporting this motion. We have the Labor Party, of course, led by Senator Wong. We have Senator Bernardi, a former member of the Liberal Party. Even he recognises that something needs to be done about the theft and the corruption of water from the Murray-Darling Basin. Even Senator Gichuhi, a new senator who hasn't been in the Senate for very long, understands that we need to do something about this issue. What a combination—Senator Bernardi and Senator Hanson-Young are on a unity ticket on this issue! And, of course, we have Senator Xenophon.


What political party is missing? Well, it's the party that's always missing when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin. It's the Liberal Party. They are nowhere to be seen. I'm pleased that Senator Smith is in the chamber at the moment. We heard Senator Ruston say, 'We shouldn't be playing politics with this issue.' That's exactly what we should be doing with this. We should be playing politics. Those Liberals from South Australia—and I'm looking directly at Senator Birmingham now—should be following the path of Senator Smith. They should be laying down the law to their colleagues and saying, 'There's an issue here that we need to be dealing with.' We saw what Senator Smith did with the issue of same-sex marriage. Those senators from South Australia in the Liberal Party should be jumping up and down day and night about what's gone on here. There's a scandal here. Water from the Murray-Darling Basin has been stolen by upstream irrigators—water that should've gone back into the environment to rescue the Murray-Darling Basin.


For 100 years, the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin were ignored. They finally got dealt with in that golden period of Australian politics—yes, I am talking about the Gillard government—when lots of things got done for the betterment of this country. That was a golden era—I see Senator Birmingham's making some notes here—of Australian politics when Tony Burke, for the first time in our history, fixed the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin. I had the privilege at that time of being his understudy. I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water. It was a great day and Tony Burke built on the terrific work that Senator Penny Wong had done in this portfolio. For the first time we started to restore our great river system—our inland river system—to good health. 


We need the Liberals from South Australia to stand up and recognise that there's a problem here. We can't have Barnaby Joyce as our water minister. We can't have that. He is not serious about restoring the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We need those senators from South Australia—and lower house members of parliament, but particularly the senators—to stand up. Follow the example of Senator Smith. Jump up and down in your caucus. We need to get something done. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (17:22):  We all leave this place one day. I'm not planning on doing it any time soon. Senator Farrell's done it and come back. We all leave one day. When you leave, you'd like to think that you'll be able to look back and think you've made a contribution—a difference—in certain areas. When I leave—whenever that time may be in the years to come—one of the areas that I will look back on is absolutely water policy and the Murray-Darling Basin.


We just heard Senator Farrell talk about the alleged golden era of the Gillard government and how, apparently, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was all their doing.




Senator Hume:
  What about John Howard?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  What about John Howard? What a very good question there, Senator Hume. The Water Act 2007 was passed by the water minister at the time. Who was the water minister in 2007? Malcolm Turnbull was the water minister in 2007. He passed the Water Act—brought that into being—with John Howard and budgeted $10 billion to be able to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He put into law the process that led to that plan.


Mr Burke, Ms Gillard and others followed through on the implementation of it, and I give them credit for it. I was proud—as a frontbencher in the opposition with the responsibility for water—to at times work with Mr Burke to make sure that the Water Act, which had been passed in a bipartisan spirit, saw the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered in a bipartisan spirit. In government, we are determined to make sure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is implemented in full and on time—no ifs, no buts; full delivery.


I can assure this Senate that I will never, ever let anything get in the way of the successful implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is essential to our home state. It is something that our government is deeply committed to delivering. It is something that the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, as the author of the Water Act—and the person who started the process of putting in place a comprehensive management plan for the Murray-Darling that, for the first time ever, actually analyses the Basin regardless of arbitrary state borders, which of course rivers don't recognise—is determined to see it fully implemented, and fully implemented it will be under a Turnbull government.


What we're seeing here today is a political stunt. You can tell it's a stunt, of course, when Senator Bernardi and Senator Hanson-Young pose for the cameras together. That's a pretty good sign that it's a stunt. Because of course it's an otherwise preposterous concept that those two would share a stage at any one point in time. 




Senator Smith:
  A parallel universe!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Very much a parallel universe, Senator Smith. You can tell it's a stunt. It's a stunt, of course, because it's a motion and a proposal that ignores fact, ignores reality. It's dealing, yes, with a serious issue. The allegations of theft of water and of potential corruption in terms of the management of water licences in New South Wales are serious allegations. They ought to be gotten to the bottom of. If proven, there ought to be criminal charges that ensue. People ought to lose their jobs, if all of the allegations are true. That, of course, is why there have been referrals to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. 


You want a call for a judicial inquiry into this theft of water? Well, you've have got one–you've got one already happening. The ICAC—with the powers of a royal commission, with the powers to hear from whistleblowers, with the powers to subpoena evidence and with the powers to do everything that it needs to—has been asked to look at this matter. And I think, with the New South Wales ICAC—that has brought down premiers, brought down ministers, sent public servants to jail and initiated charges in a range of different ways—you'd be pretty hard-pressed to argue that it was anything but a proper, thorough, full investigation into these allegations. 


Alongside that, the New South Wales government has asked Ken Matthews, former chair of the National Water Commission—again, a man of great integrity and independence—to undertake a review. So, within the jurisdiction of New South Wales, there are two initiatives. But I challenge anybody—any of those who are supporting this initiative—to question the independence, the integrity, the thoroughness and the rigour of the New South Wales ICAC and suggest that somehow it is unable to do the things that they claim they want to see happen. Because they won't be able to challenge that. Of course it is able to do all of the things to follow up on the Four Corners report. 


But our government is not content with the fact that the ICAC and Mr Matthews are undertaking their work. We also have the ANAO looking at matters with its own independence and scrutiny here in the Commonwealth. But we recognise that perhaps—what if this is not an isolated incident? What if there are some other problems in relation to the management of water licences, the integrity rate of those water licences and the integrity of water take-offs across the basin? Which is why we have proposed that there should be a more comprehensive review that sits alongside this. It's not the review to specifically deal with the one issue of instances and allegations because, if there is criminal wrongdoing there, that is exactly what the ICAC process should uncover and deal with. But the broader review is to actually give integrity and confidence back right across all of the basin states and jurisdictions—each and every one of them—and to ensure that their licensing regime and the compliance with that regime is thorough, rigorous and appropriate. To do that, under the terms of the Murray-Darling Basin management, you need the cooperation of each of those basin states. 


My colleague Senator Ruston—who now does an incredible job as the assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water, I know—is absolutely determined to see the Basin Plan, as she told this chamber before, implemented in full and on time as I outlined. I know that she is equally determined to make sure that we maintain the bipartisan commitment to this plan that has got us this far—that has got us through the passage of the Water Act under the Howard government, with Malcolm Turnbull as water minister; that got us through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, that got us through the Abbott government when I had responsibility in this place, and now with the Turnbull government.


Consistent work to see to date is: more than 2,000 billion litres of water licences successfully recovered to meet the terms of the Basin Plan. That work will only continue successfully if we have cooperation, not just bipartisan cooperation, but cooperation of each of the states and territories, as Senator Ruston so correctly and eloquently put it in her contribution. 


We must make sure that we have integrity in the delivery of the plan. That's what the review that Senator Ruston, the water minister and the Prime Minister have instigated will do. We must get to the bottom of those allegations. That's what the ICAC, the powers of a royal commission, and the other reviews will do. But, ultimately, we must deliver the Basin Plan, and that's what I and every member of this government looks forward to seeing happen with the cooperation, I trust, of every other member of this chamber too.

There should be no doubt of the need for a judicial inquiry into these incredibly serious allegations, first aired on the ABC's program on 24 July. I'll address the issue of ICAC in the brief time available. Subsequent revelations in other media outlets since that broadcast have made it abundantly clear that these allegations are just the tip of the iceberg that is emerging as a major national scandal that is challenging the ethos of our Federation. Allegations of water pump tampering, water theft and rorting, collusion between officials and irrigators, failures by officials to properly monitor compliance, the shutting down of compliance units in the face of alleged noncompliance investigations, irregularity and illegality are shocking and, together, they have an overwhelming stench of corruption about them.


Subsequent revelations of attempts to retrospectively make lawful what was a flagrant breach are absolutely inexcusable. These allegations are serious because they, in effect, reveal attempts to sabotage the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan that the basin states signed up to five years ago with bipartisan commitment. And this is not about state against state or irrigator against environmentalist; it's about the very integrity of a $13 billion plan and the officials and politicians that are meant to implement it fully, thoroughly and fairly. If we are fair dinkum about the very basis of our Federation, if our Commonwealth of Australia is indeed about the common wealth of all Australians, then we must recognise how vulnerable the lower reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin are, and in my home state of South Australia particularly—something that my friend and colleague, the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, is acutely aware of.


So when the government says there is no need for a judicial inquiry because of the four inquiries on foot, that is nowhere near good enough. It is an anaemic, weak excuse. The fact is that ICAC is limited in its jurisdiction, to one state in the basin, to New South Wales. It does not have the power to protect witnesses in other states that can come forward in terms of a broader inquiry about allegations beyond New South Wales—allegations that may relate to other basin states. It doesn't have the power to protect whistleblowers that a judicial inquiry has, because of the jurisdictional restrictions that it has. 


There is another issue I want to raise very briefly. I foreshadow that I will be moving, in consultation with my colleagues, for an order for the production of documents in relation to how the Water for the Environment Special Account is being spent. Right now we have one page indicating how $1.77 billion is meant to be spent in terms of the environment special account. These are matters that we must address. If we are fair dinkum about implementing this nation-building plan for the nation's food basin and to look after our irrigators and the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin, a judicial inquiry is an absolute must.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:33):  I, too, support this resolution for a judicial inquiry. At the outset, I would just like to say that I accept that Senator Ruston and Senator Birmingham have genuinely articulated their respective positions. Senator Ruston alluded to politics in this argument. Well, the politics is not coming from this side of the table. What has caused the alleged untoward activities of these upstream irrigators who have treated the Basin Plan with such disregard or alleged disregard? What's caused it are the actions of people like the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, who said on 21 November 2016, 'You have not got a hope in Hades of delivering 450 gigs—not a hope.' And, when he was asked subsequently, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the current funding for the promised 450 gigalitres was insufficient, saying, 'You have not got a hope in Hades of delivering the 450 gigs—not a hope.'


So the Deputy Prime Minister casts aspersions and doubt on the credibility of a plan that took 100 years to make. And then, if you throw in Senator Hanson, a person who is critical of people who don't have English as their first language—and I apologise for the verbatim Hansard—this is what One Nation said:


I will tell you about this 450 gigalitres that is supposed to be on the table. That is like a guillotine over their heads. If you took away the 450, they can handle the other. They will be able to survive. They will try to do something about it. They understand about environmental. They have had to change their farming ways. But what you have done is that they feel that they are not being listened to—no-one is listening to their concerns.


What this is really all about is the seat of Orange. The Nationals lost the seat they'd held since 1947 with a 20 per cent swing to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. In other words, the Nationals wanted to vote for anybody else but the National Party. Anybody who stood in that seat would have won except the Nationals. That's the genesis of this. Barnaby Joyce is trying to out-politic One Nation.


One Nation comes to this parliament courtesy of a double dissolution, which is owned by the Prime Minister. No-one else can take credit for that double dissolution other than the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull. He filled the place up with One Nation. They come into this argument very late and totally misinformed. They go around the country articulating unrealistic positions, giving hope to people who really have to think about their viability in a much more professional way than having Senator Hanson come here and say, 'That's all rubbish. Why do you need more water down the Murray?' That's the level of her contribution. And the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia is actually having to outgun that position. He is having to go into a country pub and outgun Pauline Hanson's One Nation.


It is an absolute disgrace, but that is what is happening with this Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It needs to be put back on track for the health of Australia, for the health of the river, for the health of South Australia and for everybody up and down the river. We cannot have it reduced to this level of crass politics, with the National Party trying to outdo One Nation in stupidity by advocating irrational, illogical positions.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:37):  I, too, rise to speak on the issue of water because, as a South Australian, it's an issue that is vitally important to everyone in our state, whether you live in the metro area, whether you are particularly concerned about the environment, whether you are concerned about the communities along the river who make their living from the water or whether you are concerned about an adequate and reliable supply. That's why for 100 years South Australians, as part of this federation, have been concerned about water. For 100 years we have seen the inability of the various states to work together to come up with a plan. It's only this side of politics, under Prime Minister Howard and then the environment minister, Mr Turnbull, that, in 2007, came up with the vision and the plan that became the Water Act and the $10 billion that was associated with that. For the first time, there was national leadership that said, 'How can we actually put in place a system to make this work?'


As someone who has lived most of my professional life being an experimental test pilot, I know that the best laid plans of mice and men don't always work perfectly first time around. You have to work at them to make sure they are effective and implemented well. And by and large, whilst there have been ups and downs and issues to work through, that has occurred. One of the reasons our Federation works is that, where something does go wrong in another state, we don't suddenly have to get the federal government to fix every problem. We actually trust each other around road rules and around health systems. We're able to transfer a patient from one city to another because we actually trust the regulations. States like New South Wales oversee the bodies that regulate professional standards across Australia in terms of schemes for professional indemnity. That system works. Just because there has been the discovery of what appears to be, on the face of the reporting, illegal activity, we don't need to upend a system that has worked well for our nation.


We do have a national approach of a review. Mr Ken Matthews AO is leading the investigation from a national perspective. He was the chair and chief executive officer of the National Water Commission, so he knows the people, the system and the stakeholders. He might find examples that need to be explored further. We already have underway the New South Wales independent investigation, the ANAO audit—another national investigation—but, importantly, the referral of allegations to ICAC, which is a body with the powers of a royal commission. So our federation, which works in almost every area you care to point out, will work in this area. We need to trust the stability of our federation to get this right in the interests of all the communities along the Murray-Darling Basin. (Time expired)

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:40):  I come to this debate on the urgency motion from a rather unique position. I'm really not interested in the politics of what has gone on. I recognise and acknowledge that there are a great many people who have taken more serious and significant interest in the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin system and the Barwon-Darling Basin system than I have over a great many years. They have been diligent and applied their skills and knowledge to getting favourable outcomes, and I thought we had that agreed. What concerns me about this is that there are allegations that have been aired on the ABC that demonstrate, indicate or suggest that activity that some would say is criminal and some would say is corrupt has taken place. These things have taken place by individuals who are linked to ministers or political parties. They extend into areas which call into question the reasonableness, the efficacy and the potential corruption of politics. 


I just want some answers. To be honest, I've been around long enough not to trust governments to investigate themselves or their own. That's not to say that they can't do a good job of it, but I just am sceptical enough to recognise that cover-ups take place when people don't want to get to the truth. There is too much here. One of the benefits of having a relatively large nose is that you have a nose for BS. You can pick up the aroma of nonsense when people are telling it to you. Every single one of my antenna went up when I saw that. Since then I have spoken to people who are not South Australian but are deeply concerned about the health and viability of the Barwon-Darling river system, who are deeply concerned by what is happening in New South Wales and others who are concerned by what is happening further downstream. I just want to get to the truth.


Quite frankly, given the links of the New South Wales government and some representatives that have been involved in this, some representatives of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, and given the links I asked about in question time today involving some in the National Party, I just think we need to make sure that there is an independent judicial inquiry—not to solve it all but to get the facts on the table and say: 'There is a significant problem here and we now need a more substantive inquiry. We need a royal commission'—or whatever it is—'further down the track.' That is my position. I do not care about the politics of this. I'm interested in getting an outcome to make sure that the river system is healthy, that it is serving New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and that people are doing what they are committed to do rather than covering it up.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:43):  The debate this afternoon on this urgency motion, quite naturally, has reflected the importance that South Australia places on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I've got to say that, as someone who cares about the basin, I'm incredibly grateful for the efforts of South Australians and the advocacy of South Australians over many years, because they have played a very important role in asserting over time a call for political reform. I want to focus my remarks today on the consequences for New South Wales and specifically for the Barwon-Darling area because I know this part of New South Wales. It is important in this debate to be thinking about the consequences of failing to deliver on the plan in this area, with all of its complexity and fragility.


The Barwon-Darling corridor has a system of rivers and lakes and wetlands and flood plains, and that provides habitat for more than 10,000 birds—and that includes the iconic brolgas. The river red gums that grow along the banks of the river system and the flood plains of this system stretch out with different kinds of eucalypts and their names resonate in the popular imagination when we think about western New South Wales and its environment: the poplar box, the iron wood, the mulga, the white cypress pine.


The system is actually like a big funnel and it channels the in-flows from the tributaries further north, like the Barwon, the Macintyre, the Weir and the Culgoa. These are systems that up until now have been reasonably unregulated. There aren't big dams on the rivers, and the rivers for the most part have an integrity in the way that their flows mirror the natural flows that characterise most Australian river systems in fairly dry areas. There is a remarkable Indigenous heritage—40,000-year-old fish traps at Brewarrina protected by the World Conservation Union.


The management of water in this area is absolutely critical to the health and resilience of all of those assets, all of that natural heritage. People like to talk about how much water flows down the river like it's a big pipe, but actually what matters in Australian river systems, which are highly variable, are the floods—those situations where a big pulse of water comes down the system, spreads out over the banks of the river and into the flood plains—and it is that flooding process that provides the habitat for bird breeding, for frogs, for lizards. That is the process that drives biodiversity in western New South Wales, and so when we are talking about corrupt practice, about water theft, about illegal activity, about the collusion between government officials and the industry they are supposed to regulate, about disrespect at best from a government minister for the fundamentals of the plan, we have a serious problem. 


It is not enough for governments to investigate themselves or for departments to investigate themselves. We need an investigation with substantial powers that can get to the bottom of this behaviour. A body like a judicial inquiry that can protect whistleblowers, that can compel people to give evidence and that can undertake the necessary investigations to understand what is going on and to protect the integrity of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (17:47):  I also rise today to speak on this matter of urgency submitted by our parliamentary colleague from the Northern Territory, Senator McCarthy. Senator McCarthy would like this chamber to consider the need to establish an independent national judicial inquiry through the Council of Australian Governments following allegations of theft and corruption in the management of water resources in the Barwon-Darling Basin. While I applaud Senator McCarthy for bringing this matter to the attention of the chamber, the idea that a judicial inquiry is necessary to investigate and prosecute breaches of state law is entirely inappropriate.


The debate in this chamber is very, very important, and it gives me great pleasure to speak on this matter, as the proper and prudent management of precious water resources is not just a matter for South Australian senators, but it is also very dear to the hearts of my own constituents, particularly those in rural Victoria. And I agree wholeheartedly that the misuse and mismanagement of common water resources cannot be allowed to continue. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister, and Assistant Minister Ruston, have jointly announced that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will conduct an independent basin-wide review into the compliance with state-based regulations governing water use.


But, far more importantly, the state of New South Wales is taking great steps to respond to and investigate the allegations levelled in a recent Four Corners report. The New South Wales government has launched an independent investigation into the allegations made on Four Corners, led by Ken Matthews AO, a highly respected man of great integrity and, in addition to that, the matter has also been referred to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the ICAC. These state-level actions are entirely appropriate, given that the allegations raised in the Four Corners report relate to breaches of New South Wales state law. Now, I'm not in a position to explain to Senator McCarthy the nature of the Australian Constitution, but I am indeed surprised that the Labor Party can't see this very clearly for the state matter that it is.


There is no denying that issues of water theft and corruption in the management of the basin resources are extraordinarily serious, and, quite clearly, irrigators in every relevant state and basin communities must be able to have confidence that the rules that govern water use in the Murray-Darling Basin are being followed to the letter. It is for this reason that I am in fact encouraged by the dual actions taken by the New South Wales state government, and I commend the New South Wales state government for their expedient action on this matter.


Calls for a judicial review or a royal commission are quite another issue. Quite frankly, even though I have great respect for Senator McCarthy I am disappointed that she has reached back into that old Labor toolbox of calling for an expensive and unnecessary royal commission or judicial inquiry. A judicial review is an independent legal process that could take up to 12 months, cost millions of dollars and require the cooperation of the New South Wales government and potentially other basin states. It isn't necessary; it isn't expedient; it isn't constitutionally appropriate—and it is an unconscionable waste of taxpayer money.


Water is understandably an emotional issue for many Australians, not least of whom are the basin communities that owe so much of their prosperity to the shared water resources. Water theft is unconscionable. I thank Senator McCarthy for raising this important issue in the chamber, but we must resist the call from those opposite for a costly, unnecessary inquiry into this matter. (Time expired)

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:51):  Before I start my speech, I'd like to seek leave to move an amendment to the motion.


Leave not granted.




Senator HANSON:
  I will continue to speak on the matter then. The Murray-Darling river passes through areas which receive little rain. In these dry areas water is gold, providing people with drinking water and water for agriculture. The recent allegations concerning the Barwon-Darling river are disturbing, but theft and corruption are not confined to this part of the Murray-Darling river system. We need a judicial inquiry into the Commonwealth purchase of water throughout the Murray-Darling Basin because we are paying for environmental water that is ending up in hands of large irrigators and others. 


The Murray-Darling problem goes beyond private and government corruption. It involves the wastage of the $13 billion of taxpayer money committed to fixing the problems of the river system. We cannot replace Darling River flows by releasing water held in dams like Hume weir and sending it down the Murray. This strategy is flawed. The low banks of the Murray cannot contain excessive man-made water flows. The result is catastrophic floods, damaging the environment and farmers alike. The so-called facts on which the present Murray-Darling Basin Plan rests need to be revisited by an independent body, because the Murray-Darling Basin Authority does not engender any confidence.


I was informed—I did not hear the speech myself—that Senator Fawcett made the comment that I had no idea what I am talking about and that I haven't been there. Let me bring to the attention of the house that Senator Burston, Senator Roberts and I made an extensive three-day tour of the Murray-Darling river from Melbourne right to the mouth in South Australia. We talked to communities. We talked to the farmers who are going under and losing their businesses and who are destitute because they are not being listened to by politicians. How many members of this house have bothered to take the time to go and investigate this and speak to not only the farmers and the communities, but the businesses who will lose their livelihoods because this is not being sorted out?


Knowing this, from having acquainted myself with the situation in Victoria and South Australia, I also went to St George in Queensland. They are also affected by the regulations that have been brought in. At one stage the Murray-Darling was looked after by 35 people; now it is in excess of hundreds. Why do we need that many people? This whole thing has to be taken out of the hands of profiteers who are making money out of this. Let's utilise the water. It is like gold in this country. It needs to be managed correctly and in the best interests of Australians.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:54):  I rise today to speak in favour of a judicial inquiry into areas of the Murray-Darling Basin and the allegations of immense corruption, theft of water, dodgy election donations and cover-up after cover-up. We know that some of these allegations were aired on the Four Corners program some weeks ago, but we know others are starting to seep out as well. And what did we hear from the New South Wales government and then followed up by our own water minister, Barnaby Joyce? First denial, dismissal that this was of any concern to anybody outside of New South Wales, and then ridicule for those of us who live further downstream. 


I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, that in the week following the airing of those allegations on Four Corners, I went down to the Lower Lakes in the Coorong in South Australia at the mouth of the Murray. I spoke to the local community there, and they are fed-up. They are fed-up with being treated as second-class citizens who live in the Murray-Darling Basin. For decades, they have fought to have a fair share of water. For decades, they have fought for the river to be given its required allowance so that it can continue to thrive, live and be a healthy, functioning river system. What they heard in that Four Corners report, the subsequent comments from New South Wales ministers and then our own federal water minister was dismissal and a total lack of concern. 


This is grand theft—$13 billion of Australian taxpayer money being spent to buy water that is designed for the environment to keep the river alive so that everybody who lives throughout the basin has the opportunity for sustainable industry and to keep those communities that rely on the river going. The river needs enough water to survive, and we know at the bottom end of the river system—the Lower Lakes in the Coorong, where the community that I visited a couple of weeks ago live—that that section of the Murray-Darling Basin is the lungs of the river. If you don't have the lungs of the river working properly, if you don't get that flush of salt out to sea, if you don't have enough water at the bottom end, the river will die. Scientists have told us that over and over again and, at the height of the drought five years ago, we saw with our own eyes just how much devastation the theft of water upstream was causing the rest of the river system. 


The attitude from our federal water minister Barnaby Joyce has undermined, significantly, the goodwill of all member states of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and to ensure that we all work together for the health of the river. And we know what Minister Joyce's attitude really is towards the Murray-Darling Basin and for those of us who live downstream. All he needs is to get a few beers into him at the Shepparton pub and he starts telling anyone who will listen that he hates greenies, doesn't give two hoots about environmental flows, and thank goodness the Nationals are in control so that the big irrigators continue to suck out more water. A few beers and the minister is mouthing off about how much of a hero he is, covering up the corruption and water theft upstream in the Murray-Darling Basin. He is unfit to be the water minister. He has a conflict of interest and, if the federal government is serious about restoring trust in the Murray-Darling Basin and how it should be managed, they must deal with the biggest and the weakest link—and that is Minister Joyce. 


There is no way Minister Joyce should be in charge of the nation's iconic river system. He doesn't care about environmental flows. He doesn't care about anyone who lives downstream; all he cares about is the election donations coming from those big corporate irrigators.

The speeches read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN IMMUNISATION REGISTER AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2017



I am pleased to introduce the Australian Immunisation Register and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2017.


The Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 (AIR Act) was created in 2015 as a new, consolidated legislative framework for the establishment and ongoing management of Australian immunisation registers. 


This Bill implemented measures to improve immunisation rates across Australia and complemented other government initiatives, including 'No Jab, No Pay' and new catch-up incentives to GPs and other immunisation providers.


Immunisation is critical to maintaining public health and preventing the outbreak of infectious diseases. 


The Turnbull Government is committed to improving vaccination rates.


Since the introduction of the No Jab, No Pay policy, the Government has seen 200,000 extra children have been vaccinated in just over a year. 


Implemented on 1 January 2016, the AIR Act improved the arrangements surrounding the medical exemption process such that only general practitioners could assess for medical exemptions. 


Since the introduction of the AIR Act, immunisation clinicians have requested that other specialised medical professionals have their assessments for medical exemptions recognised by the AIR, in addition to general practitioners. These included paediatricians, public health physicians, infectious diseases physicians and clinical immunologists.


Specialists have advised that having to send patients back to general practitioners to get medical exemptions has added an unnecessary burden of time for patients. 


The four specialist groups identified in the legislation provide care to the most vulnerable children in the country, including those with complex illnesses and health care requirements. They include paediatricians working in specialist immunisation clinics who GPs call for advice on whether medical exemptions are warranted.


This legislation enables these highly qualified specialists, who are often best placed to assess children for immunisation, the opportunity to provide comprehensive care for their patients. 


Allowing these specialists to notify medical exemption to the Australian Immunisation Register will maintain the integrity of the No Jab, No Pay policy because it ensures that the most qualified clinicians are able to make this assessment.


Based on this feedback, the Bill will make minor amendments to paragraph 9(c) and subparagraph 9(d) (iii) of the AIR Act to allow paediatricians, public health physicians, infectious diseases physicians and clinical immunologists to assess that a young individual should not have a vaccine for medical reasons or natural immunity to a disease. 


The inclusion of these immunisation specialists will reduce the number of referrals and appointments that patients currently need. This will save time, cost and effort for health providers and patients. 


In conjunction with the amendment to the AIR Act, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 (FA Act) is also being amended. 


Schedule 2 of the Bill includes provisions to amend the FA Act for consistency. The amendments will expand the medical practitioners who can certify medical exemptions in line with the amendments to the AIR Act.


The Bill also makes a minor amendment to paragraph 9(b) of the AIR Act to make it explicit that the AIR can only accept vaccination information provided by recognised vaccination providers, and not members of the public. This removes any uncertainty associated with who can provide vaccination information.


Through the Bill, the AIR will continue to operate to support the continued efforts of health professionals to improve the health of individuals. The Bill will reduce the burden on those professionals and also the individuals that require medical exemptions from immunisation.


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (INCORPORATION OF PROPOSAL AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2017


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposal and Other Measures) Bill 2017 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments will assist Australian business and consumers and will further enhance the operation of certain aspects of the Act.


Firstly, the Bill will incorporate Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2017 into the Act, ensuring that the correct customs duty rate of 'Free' is legislated for tariff subheading 6907.30.10, which applies to certain mosaic tiles. This amendment will ensure that Australian businesses have certainty about customs duty rates applied to these goods.


Secondly, the Bill will extend the concessional arrangements for imports of automotive prototypes and components. Currently, the concession provided for by Item 39 in Schedule 4 of the Act is only available to motor vehicle manufactures. The amendments contained in this Bill will extend these arrangements to include automotive service providers to support research and development by the automotive industry.


Thirdly, the Bill will remove the $12,000 special customs duty on used and second-hand motor vehicles. The special duty is rarely applied as importers are able to seek an exemption under Item 37 in Schedule 4 of the Act. This amendment will remove some of the red tape that consumers face when importing a used or second-hand motor vehicle from 1 January 2018.


Finally, the Bill will make a number of amendments to improve the usability of the Act. The Bill will simplify the classification of certain machining centres, realign Australia's classification of the chemical paraquat dichloride with international practice and make minor formatting amendments to a number of tariff subheadings.


EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROVIDER INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2017


The Education Legislation Amendment (Provider Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2017 gives effect to greater student protection measures, and strengthens the arrangements for governing quality in the higher education and international education sectors. 


This Bill is a further plank in the Turnbull Government's ongoing efforts to protect students and taxpayers from the unscrupulous behaviour that we have seen in the vocational education and training (VET) sector and prevent unethical providers from emerging in the higher education and international education markets.


Australia's international education sector is one of the strongest in the world. The quality and integrity of Australia's education providers has seen education become our single largest service export industry, worth $21.8 billion in 2016. The Turnbull Government is committed to building on Australia's success as a world leader in international education and is delivering on Australia's first ever National Strategy for International Education 2025.


The quality of our education services, and the quality assurance systems we operate, are critical in maintaining Australia's reputation internationally. 


The Government's higher education reform Bill, introduced to Parliament on 11 May 2017, will put the higher education sector on a more sustainable funding base into the future, and make the sector more transparent and responsive to student choice and market needs.


Our universities and non-university higher education providers will continue to flourish, to innovate, and to produce graduates equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to help Australia's businesses and economy grow and prosper. 


However, we also have the unfortunate example of some unscrupulous providers in the VET sector to show what can happen if effective regulation and monitoring are not in place. 


In the VET sector, unscrupulous providers were able to exploit students and the taxpayer for their own gain due to a funding system set up with minimal regulatory oversight. 


VET FEE-HELP suffered serious design flaws that allowed unscrupulous providers and brokers to take advantage of vulnerable students, rip off taxpayers, and tarnish the reputation of Australia's high-quality training providers and the VET sector.


Many students in the higher education sector are not currently afforded the same protection from exploitation by providers, and higher education providers seeking to enter the sector are not subject to the same scrutiny as those in the VET sector. There is also opportunity in the international education sector to build on Australia's rigorous quality controls by delivering greater scrutiny of providers seeking registration to deliver education to international students.


The Turnbull Government has decided to act now and apply similar measures in the higher and international education sectors to those recently enacted for VET to identify, monitor and prevent the sorts of unscrupulous behaviours by some VET FEE-HELP providers from tarnishing the reputation of Australia's international education and higher education sectors. 


And of course, for the majority of providers who operate with integrity and in the best interest of their students, these measures will require little change.


Schedule 1 of the Bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (the ESOS Act) to strengthen regulation and ensure our international education sector cannot become vulnerable to the actions of unscrupulous providers seeking to exploit students.


This Bill enables the Minister to make a legislative instrument setting out any additional matters for regulators to consider when assessing whether a provider is fit and proper to be registered to educate international students. This will allow the Minister to adjust fit and proper requirements as needed, in response to emerging issues in the sector. 


This provision will ensure the ESOS regulators are aware of the history of providers or individuals who have had action taken against them due to their unscrupulous behaviour, and who are now seeking registration in the international education sector. 


For providers who are already registered, new provisions in the Bill expand existing requirements that they notify the regulator of significant changes to their management or business practices. Providers must also notify the regulator where they become aware key personnel have any serious recent past convictions, or have had regulatory action taken against their previous approval to deliver Government programs.


These provisions ensure individuals previously involved in dubious business practices will not go undetected if they move into influential positions within international education.


To expand the ability of the Government to respond to emerging trends which indicate a potential risk to the integrity of the international education sector, this Bill includes provisions that enhance the information sharing abilities of Government agencies. 


An enhanced ability to share information among enforcement agencies is a sensible, pragmatic action which will enable the Government to monitor providers more effectively and proactively address identified concerns.


The measures in the Bill also benefit prospective students by enabling information about the actions of education agents to be released to providers and the wider community. 


Providers are already bound by a requirement not to use education agents who are dishonest or lack integrity in attracting prospective students to Australia. 


This Bill builds on that requirement by enabling the Government to share information with providers about their agent's recruitment outcomes.


An additional measure in the Bill allows this information to be published more broadly. 


This will highlight the good work of the vast majority of agents, while providing greater transparency of the small number of agents who may not be providing good advice to students, resulting in poor outcomes for international students.


There are also minor administrative amendments to the ESOS Act to ensure providers have a 30-day timeframe to make late payments, in line with current Government money collection practices.


This ensures the timeframe for payment is appropriate, and that providers will not be automatically suspended due to non-payment.


Schedule 2 of the Bill amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (the TEQSA Act) to support the efficient operation of its regulatory regime. 


The measures included in this Bill are similar to those legislated in the VET sector last year. 


The Bill clarifies financial viability requirements and stipulates the extent of coverage of TEQSA's regulatory powers.


This Bill introduces greater protection of Australian qualifications – requiring vocational education and training courses that lead to the awarding of Diplomas, Advanced Diplomas, Graduate Diplomas and Graduate Certificates to be accredited under the TEQSA Act or under vocational education laws. There are also measures to enhance TEQSA's existing compliance capabilities, allowing TEQSA to implement more robust student protection mechanisms and more stringent application and reporting requirements on providers. 


These include expanding the fit and proper person test for providers seeking accreditation, and expanding the scope of information TEQSA may consider when deciding whether or not to accredit a provider. 


Additionally, TEQSA will require providers over a certain size to provide general purpose financial statements. To support this measure, the definition of a qualified auditor in the TEQSA Act has been amended. 


The measures in this schedule also allow TEQSA to delegate its functions or powers to the Chief Executive Officer.


The measures in Schedule 3 amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enhance the existing regulatory framework and mirror the sweeping changes made in the VET sector.


These reforms will only apply to bodies approved as higher education providers under section 16-25 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, that is, non-university higher education providers. For practical purposes, this excludes universities operating in Australia. This reflects the fact that these measures are directed at reducing the risks to students and taxpayers associated with providers seeking to transition operations and/or students to the higher education sector following our reforms to VET student loan arrangements. 


Separate arrangements under the Government's higher education reform package will drive improved quality, transparency and accountability for universities.


The Department of Education and Training will continue to monitor applications, approvals and the amount and number of student loans accessed among all providers registered to offer FEE‑HELP, and advise the Government if there is a need to extend the measures in this Bill.


By ensuring consistent standards apply to non-university higher education providers and private VET providers, we are preventing a transition to the higher education sector of the intolerable behaviour of a few unscrupulous providers we witnessed in the VET sector. 


This Bill allows the Minister to exempt bodies established by a Government, be it the federal government, or a state or territory government, from the body corporate requirements. 


This is a minor amendment to correct a current anomaly, and will for example, allow organisations such as the Australian Federal Police and Bureau of Meteorology to deliver courses in their areas of expertise and offer FEE-HELP to remove the upfront tuition fees barrier subject to the necessary approvals. 


This Bill also introduces more rigorous tests for all providers applying to access FEE-HELP, similar to what was put in place last year in the new VET Student Loans program. 


Under these measures, the Minister can consider whether the provider has a proven history of successfully teaching the courses offered. 


We are enhancing the fit and proper person test that providers are assessed against. Providers that fail to gain approval are excluded from reapplying for a six month period. 


For existing providers, those who currently access FEE-HELP, additional financial viability and transparency requirements are also included in this Bill.


These arrangements are broadly consistent with requirements for VET Student Loans providers, legislated last year. 


This Bill provides scope for additional requirements around financial statements and providers' revenue sources to be included in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines as conditions a provider must meet to maintain their approval. 


This Schedule also applies student protection mechanisms currently available in the VET sector to students enrolled at non-university higher education providers. 


The Bill will prevent providers from creating barriers to withdrawal such as withdrawal fees. 


If a student requests to be unenrolled, the provider must cancel their enrolment without requesting a punitive fee, or binding the student in red tape until after the census date. 


Additionally, cold-calling, the use of third party contact lists and other unscrupulous marketing practices will be banned, as they are under VET Student Loans. 


This Bill will prevent the use of deceitful marketing, and apply penalties to those who fail to abide by these standards, consistent with the VET Student Loans arrangements passed by Parliament last year. 


Similar to requirements in place for VET Student Loans, we will ensure that FEE-HELP loans are only going to students who have requested them, and who are active and engaged in their course of study, and to those who are academically suited for the course in which they are enrolled. 


Requiring providers to assess a student as academically suitable and limiting eligibility for FEE-HELP loans to those students who are genuinely studying will prevent vulnerable people from being signed up for courses they are not capable of completing, and incurring debts they may not be in a position to repay. 


In order to maintain eligibility for FEE-HELP at these higher education providers, students must also achieve and maintain a reasonable level of completion of units undertaken. The onus should be on both the provider and the student to achieve this – the provider to have high quality teaching and student support in place, and the student to engage with the course requirements. 


An important aspect of these changes is that they ensure non-genuine students, or those who were not eligible to incur the debt for academic reasons, are able to have their debts remitted. 


The Bill also triggers powers under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014. This allows the department to monitor and investigate, and to apply enforcement provisions such as civil penalties, again mirroring arrangements for VET Student Loans. 


This Schedule also introduces measures to allow the Commonwealth to cap the amount of FEE-HELP assistance a provider is able to offer, or restrict student numbers or courses for which they are able to offer FEE‑HELP. 


These measures will prevent artificial growth due to non-genuine student enrolments, and allow the Commonwealth to act quickly if there is evidence that a provider is dishonestly trying to take advantage of the system. 


Conclusion


Together, these vital measures represent an important insurance – and quality assurance – policy for our higher education and international education sectors, and are consistent with changes recently enacted in the VET sector. 


The Bill ensures that as we increase learning opportunities for overseas students and market opportunities for dedicated education providers, we also shut down opportunities for unscrupulous providers to harm the reputation of our education services.


By enhancing the protections in place for students, and strengthening the monitoring framework for international education providers and non‑university higher education providers, we are avoiding another disaster like the failed VET FEE-HELP scheme, and ensuring that both the higher education and international education sectors maintain the highest standards of quality and integrity, for which we are internationally renowned. 


I commend the Bill. 


PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2017 MEASURES NO.1) BILL 2017


I would like to thank Senators for their contribution to this debate on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No.1) Bill 2017 (bill). The bill amends legislation and repeals redundant legislation. 


I present for the information of Senators an addendum to the Explanatory Memorandum which responds to a request made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Committee requested that key additional information provided to that Committee be included in the Explanatory Memorandum. [Present Addendum]


The amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act 2005 enable the Commonwealth and its portfolio bodies to waive the exercise of its statutory consent power over certain Commonwealth funded assets by providing written notice to the Indigenous organisation concerned that consent to dispose of an interest in land is no longer required. 


Historical Indigenous grant funding of land or property has been secured through the Commonwealth's application of ongoing rights and interests, usually notified by a caveat. 


In 2015, the Council of Australian Governments recommended that the Commonwealth review remaining caveats on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission properties and remove unnecessary restrictions to support economic development for Indigenous land owners.


At the moment, the law does not allow the Commonwealth to waive rights and interests for an organisation unless the contractual link is broken by the sale or disposal of the property. This ongoing aspect of rights and interests is not in line with other Commonwealth grant funding processes. In addition, the current policy is to maintain the Commonwealth's interests through the use of contract law after a property sale has occurred. The changes will reduce administrative burden and regulatory requirements for organisations and government.


The bill will also support this Government's approach to work in partnership with Indigenous Australians, empower local communities and promote economic opportunities. 


The Commonwealth and its portfolio bodies can elect to notify the Indigenous organisations that consent is no longer required to dispose of an interest in land. The consenting authorities in question include the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation and other bodies with responsibilities for Indigenous Affairs, such as the Department of Health and the Attorney-General's Department.  These amendments will reduce red tape for the Commonwealth by permitting it to remove its regulatory role in the disposal of land and provide opportunities to further the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the management of land.


The Government has consulted with Indigenous stakeholders on this amendment and will work with Indigenous Australian on the implementation of this measure. 


The amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 streamline the annual reporting requirements of Indigenous Business Australia by repealing the requirement for the responsible Minister to table a corporate plan from Indigenous Business Australia which duplicates reporting requirements in the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.


The bill repeals the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978 and Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991. These two acts are both redundant as the Commonwealth can no longer declare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander reserves in Queensland, and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is no longer in use.


The bill amends the Auditor-General Act 1997 to align annual reporting requirements of the Auditor-General with his or her responsibility to the Parliament. The Auditor-General is an independent officer of the Parliament. The reintroduction of tabling of annual reports directly to the Parliament would demonstrate the independence of the office and be consistent with its responsibilities to the Parliament. It would also bring Australia in line with international best practice for comparable auditing institutions. The amendment would allow for the Auditor-General to table the 2016-17 annual report directly to Parliament. 


The Australian National Audit Office was consulted in the drafting of the amendments. 


Finally, the bill amends the Royal CommissionsAct 1902 to give Commissioners a new power and to increase some offence penalties. These changes will assist the operation of future Royal Commissions. Another change will give administrative flexibility by enabling records of a completed Royal Commission to be held by the Attorney-General's Department when that is considered the appropriate agency. 


I commend the bill.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:06):  I move:


That the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016, made under the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Act 2016, be disallowed.


This morning we heard Minister Cash, in one of her diatribes, say that workplaces should be cooperative, productive and fair. Let me tell you that the building and construction code does not lead to cooperative workplaces. It does not lead to productive workplaces and it does not lead to fair workplaces. I notice that the minister never mentioned having safe workplaces, but let me add that to the list that Minister Cash outlined. Let me indicate that the Australian Building and Construction Commission does nothing for safety in relation to building and construction workers in this country.


Minister Cash also said this morning that small and medium workplaces need to be able to compete. Really, that is code—not the Building Code—but it's a code for letting the cowboys loose in the building and construction industry. The cowboys are in there, with no concern for health and safety. And what we see is what happened to two young Irish backpackers in East Perth, who were employed by Jackson Construction. They were Gerry Bradley and Joe McDermott, young Irish construction workers killed on the job, even after the CFMEU had notified WorkSafe in Western Australia that there was a problem and after they had tried to enter the Jackson site to deal with health and safety issues. And what happened to them? They were obstructed by the ABCC. You let cowboy companies on the job, and what do you get? You get young workers killed. You get a 27-year-old German backpacker working 13 floors up, falling to her death. That's the type of situation you get when you have the ABCC and this Building Code in place.


We need to get back to a situation in the industry where the tripartite groups—the government, the building unions and the employers in the industry—can come together and sit down to discuss the issues that will improve productivity and that will improve health and safety on the site, not this ideological nonsense that Minister Cash proposes every time she's on her feet, which is about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry and diminishing health and safety. It's an ideology which has no concern for proper training and skills in the industry, letting exploitation take its way in the industry—where the small businesses and big businesses can exploit workers without any fear of any government regulation or government legislation that will deal with it.


We see overseas labour flooding into these building and construction sites, many of them young backpackers with no experience in the industry, being killed and being maimed in the building and construction industry—a very dangerous industry. We see apprentices being exploited in the industry. Does the Building Code fix that? No, it doesn't. Does the ABCC deal with that? No, they don't. This is just an ideological group set up by this government to diminish workers' rights and access to the unions in the industry. It's about allowing a dog-eat-dog undercutting of the rates of pay properly negotiated by the unions and the building industry by providing protections for these fly-by-nighters, the cowboys in the industry, coming in to undercut decent wages in the industry. It's one of the reasons we have wage stagnation in this country. It's one of the reasons the Reserve Bank Governor has come out and said, 'Make more demands for wages,' because wages under this minister are stagnating. Profitability is going up and wages are going down, and that's because of these ideologically driven pieces of legislation that provide for the ABCC and the Building Code.


I have to say to you—and I've said this on many occasions—I have never seen a more incompetent servant of the Australian public than Nigel Hadgkiss, the building commissioner, who established their approach under the direction of the former minister, Senator Eric Abetz, and continued on with the ideology that drives Senator Cash to attack working people and their unions, to determine that the core business of the ABCC will not allow them to deal with workers' exploitation. They won't deal with phoenixing and sham contracting. They won't deal with health and safety. And it was only after legislation to re-establish the ABCC came to this Senate—last year, I think, now—that we actually got changes to the legislation to try to widen the issues that the ABCC dealt with. I know Senator Xenophon made comments about the conduct of Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, the commissioner for the ABCC, who has responsibility to oversight this code—a code that is simply about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry. And Senator Xenophon agreed with me that there were significant problems with the operation of the ABCC. How such an incompetent, ideologically driven public servant could ever be given the responsibility to implement legislation in the building and construction industry beggars belief. I just don't understand it. He is absolutely incompetent and absolutely ideologically driven.


Let's look at what this minister has delivered with this code. This is a code that is supposedly improving productivity but, when you look at it, it's only about driving down wages and conditions and trying to ensure that the building and construction unions have little opportunity to increase rights in the building industry.


One of the clauses in that building code stops unions negotiating with companies to increase the opportunities for young Australians getting apprenticeships in the industry. I was a union official for 27 years, and one of my jobs whenever I was bargaining was to get young kids a job—give young kids an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. But that is directly illegal under this building code. That's despite the ABS estimating that, in 2015, approximately 27,400 young people applied for apprenticeships in the industry, but were unsuccessful in obtaining one. This is something that has been allowed for decades in this country, because this government determines that you are not going to be allowed to bargain with your employer to increase apprenticeships. What a nonsense!


The other aspect of this building code is about increasing casualisation. That's what it's about. It's about stopping workers getting permanent jobs in the industry. Clauses requiring casual conversion to permanent work after six weeks is not code compliant. I don't know anywhere in this country, never mind overseas, where you can't bargain for those issues. I don't know anywhere else in the world, in advanced economies, where unions can't bargain on behalf of the workers to get a conversion to permanent work after six weeks. This government—the ideologues and rabble of a government that they are—and this minister have determined that this doesn't fit with their view of the world and it doesn't fit with the employers who pour money into their election campaigns every year. That's despite that one in four workers in the industry are casual—23.9 per cent casual. That is significantly higher than the national average across all industries.


This code makes vulnerable temporary overseas workers even more vulnerable. Clauses and agreements which require the parties to confer to ensure that all parties are satisfied—that all laws in relation to sponsorship, engagement and employment of a person who is not an Australian citizen are complied with—are banned by the code. The unions—the workers on the job—cannot get a clause in an agreement that says, 'Migrant workers or workers who are coming here on a temporary basis are employed under Australian law.' This is despite the fact that, while there are approximately two million temporary workers in Australia—including over 1.4 million with work rights—the overseas workers team at the Fair Work Ombudsman consists of 17 full-time inspectors to investigate cases of exploitation. That's 80,000 visa holders per inspector. But does this code contemplate any of those issues? Does this code assist working people and ensure that foreign workers are coming in on the correct basis? It doesn't.


The code also bans clauses in enterprise agreements which ensure Australian residents will have preference in recruitment, employment and training opportunities relative to temporary foreign workers. What could be more crazy than that? This is a government who wants to reduce wages and conditions in the building and construction industry through this code and make it easy for companies to bring in temporary foreign workers at the expense of jobs for Australian workers. It makes it illegal to consult with the workers' union prior to the initial mobilisation of foreign labour. It makes it illegal for a union and workers on the job to ensure that, in the event of redundancies, temporary foreign workers will be made redundant first, given that temporary foreign workers are intended to supplement the Australian workforce. So this is what is in this code. It's not about productivity. It's not about ensuring that workers get rights. We so often hear from Senator Cash that the coalition are somehow standing up for workers' rights. I just can't stop laughing when I hear that from this rabble of a disjointed, divided government in here. They almost sound like Senator Roberts—completely out of touch with reality.


The last point: although confirmed as non-compliant with the ABCC guidance note, it is in direct contradiction to the promise that the minister made in the debate on the building and construction amendment bill on 14 February. So this is a minister that can't even keep her word. Her ideology just dominates her capacity to keep her word. And they have even banned a union flying charity flags from cranes. The code doesn't allow the flying of union flags or the Good Friday Appeal flag. The Turnbull government's building code has been used on Victoria's sky rail and Tullamarine upgrade to block efforts by the CFMEU to raise money for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal. We hear so much from this minister, this ideologue across the chamber, coming after unions for stopping the job at a children's hospital because workers were dying on the job. But when workers were raising $800,000 last year for charity, this code stopped them raising that money. It's just crazy!


They even got to the stage where they cancelled Christmas in the building and construction industry. Clauses which provide that in the construction sector Christmas shutdowns shall be observed as per the industry calendar are non-compliant. It is something that's happened in the building and construction industry for decades. But it doesn't fit with the ideology or the cost cutting that business want in that industry. There's no say for unions in fatigue management. Clauses in enterprise agreements that require union consultation for overtime in excess of 58 hours a week to be worked are banned. No wonder workers are getting killed in the building and construction industry directly because of this code. There is more fatigue and more pushing for long hours in a very dangerous industry. You can't deal with it in your agreement between you and the employer.


The code says that any disputed or delayed payment has to be reported to the ABC commissioner and the relevant funding entity. The ABCC has defined a payment has 'disputed' when it's referred to adjudication, and it's delayed when the amount payable is in accordance with a determination of an adjudicator. This doesn't help contractors and their reluctance to report that they're not being paid in the first place. This is an abomination of a code. It inhibits union officials' access to their workplace. The bulk of the disputes in the building and construction industry are when union officials are trying to get onto the site to protect their members' wages and conditions, protect their health and safety, and deal with workers who are being maimed and killed in the building and construction industry. Twenty-five have been killed in recent times. It's absolutely unacceptable. This Senate should not allow this code to continue.


Senator Xenophon needs to address these issues and why workers in this country are being denied the rights that are allowed in every other advanced country in the world. It provides a fig leaf to legitimate problems in the industry by paying lip-service to being concerned about health and safety, wage theft, worker exploitation, contractor underpayments, the exploitation of foreign labour and non-conforming building products that are killing people all over the world.


John Holland have seven convictions for serious breaches of the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act—four of those involving fatalities—but they haven't been banned from construction building work. So you can kill workers on a building site but you can't fly a union flag. How ridiculous is that? How much more does this mob need to do to demonstrate how stupid they are in relation to this building code? Only two companies have lost accreditation for work on Commonwealth safety provided by the Federal Safety Commission in the 12 years that this has been established. But there has been fatality after fatality. There have been 424 fatalities in the construction industry in the last 12 years, as of 2 August. But do you hear any concerns about that from this rabble of a government? No; it's about stopping workers accessing a decent union and stopping them accessing decent rights. (Time expired)

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (18:26):  Bullying, thuggery, intimidation, standover tactics, vile threats, refusing to obey the law, fines now totalling in excess of $10 million, cartel-like behaviour between some head contractors and the CFMEU, actively and proudly locking out of the building and construction industry mum and dad hardworking sub-contractors, taxpayers paying up to 30 per cent more for public infrastructure, fewer schools, fewer roads, fewer hospitals and industrial action proudly taken to ensure delays in the building of children's hospitals. Unfortunately, for too many years now, the building and construction industry has proven to all Australians the worst examples of illegal industrial behaviour, unnecessary disruption and unrest.


The sheer weight of evidence regarding this unlawful conduct is staggering. To quote recent Federal Court judges in relation to the CFMEU:


No penalties that have been imposed in the past have appeared to reduce its willingness to breach the law.


As for the position of the CFMEU itself, the commissioner tendered schedules of prior cases involving the CFMEU that on any view reveal a lamentable, if not disgraceful, record of deliberately flouting industrial laws.


It has also been stated that the 'normalisation of contraventions' by the CFMEU: 


… has been the subject of comment by judges on so many previous occasions that any further observation on my part here would amount to little more than stating the obvious.


… if there is any union in the industrial universe which should be acutely aware of the importance of understanding the boundaries of lawful conduct in the prosecution of disputes, it is this one. Self-evidently, it does not care to do so.


It was also stated that the CFMEU:


… is an organisation with a long and sorry history of industrial disputation in which its willingness to disregard the industrial laws of this country seem to know no bounds. The CFMEU has an egregious record of repeated and wilful contraventions of all manner of industrial laws. 




Senator Cameron:
  Blah, blah, blah!




Senator CASH:
  Senator Cameron, I do not often take your interjections, but, just to repeat for the Hansard record, they are not my words; they are the findings of Federal Court judges—respected men and women in this country who are there to ensure the laws are upheld and, in the end, they are not to apply the appropriate penalties.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my left!




Senator CASH:
  I'm going to address one claim that is made in relation to the building code. I am not going to address others, because I'm not allowed to call anyone in this place a liar, so all I will say is that what have been on display tonight are nothing more and nothing less than falsities in relation to the claims of safety. It is an utterly false claim that the building code reduces workers' safety provisions on building sites. It grossly misrepresents the building code and all of the government's agenda—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister, resume your seat. Senator Cameron, order! Order on my left! Senator Cameron, you were heard in total silence. I ask you to show the same respect for other speakers in this chamber. Is that clear? Continue, Minister.




Senator CASH:
  It grossly misrepresents the building code and, I would hope, every single person's agenda in this place for a safer and more productive building industry. The code requires employers to strictly comply with all applicable work health and safety laws. In the event that they don't, they will face consequences, including being banned from tendering for Commonwealth government work.


Again, I say this: this government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry to ensure that the rule of law prevails in this sector. Taxpayers, consumers, mum-and-dad small businesses and workers are all benefitting from the re-establishment of the ABCC. There have been bullying, thuggery, intimidation, standover tactics, threats, refusal to obey the law, fines now totalling in excess of $10 million, cartel-like behaviour between some head contractors and the CFMEU, proudly and actively locking out mum-and-dad subcontractors from the building and construction industry, taxpayers paying up to 30 per cent more for public infrastructure, fewer schools, less work, fewer hospitals. No person in Australia—woman or man—should have to work in an industry where these conditions prevail. We will do everything we can to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in the building and construction industry and to wipe out once and for all the bullying, thuggery and intimidation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:32):  On behalf of my colleagues, we cannot support this disallowance motion. There has been no shortage of debate on the ABCC legislation and the building code that goes with it. Last November, I moved a series of amendments to that legislation, which were about making the bill fairer, making it more effective in terms of job creation and improving productivity in this country. The amendments included an important right to judicial review of decisions made by the ABCC, which had never existed before.


As a general principle, I understand fully the argument that one industry should not be singled out for different treatment, but the industrial relations framework in the building and construction industry has a long, complex and vexed history. There was the Winneke royal commission in 1982, the Gyles royal commission in 1992, the Cole royal commission in 2003 and, most recently, the Heydon royal commission in 2015. There was also the Wilcox report, which was an initiative of the then federal Labor government in 2008. The final report was handed to the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard, in April 2009 in relation to the operations of the office of the Fair Work building and construction inspectorate. Justice Wilcox found that there was still a significant level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry. He was critical not just of unions but also of employers.


The more recent inquiry of former High Court justice Dyson Heydon gathered a great deal of evidence, some of which I found quite compelling, about serious issues—allegations of corruption, bullying and harassment. In his interim report, Commissioner Heydon found that some CFMEU members had acted in wilful defiance of the law, and there were allegations of corruption, death threats, extortion, gross neglect and other serious criminal matters. In his final report released in December 2015 the royal commissioner confirmed his findings that corruption was widespread and deep-seated. 


The union officials allegedly involved ranged in seniority from the most junior to the most senior, although I hasten to add that Michael O'Connor, the national secretary of the CFMEU, and Dave Noonan, another very senior officer, have not been tainted by any of these allegations in the royal commission. Despite the fundamental differences that I have with Michael O'Connor over the building code, it was grossly unfair that he was wrongly reported for breaches of the act—that is, that he was named for allegedly being at an unlawful picket when he was in fact in another state. The leaking of that information, dragging his name into the parliament, was wrong. It was a disgrace.


The issue before us is whether the building code should be disallowed and in particular section 11 of the code. Perhaps the key issue relates to section 11 of the building code. This section prohibits code covered entities from being covered by an enterprise agreement in respect of building work which includes certain clauses, or from engaging in certain conduct. This section is the centrepiece of the building code. Its aim, as essentially stated, is to change the culture in the building and construction industry. The long history of royal commissions, together with the Wilcox report, notes that there is an issue with the culture in the building and construction industry. It is a difficult issue because the argument of those opposed to the building code is that it ought to be within the framework of the Fair Work Act and not derogate from that framework. 


That to me seems to be the key debate and the key ideological debate in respect of this. Those in favour of it say that if cultural change is needed then the building code will be the most effective tool, and it is needed because the courts have said this about the conduct on building sites. Justice White said in April last year in a case involving the CFMEU:


On any reasonable measure, that is an appalling record. It bespeaks an attitude by the CFMEU of ignoring, if not defying, the law and a willingness to contravene it as and when it chooses.


Last year as well Justice Jessup said:


The CFMEU's record of non-compliance with legislation of this kind has now become notorious. That record ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement. 


Justice Mortimer in a 2016 case said:


The conduct has in common features of abuse of industrial power and the use of whatever means the individuals involved considered likely to achieve outcomes to the interests of the CFMEU.


The conduct occurs so regularly, in situations with the same kinds of features, that the only available inference is that there is a conscious and deliberate strategy employed by the CFMEU and its officers to engage in disruptive threatening and abusive behaviour towards employers without regard to the lawfulness of that action, and impervious to the prospect of prosecution and penalties. 


It is for this reason, because of these exceptional circumstances, that the provisions of the building code are necessary at this time. If the behaviour changes, I would support the code changing. 


Unlike some of my crossbench colleagues, I have continued to engage with the CFMEU in recent weeks. I did so in good faith. I spent a lot of time with them. Even though the CFMEU has previously unleashed a massive advertising campaign against me, featuring gross misrepresentations, outright lies and a post-truth campaign par excellence—the billboards and the full-page ads said that I didn't care about safety or about jobs—I have continued to talk to them. I've been told that after today in effect Armageddon will be unleashed against me and that there will be a massive campaign, the likes of which I have never seen. This fear-and-smear campaign on anything other than the code, as I understand it, is designed to damage and destroy, based on lies, distortions and misrepresentations, but I suggest it is counterproductive.


I want the best outcome for Australian workers on building sites. If Commonwealth money is involved on these sites, then it is reasonable to expect a reasonable standard of behaviour. I say to Senator Cameron, who I respect and admire for his passion on this and many other issues: the Senate estimates process is one of many processes to examine the conduct of the ABCC. If Senator Cameron has further evidence of what he considers to be unfair conduct and that requires a separate parliamentary inquiry, then the general principle is I will support that. But right now we have a situation as to whether the code should stand. The conduct and the behaviour has not changed; therefore, the building code should not change. I do not support this disallowance motion.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Cameron be agreed to.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-08-09,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:06):  I move:


That the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016, made under the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Act 2016, be disallowed.


This morning we heard Minister Cash, in one of her diatribes, say that workplaces should be cooperative, productive and fair. Let me tell you that the building and construction code does not lead to cooperative workplaces. It does not lead to productive workplaces and it does not lead to fair workplaces. I notice that the minister never mentioned having safe workplaces, but let me add that to the list that Minister Cash outlined. Let me indicate that the Australian Building and Construction Commission does nothing for safety in relation to building and construction workers in this country.


Minister Cash also said this morning that small and medium workplaces need to be able to compete. Really, that is code—not the Building Code—but it's a code for letting the cowboys loose in the building and construction industry. The cowboys are in there, with no concern for health and safety. And what we see is what happened to two young Irish backpackers in East Perth, who were employed by Jackson Construction. They were Gerry Bradley and Joe McDermott, young Irish construction workers killed on the job, even after the CFMEU had notified WorkSafe in Western Australia that there was a problem and after they had tried to enter the Jackson site to deal with health and safety issues. And what happened to them? They were obstructed by the ABCC. You let cowboy companies on the job, and what do you get? You get young workers killed. You get a 27-year-old German backpacker working 13 floors up, falling to her death. That's the type of situation you get when you have the ABCC and this Building Code in place.


We need to get back to a situation in the industry where the tripartite groups—the government, the building unions and the employers in the industry—can come together and sit down to discuss the issues that will improve productivity and that will improve health and safety on the site, not this ideological nonsense that Minister Cash proposes every time she's on her feet, which is about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry and diminishing health and safety. It's an ideology which has no concern for proper training and skills in the industry, letting exploitation take its way in the industry—where the small businesses and big businesses can exploit workers without any fear of any government regulation or government legislation that will deal with it.


We see overseas labour flooding into these building and construction sites, many of them young backpackers with no experience in the industry, being killed and being maimed in the building and construction industry—a very dangerous industry. We see apprentices being exploited in the industry. Does the Building Code fix that? No, it doesn't. Does the ABCC deal with that? No, they don't. This is just an ideological group set up by this government to diminish workers' rights and access to the unions in the industry. It's about allowing a dog-eat-dog undercutting of the rates of pay properly negotiated by the unions and the building industry by providing protections for these fly-by-nighters, the cowboys in the industry, coming in to undercut decent wages in the industry. It's one of the reasons we have wage stagnation in this country. It's one of the reasons the Reserve Bank Governor has come out and said, 'Make more demands for wages,' because wages under this minister are stagnating. Profitability is going up and wages are going down, and that's because of these ideologically driven pieces of legislation that provide for the ABCC and the Building Code.


I have to say to you—and I've said this on many occasions—I have never seen a more incompetent servant of the Australian public than Nigel Hadgkiss, the building commissioner, who established their approach under the direction of the former minister, Senator Eric Abetz, and continued on with the ideology that drives Senator Cash to attack working people and their unions, to determine that the core business of the ABCC will not allow them to deal with workers' exploitation. They won't deal with phoenixing and sham contracting. They won't deal with health and safety. And it was only after legislation to re-establish the ABCC came to this Senate—last year, I think, now—that we actually got changes to the legislation to try to widen the issues that the ABCC dealt with. I know Senator Xenophon made comments about the conduct of Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, the commissioner for the ABCC, who has responsibility to oversight this code—a code that is simply about diminishing workers' rights in the building and construction industry. And Senator Xenophon agreed with me that there were significant problems with the operation of the ABCC. How such an incompetent, ideologically driven public servant could ever be given the responsibility to implement legislation in the building and construction industry beggars belief. I just don't understand it. He is absolutely incompetent and absolutely ideologically driven.


Let's look at what this minister has delivered with this code. This is a code that is supposedly improving productivity but, when you look at it, it's only about driving down wages and conditions and trying to ensure that the building and construction unions have little opportunity to increase rights in the building industry.


One of the clauses in that building code stops unions negotiating with companies to increase the opportunities for young Australians getting apprenticeships in the industry. I was a union official for 27 years, and one of my jobs whenever I was bargaining was to get young kids a job—give young kids an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. But that is directly illegal under this building code. That's despite the ABS estimating that, in 2015, approximately 27,400 young people applied for apprenticeships in the industry, but were unsuccessful in obtaining one. This is something that has been allowed for decades in this country, because this government determines that you are not going to be allowed to bargain with your employer to increase apprenticeships. What a nonsense!


The other aspect of this building code is about increasing casualisation. That's what it's about. It's about stopping workers getting permanent jobs in the industry. Clauses requiring casual conversion to permanent work after six weeks is not code compliant. I don't know anywhere in this country, never mind overseas, where you can't bargain for those issues. I don't know anywhere else in the world, in advanced economies, where unions can't bargain on behalf of the workers to get a conversion to permanent work after six weeks. This government—the ideologues and rabble of a government that they are—and this minister have determined that this doesn't fit with their view of the world and it doesn't fit with the employers who pour money into their election campaigns every year. That's despite that one in four workers in the industry are casual—23.9 per cent casual. That is significantly higher than the national average across all industries.


This code makes vulnerable temporary overseas workers even more vulnerable. Clauses and agreements which require the parties to confer to ensure that all parties are satisfied—that all laws in relation to sponsorship, engagement and employment of a person who is not an Australian citizen are complied with—are banned by the code. The unions—the workers on the job—cannot get a clause in an agreement that says, 'Migrant workers or workers who are coming here on a temporary basis are employed under Australian law.' This is despite the fact that, while there are approximately two million temporary workers in Australia—including over 1.4 million with work rights—the overseas workers team at the Fair Work Ombudsman consists of 17 full-time inspectors to investigate cases of exploitation. That's 80,000 visa holders per inspector. But does this code contemplate any of those issues? Does this code assist working people and ensure that foreign workers are coming in on the correct basis? It doesn't.


The code also bans clauses in enterprise agreements which ensure Australian residents will have preference in recruitment, employment and training opportunities relative to temporary foreign workers. What could be more crazy than that? This is a government who wants to reduce wages and conditions in the building and construction industry through this code and make it easy for companies to bring in temporary foreign workers at the expense of jobs for Australian workers. It makes it illegal to consult with the workers' union prior to the initial mobilisation of foreign labour. It makes it illegal for a union and workers on the job to ensure that, in the event of redundancies, temporary foreign workers will be made redundant first, given that temporary foreign workers are intended to supplement the Australian workforce. So this is what is in this code. It's not about productivity. It's not about ensuring that workers get rights. We so often hear from Senator Cash that the coalition are somehow standing up for workers' rights. I just can't stop laughing when I hear that from this rabble of a disjointed, divided government in here. They almost sound like Senator Roberts—completely out of touch with reality.


The last point: although confirmed as non-compliant with the ABCC guidance note, it is in direct contradiction to the promise that the minister made in the debate on the building and construction amendment bill on 14 February. So this is a minister that can't even keep her word. Her ideology just dominates her capacity to keep her word. And they have even banned a union flying charity flags from cranes. The code doesn't allow the flying of union flags or the Good Friday Appeal flag. The Turnbull government's building code has been used on Victoria's sky rail and Tullamarine upgrade to block efforts by the CFMEU to raise money for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal. We hear so much from this minister, this ideologue across the chamber, coming after unions for stopping the job at a children's hospital because workers were dying on the job. But when workers were raising $800,000 last year for charity, this code stopped them raising that money. It's just crazy!


They even got to the stage where they cancelled Christmas in the building and construction industry. Clauses which provide that in the construction sector Christmas shutdowns shall be observed as per the industry calendar are non-compliant. It is something that's happened in the building and construction industry for decades. But it doesn't fit with the ideology or the cost cutting that business want in that industry. There's no say for unions in fatigue management. Clauses in enterprise agreements that require union consultation for overtime in excess of 58 hours a week to be worked are banned. No wonder workers are getting killed in the building and construction industry directly because of this code. There is more fatigue and more pushing for long hours in a very dangerous industry. You can't deal with it in your agreement between you and the employer.


The code says that any disputed or delayed payment has to be reported to the ABC commissioner and the relevant funding entity. The ABCC has defined a payment has 'disputed' when it's referred to adjudication, and it's delayed when the amount payable is in accordance with a determination of an adjudicator. This doesn't help contractors and their reluctance to report that they're not being paid in the first place. This is an abomination of a code. It inhibits union officials' access to their workplace. The bulk of the disputes in the building and construction industry are when union officials are trying to get onto the site to protect their members' wages and conditions, protect their health and safety, and deal with workers who are being maimed and killed in the building and construction industry. Twenty-five have been killed in recent times. It's absolutely unacceptable. This Senate should not allow this code to continue.


Senator Xenophon needs to address these issues and why workers in this country are being denied the rights that are allowed in every other advanced country in the world. It provides a fig leaf to legitimate problems in the industry by paying lip-service to being concerned about health and safety, wage theft, worker exploitation, contractor underpayments, the exploitation of foreign labour and non-conforming building products that are killing people all over the world.


John Holland have seven convictions for serious breaches of the Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act—four of those involving fatalities—but they haven't been banned from construction building work. So you can kill workers on a building site but you can't fly a union flag. How ridiculous is that? How much more does this mob need to do to demonstrate how stupid they are in relation to this building code? Only two companies have lost accreditation for work on Commonwealth safety provided by the Federal Safety Commission in the 12 years that this has been established. But there has been fatality after fatality. There have been 424 fatalities in the construction industry in the last 12 years, as of 2 August. But do you hear any concerns about that from this rabble of a government? No; it's about stopping workers accessing a decent union and stopping them accessing decent rights. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2017-08-09,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (18:26):  Bullying, thuggery, intimidation, standover tactics, vile threats, refusing to obey the law, fines now totalling in excess of $10 million, cartel-like behaviour between some head contractors and the CFMEU, actively and proudly locking out of the building and construction industry mum and dad hardworking sub-contractors, taxpayers paying up to 30 per cent more for public infrastructure, fewer schools, fewer roads, fewer hospitals and industrial action proudly taken to ensure delays in the building of children's hospitals. Unfortunately, for too many years now, the building and construction industry has proven to all Australians the worst examples of illegal industrial behaviour, unnecessary disruption and unrest.


The sheer weight of evidence regarding this unlawful conduct is staggering. To quote recent Federal Court judges in relation to the CFMEU:


No penalties that have been imposed in the past have appeared to reduce its willingness to breach the law.


As for the position of the CFMEU itself, the commissioner tendered schedules of prior cases involving the CFMEU that on any view reveal a lamentable, if not disgraceful, record of deliberately flouting industrial laws.


It has also been stated that the 'normalisation of contraventions' by the CFMEU: 


… has been the subject of comment by judges on so many previous occasions that any further observation on my part here would amount to little more than stating the obvious.


… if there is any union in the industrial universe which should be acutely aware of the importance of understanding the boundaries of lawful conduct in the prosecution of disputes, it is this one. Self-evidently, it does not care to do so.


It was also stated that the CFMEU:


… is an organisation with a long and sorry history of industrial disputation in which its willingness to disregard the industrial laws of this country seem to know no bounds. The CFMEU has an egregious record of repeated and wilful contraventions of all manner of industrial laws. 




Senator Cameron:
  Blah, blah, blah!




Senator CASH:
  Senator Cameron, I do not often take your interjections, but, just to repeat for the Hansard record, they are not my words; they are the findings of Federal Court judges—respected men and women in this country who are there to ensure the laws are upheld and, in the end, they are not to apply the appropriate penalties.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my left!




Senator CASH:
  I'm going to address one claim that is made in relation to the building code. I am not going to address others, because I'm not allowed to call anyone in this place a liar, so all I will say is that what have been on display tonight are nothing more and nothing less than falsities in relation to the claims of safety. It is an utterly false claim that the building code reduces workers' safety provisions on building sites. It grossly misrepresents the building code and all of the government's agenda—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister, resume your seat. Senator Cameron, order! Order on my left! Senator Cameron, you were heard in total silence. I ask you to show the same respect for other speakers in this chamber. Is that clear? Continue, Minister.




Senator CASH:
  It grossly misrepresents the building code and, I would hope, every single person's agenda in this place for a safer and more productive building industry. The code requires employers to strictly comply with all applicable work health and safety laws. In the event that they don't, they will face consequences, including being banned from tendering for Commonwealth government work.


Again, I say this: this government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry to ensure that the rule of law prevails in this sector. Taxpayers, consumers, mum-and-dad small businesses and workers are all benefitting from the re-establishment of the ABCC. There have been bullying, thuggery, intimidation, standover tactics, threats, refusal to obey the law, fines now totalling in excess of $10 million, cartel-like behaviour between some head contractors and the CFMEU, proudly and actively locking out mum-and-dad subcontractors from the building and construction industry, taxpayers paying up to 30 per cent more for public infrastructure, fewer schools, less work, fewer hospitals. No person in Australia—woman or man—should have to work in an industry where these conditions prevail. We will do everything we can to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in the building and construction industry and to wipe out once and for all the bullying, thuggery and intimidation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:32):  On behalf of my colleagues, we cannot support this disallowance motion. There has been no shortage of debate on the ABCC legislation and the building code that goes with it. Last November, I moved a series of amendments to that legislation, which were about making the bill fairer, making it more effective in terms of job creation and improving productivity in this country. The amendments included an important right to judicial review of decisions made by the ABCC, which had never existed before.


As a general principle, I understand fully the argument that one industry should not be singled out for different treatment, but the industrial relations framework in the building and construction industry has a long, complex and vexed history. There was the Winneke royal commission in 1982, the Gyles royal commission in 1992, the Cole royal commission in 2003 and, most recently, the Heydon royal commission in 2015. There was also the Wilcox report, which was an initiative of the then federal Labor government in 2008. The final report was handed to the then Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard, in April 2009 in relation to the operations of the office of the Fair Work building and construction inspectorate. Justice Wilcox found that there was still a significant level of industrial unlawfulness in the building and construction industry. He was critical not just of unions but also of employers.


The more recent inquiry of former High Court justice Dyson Heydon gathered a great deal of evidence, some of which I found quite compelling, about serious issues—allegations of corruption, bullying and harassment. In his interim report, Commissioner Heydon found that some CFMEU members had acted in wilful defiance of the law, and there were allegations of corruption, death threats, extortion, gross neglect and other serious criminal matters. In his final report released in December 2015 the royal commissioner confirmed his findings that corruption was widespread and deep-seated.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  As I understand, we are dealing with the One Nation amendments, and I use the word 'amendments' loosely. I did say in my earlier contribution today that One Nation have never stood up for workers in this place unless they've actually been embarrassed into standing up for workers and when they were forced to do that in relation to penalty rates. But here they are. They're not even satisfied with the attacks on working people brought about by Senator Cash and the coalition of hopeless people sitting across this chamber. They're not even satisfied with that. They want to go even further, and there was no capacity. Senator Roberts did not have a clue as to what the amendments would actually do. He did not have a clue what the implications were. Maybe his mind's on other things, like High Court challenges and the like. This is something that we see from One Nation whenever they get a chance to attack working people in this place. They set about attacking them, and that's exactly what these amendments do. We don't support the amendments. The government should not support the amendments. The government have done enough attacking on working people, without picking up your further attacks on working people.


One Nation are an absolute disgrace. One Nation, you should not hold your heads up anywhere in this country, because workers' wages will diminish under you lot. You are simply subservient to the coalition. You do everything the coalition want you to do. You're worse than the National Party in that context, and that's saying a lot. So you should pull this off, because you don't even know what it means. You don't know what the implications are. You are an absolute disgrace. You should spend some productive time trying to build your case for the High Court. I think that's where you should put all of your efforts in. As I read it, you are in big trouble.

 (Queensland) (18:50):  I don't know where to start on that one! Let me answer Senator Cameron's questions from earlier. 'Reasonable'—it's an adjective—means agreeable to reason or sound judgement; logical. Secondly, it means, not exceeding the limit prescribed by reason; not excessive. Thirdly, it means moderate, especially in price. And this is where it comes back to Senator Cameron's question wondering what it means with regard to union membership dues. So not expensive. Fourthly, it means, endowed with reason. Fifthly, it means capable of rational behaviour and rational decisions.




Senator Cameron:
  Unlike you!




Senator ROBERTS:
  Mr Chair, I normally go to the television for entertainment but I have to come down here more often!


Are people so used to union bosses receiving corrupt payments that Senator Cameron needs help with understanding what 'reasonable' means when it comes to union dues? Let be me specific. Say, for example, companies can't make payments anymore to corrupt union bosses. This is what it means: currently—




Senator Cameron:
  If they were corrupt, they'd be in jail!




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my left!




Senator ROBERTS:
  There are many before the courts, as I understand it—some on criminal charges.


So here's what it means: there would be some set of dues for everyday union members—the people that the union bosses are quite often stealing from. Then, to get around these corrupt payments, it would simply be a matter of creating an executive membership grade, which could be, for example, $10,000. And that would be the way companies would be paying off the union. Or it could be $100,000. Or it could be, as we have seen in the examples that I read yesterday and today, $1 million. Is that a reasonable membership due? I say not. Maybe the senator was sleeping through my speech yesterday. So I will read what I said when I described this. Corrupt union bosses and employers create loopholes. What this does is it closes a loophole:


… where a union may charge executives of a business, for example, unreasonably large union membership fees in lieu of no longer being able to obtain cash through other nefarious means as prevented by this bill …


It must be similar, in other words, to ordinary membership dues.


I want to go on with something Senator Cameron said. This bill is about protecting union members from the sorts of corrupt payments that they have stolen from union members through the union bosses. The union bosses have stolen from the union members. That's what we need to protect. The employers are in cahoots with some union bosses to steal from union members and deny them their rights. This is about restoring workers' rights and union members' rights. And that is reasonable.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:53):  Can I indicate that I and my colleagues will not be supporting the One Nation amendments. This is not a reasonable amendment. The implication is—and I believe it is an unnecessary amendment—that unions will be able to get around this legislation by charging $10,000 for a membership fee. I don't think that when Senator Cameron was secretary of the AMWU the fee was $10,000 or anything like it. Any union that tried to charge an unreasonable fee would find itself in a position where they wouldn't have too many members. They would have a situation where people would join another registered organisation in its place.


I understand the rationale of Senator Roberts. We didn't have the benefit of a briefing from your office, Senator Roberts. It is not a criticism, because we are all so busy in this place, but I believe the legislation works without this. I believe that this is an unnecessary and onerous amendment, and my colleagues and I cannot support it.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:55):  I want to add the voice of the Greens to the opposition of what One Nation is bringing forward here. It's in no way an improvement. It's just out there doing more work for the coalition in a very ugly way and that would bring further hardship. It speaks volumes about what type of party One Nation is. Just because we're hearing from the likes of the minister of how they're doing it for the workers—and now we're hearing it from One Nation—doesn't mean that what people say is true. It's certainly not true because workers need unions. Workers need unions that are out there representing them, campaigning for them and getting better conditions. That's why we all can enjoy lunch breaks, holidays and superannuation—because people came together and they struggled. Yes, mistakes were made along the way, but we already have sufficient laws to tackle that. What One Nation is after is very punitive, very dangerous and should be defeated.

 (Queensland) (18:56):  My response to Senator Xenophon's comments are that I would not imagine that any union that charges $10,000 for its ordinary membership dues would stay in business very long. My point is that, to get around the membership dues being reasonable, unions can take payments off companies and call them membership dues. That's what I was referring to, and that's what this amendment is designed to stop.

(1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (line 25), after ""of"", insert ""directly"".


I have a definition of 'direct' here in case this is needed. This ensures benefit funds that are established for union members—perhaps, for example, widows—go directly to those the money was proposed for. That's what this is about. We all know that some union bosses are so audacious in their attempts to steal money that they establish fake funds for victims and then never give those victims one red cent from that fund. This amendment seeks to target that specific behaviour and ensure that these funds are only exempted if they directly benefit those the money was intended for.

 (South Australia) (18:58):  On behalf of my colleagues, we cannot support this amendment. The provisions in the bill are clear enough. It must be of benefit to employees. To say 'directly benefit' would invite absolute chaos. What does 'directly benefit' mean? Would it mean if a union collectively bargained for workers in one sector of the union that the other workers who have paid their member dues will not directly benefit, therefore it's unlawful? It is completely and utterly unworkable and unreasonable, and we do not support it.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (19:00):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 8164 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (line 25), at the end of paragraph 536F(3)(b), add ""or former employees"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (after line 28), after paragraph 536F(3)(c), insert:


(ca) a benefit of nominal value associated with travel or hospitality during consultation, negotiation or bargaining;


(cb) a benefit of nominal value that is:


(i) a token gift, an event invitation or a similar benefit; and


(ii) given in accordance with common courteous practice among employers and organisations;


(3) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (lines 29 to 32), omit paragraph 536F(3)(d), substitute:


(d) a payment made, at no more than market value, for goods or services supplied to the defendant in the ordinary course of the organisation's business;


(4) Schedule 1, item 3, page 8 (line 36), at the end of paragraph 536F(3)(f), add "", or in settlement of a matter before the FWC or a genuine legal dispute"".


The AiG, the ACTU, Professor Andrew Stewart and many other stakeholders have raised concerns that the exemptions in the bill to the cash or in-kind benefit offence are too narrowly drawn. For example, it makes it an offence for the following activities, which are not corrupt or corrupting and are standard activities: unions requesting and receiving payment from employers of wages or entitlements owed to ex-employees; unions negotiating the settlement of disputes with employers before court proceedings are commenced or have failed; and standard travel and hospitality during negotiations—for example, the employer making their conference room available with morning tea for a negotiation. The Labor amendments will mean that these perfectly proper activities are within the statutory exemptions.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (19:02):  In relation to the amendments, without the government's amendments Labor's proposed amendments would create a huge loophole for employers who want to contribute to make secret payments. This would mean that anyone who was once employed by an employer would then be free to receive any payment from that employer, even if the payment has no relevance to their former employment and they are working for the union. One such example of an arrangement was uncovered by the royal commission. In this case, a worker resigned from Huntsman Corporation to take up a job as an AWU organiser in a deal engineered by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Bugg was paid by the company as an organiser, but large parts of the payments, ostensibly for his wages, were channelled into the AWU's general revenue. We cannot support these types of arrangements being hidden from workers, and so we do not support Labor's amendments.


In relation to the payments for nominal value, without the government's amendment, Labor's proposed amendment would provide no cap on the size of the payments that can be transferred between union officials and employers. Again, it creates a massive loophole. It's not at all clear what would constitute a nominal payment in the context of travel or hospitality, which are generally costly gifts. Would a nominal gift of travel include an employer lending a private jet to a union secretary to take private holidays in Cuba? Unfortunately, that's not far-fetched, because that is exactly what happened in terms of the Leader of the Opposition while he was a union boss negotiating an enterprise agreement.


Any travel or related costs that are genuinely associated with bargaining or other roles of registered organisations will not be affected by the bill. What our amendment seeks to do is to ensure that the term 'nominal payments' actually does refer to small amounts, and we are proposing that gifts of up to two penalty units—$420—would be nominal gifts. We would seek the support of the chamber to clarify those two amendments put by Labor.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  As I understand, we are dealing with the One Nation amendments, and I use the word 'amendments' loosely. I did say in my earlier contribution today that One Nation have never stood up for workers in this place unless they've actually been embarrassed into standing up for workers and when they were forced to do that in relation to penalty rates. But here they are. They're not even satisfied with the attacks on working people brought about by Senator Cash and the coalition of hopeless people sitting across this chamber. They're not even satisfied with that. They want to go even further, and there was no capacity. Senator Roberts did not have a clue as to what the amendments would actually do. He did not have a clue what the implications were. Maybe his mind's on other things, like High Court challenges and the like. This is something that we see from One Nation whenever they get a chance to attack working people in this place. They set about attacking them, and that's exactly what these amendments do. We don't support the amendments. The government should not support the amendments. The government have done enough attacking on working people, without picking up your further attacks on working people.


One Nation are an absolute disgrace. One Nation, you should not hold your heads up anywhere in this country, because workers' wages will diminish under you lot. You are simply subservient to the coalition. You do everything the coalition want you to do. You're worse than the National Party in that context, and that's saying a lot. So you should pull this off, because you don't even know what it means. You don't know what the implications are. You are an absolute disgrace. You should spend some productive time trying to build your case for the High Court. I think that's where you should put all of your efforts in. As I read it, you are in big trouble. Workers in this country will survive you, Senator Roberts. They will survive the coalition—

Mr Bugg was paid by the company as an organiser, but large parts of the payments, ostensibly for his wages, were channelled into the AWU's general revenue. We cannot support these types of arrangements being hidden from workers, and so we do not support Labor's amendments.


In relation to the payments for nominal value, without the government's amendment, Labor's proposed amendment would provide no cap on the size of the payments that can be transferred between union officials and employers. Again, it creates a massive loophole. It's not at all clear what would constitute a nominal payment in the context of travel or hospitality, which are generally costly gifts. Would a nominal gift of travel include an employer lending a private jet to a union secretary to take private holidays in Cuba? Unfortunately, that's not far-fetched, because that is exactly what happened in terms of the Leader of the Opposition while he was a union boss negotiating an enterprise agreement.


Any travel or related costs that are genuinely associated with bargaining or other roles of registered organisations will not be affected by the bill. What our amendment seeks to do is to ensure that the term 'nominal payments' actually does refer to small amounts, and we are proposing that gifts of up to two penalty units—$420—would be nominal gifts. We would seek the support of the chamber to clarify those two amendments put by Labor.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (19:30):  This evening I want to make a short contribution acknowledging the work that both Senator Ludlam and Senator Waters made in and gave to this place. The circumstances of their leaving us have been widely discussed in the media and I won't be looking into that at all. But because I happened to work with both of these senators across a number of areas, particularly on committee work, I thought it was important to make some contribution acknowledging the work that we had done and also to remind people that these two senators gave considerable work and considerable commitment and brought great dedication to their work in this place.


I have worked with Scott Ludlam across many committees over many years. Prior to his working as a senator in this place he worked with Senator Rachel Siewert, and that was where I met him. In his work, particularly in the areas of human rights and social justice, Scott was always generous in his contributions and quite discerning in seeing the best way to make his argument. Whilst I would never use the adjective 'vicious', he was sometimes quite direct in the way he called upon people to be true to their values in what they did in this place. This afternoon, when we had a visit from a delegation from Tibet and met with a number of people who are involved in the issues around the struggle for Tibet, it was almost unreal to sit there and not be able to turn around and see Senator Ludlam there, because that was one of the issues that he had fought for from the time he came into this place. I think that will be remembered.


He also made many contributions—sometimes in the adjournment, sometimes not—around the issue of nuclear disarmament. He has been active at the international level in this space and came into the chamber many times to talk about the need for an international approach where Australia would take a role on issues of nuclear armaments, nuclear energy and the threat that nuclear processors hold for our planet. I think that his work will continue across many of the debates that take place here in the Senate. Scott was also extremely generous in his work with social community groups, and we talked many times about the way the Senate operated and how we could best use this place to get the message across about the issues that are important to so many people.


Senator Larissa Waters was a Queensland senator, and I shared many platforms with her not only during elections—where it seemed that her terms coincided with mine, so she would be there representing the Greens Party and I would be there for Labor—but also in wider community activities. For Senator Waters, the work that we did was increasingly focused on gender equality. I think people particularly remember the work that she did around the domestic violence report that we did a couple of years ago in this place. She pushed very strongly for a Senate inquiry into these issues and throughout the process was very active in ensuring that women and men across the community were engaged in the process and that we had the opportunity to hear real experiences and listen to people who understood the reality of the horror of domestic violence and people from community groups. We shared membership of many of the organisations as well and talked about practical ways to respond to these horrors. The area of gender equality has always been important to Larissa, and I know it will continue to be.


The environment is also very important for Larissa. I first met her as an environmental lawyer. She is completely dedicated to issues of the sanctity of the Great Barrier Reef. Many times we've heard her debating these issues in this place—bringing information to this place, not always receiving the overall support of the chamber, but steadfastly holding to her arguments and ensuring that those arguments were placed before the Senate.


In the Senate, before people leave us, we often have the opportunity to take note of the activities of senators, to wish them well and to ensure that some of their important contributions are acknowledged by their fellow senators. This opportunity was not given, because of the way in which their retirements from this place occurred. But I do very much value the many years of discussion and debate that I shared with these two senators. I acknowledge their commitment to their cause. Whilst we didn't always agree on the policy results, I think that the energy and the commitment they brought were exactly the kinds of skills that we value in this place. I want to put on record my personal acknowledgement of the service they gave us and wish them well in their life after the Senate.




Senate adjourned at 19:35
