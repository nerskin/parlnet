"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2003-05-15,"—I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
That the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 2002 No. 337 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with these regulations.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 2002 (No.3), Statutory Rules 2002 No.337
The Regulations confer on the Employment Advocate the function of providing free legal representation to a party under specified circumstances. 
Paragraph 8AA(b) requires the Employment Advocate to form an opinion that `it is appropriate' to give assistance in the form of free legal representation. It was not clear what factors were to be considered in determining the appropriateness of giving this assistance and the Committee wrote to the Minister seeking advice on the criteria that would be used under paragraph 8AA(b). The Minister advised that the Employment Advocate had developed principles to assist with the determination of whether to provide free legal representation in some circumstances under paragraph 83BB(1)(g) of the Act and that he expected similar principles to those utilised under paragraph 83BB(1)(g) would govern the provision of free legal advice under the new paragraph 8AA(b). The Committee has written further to the Minister seeking an assurance that such principles would be used.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1

That the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2003 (No. 1), made under section 52A of the Farm Household Support Act 1992, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with this instrument. 
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2003 (No.1)
The instrument provides that recipients of the Sugar Industry Reform Assistance exit grants are not also eligible to receive a Farm Help Re-establishment grant. 
Item 1 in Schedule 1 introduces into the Scheme a reference to an instrument called the `Program Protocol for the delivery of Sugar Industry Reform Assistance'. The amendments also insert a postal address where copies of this Protocol can be obtained. However, the Protocol does not appear to be available on the Internet. This comparative inaccessibility is a matter of concern for the Committee, as the content of the Protocol is unclear. The Explanatory Statement provides no further information on this matter. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further advice about the content and accessibility of this Protocol.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-05-15,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003. The purpose of the bill is to address the consequences of the withdrawal of terrorism cover in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on September 11 2001. Soon after those shocking events, financial institutions and commercial property owners in Australia began making representations to the government and the opposition, saying that the market was failing to provide the cover they required. The banks warned that the provision of credit for major projects was in jeopardy. Such financing usually involves the taking of security over the property. Such financing needs to be addressed. The banks stated that, if that property were destroyed and there was no terrorism cover, they would experience substantial losses. Owners of commercial properties, including superannuation funds, also cautioned that they would suffer massive losses in the event of an attack. The lack of appropriate cover has also caused concern for the owners and operators of essential public infrastructure, such as power stations.
The bill implements the legislative elements of the government's scheme to address these problems that was announced in October last year. The bill involves two substantive elements. Firstly, it establishes a mechanism to ensure that insurance companies provide terrorism cover in specified circumstances. Clause 8 of the bill overrides clauses in eligible insurance contracts which exclude liability arising from terrorist incidents which are declared by the Treasurer. Eligible insurance contracts are essentially contracts to provide insurance cover for loss or damage to building and other tangible property located in Australia. It also includes cover for losses arising from business interruption caused by property damage and cover for public liability that arises from being the owner or occupier of property. The definition of `eligible insurance contract' will be refined by regulation but is essentially intended to capture commercial property and privately owned infrastructure.
The second key element of the bill is that it establishes the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, the ARPC. Under the government's scheme, insurance companies will have the ability but not the obligation to reinsure their liability to provide cover for terrorism losses with the new ARPC. Many of the details governing the operation of this scheme will be set out in the direction that will be made by the Treasurer. The ARPC, under direction from the Treasurer, would set premiums payable by insurers for reinsurance contracts. The government has indicated that reinsurance premiums payable by insurers would vary between two per cent and 12 per cent of the underlying commercial property premium based on risk and location. CBD property will be subject to higher rates.
Premium income will be used to build the reinsurance pool to something in the order of $300 million. This element of the scheme is known as pre-funding. It is estimated premiums will need to be levied for three years to capitalise the pool. In the event of an incident, the insurance industry would be required to bear the first $10 million in losses, with a maximum exposure of $1 million per company or four per cent of the gross fire/industrial special risk premium before having recourse to the reinsurance pool. In the event that losses from an incident exceed the resources of the pool, up to $10 billion is available through a commercial loan and government indemnity. These amounts can be recovered through increased premiums after a terrorist attack. The scheme is expressed to be temporary and is subject to review every three years.
Labor was concerned about a number of elements of the government's scheme and therefore asked the Senate to refer the bill for inquiry by the Economics Legislation Committee. The committee heard evidence of widespread market failure. While no witness was able to provide an example of a project that had been delayed or abandoned as a result of a lack of terrorism cover, there was evidence that financial institutions and property owners are faced with uncomfortably large exposures. It is clear that there is the potential for losses that could have a devastating impact on investment, employment and economic growth. 
There is currently some terrorism cover available in the marketplace. It is, however, very expensive and narrow in scope. In the case of one CBD building, the Australian Bankers Association reported that the inclusion of terrorism cover increased the premium by 450 per cent. Even then the policy only covered a third of the property's value. The Property Council described the cover that is available as `Clayton's cover'. It reported that exclusions meant that policyholders could not obtain cover for chemical or biological attacks and that policies typically covered only 25 per cent of asset value. Labor accepts that there has been market failure. The key issue for us and for several organisations that gave evidence to the committee inquiry is whether this scheme is the right solution to the problem.
It is important to note that the government did not start the process of developing this scheme with a blank sheet of paper. In May 2002 the Treasurer laid down conditions for government intervention. Most significantly, these included that any scheme must, firstly, maintain private sector involvement in the provision of terrorism cover and, secondly, allow for the re-emergence of a commercial market for terrorism cover. These considerations have fundamentally restricted the range of options that could have been considered in developing the scheme.
Unlike the government, Labor is not overly optimistic that a commercial market for terrorism cover will return. It is true that insurers did provide terrorism cover prior to September 11 2001. However, at that time terrorism risk was widely regarded as negligible in Australia. Indeed, it is likely that some insurers may not have explicitly priced for it, as the probability of an event and its impact was in fact too difficult to estimate. In their submission to the Senate Economics Committee, IAG, Australia's largest general insurer, argued:
... the probability and severity of losses from a terrorism event/s are not calculable in advance and therefore unsuitable for insurance or, indeed, pre-funding ...
The Insurance Council of Australia also agreed that the difficulty in pricing exposure meant that a commercial market for terrorism cover was in fact unlikely to re-emerge. Labor believes that such considerations do lend support to a post-funded model where a levy would be imposed on insurance premiums after a terrorist event. A post-funded scheme does have a number of attractions. Firstly, the community, which is already suffering under the weight of high premiums following the collapse of HIH and the current hard insurance market, does not incur any cost if, as we all hope, there is not a terrorist incident in this country. Secondly, it also avoids the administrative costs of establishing a pre-funded scheme for both the insurance industry and the Commonwealth. Thirdly, in the event that an incident occurs, the amount of money that needs to be allocated is certain and ascertainable.
Submissions from the Insurance Australia Group and the Western Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet both endorsed a post-funded model. A post-funded model is already employed or proposed in a number of similar contexts. For example, under superannuation legislation a levy may be imposed on superannuation funds where a fund suffers substantial losses as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. Support for post-funding can also be found in the report of the HIH royal commission. Commissioner Owen recommended the establishment of a policyholder protection scheme in the event of insurance company failure. His Honour stated that funding for this scheme should be provided through a post-event levy on all licensed insurers. This is a recommendation that the Treasurer has in fact already endorsed. Why should a different model be pursued for terrorism cover? 
Supporters of the government's scheme argue that it provides business with greater certainty and ensures that funds can quickly be paid out in the event of a terrorist incident. It is clear, however, that after nearly 20 months of uncertainty a major factor for the banks and commercial property owners is a desire to see a solution in place as soon as possible. They know that the government has done very little work on a post-funded scheme and that the rejection of this bill would involve a lengthy delay in the development of a new proposal. Labor understands their frustration with the slow pace at which the government has moved on this issue. Labor is extremely disappointed that the government did not explore a post-funded option more fully. Nevertheless, given the exposure being faced by entities that need terrorism cover, Labor is reluctantly prepared to support the government's scheme in order to bring certainty to the business community. However, I would like to make it clear that, in government, Labor will review the operation of the scheme and give detailed consideration to putting in place a post-funded model.
I will now turn to the issues which underpin the amendments that I will shortly move to the bill in the committee stage. A particular concern that Labor has with the pre-funding element of the government's scheme is the cost that policyholders will be forced to bear. While the Treasurer will give directions to set reinsurance premiums, the bill contains no mechanism to control the premiums that insurers will charge policyholders. Insurers indicated that they intend to charge premiums in excess of the cost of reinsurance in order to recover `administrative and other costs'. 
The government has no idea what premiums policyholders will be charged following the introduction of compulsory terrorism cover. Its initial explanatory memorandum was quite misleading on the subject, suggesting that policyholders would be charged no more than the cost of reinsurance for the insurance. Submissions by Royal and Sun Alliance and the Insurance Council to the economics committee make it clear that this will not be the case. On behalf of the opposition, I intend to move amendments to ensure that the ACCC has a role in preventing insurance companies from exploiting the fact that terrorism insurance is compulsory to boost their profits at the expense of policyholders. In seeking some protection for policyholders against price exploitation we are doing no more than upholding a commitment the government made in its explanatory memorandum. In that document the government pledged:
... to explore possible acceptable cost recovery arrangements for insurers in regard to reinsurance premiums charged by the Scheme.
Treasury officers informed the committee that no such work had been undertaken. Instead of doing what it promised, the government wants policyholders to have faith in competitive forces to act as a brake on premiums. Labor does not share this government's faith in the operation of competition in the insurance industry. We believe that there is a real danger that companies will use the fact that policyholders will be required to take out terrorism cover to dramatically increase premiums. 
Labor notes that in the recent Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 the government included a provision which requires insurers to offer medical indemnity premiums that are `reasonable'. If it is good enough for doctors to have this protection, Labor believes that it ought to be available to hundreds of thousands of small businesses who will be required to pay for terrorism cover. Recent experience leads us to be sceptical of the competitiveness of the industry. We are, for example, yet to see the benefits of competition in action in relation to public liability. Despite a range of tort law reforms being enacted by state and territory governments, public liability premiums continue to rise, as do insurance company profits. We are yet to see any of the promised savings being passed on to consumers.
The recent experience in the United States does not provide any basis for optimism  either. Following the introduction of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 2002, which requires companies to offer terrorism cover backed by government indemnity, it has been reported that some premiums have risen by over 100 per cent. Many people would suggest that the United States is a more competitive insurance market than Australia.
Labor is also not persuaded by the argument made by the majority committee report that the `appropriate cost-recovery arrangements' can be considered under the arrangements for the review of the scheme. We do not believe that policyholders should be required to wait three years in order to gain protection against potential rip-offs. 
Another issue that was raised during the inquiry concerned the requirement of compulsion. The Council of Small Business Organisations and the Association of Risk and Insurance Managers of Australasia said that their membership strongly opposed the fact that policyholders are required to take out cover. They argued that it effectively required those at low risk or those who were prepared to accept the risk to subsidise those who wanted terrorism cover. In our view the pre-funded scheme requires compulsion to operate effectively. Labor will seek to address the concerns of small business by empowering the ACCC to prevent price exploitation in relation to terrorism cover.
Clause 41 of the bill provides that the minister is to review the need for the operation of the scheme every three years. Labor is concerned that the bill does not presently contain any requirement that the report resulting from the review be tabled in the parliament or otherwise made publicly available. I foreshadow that in the committee stage I will move amendments to the bill to ensure that reviews of the scheme are subject to public scrutiny.
In conclusion, Labor accepts that the withdrawal of terrorism cover constitutes a market failure which could have a substantial adverse impact on the Australian economy. There is clearly a need for government intervention in this case. Labor does have concerns about the government's scheme and believes that the option of a pure post-funded model should have been more rigorously explored before this. Nevertheless, in the interests of giving business certainty, the opposition will support the bill, with appropriate amendments to protect policyholders from price exploitation.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-05-15,"—I wish to comment on the passage of the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003 as it now stands, following the amendments that were passed in the House of Representatives on 27 March. The bill was originally introduced in the House on 12 December last year and was passed with amendments on 27 March of this year. On 19 March, however, the Senate referred the bill to the Economics Legislation Committee, whose report was tabled during the current sitting period. It would appear that the government has decided to respond to some of the concerns that have been raised following the bill's introduction. While the amendments go some way to addressing the inadequacies of the bill—in particular, the desires of the insurance industry—it is still somewhat disappointing that the bill lacks more detail. I understand that the particulars of the scheme are to be left to the regulations. However, I want to record my concern and the concern of the Australian Democrats about what seems to be an increasing trend to leave the details of such important legislation to the regulations. 
The explanatory memorandum provides details about three options available to the government in running the scheme and accumulating the pool of funds. In particular, and without stating for certain its adoption, it highlights the benefits of option 3—that is, `Universal participation through compulsory provision of insurance and optional reinsurance with the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation', which is yet to be established. The bill would establish a scheme whereby the government provides insurance cover against terrorism. The bill deems all eligible insurance contracts to include terrorism risk cover, effectively rendering inoperative exclusion clauses for terrorism cover. Eligible insurance contracts are those that provide insurance cover for the loss of, or damage to, eligible property located in Australia.
The bill also establishes a statutory authority, to be known as the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, which will provide reinsurance cover to insurers for losses arising from a declared terrorist incident. It is intended that insurers seeking reinsurance will retain part of the risk. The retention, as set by the Treasurer, will be $1 million per insurer per annum and $10 million across the industry per event. Through the compulsory nature of the levy imposed, it is estimated that the reinsurance pool will total some $300 million. Since terrorism insurance cover will be deemed to exist in the contract, this would prompt insurers to increase premiums. As the inquiry highlighted, that has been a major criticism of the bill and is of great concern, especially to members of the small business community. The reason is that the insurance company would then be compelled to take out reinsurance with ARPC to fund the added risk that they are assuming. While the level of reinsurance to be paid by the insurance industry is capped, the charges payable by insurance increases are not. I note that the ALP are going to move a set of amendments to deal with that issue. I will come to that shortly.
I think we need to keep in mind the whole question of why and how this bill came about. In my view, the introduction of the bill and the impending scheme are essentially to correct market failure in the area of terrorism insurance arising from the events of September 11, 2001. Since that time, the availability of insurance cover for terrorism has been virtually non-existent. It is thought that this might lead to less financing and investment in the Australian property sector, primarily in commercial property, and of course it would have wider economic impacts.
According to the Australian Bankers Association, there is a risk that financiers will be unprepared to provide finance to some large projects or large-scale infrastructure if terrorism cover is withdrawn and the new assets are exposed to an uninsurable risk. Not only this, but also large financial and other losses are a threat where projects go ahead without this type of insurance. As a result of these risks, countries such as France, Germany and the United States have also implemented similar schemes to the one contained in this bill. 
In his second reading speech, the Treasurer claims that the scheme will be wound down when terrorism insurance becomes available in the insurance market in the general sense. Accordingly, reviews of the scheme must be conducted and a report prepared every two to three years as provided in part 4 of the bill. This begs the question: if the scheme is designed to be a temporary measure, what will become of the funds at the end of the scheme if a terrorist event is never declared? Three hundred million dollars is not an insignificant figure.
There has been criticism of the bill by some who will be captured by it and who view their risk of terrorist attack to be quite low. As the inquiry has highlighted, many in the small business community, especially those who are located in areas outside what might be seen as high-risk areas, feel that they will be subsidising the cost of insurance for damage from a terrorist attack for those in the higher-risk areas. Providing insurance is about taking a gamble; for the insurance industry, this gamble pays off enormously. And, while all of us are continually pumping money into the industry so that they assume our risks, if we do not make a claim we will never see those funds again.
I am sure that many here are aware, either personally or professionally, of the instances where getting a claim paid from an insurance company has been a completely draining process. While it is desirable for this government scheme to ensure legitimate claims are paid, governments are not corporations and, if no claims are made, I think that those in the community who have been affected by this scheme would expect that the funds be put to good use. I also hope the term `declared terrorist event' is not used by the government as a tool to reject otherwise legitimate claims.
Only premiums for reinsurance will be set by the body to be known as the ARPC, while the premiums set by the insurers will not be under ARPC control. Given the uncertainty of premium increases for affected contract holders, it makes it even more important that some good come of these funds if no claim is made. And there is no doubt that all who are present here today would be hoping and praying that this is the case and that we do not experience a terrorist event during the life of this scheme, or at any time, for that matter.
In the event that there are no declared terrorist events, a pool of funds valued at $300 million would be well spent if earmarked towards such things as the maintenance and improvement of heritage listed buildings; funding improvements to public buildings which house public galleries, museums and places of interest; funding to establish sites to be used to house a variety of worthwhile research projects; and investment in projects aimed at designing buildings that are more efficient and environmentally sound. At the very least, these funds could be used to increase practical security measures for our most vulnerable and to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks on public buildings.
As the Treasurer himself has acknowledged, this bill does not contain much detail about how the scheme will operate. While the Treasurer claims that much of the detail lies in the regulations so as to keep the scheme flexible, another interpretation is that the scheme itself lacks transparency. In relation to uncapped premiums, it is thought that the reinsurance paid by the insurance industry into the pool would vary, depending on the level of risk. Supposedly, between two and 12 per cent will be added to the premium price. As I mentioned earlier, some concern has been raised that insurance companies will engage in profiteering with the introduction of the scheme, given that the premiums that can be charged to policyholders will be uncapped. In light of this, the government must ensure that the ACCC is empowered to adequately monitor premiums to alleviate these concerns. I note the opposition's amendments on this matter and flag the Australian Democrats' support for those provisions. However, on the whole, the Australian Democrats support the passage of the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003 and we await the regulations that are to come forward, wherein we expect the government to keep to the spirit of the explanatory memorandum when working out the detail of the scheme.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-05-15,"—I rise to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2003 and to outline a number of concerns that I have with it. Whilst I accept that it is the view of the opposition that this bill should be supported—and we have had a very strong case put to us about why that is the case—I would like to give it qualified support. I see some real problems with the overall concept of it. The first problem I see—being from Western Australia—is that we are now looking at having a framework that makes insurance for dealing with terrorism liability compulsory across the board, when it could be an added impost to the cost of the operation of key assets within the WA community that have already negotiated their own arrangements.
As I outlined to witnesses during the committee process, one of the key places in Western Australia that is identified as a potential target for terrorism is not the CBD of Perth, it is not any of the multistorey buildings on St. George's Terrace; it is the township of Karratha and the infrastructure that goes with the oil and gas industry that is based in that town. For those of you who know anything about the operations of the oil and gas industry, the need for terrorism insurance or coverage for exposure to a terrorism type risk is something that that industry has taken into account for many a long year, particularly when you look at the key players in the oil and gas field, most of whom are multinational companies and therefore have exposure in the Middle East and elsewhere. We all know that terrorism has been a potential risk for a very long time for anyone operating in the Middle East.
When I outlined some of my concerns that this would be an added impost to businesses that already have their own arrangements, I was assured by some of the witnesses during the committee inquiry that, if the businesses have their own insurance, this will not be extra insurance cover they are forced to take out. My concern is that, within their internal costing processes, these businesses could have priced in to their operations the replacement cost for any exposed facilities rather than taken out commercial insurance—so it is part of their internal operations and there is no actual insurance. This could actually be an increased cost to their operations. It is an increased cost, I might say, at a time of potential decrease in oil prices. For the government to impose an extra cost component on the operations of those businesses when it is a highly volatile market anyway—we are constantly told about the oversupply of refinery capacity throughout the world—I think is a real concern for the future of that industry.
Another concern I have about the way the government has brought about this scheme is the cross-subsidisation that there will be because of this flat charge for all entities. Again, it goes to the compulsory nature of it. Because the property council and large property owners in CBDs have said they feel the need for the government to come up with a scheme because of the market failure—and I have absolutely no doubt about the market failure argument—this is going to be imposed across the board on small businesses and on everyone operating. If you operate a small business, say, in a place like Mukinbudin in Western Australia, you have to take out terrorism insurance whether you like it or not. It beggars belief that a small business operating in Mukinbudin could ever be at risk of any form of terrorism attack. It is a concern to me to have this added impost on small businesses, again brought to us by the government, without those small businesses actually having any discretion in deciding whether it is necessary or not. 
My third concern with this proposal is that we seem to have come up with just one model to address this market failure. As I have said before, I accept there has indeed been market failure. I remain to be convinced, given the nature of the reinsurance industry worldwide at the moment, that the market will ever recover to the level it needs to. Therefore, I accept that, if we are to have some kind of insurance coverage like this, it does need government intervention. In their haste—business and other commercial entities have been given an assurance about a start-up date—it seems to me that the government has only considered one possible model for the way this insurance coverage could be constructed. That has become what is known as a pre-event funded model where there is a levy right across the sector no matter what. In other cases and in other industries where there has been the need for market intervention for risk or what have you, there has been consideration given to a post-event funded model where, once the cost of the event to be covered by the insurance claim is established, the levy goes out throughout the sector. It is a model used in superannuation and in other areas.
It seems that in our haste to meet the 1 July start-up date, there has not been sufficient work done on looking at the different models of operation and what would be most successful in meeting the needs of our community. I think a post-event funded model is a much more attractive alternative. Obviously, with that goes some form of compulsion, but there is only compulsion after an event, and that compulsion is to address the cost of repairing the damage of that event. There are no up-front costs for an event that may never ever happen. In our haste to meet the deadline, I am really concerned that there has not been a wide enough examination of the different options. In fact, post-event funded models have actually been recommended by the HIH royal commission, which is a well-known royal commission in this place. It has also been strongly supported by some of the state governments.
Having placed on the record my concerns about what I think are the shortcomings of this legislation, I am happy to offer qualified support for this legislation. I accept that there has been market failure, and I accept that there are sectors of the business community that have identified a real need for immediate coverage for their own operational security and for their sector of the business community to prosper. I accept that. But I believe there need to be further safeguards placed within the legislation to try and address some of the concerns I have outlined. If we are going to have an added cost impost, particularly on small business or the like, it is incredibly important that we have sufficient pricing and competition controls within it to ensure that this impost is not just the subject of profiteering by different insurance companies now that they would have the capacity for government intervention and government subsidy. As that is a real concern, I am very happy to urge the support of Senator Conroy's move to devise a role for the ACCC to ensure that this is a robust scheme, that there is no profiteering by insurance companies and that, in fact, there is adequate protection for the small business sector. I think that is incredibly important. 
I agree with Senator Ridgeway about the importance for all concerned to see the regulations attached to this legislation as soon as possible. That was a recommendation in the report of the inquiry into this legislation. It is also important that the government be required to table the reports that review the operation of the scheme so we can be sure that this is not a cost deterrent to the operation of the business sector in our community, that it is the best model and that it is operating efficiently. That would allow us the scope to review whether we should change the operations of terrorism insurance.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-15,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is not a controversial bill. In 2002, the Commonwealth parliament passed counter-terrorism laws to create a range of offences relating to terrorist activities and to the financing of terrorist groups. The Commonwealth does not have any express powers over matters like terrorism or general criminal laws. Instead, it relies on a raft of indirect constitutional powers to enact the counter-terrorism laws such as the defence and external affairs powers. There are concerns that those powers may not provide a comprehensive base for the legislation. I can provide an example of this. The Attorney-General has stated that he is concerned that there may be gaps in the law when:
... terrorist activity was entirely state-based and did not have any Commonwealth element in it or foreign element in it ...
The leaders summit in Canberra on 5 April 2002 agreed that state constitutional references would be sought to support federal terrorism offences of national application. On 8 November last year the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General finalised the details of legislation to refer state constitutional power over terrorism to the Commonwealth in order to strengthen the Commonwealth's counter-terrorism laws. 
The bill that we have before us this afternoon will implement the agreement from the leaders summit and it will, in effect, re-enact the terrorism offences as Commonwealth provisions capable of operating nationally. However, now the offences will operate on a more secure legal basis following the referrals from the states. I do not expect that this will be a controversial bill. It is certainly a bill which has the support of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-05-15,"—I rise to again record the Australian Democrats opposition to the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. The bill re-enacts the various terrorism offences introduced last year as part of the government's package and suite of antiterrorism legislation. The purpose of this re-enactment is to provide for the referral of state powers to the Commonwealth to deal with these offences. In the absence of such a referral, this legislation would rely on a mixed bag of Commonwealth powers, and there is some concern that potential loopholes in these powers may prevent the Commonwealth from responding to a terrorist attack in some circumstances. For this reason, the summit of Commonwealth, state and territory leaders, convened on 5 April 2002, agreed to work towards a national referral of state powers on specific antiterrorism legislation. The majority of Australian states have now passed legislation to bring this referral into effect. If any state does not enact referral legislation, the Commonwealth will continue to rely on its constitutional heads of power when acting within that state. In the territories, the Commonwealth will rely on the territories power in section 122 of the Constitution and outside of Australia it will rely on its external affairs power.
We Democrats note that the states have referred to the Commonwealth both the text of this legislation and the power to amend it. We are pleased to see that such amendments can be made only with the agreement of a majority of states and territories, including at least four of the states. We Democrats also note that the bill will enable the concurrent operation of state laws relating to terrorist offences provided there is no direct inconsistency. We welcome the provision which prevents a situation of double jeopardy arising under these arrangements.
The Democrats opposed the introduction of the terrorism offences when this chamber considered the package of antiterrorism legislation last year. The original suite of bills was draconian in the extreme and represented, I believe, an ambit claim on the part of the government. The bills were, of course, substantially amended during their passage through this chamber and, as a result, radical improvements were made. However, even after these improvements, the Democrats were unable to support the bills. Our fundamental concern was related to the definition of a terrorist act and the Attorney-General's proscription power. The Democrats believe that the definition of a terrorist act was too broad and could potentially capture forms of political activism that were far removed from terrorism despite the exemption for lawful advocacy. 
With respect to the proscription power, the Democrats argued strongly that criminal behaviour should be punished but belief or association should not. We took the view that a more appropriate way to deal with this issue would be through prosecuting on the basis of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. We Democrats did, however, welcome the new requirement for the organisation to be identified by the Security Council in a decision relating to terrorism. The requirement placed some limitation on what would otherwise have been an arbitrary and a potentially very dangerous power.  
We take the opportunity this time to record our deep concern at the Attorney-General's recent announcement in the media that he intends to seek amendments to the Criminal Code which would remove this requirement, effectively reverting to the government's original model. This announcement confirmed the Democrats' concerns that once these new powers were introduced the government could potentially increase their scope. This was a possibility that greatly influenced our decision to oppose the original bills. Time and time again the government has sought to assure us that it will exercise these powers responsibly and will not abuse them or misapply them. Here we are a year later and the government is already signalling its intention to shed some of the safeguards that secured the passage of this legislation in the first place. I want to put clearly on the record now that, if legislation is introduced to remove the requirement for a Security Council listing in relation to terrorist organisations, we Democrats will oppose it.
On the issue of the referral of state powers, Democrats in state parliaments have voted against referral legislation. The reason for this opposition is best summarised by my South Australian colleague the Hon. Ian Gilfillan, who said:
In addressing the bill we must answer two questions: first, is the issue of fighting terrorism properly dealt with at a national level; and, secondly, do we have confidence in the commonwealth to deal appropriately with the challenges that terrorism presents? The first question is easily dealt with. Terrorism as we face it today is an international issue and, hence, the commonwealth is the most appropriate body to address the matter. The second question is more problematic. It is difficult, when the measures that are employed in an attempt to combat terrorism erode those values of our society that we are trying to defend against terrorists. 
Having considered the substance of the Commonwealth legislation, he then lacked the confidence in the Commonwealth to deal with the threat of terrorism appropriately. Right from the beginning we Democrats have opposed the offences contained in this bill. We believe that they represent a fundamentally flawed and disproportionate response to the threat of terrorism. We have voted against them at a federal level and we have voted against them at a state level. Again today we express our opposition to these measures.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-05-15,"—I would like to thank the Labor Party for its consideration of and support for the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. As the government has indicated—
—Rare praise.
—Rare praise indeed, Senator Faulkner—the bill is the central element of the Commonwealth and state legislative package to implement the April 2002 leaders summit agreement. The enactment of this bill will ensure comprehensive national application of the federal counter-terrorism offences enacted last year. I would like to take this opportunity to mention once again that last year's attacks in Bali have strengthened the government's resolve to complete this exercise as soon as possible. The Commonwealth appreciates the states' efforts in responding to the national need and referring the power necessary to support the enactment of the bill. The bill is part of the counter-terrorism package that delivers on the government's commitment to protect Australians against terrorism. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-15,"—This procedural motion is not unexpected. I did come into the chamber just a little before consideration of noncontroversial legislation was due to commence. At the time I did ask the Manager of Government Business in the Senate a pertinent question as to whether Senator Harradine had been informed that this bill was coming on for debate. The Minister for Health and Ageing would appreciate the significance of this because there are amendments standing in Senator Harradine's name. I have made attempts to contact Senator Harradine's office and I was concerned that his office, and perhaps the senator himself, were not informed of this. I think that when we change these procedures—which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do as long as all senators are aware of the change—we need to be satisfied that we are not disadvantaging senators in this place who intend to move amendments.
We also need to take account of the fact that there may well not be agreement on amendments moved in the committee stage of this bill. The motion before the chair, the procedural device, does not limit consideration of this bill just to the second reading debate. I would appreciate it if the minister could satisfy me as to the situation in relation to this reasonable point I have raised.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,17,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-05-15,"—I have just been advised that Senator Harradine was in a meeting and I have also been advised that Senator Harradine is happy for the bill to proceed. An officer of the Senate has checked that, not just our office.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-05-15,"—I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing indicated, when discussing the procedural motion relating to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, that Senator Harradine is unable to be here at the moment—he is in a meeting—but that he is happy for the bill to proceed. I am not in a position to ask Senator Harradine whether he is intending to proceed with his proposed amendments to the bill—maybe the minister might have some advice on that. The initial understanding was that the legislation would most likely be treated as noncontroversial legislation. The opposition position has been well known to the government. It was outlined in the other place yesterday when the bill was debated there that the opposition fully supports the legislation.
We support the legislation but we note that it has been sitting on the Notice Paper for quite some time. Indeed, the bill that we are debating now, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, originated as the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. It was introduced on 27 June last year and it has languished for all of that time. It has now been brought back into the parliament with amendments by the government essentially in response to a crisis that has just recently occurred with the Pan Pharmaceuticals matter. Everyone is aware that a major recall has occurred—I would venture to say the biggest single recall of pharmaceutical products, and probably of any products, in the history of this country. 
When I picked up a newspaper a couple of weeks ago and opened it up, I saw three full pages of an advertisement by the Therapeutic Goods Administration listing all the various drugs and products that were the subject of the recall. The advertisement was not in the Daily Telegraph either; it was in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian, the larger broadsheets. Not only did the advertisement take up at least three pages but also it indicated that there were probably still more products that may need to be recalled because the TGA did not have a complete list of those products on the shelves of pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets which might be affected by what had occurred with Pan Pharmaceuticals.
We are now in a serious situation, and it has become very clear by the minister having to move a procedural motion to deal urgently with the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 in response to this crisis. The particular details of the legislation have been well outlined in the debate in the other place and in the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. I do not need to go through those. We welcome the changes that have been proposed as a means to provide greater clarity and certainty for the industry, consumers and regulators. The bill amends the definition of `therapeutic goods'. It also rationalises various processes regarding preapproval and makes a range of changes to the penalty regime applying in respect of advertising offences under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I do not wish to take the time of the Senate at this point because our position is very clearly on the record—that is, we support the legislation.
I turn to Senator Harradine's proposed amendments. I questioned earlier, before Senator Harradine came into the chamber, whether or not those proposed amendments are still going to be proceeded with. No doubt Senator Harradine will inform us shortly. Our position is that the Labor Party, firstly, supports the bill. Secondly, the party does not support the amendments moved by Senator Harradine.
—I haven't moved anything yet.
—The amendments which you intend to move—I apologise, Senator Harradine. I am using the opportunity, while on my feet in the second reading debate, to deal with your proposed amendments as well. There are reasons why the Labor Party does not agree to those amendments: one, they raise practical problems; two, while we are sympathetic to the intent of the amendments—namely, to give consumers information on whether the products they are considering purchasing have been developed with the use of human embryos or human embryonic stem cells—we believe at this point that compliance with them would be extremely hard or impossible in some cases. We understand—and again the minister can confirm this—that the government is prepared to give an undertaking to oblige the TGA to report back within a month on options to address the issues raised in Senator Harradine's amendments relating to consumer and reporting concerns. These are concerns which the Labor Party shares and we look forward to receiving the government's options and proposals in that regard. The position of the Labor opposition is that we do not support the amendments. However, we also wish to indicate that we will allow our members a conscience vote on the amendments proposed by Senator Harradine. With that, I conclude my remarks.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-05-15,"—I indicate Democrat support for the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003. We note that it will broaden the scope of advertising and the regulatory power over foods and other products claiming to have therapeutic value, and will enhance existing regulation to increase quality control and the recall of products and will impose penalties on manufacturers and suppliers of goods. We do have some concerns, which we have raised with the minister. We understand the urgency of this legislation, given the amendments which deal with the Pan Pharmaceuticals issue, but we would like to have seen some reassurances from the government about the question of how appropriate it is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing to indicate who is a fit and proper person. We seek assurances from the government that, in the implementation of this act, that question will be given some consideration. We are also surprised that this bill is coming on right now. We would have liked to have had a little more time in which to consider those concerns. ",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-05-15,"—In the process of trying to discuss how we are in this situation and debating this bill right now, when I left my office five minutes ago we were in conversation with Trish Worth's office saying that we were not consenting to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 being discussed in `non contro', that we had concerns about the legislation, that we have been working on this issue with community groups who are awaiting legal advice so that we can continue to address their concerns about this legislation. This is an extremely important issue. We recognise the seriousness of the situation we are in at the moment with Pan Pharmaceuticals, the need to address that quickly and the need to make changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act. But given the seriousness of this legislation and the impact on the broad sector of the complementary health care industry—an industry that has been growing rapidly in Australia—we need to have the opportunity to discuss the changes and the amendments that the government has put forward. We received these amendments yesterday afternoon and are expected to be in a position to finalise decisions at this stage. We understand that other senators in this chamber were offered briefings on this issue as long ago as last week. No such briefings or opportunity to discuss these issues were made available to the Australian Greens. So we are not in a position to proceed with the government's amendments to this piece of legislation at this stage.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-05-15,"—I am not sure precisely where we are at this point. There had been negotiations over certain amendments I put forward. The reason the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 is before us today is the failure of drug companies to uphold standards we all expect and rely upon. I support the tougher stand and the tougher regulatory system for therapeutic goods. I agree with the ministers that we must protect public health and safety in relation to all therapeutic goods.
There has been a question that these types of complementary medicines are indeed less harmful than some of the prescription medicines that are around the place—but that is an aside. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Ms Worth, who said:
`It is imperative the community is able to have confidence that information available from all sources is valid, trustworthy and not misleading ...'
Under the proposed changes, drug companies will be forced to reveal on packaging exactly who made the product and where the ingredients came from. That is why I have drawn up amendments that also go to the importance of the consumer's right to know—a right significantly threatened by the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis we have witnessed these past few weeks. I am sure everyone in this chamber believes that this is a right that must be protected and upheld at all costs—that consumers must know what is in the drugs they take or are considering taking. 
The amendments that I distributed cover a specific pharmaceutical category so far not covered by any consumer right to know legislation or regulations, and about which there is great community concern. They would ensure that information was available with pharmaceutical products and in advertising for pharmaceutical products so that consumers could determine whether the pharmaceuticals were tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. Consumers could then make a fully informed choice as to whether or not they wished to use the pharmaceutical product. This is consistent with the TGA's interest:
The TGA is interested in fostering a consumer-focused approach to the labelling of consumer medicines in Australia.
Consumers have a right to know whether pharmaceuticals they are considering using were tested, created or manufactured using human embryos or human embryonic stem cells. The only way for individuals to protect themselves from inadvertently using a product with which they have an ethical problem is for manufacturers to disclose, in a way that is accessible to all potential consumers, what was involved in making that product.
Those who conscientiously oppose destructive research on embryos want to be able to easily identify drug products created using this research through the introduction of a system of clear product identification. Many people consider some practices so deeply wrong that it would be devastating to them to discover they were consuming products involving those practices and contributing to the resultant financial benefit to the manufacturer as well as to the product's continued production. For example, in a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, Diabetics for Ethical Treatment argued:
It is unethical, and an insult to the integrity of persons with diabetes, to pursue research into therapies which involve harming or destroying human beings, including human embryos.
...	...	...
We firmly believe that an attack on the dignity and well-being of any group of human beings is an attack on human dignity itself. It is a profound insult to people with disabilities and illnesses, including diabetics, to presume that we are willing to accept therapies developed at the cost of other human lives.
We should remember that consumers who are not concerned about the use of human embryos can still use products made in this way if they want. This amendment in no way restricts anyone's ability to purchase a pharmaceutical product under the normal requirements. What it does do is enhance the rights of consumers who have ethical objections to using products that involved the destruction of human embryos—no more, no less.
Last year the parliament was given a conscience vote on the issue of embryo research. Consumers deserve the right to exercise their consciences too. They deserve the right to full information so that they can make an informed choice. Individual consumers are certainly not in a position to know what has been involved in the production of drugs and have limited capacity to find out—particularly if manufacturers refuse to disclose this information.
Currently there are no known pharmaceutical products which contain ingredients derived from embryos or embryonic stem cells. But the Research Involving Human Embryos Act passed last year allows embryos or embryonic stem cells to be used in the testing, creation or manufacturing of products. It is important to enact a consumer information provision for the protection of consumers before products come onto the market, if that is at all possible. 
The amendments that I have been foreshadowing are different to those I moved in December last year, though they of course have similar provisions. I want to indicate that, during the debate on the Research Involving Human Embryos Bill 2002, the minister said that people do not have to use those drugs if they do not want to. But that is the whole point. We will have that discussion. I know, Minister, that you understand that and were concerned that I was raising this in the wrong area last time. I think Senator Evans made the point that he was not against what I was seeking to do but that it was not appropriate to the legislation we were debating at the time and should be dealt with on the basis of an amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act. Obviously, that is what I have done on this particular occasion by taking the first opportunity to do this.
I invite honourable senators to consider—whether they agree or not with research on human embryos—that this is a matter of consumer choice. Surely it is as simple as that. There are whole lot of other areas where information is required by governments in respect of products. For example, in the case of genetically modified foods the manufacturers have certain requirements. And I think Dr Kemp mentioned ethanol—that people should know what is going into the fuel tanks of motor cars. But this is not about fuel tanks. If consumers have the right to know what goes into their fuel tanks, they surely have the right to know what is going into their bodies. That is what I thought the Therapeutic Goods Administration were all about. We will soon see whether they are about that.
This measure has been discussed around the traps on the basis of material that has been provided to honourable senators. I put it to honourable senators that this is clearly a consumers' rights amendment and it will be up to the parliament to deal with it on that basis. I understand that the minister will be making a statement on this. I support the measure thus far, though there are concerns. I am aware that concerns have been expressed by the alternative medicine producers and I would like to hear the minister's response to those concerns.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-05-15,"—I want first of all to thank the Senate for agreeing to discuss the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 at this time. I know it is not a normal procedure, but we have a very long break coming up and the situation that my parliamentary secretary and I were confronted with was not run-of-the-mill. It has meant that we have needed to proceed more swiftly than might otherwise have been the case. I appreciate honourable senators' cooperation in this matter.
The bill enables a greater clarity, consistency and transparency of decision making relating to the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods and the food-medicine interface. The amendment for the definition of `therapeutic goods' in subsection 3(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act will enable the Therapeutic Goods Administration to continue to regulate goods that are presented for therapeutic use but are subject to a food standard as a therapeutic good. This will provide the necessary clarity and certainty for consumers, the industry and regulators in relation to some goods at the food-medicine interface. 
The changes to the two advertising provisions in the therapeutic goods legislation are divided into two categories. The first relates to the remaining advertising offences included in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations that are to be removed and inserted into part 5(1) of the act. By transferring the offences from the regulations to the act, the regulators are ensuring that a level playing field is created by having consistency in penalties imposed for breaches of the advertising offences. The second category relating to the advertising provisions concerns the removal of advertising provisions from the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and inserting similar provisions into the therapeutic goods legislation. This will ensure consistency in the regulation of advertisements for therapeutic goods. 
The changes included in the government amendments are intended to secure stronger protection of public health and safety in relation to all therapeutic goods, and they represent a balanced response by this government to the Pan Pharmaceuticals incident. The changes will clarify and tighten the responsibilities placed on sponsors and manufacturers of therapeutic goods to ensure that the products they make or supply measure up to appropriate internationally recognised quality and safety standards. The amendments will also equip the TGA with greater powers to take appropriate and timely action to remove substandard or suspect products from the marketplace.
The amendments will enable every manufacturer involved in the manufacture of each batch of a therapeutic good to be identifiable so that this information can be readily obtained by the TGA. Sponsors and manufacturers will be required to report to the TGA problems they become aware of about the products they manufacture or supply, including information about any adverse effects resulting from the use of their products, and information about other deficiencies found in their product. The government amendments to the bill will also extend the circumstances in which goods that fail to meet standards may be recalled from the market, and when their sponsors or manufacturers will be required to notify the public about the grounds for recall.
Greater incentives for companies to comply with standards designed to ensure the safety, quality and effectiveness of therapeutic goods have been added. New offences include an offence for falsifying or destroying any document or record relating to the manufacture, testing or evaluation of therapeutic goods. Furthermore, the level of penalties for a range of existing offences will be increased by these amendments. In addition, the government amendments indicate that the person obtaining a licence needs to be a fit and proper person. There has been consultation with all sectors of the medicines industry and they are generally supportive of the measures. The two industry associations that represent the complementary medicines industry—the Australian Self-Medication Industry and the Complementary Healthcare Council of Australia—have indicated their support for the measures.
With regard to the issue that Senator Harradine has raised, I know of his commitment and concerns. The fact that we have asked for this to be considered later does not diminish my regard for his concern about this issue. I appreciate his agreeing to not put his amendments so that we can deal with the other issue, which is particularly urgent. But that does not decrease in any way my commitment to address the issues he has raised in those amendments. In relation to the proposals to amend the Therapeutic Goods Act, I acknowledge not only Senator Harradine's concern, but also that some consumers might have concerns about knowing whether pharmaceutical products contain human embryonic materials or have been tested on them. The government has referred the proposed amendment to the TGA for urgent consideration and advice. I have asked the TGA to report to me within a month. I will table the TGA's report in the Senate and include an analysis of the regulatory options available to meet Senator Harradine's proposal. I appreciate his cooperation in this issue. 
 (Senator Hutchins)—I remind honourable senators that, under a sessional order agreed to on 20 June 2002, after the second reading of this bill I shall call the minister to move the third reading, unless any senator requires that the bill be considered in the Committee of the Whole.

Given that this question is more than 70 days overdue, I think it would be helpful if such questions could be more speedily answered. It was taken on notice by Senator Ellison more than 70 days ago.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-05-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today relating to the 2003-04 Budget.
What we have seen again today is another pathetic attempt to rewrite history. Forty-eight hours after the budget, it is an orphan. You have already had the Treasurer stand up and say, `We know this one's not much cop, but there will be more tax cuts next year.' It has taken less than 48 hours for them to roll over and acknowledge that Senator Vanstone was dead right. We have had Senator Alston stand in this chamber today and mislead the Australian public. He talked about giving back all of the bracket creep. Let me quote Mr Peter McDonald of the Taxpayers Association of Australia. He has said that the latest tax cuts would be eroded again as soon as inflation pushed wages higher. Until then, he said, `any claim bracket creep has been paid back is a lie'. It is `a lie'—that is from Peter McDonald from the Taxpayers Association of Australia. He says that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, was forced to lift the tax rate thresholds because of the coalition's 1996 election promises. He says: 
When Mr Costello introduced the New Tax System, he said the average Australian would never pay more than 30 cents in the dollar in tax.
What have we got? The big claim that 80 per cent of Australians would be in that 30 cents in the dollar category. What has happened? On the Treasurer's own admission, it is down to 75 per cent now and it is going lower. That is what the Treasurer knows, that is what Senator Minchin acknowledged yesterday and that is what Senator Alston is trying to cover up.
This is a budget that is designed to try and distract the Australian public, by waving a measly $4 in front of them, from what the government are trying to do with Medicare and education. They are describing them as reforms. These changes that are being put forward by the government represent John Howard's ideological obsession with transferring the cost of health and education from the government to families. The government's Medicare package will destroy Medicare and put an end to bulk-billing for families. Under the changes, doctors will be allowed to bulk-bill concession card holders, but they will be given the green light to impose a copayment for everyone else and charge what they like. That is the hidden agenda; that is what is really going on here. Two out of every three Australians who do not have a concession card can say goodbye to bulk-billing. That is what is going on here; that is what the government are trying to distract you from. These changes mean just one thing: Australian families will pay more for a visit to the doctor. The $4 a week tax cut will be swallowed over a year by just five visits to a doctor who does not bulk-bill—just five visits.
Australians will also pay more for their children's education. Families will face a difficult choice—pay more in HECS or take out loans to pay for their children's education. Families face up to a $32 per week increase in HECS debt or up to $125 a week in loan repayments. Australians already owe more than they earn. Household debt to household income has risen to 130 per cent under this government as families struggle to make ends meet. Higher loan repayments will add to the debt burden on Australian families. The government wants to slug these same Australian families an extra $5.50 each every time they buy essential medicines. These same families will on average get $400 less in family benefits this financial year due to the government's benefit clawback—one of those other little horrors this government keeps trying to hide. These higher costs for families, imposed by any one of these changes, will far outweigh benefits from the tax cuts, even before they were described as the milkshake and sandwich tax cuts.
This budget is also remarkable for the supposed reform priorities that have been ignored. The Treasurer previously has said, `Superannuation needs to be reformed.' Yet, after eight budgets, he has done nothing about it. Back in 2000 he said that the system was too complicated—too many rules, too many different taxation regimes. Three years later, there is no reform package. The government has also offered talk instead of reform in the area of water. Just recently, Mr Howard claimed there are few more important issues to our nation than water reform. What was in the budget? Nothing on water reform.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-05-15,"—I find that the hypocrisy coming from the Labor Party this week is nothing short of breathtaking. The Labor Party have been saying that they want this government to provide tax cuts. I can understand that because when in government they never gave any. What they dished out budget after budget was an increase in the hidden taxes. The wholesale sales tax continued to go up and up and people did not know about it. It is interesting to think that the Australian Labor Party—the party that professes to be the friends of the battlers, could not care less about the battlers getting some money back. It is interesting because battlers generally battle to pay the bills. The Australian Labor Party does not believe it is important to give a battler $300 a year to pay for whatever they might want to pay for. Whether, as Senator Vanstone said, $300 a year might pay off the average mortgage a year and a half earlier at a saving of around $12,500, whether $300 a year might pay for a few months of electricity, whether $300 a year might pay for the insurance on their motor vehicle or whether $300 a year might pay for their home contents insurance, the Australian Labor Party do not care. They prefer to see them go without, and they prefer to have a Labor government that just continues to tax, tax, tax, tax. They know that they continue to tax. It is interesting because, as Senator Vanstone said in question time today, Mr Swan—one of the lesser lights in the Labor Party in the other House—said in March last year:
If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget.
Isn't that interesting that Mr Swan from the Labor Party said that last year. Yet, this year, Mr Crean and the rest of the Labor Party say that it does not matter. I find that quite amazing; it is quite contradictory. In 2001, he criticised the government for not having:
... a clue what a dollar a week or $2 a week or $4 a week means to someone who is battling.
That is what he accused this government of in 2001. Here we are in 2003 and the whole of the Labor opposition have changed their tune. Now they do care, but they do not think it is enough. They are never going to be happy, are they? They are never ever going to be happy. They keep on saying, `We want tax cuts. We want tax cuts.' They get tax cuts and they do not like them.
Seven years into opposition and the Labor Party do not have one single, solitary policy. If they did, we would be able to compare this budget with their tax policy. We would be able to compare this budget with their health policy. We would be able to compare this budget with their education policy, with their defence policy and the list goes on and on. Seven years into opposition and there is not one single policy with which this budget, brought down last Tuesday, can be compared with that of Her Majesty's opposition. I think that is pretty disgraceful, but it just goes to show what a brain drain there has been in the Labor Party since the likes of Barry Jones left. No wonder there are people who are contesting the leadership all over the place. There are more contestants for the leadership than people who know what they are doing over in the Labor Party. This is just remarkable—seven years into opposition and we cannot look at a Labor Party policy. Yet all they can do is come in here and complain about the battlers being given a tax cut—complain about nine million Australians being given a tax cut. That is pretty appalling. They should be applauding a tax cut for nine million Australians, instead of whingeing, whining, carping and criticising, which is all they do—oppose, oppose, oppose.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-05-15,"—We are not complaining about a tax cut for nine million Australians; we are complaining about the duplicity of the government in taking with one hand and giving with the other so that Australians are worse off. This is the smallest tax cut in history from the highest taxing government in history. Taxes have gone up by more than this government is giving back and therefore Australians are worse off. The sums are easy to work out. The budget papers say that wages over the next 12 months will rise by four per cent. A worker on $40,000 a year—and here is the example that proves the lie to what has just been said by the Liberal Party in this chamber—facing a wage hike of four per cent over the next 12 months will pay $480 more in tax and the tax give-back by this government will be $208. At the end of the year that worker in the average wage bracket in Australia will be $272 worse off. That is why this budget is a fraud. That is why this budget has vanished without trace in the media.
Oops! Sorry! Except for the sandwich and the milkshake analogy that Senator Vanstone has introduced into the lexicon and, by the way, except for the outrage that Australian university students and parents who want their children to go to university in Australia in the future express because, under this government, the cost of getting to university in this country in the future will mean it will only be for the rich. It will not be for the average Australian. University costs have been hiked. The only other thing on the budget screen which is not the positive bounce that the government wants is that Australians see through the fraud of destroying Medicare under the so-called reforms that the government has proposed on health. Medicare is an Australian icon. Medicare offers universal health protection. This government wants to remove that as a right of ordinary Australians. We see through that and so do the voters. That is the reason why this budget has got the thumbs down.
Under this budget, bracket creep—the increase of wages due to inflation pushing workers into higher tax brackets—means that higher taxation continues and the clawback by this government of wage and salary earners' dollars into the tax pool is greater. Under this budget, the cost of health and visiting the doctor will be greater, quite apart from wrecking Medicare. Under this budget, university education will become more expensive. There is nothing in this budget for the millions and millions of Australians who do not go to university but who go to technical colleges and aspire to be tradespeople or to acquire a technical skill. There is nothing in this budget at all for them. Further, there are cuts to expenditure on research and development. This country was once proudly a clever country. This country now is destroying its intellectual capital by reducing funding for research and development, removing that clever country tag, dumbing down R&D in this nation, sending our scientists offshore and making sure that we are not building a pool of intellectual and smart capital for the future and for our development.
This budget will see pharmaceutical costs rise. The worrying thing is not just that in this budget pharmaceutical costs will eat into the household budget, where families increasingly under health treatment require better and more expensive drugs, but that what this government is negotiating with the United States in their free trade agreement is nothing short of the destruction of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme per se. That means that the prices of pharmaceuticals will rise to the market level that the multinational pharmaceutical companies wish to charge rather than to an affordable level under the PBS. Under this budget there are cuts to the family tax benefits as well. 
In regional Australia the mining industry is in uproar because there are higher costs for diesel fuel for mining companies and explorers. There is nothing in here for roads, nothing in here for rail. There is insufficient drought funding in this package. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-05-15,"—I stand to commend the government with respect to the budget that has been handed down. It is probably one of the most remarkable efforts in recent political history to, at the end of the day, come up with a $2.2 billion surplus and a $2.4 billion tax cut on the back of a very severe drought and a war costing about three-quarters of a billion dollars each. The Treasurer, Peter Costello, should be commended and congratulated on an outstanding performance.
We still have strong economic growth at 3.25 per cent. The good news for the Australian people is that we have now paid $63 billion of the $90-odd billion of the Labor debt that we inherited in 1996. That frees up money to spend on health, education and welfare instead of going in interest payments into this big black hole. 
—Whose black hole was it?
—Good question. Whose black hole was it? It was the ALP's black hole or Mr Beazley's black hole. The debt as a proportion of GDP is four per cent compared to the US where it is 40 per cent and Japan where it is 80 per cent. It really is quite remarkable. If Mr Beazley were still the Treasurer we would probably still have that black hole and no doubt it would be far bigger than what it is.
—He is coming back.
—He is coming back. That is the big question in the quiz going on in the Labor Party at the moment. Who is going to win the prize? We do not know. We have had the lowest interest rates in 30 years. We have drought assistance and one million jobs have been created since 1996.
There has been a reference to the PBS by Senator Cook. I congratulate Senator Kay Patterson for the work that she is doing to make the PBS more sustainable. We want a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At the moment the concession card holders pay only $3.70 and the general patient pays $23.10, or no more than that. As Senator Patterson has said—and it is on the public record—the cost to the taxpayer on average is $80 per prescription. That is why I am absolutely thrilled that from 1 August the full cost, the real cost, will be on the packet and on the bottle along with the government subsidy—or, putting it another way, the taxpayer subsidy. That is why we are looking for a sustainable PBS. Each month costs are going up by $50 million, an enormous amount of money, and it is blowing out to nearly $5 billion each year. We are saying that we want a modest increase in copayments, and these are being blocked in the Senate by the opposition parties.
In Tasmania, for example, we use 9.4 prescriptions per year per head of population compared to the national average of 7.9. Last year 4.43 million prescriptions were bought in Tasmania, costing $135 million. But the users paid only $20.3 million of the cost and taxpayers had to pick up the remaining $114.3 million. For every dollar that the consumer put in, the taxpayer came up with $5. As a wealthy nation we need to be caring and generous but we also need to be responsible with taxpayers' funds. That is exactly what we have done in this budget. That is why I am proud to stand in support of our health initiatives in particular—Medicare and our public hospitals. 
I want to bring to the notice of the Senate that the Treasurer in Tasmania is Dr David Crean, the brother of Simon Crean. He is doing the smoke and mirrors trick with regard to the Australian health care agreement, saying that there is a $40 million shortfall under the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister and Senator Kay Patterson. He is wrong. He has his facts wrong. There will be a $220 million increase under our proposal over that five-year agreement. That is over a 30 per cent increase on the status quo and it is a 17 per cent real increase on the status quo. That will decrease waiting lists in Tasmania. Those on waiting lists can be assured that under this proposal—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-05-15,"—The higher education reform package which was announced on Tuesday will cut a swathe of destruction through Australia's universities and their national research capacity. If you look at the statement on science and innovation put out by Minister Nelson and Minister McGauran, for instance, table 2 indicates that the total expenditure increase for the major Commonwealth research agencies is $69 million. This is in a budget of $1.372 billion. Sixty-nine million dollars does not even cover the cost of inflation. If we were to examine the total Commonwealth support as a percentage of GDP, we see that in 1996 it was 0.76 per cent of GDP and, according to this government statement, it is now 0.68 per cent. That is a decline in research investment by this government as a percentage of GDP.
Not content with that, the government also now wants to move on our internationally renowned public research agencies such as the CSIRO. It has decided to establish a task force to examine `greater integration' between public research agencies like CSIRO and the universities. This is a fait accompli. We now know that Dr Nelson has pre-empted this task force review by announcing the merger of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville with James Cook University. On top of that, we find out that Minister McGauran has made it very clear that Mr Don McGauchie will head up this new review—Mr Don McGauchie of the National Farmers Federation fame. Mr Don McGauchie of the waterside workers dispute fame—of Patrick fame. Mr Don McGauchie has a long history of involvement with this government, and I think his views on these issues are quite clear. As I say, this is a fait accompli. An agenda has been established by the cabinet to establish a rationale for the integration of our research agencies and our universities to establish alternative funding models for the CSIRO and to force the amalgamation of various units of the CSIRO with sections of universities at a regional level. We know the reason for this. We know that there is a real danger that the CSIRO will be smashed in this process. 
This is the price of the so-called reforms, but it is not the only price. We see in the university sector that there are devices being pursued by this government which will divide this society into clear winners and clear losers. We see there are obvious winners and losers in the policies that the government has been pursuing until this point. If you look at the statistics, the four top universities, the four big ones, already account for over half the annual operating surplus of the sector as a whole. The other 34 universities make do with the rest. If you look at research expenditure alone, the same four universities account for 40 per cent of all the research funds. The top eight universities get nearly 75 per cent of all the research grants handed out by the Australian Research Council. The 30 or so also-rans have to share 25 per cent of these funds amongst themselves. If you look at the top eight universities in this country, they have 35 per cent of all the enrolments and 50 per cent of the revenue and almost 75 per cent of the cash and investments. This is a government that says there is no diversity. There is huge diversity. There is diversity between the winners and the losers. The 13 regional universities will have to share 25 per cent of the enrolments but they receive 20 per cent of the total revenue and 13 per cent of the operating results. They have only 11 per cent of cash and investment. These same 13 regional universities have over one-third of the whole sector's debt, and these are the ones that are now being told that they have to opt out of research.  
We see here a policy where competition has gone mad. It is quite clear that the government wishes to establish a whole new regime of contestability of funding for universities and research agencies. That is what the establishment of these reviews, mapping exercises and various other inquiries are about. I say that those decisions have already been made. The inquiries are being established to justify those decisions. The government says that the dead hand of bureaucracy will be removed from the universities. We are noticing, though, that new contracts will be imposed on the universities, which go to the issues of staffing, industrial relations, control of students, control of research and control of teaching. This is the most interventionist government we have ever seen with regard to universities. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-05-15,"—I seek leave to make a short statement in response to a Senate order to produce documents.
Leave granted.
—The first statement is on behalf of Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing. This order arose from a motion moved by Senator Allison which was agreed to by the Senate on 14 May this year. It relates to the most recent application documents from the Australian Grand Prix Corporation to the federal government for exemption from the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 on the grounds of economic hardship and the documents detailing the government's reasons for being satisfied that the case for economic hardship has been met.
I wish to inform the Senate, on behalf of Senator Patterson, that the government is unable to respond in full to the order at this stage. Documents relating to the order are still being examined. I would like to request an extension of time until 16 June 2003, which I believe is the next sitting day. This will give the Australian Grand Prix Corporation time to consult with contractual third parties to identify those sections of the documents which may contain sensitive commercial-in-confidence information.
However, on behalf of Senator Patterson, I am able to lay before the Senate today the following documents, which I hope will be of assistance to Senator Allison in her pursuit of this issue: minute no. M02005650, seeking agreement to exempt the 2003 Grand Prix as an event of international significance under section 18(2) of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992; a letter to the chief executive officer of the AGPC advising him of the outcome of the application; and a gazette notice dated 17 July 2002 specifying the 2003 Australian Grand Prix as an event of international significance that would likely be lost to Australia without this specification. 
The second statement is once again on behalf of Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's October 2002 report requested by Senator Allison is the draft eighth edition of the Australian Immunisation Handbook that was released for public consultation in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. I table a copy of the draft handbook. It should be noted that this version of the handbook has been modified in light of the comments received during the public consultation process and following the National Health and Medical Research Council's independent review of the handbook. The draft handbook has been revised in accordance with the review comments and was reviewed by the Health Advisory Committee in May. The handbook is scheduled for presentation to the council in June for endorsement and subsequent release. In response to the second part of Senator Allison's notice of motion, there is no National Health and Medical Research Council report on the new Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's recommended vaccines of March 2003.
The third statement relates to an order following a motion moved by Senator Allison and supported by the Senate on 14 May. It related to expressions of interest in Defence land for sale at Point Nepean. I wish to inform the Senate that the government is unable to respond to the order at this stage. Documents relating to the order are still being examined. I am advised that the government will respond to the order as soon as possible.
Finally, I will now make a statement on behalf of Senator Minchin, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Once again, it is in response to an order from Senator Allison which was agreed to on 14 May, relating to the Basslink project. I inform the Senate that the government is not able to respond to the order at the moment. The documents relating to that order are still being examined and I am advised that the government will respond. However, that will not take place today. On behalf of Senator Minchin, I undertake that that will take place as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX: TOBACCO ADVERTISING</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-05-15,"—by leave—This statement is made on behalf of the Minister for Science and it addresses the order arising from Senator Lyn Allison's motion and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja's notice of motion. The National Store Advisory Committee, a group of technical experts advising the Commonwealth on site selection for the national store, has provided the Minister for Science with advice on sites for consideration. The advice is in the form of an internal advice or working document. Such advice has been traditionally regarded as confidential and the government has declined to release such information. This practice will be followed with respect to this advice.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-05-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I am quite surprised at the government's response to this issue. This is about the government's decision to establish a shortlist of sites for an intermediate waste dump for nuclear material. This is a decision that the government has now postponed for over a year. We are being told that the government cannot, in response to this order, provide a list of sites because it is `ministerial advice'. In effect, that is the proposition we have been told—that this is advice to the minister and therefore we are not entitled to see it.
It has been a year since this government postponed this decision. I think we are entitled to know what action the government intends to take about the storage of about 500 cubic metres of very dangerous materials. We on this side of the chamber take the view that there ought to be a national store and we have maintained that position throughout this debate, but we will not be able to argue a case logically and coherently within the community if we do not know what the government is intending to do and, in particular, what sites it is proposing for the establishment of this store. What is really critical here is that the national regulator who deals with the nuclear industry, Dr Loy, who heads up ARPANSA, has made it perfectly clear that the licence to operate the new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights will not be given when that project is concluded, presumably in about two years time, unless there is a clear and unequivocal coherent national strategy for the disposal of nuclear waste.
The government has committed $500 million of capital to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. It is the major source of the nuclear waste that is the subject of this return to order. The government is endangering that project by its failure to respond to the clear advice to the regulator and the nuclear industry in this country. The government has known for a very long period of time what its obligations are, and yet it delays and delays and delays—in just identifying a shortlist. A whole series of other processes have to go on for the establishment of a site after that shortlist is revealed. Frankly, it is just not good enough for the government to say that it will not tell the parliament what that shortlist consists of. It is just not appropriate to argue that this is a matter of ministerial advice. 
We are looking here at a matter of political expediency, where it is not interested in taking this parliament into its confidence in dealing with a difficult public policy issue. Government secrecy on matters like this does not help public debate. We know how hard it is going to be in terms of the arguments to and fro on the issue of the storage of nuclear waste. We have said all along what our commitment is in terms of a national store. We believe there should be national facilities. This is a Commonwealth responsibility. You cannot leave this sort of stuff lying around in sheds as we have at the moment. You cannot have nuclear waste being treated in the contemptuous manner in which this government is treating it.
A shipment of materials was supposed to have gone to France last year. If I recall rightly, $11 million was allocated for that project for reprocessing of spent fuel rods. The shipment was not sent, because it appears there were serious `operational reasons', as they call them, for that not happening. We now have a problem where the Argentinean government is clearly having difficulty in getting the contractual arrangements in place and the constitutional changes required to actually allow for reprocessing in that country. The government is running out of options when it comes to the issue of nuclear waste. It must establish its proposed shortlist for sites for this facility. It will not do to try to come in here and suggest to us that, because it is ministerial advice, we are not entitled to have a look at it. That excuse has been well worn. You have had over 12 months to do something about this, and you continue to fail. I am totally dissatisfied with the government's response to this return to order.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE REPOSITORY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-05-15,"—I am very pleased to have back here this afternoon the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002], which was first brought before this chamber in 1998. At the outset, I thank all involved, including Senator Ian Campbell, opposition members, the Democrats and the Independents for facilitating the bill being brought before the Senate this afternoon. There is a general hope that the bill will be read a third time. Because it is a Constitution amendment bill, I flag the need for a rollcall under the provisions of the Constitution and our standing orders at the end of this debate. Senators might be aware that, if we have a third reading vote, there will be a rollcall of senators because, under the provisions of the Constitution, an absolute majority is required for a Constitution amendment bill to proceed at that stage.
As every election approaches, 1½ million teachers, posties and other public servants who might like to stand for parliament have to decide whether it is worth resigning their jobs in order to do so. Australian citizens who are also citizens of another country—that is, they have dual citizenship—have to go to great lengths to repudiate that second citizenship if they want to nominate for election here. Section 44 of the Constitution is the problem. It stops anyone who holds `an office of profit under the Crown' or who is a citizen of another country—that is, they hold dual citizenship—from nominating for this parliament. That dual citizen component prevents another five million or so Australians from standing for parliament.  
There is a question mark about pensioners who arguably may be said have an office of profit under the Crown—that includes disability pensioners, old age pensioners and, indeed, unemployment benefit recipients and recipients of other benefits—as to whether they would be able to stand. There are between five and seven million Australians who, under the current constitutional provision, cannot stand for their own parliament. That is because the Constitution was written in the 1890s—and we are now in the first decade of the 21st century—and things have moved a great deal since then.
Section 44 deprives the federal parliament of a huge pool of talented potential politicians. At every recent election it has caused trouble and expense as someone unwittingly falls foul of the Constitution. Everyone agrees that section 44 should be changed. All parties supported a Greens motion in the Senate to that effect in October 1996 and called on the then government to bring forward a proposal for constitutional amendment. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, reporting on the 1996 election, recommended:
that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election—
which would have been 1998—
a referendum be held on a) applying the `office of profit' disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination—
so it would not catch people up with nomination—
and b) deleting section 44(i) on `foreign allegiance' and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.
That was recommendation 39. Then the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined in detail sections 44(i) and 44(iv) of the Constitution and recommended that a referendum be held to amend them. The government's response to those recommendations has been supportive. It states:
Subject to the qualifications outlined below, the government would support amendments of subsections 44(i) and (iv) of the Constitution to overcome the shortcomings identified by the Committee.
It went on to say:
... it accepts that constitutional and legislative action is the only realistic way in which to overcome these shortcomings. 
That quotation is from the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which was titled Aspects of section 44 of the Constitution.
However, no bill for a referendum has been forthcoming. It is now on the record that on 3 December 1998, when I first brought this bill before the Senate, there was a debate in private members' time but no conclusion was reached as a result of that debate. I have now brought the bill forward. We greatly hope that because this is such an important matter—and I have no doubt that it will have the support of the Australian populace at large—we ought to put it to the people so that the referendum can be held so that the millions of Australian citizens effectively get their full citizenship. It is an extraordinarily important component of an egalitarian country that no-one should be deprived of the ability to stand for his or her parliament and to represent her or his people. This bill is the simplest possible way of amending the Constitution to fix the problem. No-one disputes that.  
I am grateful to the opposition and to Mr McClelland in the House of Representatives and his staff for suggesting a minor amendment which I have circulated and which is in line with the aforesaid committee's recommendation to government back in 1996 and which simplifies the bill before the chamber this afternoon. I commend the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-05-15,"—The opposition welcome this opportunity to debate the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]. This bill was last debated in the Senate in December 1998. Senator Brown is to be commended for raising it. As we did on the earlier occasion, the opposition will again be supporting this bill as a constructive step forward in the campaign to reform section 44 of the Constitution. The bill would amend section 44 in two main ways. First, it would amend subsection (i) to allow an Australian citizen with dual citizenship to stand for, and be elected to, parliament. The current prohibition on a person who is `under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power' would be repealed. Since the bill was last debated, the High Court determined in 1999 that Heather Hill could not be elected to the Senate because she was a `citizen of a foreign power'. In that case, the foreign power was the United Kingdom.
Today, more than four million Australians hold dual citizenship, which is up from about three million in 1986. It has long been possible for Australians to acquire dual citizenship in a number of ways. It can happen without their knowledge, such as when another country's laws automatically confer citizenship upon them. Last year, after many decades of community debate, this parliament passed laws which provided for the first time that an adult Australian citizen will not lose their Australian citizenship if they take action to acquire the citizenship of another country. Australians now recognise that dual citizenship is a way of life. They would expect the Constitution not to impose arbitrary restrictions on their capacity to participate in Australian democratic institutions. Senator Brown's amendment recognises this fact. However, Australians would also insist that all members of this parliament have a clear and undivided loyalty to the Australian nation. In Labor's view, it is essential that any change to section 44(i) be accompanied by safeguards to prevent divided loyalties. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended in 1997 that parliament enact legislation determining the grounds for the disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. That or a similar recommendation must be implemented as part of any reform of section 44.
The second amendment proposed by the bill would disqualify holders of judicial office, and other public offices declared by the parliament, from standing or being elected to parliament. This would replace the current disqualification in section 44 of a person who `holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth'. That part of section 44 is intended to ensure that the members of parliament do not hold an office that is incompatible with their legislative responsibilities to the parliament and the Australian people. However, the language of the subsection has produced nothing but uncertainty, particularly in areas of the public sector. Senator Brown's amendment is broadly consistent with the 1997 recommendations of the House of Representatives committee, although it would, in the opposition's view, make more sense to repeal the final paragraph of section 44 altogether than to make the limited amendment to that paragraph proposed by the bill. 
A recent instance—no doubt fresh in Senator Brown's mind—in which section 44(iv) attracted comment was the election of Mr Michael Organ as the member for Cunningham in October last year. On 19 December, the Australian Financial Review carried an article entitled `Employment cloud over Green MP' which speculated that Mr Organ, who continued to be employed as an archivist by the University of Wollongong after he nominated and was elected, might be disqualified from parliament because he held `an office of profit under the Crown'. In that article, constitutional lawyers discussed inconclusively the extent to which universities are controlled by the executive of government. I make no observation about Mr Organ's circumstances, but there can be no doubt that the current federal government has sought to exercise an unprecedented degree of control over the internal affairs of universities, in particular over the employment conditions of their research and teaching staff.
In this week's budget we saw the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, copy his predecessor, Dr Kemp, and tie university funding to workplace reform—a euphemism used by this government for kicking unions out of the workplace, pushing employees onto individual contracts and restricting their right to bargain collectively over their conditions of employment. Even the Federal Court was moved to observe in April last year that Dr Kemp's policy `may fairly be regarded as having little to do with the proper functioning of universities in this country and rather more to do with the government's industrial relations agenda'. Sadly, the words of a wise judge were not enough to prick the dormant Labor conscience of the ambitious Dr Nelson. It is reasonable to suggest that as long as this government continues to try to control the employment relationship between universities and their staff, a constitutional cloud will hang over any university employee who seeks election to this parliament. We can hardly call ourselves the clever country if our Constitution forces clever Australians to avoid the risk of standing for election if it means quitting their jobs. The government's meddling in our universities simply adds to the weight of the argument for the reform of this particular section.
I should stress that the opposition strongly believes that, before these proposals are put to a referendum, further consideration should be given to the precise wording of the amendments and also to what other constitutional reforms are appropriate to go to a referendum at the same time. A referendum demands a large public investment of time and attention, not to mention money. It is an opportunity that should not be squandered on just one issue; if we were going to use a referendum, then it should also include those issues that require constitutional reform.
Once again, it is a matter of regret that this bill is being sponsored by a private member rather than by the government. History demonstrates that referenda stand little chance of success unless they are supported by all parties and the government assumes a role of responsibility and leadership on the issue. Perhaps it is the pervasive influence of the Prime Minister in the coalition parties, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, since the referendum on the republic, the government has been asleep in a hammock on constitutional reform. The opportunity to debate these issues once again in the Senate is welcome. 
While Senator Brown is currently leading the push to reform section 44, proposals to amend section 44 have had a long history in our constitutional debates. As far back as the constitutional conventions of the 1890s and during the first Electoral Act debate in 1902, aspects of section 44 and the electoral laws relating to it were the subject of extremely vigorous debate. Section 44 has been the subject of Senate reports in 1981 and in 1988, and the final report of the Constitutional Commission recommended a number of changes to section 44 itself, including making Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for office, major reform to the office of profit provisions, and a wide range of other reforms such as making unsoundness of mind a ground for disqualification and removing the bankruptcy provisions as included in section 44(iii). The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, in their post-election reports, regularly remark on section 44. In 1994 the committee remarked:
The most effective means of removing the uncertainty over the office of profit disqualification would be to remove section 44(iv) of the Constitution.
It is a grave matter that I am sure the senators from the coalition are interested in. In 1996 section 44 reached national prominence following the court case that led to the removal of Miss Jackie Kelly. Following the subsequent by-election, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution initiated by Senator Brown which stated:
That the Senate—
(a) notes:
(i) the High Court ruling of 11 September 1996 that the 1996 federal election result in the House of Representatives seat of Lindsay was invalid, and
(iii) that section 44 of the Constitution impedes many Australian citizens from standing for Parliament, including citizens holding dual citizenship, public servants and certain others who may be holding an office of profit under the Crown; and
(b) calls on the Federal Government to respond with a proposal for amendment.
The report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters following the 1996 election recommended:
that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election, a referendum be held on a) applying the “office of profit” disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination, and b) deleting section 44(i) on “foreign allegiance” and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.
In July 1997 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs investigated aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, making similar recommendations.
Section 44 clearly has had both a colourful and long career in this house and in the other place as well. Clearly, there is still a lack of necessary willingness by the government to do anything about it. Senator Brown's bill, which is the subject of today's motion, proposes changes to section 44 of the Constitution which describes disqualifications from holding federal parliamentary office. It is time that this government took note and used it rather than allowing this debate to be had again. This debate was also held in 1998. I did not have the opportunity to participate in it then but I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in it now. It is an important section that does need amendment. It is a significant issue that should be addressed and one that this government has had ample time and opportunity to address, but it has failed to act. ",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-05-15,"—I would like to congratulate Senator Brown for raising these very important constitutional issues. The issues that are raised by Senator Brown in the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002] reflect some of the constitutional and historical tensions that still have not been played out in this nation, in particular the growth of the influence of the state and government on the lives of citizens. Also, and perhaps even more importantly, there is the influence on those people who can be elected to federal parliament—it affects the pool of people who are eligible for federal parliament. So these are important issues, and it is a very important thing that Senator Brown has done. Certainly these issues are worthy of debate in the Australian Senate.
There is no doubt that the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the qualifications or, indeed, the disqualification of members of parliament, particularly subsections 44(i) and 44(iv), have their shortcomings. There is no doubt about that all. Much has changed, as my friend Senator Ludwig said, since the 1890s, and our constitutional founders could not have been expected to understand the rise of citizenship rights and the influence of government on the lives of every Australian. In essence, this bill seeks to clarify the position in relation to dual citizenship under section 44(i) of the Constitution and those who hold offices of profit under the Crown in relation to section 44(iv) of the Constitution.
Let me commence with section 44(i). Even though it may be in archaic language, I think the principle still holds true. Section 44(i) is based on the principle that members of parliament must have a clear and undivided loyalty to the Australian community. It attempts to avoid both actual and perceived conflicts of interest that may flow from any allegiance or loyalty owed to another nation-state. It does embody the particular considerations that prevailed at the end of the 19th century in Australia. At the time our Constitution was drawn up in the late 1890s, there was no concept of Australian citizenship; we were simply British subjects and aliens. Despite the different social and political context of the late 1890s, the policy on which section 44(i) was based remains valid—that is, that parliamentarians must not be subject to undue external influence that could prejudice the performance of their duties on behalf of members of the Australian public.
A person having allegiance to a foreign power could be unduly influenced by that power. That, again, is the principle behind section 44(i). As Senator Ludwig said in his eloquent address, section 44(i) has been interpreted on several occasions by the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. The court has held that the election of a person who was not an Australian citizen at any material time during the election is void. Of course, we will remember the case of Senator Wood in 1998. Odgers throws some light on the critical legal question here. At page 154, Odgers states:
Paragraph (i.) of section 44, relating to adherence to a foreign power, has been construed by the Court—
that is, the High Court—
as relating only to a person who has formally or informally acknowledged allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power and who has not revoked that acknowledgement. In relation to persons who have dual nationality—
that is a big issue in this country; we will get to that— 
the question is to be determined by whether the person has taken reasonable steps to renounce a foreign nationality, and what amounts to the taking of reasonable steps depends on the circumstances of a particular case.
We all remember the cases of Sykes v. Cleary and, of course, the would-be senator Heather Hill, elected at the 1998 federal election.
That is what the court has said. Senator Brown is right: there are real problems with section 44(i). Why? It is because section 44(i) does not make clear what actions or omissions will result in disqualification in circumstances involving dual citizenship. What is the test? It is open, it is vague and it is uncertain. Reasonable steps at least must be taken to avoid foreign associations of the kind covered by that subsection. However, the reasonableness of any particular course will depend on the circumstances of the case and cannot always be predicted in advance. Before I go on, I will relate this to an aspiring politician. People are uncertain when they run for political office as to whether they will in fact qualify. Because of that uncertainty and the number of people holding dual citizenship in this country, the pool of people that can run for political office is smaller and diluted. That is a problem for our democracy. The issue of dual citizenship and the way a prospective member of parliament deals with that issue will be very important. Moreover, the country of dual citizenship might also be very important. Some countries make it impossible or virtually impossible to renounce citizenship. It is often unclear to prospective members of parliament what they need to do.
This is particularly important given this parliament's recent passage of legislation that in effect encourages dual citizenship. In that context, this is a big issue. Allow me to be specific. For example, what do the words in section 44(i) `under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power' mean? I will give a clear example: my brother served in the French Foreign Legion.
—What was he running away from?
—Probably from me, Senator Murray. Is my brother's service in the French Foreign Legion a direct form of allegiance to a foreign power? Perhaps it was. Perhaps it is clear that when he was serving it was a form of allegiance. I understand that. When my brother left the French Foreign Legion, did he have any residual allegiances to another nation-state? That is the question. Is there, in effect, a retired list for the French Foreign Legion? If there is, what did his oath of allegiance mean, and what did his contract of employment say? My point is that it is unclear.
—Once you are a member of the legion, you can become entitled to become a French citizen.
—I take Senator Kemp's interjection because it is a good one. My brother's entry to the French Foreign Legion gave him, in effect, residual rights to become a French citizen and therefore a citizen of the European Union. Does that mean he was under an acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power? You can see the point, Mr Acting Deputy President. It would be uncertain and therefore difficult if my brother wanted to join me here in federal parliament.
Secondly, what do the words `entitled to the rights and privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power' mean? Even if someone has renounced their citizenship of a particular country—for example, of the United Kingdom or the United States—in many cases residual rights might remain. What happens if you have a right to a British pension or a United States pension or a pension from the French Foreign Legion? Is that a residual right? Under the words of the Constitution, is that a `right or privilege of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power'? I do not know the answer to that and that is why it is a very interesting question. 
Importantly, what about Australian citizens who are not dual citizens but, because of the laws of other nations, may have a right to apply for dual citizenship which would ordinarily exclude them under section 44(i) of the Constitution? For example, many millions of Australians have a right to apply for British citizenship because they have a parent who is a British subject, or they may be able to apply for Irish citizenship. As I stand here now I wonder whether I might even qualify for Irish citizenship. But you see the point, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, and it is a serious point. Is that a right and a privilege of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power? Is that a residual right? I am just asking the question and I think it is a fair question. No doubt some of my republican friends sitting on the other side of the chamber do not like the word `subject' and would prefer `citizen' but I think that is perhaps one of the less important aspects of the debate so I will not enter that debate.
I will move on now to the second part of Senator Brown's bill, which relates to section 44(iv) and which embodies the principles that the executive and the legislature should be separated and that the executive should not be in a position to unduly influence the legislature. Who would ever believe that the executive tries to unduly influence the legislature? Who would ever think that the executive tries to unduly influence parliament? What an outrageous thing. 
Section 44(iv) also seeks to prevent citizens from simultaneously holding two offices which could lead to a conflict of duties. Again, section 44(iv) has a very respectable constitutional history. In the 18th century, the British parliament was concerned that the Crown would use its powers of patronage to suborn members of the House of Commons and thereby undermine the independence of the House of Commons. That principle is fair enough. We may not agree with the language, and the fact that problems have been raised is right, but the principle is fair.
Section 44(iv) is intended to prevent the gaining of control of the legislature if a large number of members of parliament, of office holders, appointed by the executive had a disproportionate control over members of parliament. That is the problem. In a sense, we do not want members of parliament under the patronage of the executive, given jobs by the executive, and therefore subject to undue influence of the executive. That is a fair principle.
As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs stated in its report of July 1997:
The provision is concerned with the ability of the parliament to hold the executive to account and therefore it is necessary to ensure that enough members of parliament are free from the influence of the Crown to achieve this.
All honourable senators would agree with this principle.
The second principle fundamental to section 44(iv) is that some offices are incompatible with membership of the parliament. The House of Representatives committee report of July 1997 stated that incompatibility can arise in two ways: the first was a risk of conflict of duties involved in attempting to satisfy the demand of both offices and the second was that some offices, for example judicial offices, are considered to be so sensitive that if the holders of such offices became embroiled in political controversy the offices themselves may be damaged. 
Section 44(iv) is highly problematic. I want to tell a little story about how it operated in my case. I was a full-time academic in Queensland working for a university. I remember that the question was raised, `Brett, do you hold an office of profit under the Crown?' The principle here is this: it was perhaps okay in my case because the particularities of my preselection and order on the Senate ticket meant I was very likely to be elected. However, let us say I had a slim chance or a fifty-fifty chance; I would have had to resign from a tenured position at university to run for parliament. Even then you might say that that is fine. However, I could not get legal advice one way or another as to whether a tenured academic at a university holds an office of profit under the Crown. The advice I was given was absolutely equivocal. I sought advice from law firms and friends who were barristers and no-one could tell me with certainty whether or not I held an office of profit under the Crown. In my particular case, I resigned and was fairly confident of being elected given the particularities of my case. However, if I had been running for a marginal seat, I could not have resigned. You cannot just leave a tenured position, whether in the Public Service, at a university or whatever, and run for a seat, lose and then try to get back in. That would not be very easy.
The point is—and, again, I have to emphasise it—that section 44(iv) reduces the pool of people eligible to run for parliament. That is problem. In a sense, it inhibits our democracy and makes it much more difficult to attract people from the public sector and more broadly, and that is the problem with it. I have plenty of other points to make about section 44(iv), but I want to conclude with perhaps some problems with the process—not with the principles you have raised, Senator Brown, because I have to say that I largely agree with you. 
There are, of course, problems with a referendum. All of us know—we are all politicians here—the problems with referendums. We know we have to have bipartisan support otherwise it simply will not get through. Even with bipartisan support, it still might not get through. I think we all accept that. Not only are section 44(i) and section 44(iv) highly problematic; so is section 44(v). Again, it is very difficult to know exactly what it means. 
In short, the matters of principle raised by Senator Brown are valid. I think, however, that when the Constitution was first drafted the principles were correct. But somewhere in the last 100 years the state has become much bigger. The corporate state developed by our friends in the Labor Party—where you have big unions, big government and big business all intertwined like some sort of large octopus—makes it impossible to have the classic liberal distinction between public and private. That is why `office of profit under the Crown' these days is nearly a meaningless expression. There are contracts with government. There are people who work in universities, schools and elsewhere. And the fact is that they should be able to run for public office or, at least, there should be some device that enables them to come back to their former jobs in any case. 
In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Senator Brown for raising these issues. I think they are valid. But I do think that the issue of constitutional change is broader than this; there are problems indeed in implementing these changes. I thank Senator Brown for raising these issues.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-05-15,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]—and even I cannot invent an acronym for that long title. This bill has three elements that intend to alter the application of section 44 of the Constitution with regard to the disqualification provisions affecting those who stand for public office. I must say before I get into the body of my remarks that I thought Senator Mason's analysis was both apposite and entertaining.  
Firstly, the bill would delete the prohibition enshrined in section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution that a person could not seek election to the parliament if that person were a citizen of another country or owed an allegiance of some kind to another nation. The bill proposes to replace this with a simple requirement that all candidates for political office be Australian citizens—an eminently sensible view. Most senators know that section 44(i) of the Constitution has long provoked litigation—the leading case is still Sykes v. Cleary No. 2 of 1992. 
The section was drawn up at a time when there was no concept of Australian citizenship, when Australian residents were either British subjects or aliens. I have always liked the word `aliens'—it has that out of world approach. I once came across the bureaucratic use of the word. A friend of mine was born in South Africa, resided in southern Rhodesia, as it was at the time, and had taken up citizenship there. He came to the notice of the South African government, who thought him undesirable. So they took away his South African citizenship based on birth, then proclaimed him an alien and deported him, which I always thought was a very cunning ploy. Anyway, he survived the tale.
Back to the section: it was designed to ensure that the parliament was devoid of aliens, as so defined at that time. The Democrats accept, however, that the sentiment of that section—that only Australians should be eligible to stand as representatives for the federal parliament—is a valid and a continuing one. That is not to say that section 44(i) of the Constitution as it currently stands is the most appropriate and adapted to achieving that end; rather it contains notions such as `any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power'. 
Again, as an aside, I had cause to ask the Clerk for his opinion on the oath that we all swear to the Queen of England, who is also the Queen of Australia. As usual his advice was intriguing, but his conclusion was that we were not breaching the Constitution. These concepts are obviously subject to disparate and perhaps dangerous interpretation by judges. Is it to be the case that some future member will lose their seat because while in office they have been made an honorary citizen of another country, purely as part of the diplomatic process? Then there was the case of the Foreign Legion, which I must say was interesting. Such a result would, of course, be an absurdity.
Further, in the context of the current debate over the eventual move to a republic, such reference to a foreign power does bring the oath that each member and senator takes upon assuming his or her seat into apparent contradiction with the existing constitutional provision. Senators will recall that the oath requires members to swear that they will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and her successors according to law. On a strict reading you would think that that was an unequivocal declaration of `allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power', as prohibited by section 44(i). 
As it currently stands, section 44(i) is wholly unsuited to achieving its aims for the reasons I have outlined above and for those that other speakers have outlined. Like many sections of our Constitution, it has lost its workability a century after its drafting. The proposed replacement in the bill for this section—that the qualification simply be that a person must be an Australian citizen—is sound. However, we should take account of the valuable work that has been done in this area by various parliamentary bodies in assessing whether the present bill is sufficient.  
In July 1997, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs produced a report recommending that section 44(i) be replaced by a provision requiring that all candidates be Australian citizens. It went further to suggest that the new provision empower the parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members in relation to foreign allegiance—that is, the committee acknowledged that there are some situations, such as where a Prime Minister holds dual citizenship, that may cause concern to the Australian people. A provision leaving the door open to parliament to put in place some better expressed requirements with respect to dual citizenship would seem a sensible recommendation.
I further note that the Constitutional Commission in its final report in 1988 recommended that subsection 44(i) be deleted and that Australian citizenship instead be the requirement for candidacy, with the parliament being empowered to make laws as to residency requirements. Going further back, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1981 report entitled The constitutional qualifications of Members of Parliament recommended that Australian citizenship be the constitutional qualification for parliamentary membership, with questions of the various grades of foreign allegiance being relegated to the legislative sphere. I think that, too, is an eminently sensible view.
It is therefore clear to us, especially in view of the multicultural nature of Australian society and especially in view of the recent changes to citizenship and dual citizenship—which all parties welcomed—that contemporary standards demand that Australian citizenship be the sole requirement for being chosen for parliament under a new subsection 44(i), with a residual legislative power being given to the parliament to deal with unique cases that may arise from time to time.
The second element of the bill deals with the office of profit under the Crown—that is the issue of subsection 44(iv). Again, this section featured in the Sykes v. Cleary litigation. The bill proposes to delete subsection 44(iv) and substitute a requirement that only judicial officers must resign their positions prior to election, as well as empowering the parliament to legislate for other specified offices to be vacated. Quite frankly, I have long believed that the office of profit under the Crown provision is more offensive than the Australian citizenship provision, simply because it excludes so many people.
Subsection 44(iv) has its origins in the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 in the United Kingdom. Its purpose there was essentially to do with the separation of powers, the idea being to prevent undue control of the House of Commons by members employed by the Crown. Obviously, times have changed, even though the ancient struggle between the executive and the parliament continues to this day. Whilst this provision may have been appropriate 300 years ago, the growth of the machinery of government has meant that its contemporary effect is to prevent the many hundreds of thousands of citizens employed over the years in the public sector from standing for election without resigning their office and therefore without any real justification. My own party and my own state of Western Australia at the 1998 election is an example: there were 14 lower house seats there, yet seven potential Democrat candidates were unable to stand due to their unwillingness to resign from their public sector positions. There are of course now 15 seats. 
The Australian Democrats have a long history of trying to rectify this part of the Constitution; in fact, it is a 23-year history. In February 1980—23 years ago—former Democrat senator Colin Mason moved a motion in this chamber which resulted in the inquiry I referred to earlier by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs into the government's order that public servants resign before nomination for election. We have sought to alter section 44(iv) four times through the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualifications of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1985, the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualifications of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1989, the Constitutional Alteration (Qualifications and Disqualification of Members of the Parliament) Bill 1992 and the Constitutional Alteration (Electors' Initiative, Fixed Term Parliaments and Qualification of Members) Bill 2000. We have also covered the issue extensively in both our 1996 and 1998 federal election minority reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. None of our very practical bills have yet been allowed to go to the vote or to be debated to the stage where they could go to the other house. I am hopeful that at least this bill will make it that far. I am even more hopeful—perhaps it is a vain hope—that the government might consider dealing with it on its merits.
I further note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997 recommended that subsection 44(iv) be deleted and replaced by provisions preventing judicial officers from nominating without resigning their posts and other provisions empowering the parliament to specify other offices which would be declared vacant should the office holder be elected to parliament. Subsection 2(2) of the bill in its current form will not achieve this. While some offices, such as those of a judicial nature, must be resigned prior to candidacy, no provision is made for other offices to be declared vacant upon a candidate being successfully elected. It would be absurd, of course, if public servants could retain their positions after having been elected to parliament. It is essential that a mechanism be put in place declaring vacant certain specified offices upon their holders being elected.
The third element of the bill seeks to delete entirely the last subsection of section 44. I am pleased that this section has been amended to be aligned with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997. It must be noted though that the changes proposed in this bill incorporate only a selection of the recommendations made in that report. In my opinion—and our opinion—it would be ideal if the bill incorporated all or most of the committee's recommendations.
These issues under section 44 have been debated for decades. I think there is general consensus among all political parties and probably among all the Independents that this situation needs to be rectified. The government should take a position of leadership and deal with this issue in time for the next federal election. At some time and in some place, governments of the day need to attend to this one and I really cannot see the Australian people resisting these sorts of changes. Maybe I am ignorant of the likely arguments to be thrown up opposing it, but I cannot see that this sort of change would be that difficult these days. In conclusion, I indicate that the Democrats will support the bill and the Labor amendments to the bill.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2003-05-15,"—Achieving constitutional change in Australia is particularly difficult as it requires not only a majority vote but a majority of states to vote in favour of it. It is fairly clear to me that it is very easy to distort any proposal for constitutional change. It is very easy to run scare tactics. It is very easy to demonise any prospective change.
My first involvement in support of a constitutional change was only as a very minor functionary in 1967 when the then coalition government proposed two constitutional amendments. The first was on recognising Aboriginals as properly constituted Australian citizens, and that romped in. The second was to break the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives. We had got into a situation where it was quite obvious that the House of Representatives would benefit from enlargement, but a lot of people did not want to see the Senate enlarged at the same time. This was as a result of the 1957 inquiry which a lot of notable liberal jurists and also Gough Whitlam were on. In effect, I watched that campaign being destroyed by the DLP, who had a very simple message: don't vote for more politicians. It appealed to all the lowest, basest instincts that they could muster. And they won. A small political party was able to knock over what was a very rational political change. The lesson we have learnt is that it is exceptionally hard to get constitutional change through in Australia, no matter how logical your case is.
What has really evolved in the last 25 years? The only chance of constitutional change is if a coalition of the Liberal and National parties in government puts that change forward and is supported by the Labor Party. It never happens in reverse because we find that the opportunists opposite always oppose any Labor proposal for constitutional change, no matter what it is. They think that is what their job is because they are in opposition. They do not think in broad national terms.
—Oh!
—`Oh!', says the minister at the table. In 1974 you opposed a certain constitutional change. You then put up a similar change in 1977 to be supported, and when we put it up in 1988 you opposed it. Well I remember that debate here because Senator Chaney took a full hour to try to explain why they had double-flipped so often. When I got up and pointed that out to the chamber I got a very vicious message from the switch here from Fred Chaney's mother, criticising me for pointing out these double standards. So I remember the debate exceptionally well. But that is the reality of constitutional change: unless it is proposed by a conservative government and supported by Labor it has no chance whatsoever of going through.
Should this piece of legislation moved by Senator Brown come to pass, the reality is that we are not going to have a referendum costing $50 million to resolve problems of section 44 of the Constitution. It is just not going to happen and, if we did, it would get defeated. It would get defeated because the public would say, `Why are you spending $50 million and dragging us out on a Saturday afternoon on these technical matters?' I am afraid that that is the reality of it. But, at some stage in the future, when a government puts a package of reasonable constitutional amendments—not ones that do not attract a massive partisanship—and attaches a further referendum on this subject it may well go through. Therefore, these debates today and debates in the future around these issues are quite essential.
But I suspect that what will happen with this legislation is that it may well pass today. It will go to over to the House of Representatives and—guess what!—it will never be heard of again. But that is more a condemnation of the undemocratic nature of the other house these days—that is not a partisan comment; it has been made as irrelevant by the Labor Party when in government as it has by the Liberal-National parties. It is not a parliamentary chamber anymore. It is just a show trial; it is just a place where executive dominates and there is no independence of thought whatsoever. I think we are a bit better than that. I do not want to put too big a gloss on the Senate—let us not get too Senate chauvinistic in these things—but at least you get a little more in this chamber. 
These matters have been looked at over the years. They were best looked at by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported back in 1981. In fact, it was the first Senate report I ever read, because I arrived here in July 1981 when it was tabled. People like Senator Durack and Senator Gareth Evans and others—it was a very high-powered committee—wrote quite a brilliant report. Interestingly enough, they wrote it themselves. These days, we do not often see a Senate report written by senators. It is usually drafted by the committee and amended and polished by senators, but this one was virtually written word for word by the senators themselves. It did deal with this vexatious question of office of profit. This has plagued this parliament in its interpretation for many years.
We are not allowed, of course, to criticise High Court judgments, so let me congratulate the High Court on the unique cleverness it has had in interpreting this particular section of the Constitution! It takes a great mind to come up with such an obtuse interpretation of these particular matters as they have over the years. You have to be particularly devious to interpret section 44 in the way that they have. Of course, the first big test case, to my knowledge, was the Webster case in 1975. This was when Senator Webster basically outed himself, I think, and said that a company he was involved in had contracts with the Commonwealth. This was referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, constituted in the High Court.
There are some remarkable aspects of that case. Firstly, Chief Justice Garfield Barwick monopolised the whole proceedings. Instead of having a sitting of two or three judges, he did the whole case himself—he allocated it to himself. So you have a former Liberal Attorney-General judging a National Party member—I would have thought that that would have worried the National Party more than anything else! Nevertheless, he did it all by himself and came up with one of the most convoluted and disgraceful judgments that has ever been handed down in the High Court. It is one which we should take no account of in terms of precedence. Nevertheless, he found that Senator Webster had not breached the office of profit under the Crown provision. Looking back in modern day terms, I think I might also make the judgment that Senator Webster had not breached the office of profit section. But I would not ever do so on the bases that Justice Barwick proffered in his judgment, which were highly technical and, in fact, probably wrong at law and a total misrepresentation and misinterpretation of the intention of the founding fathers as revealed in the convention debates.
One of the next cases we had was that of Mr Phil Cleary. He won the seat of Wills in a by-election and, some months after, was challenged—I think it was by Sykes, but I am not sure; I think it was by a losing candidate that got about one per cent of the vote—and deemed to hold an office of profit. He had basically not taught in a secondary school for years; he was on leave. Yet the High Court said, `No, you are disqualified from office because you still held an office of profit under the Crown.' The main intention of this office of profit thing was not whether he could influence events but whether a government could have a hold over him. So he was dismissed, but it did not interrupt his political career for a particularly long time, because an election was coming up in 1983. 
Then we had the classic case of Senator Ferris. Senator Ferris was elected to this place in March 1996, I think, and was due to take her place here on 1 July 1996. She was then employed under the members of staff act as a ministerial adviser to Senator Minchin and had not only a salary but a travel allowance and a number of other emoluments associated with that office. A very perceptive person in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services Division picked this up and had to warn the minister that Senator Ferris had probably breached section 44 of the Constitution.
These matters came to my attention and were raised in this parliament. I do not think any particular blame should be placed on Senator Ferris, who probably was inexperienced in these matters. How the government and Senator Minchin managed to miss these matters remains a mystery to me today, because it shows a degree of ineptness not normally associated with that minister. Nevertheless, he was in a position to have known better. The end result of all that was that this chamber eventually had to determine at some stage to refer this to the High Court. But, generous souls that we are, we did suggest a solution—indeed I did it from sitting about here—that Senator Ferris should resign and be reappointed under a casual vacancy. That all occurred and the net result was that the taxpayers got back about $25,000 of salary and business class travel expenses from Senator Ferris, and got a couple of months free work from her. This should not have been necessary. There is no doubt that Senator Ferris—Senator-designate Ferris, at the time—was not being employed to influence her in the future. It was so she could have a job until she took her seat here. 
It is very unfair to say to someone, `You do not have a living.' I do not know about others, but I was elected in November or October 1980, when I was a schoolteacher, and I had to spent eight months finding other employment because I could not go back and teach at school as it would be an office of profit under the Crown. Doug McClelland, who was a shorthand court reporter in New South Wales—I think Senator Forshaw might know this—went and sold ice-creams for six months, I think, to support himself and his family before he took his place in this chamber. Then we had the Ferris matter, and there was absolutely no intention there of suborning a future senator by an office of profit. Then we had Miss Jackie Kelly, the member for Lindsay, who I think took leave from her Air Force job rather than resign. Again, it was a clear case of not intending to pervert the Constitution or anything else. She was disqualified from her seat. 
Finally, we have a case before us again outed by the senator concerned—this time Senator Scullion. He was involved in a degree of commercial activity with his boat with a number of government agencies—the quarantine service, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That case still has not been resolved. The government has been stonewalling immensely in the last few months. The Labor Party attitude to this is: we do not think Senator Scullion was in any way trying to profit from his position. We know that it was stupidity and not malice that brought about his current position. We do not have any stake in seeing him leave this place, because another grubby dalek would just come from the CLP to replace him—probably far worse, far less generous and far less avuncular than we know Senator Scullion is—so why should we do it? The only reason we would like to see it resolved is that, if we do not resolve it, some day a private citizen could take the case and that could be far more expensive to Senator Scullion than if we resolve it ourselves. I know the government have had other priorities and I do not particularly blame them, but we are still waiting, months later, to get a response to the last piece of correspondence we did on this issue. 
None of those cases are Labor Party members—I feel pleased about that. But, certainly, over the years, there have obviously been some people who have been luckier—who have, in fact, offended the office of profit provision and have not been caught. I do not know of any personally, but I am sure it would have happened. One area that is still not particularly clear to us is municipal councillors, aldermen and whatever. There have been candidates for federal elections, both unsuccessful and successful, that have stayed on local councils. Is that an office of profit? They have never been taken to the High Court on it, but we would like that to be resolved. If Senator Brown's resolution is carried, we can resolve it.
—Eddie Ward was one.
—I think there are probably lots of later examples of people who have been on local councils, too. We, of course—Senator Kemp and I—have much better taste than to run for local government, because we are statesmen!
The second area that is covered here is allegiance to a foreign power. I must say that the way the High Court has interpreted this particular matter irritates me a lot more than the first one. I would have thought that, if you are an Australian citizen and you are willing to take the oath in this chamber of loyalty to Australia, you should be able to serve here. But that is not taken in that way and it is not the way the Constitution is interpreted.
The first person to offend on this—or the first case I had something to do with—was Senator Robert Woods. He was elected as a Nuclear Disarmament Party member and it was discovered that he was not an Australian citizen. This chamber had to do the appropriate thing and refer it to the High Court. The test I put on him that day was, `If the English cricket side comes out, do you barrack for them or for Australia?' He said he would barrack for Australia. I said, `That's good enough for me—I think you're an Australian and you should be here.' Nevertheless, the matter was sent off to the High Court and, in fact, he lost his Senate position. He did say to me at the time, `It doesn't matter if that happens; my replacement'—that is, Senator Irina Dunn—`will resign and I will be appointed under a casual vacancy.' That suspended my belief in human nature. But, I must say, five minutes after the court case, Irina Dunn rang me, as the relevant minister, to ask where she could set up her office. I thought, `My faith in human nature is restored.' That was the last we saw of Robert Woods.
The other person who offended on this was, of course, Heather Hill, who was elected in Queensland. She fell foul of it, but she should have been warned—we had had the Woods case and both the Liberal and Labor parties spent a lot of time making sure that all of their candidates were properly qualified. The way to do that is to make sure not only that you have Australian citizenship but, if you are regarded as having dual citizenship, whether you have sought it or not, you renounce it. You can renounce it at the local high commission or embassy, pay your necessary fee and then the High Court will say, `You've taken all the necessary steps.' But not Heather Hill—they were too busy campaigning on wedge issues to worry about these minor difficulties. The old One Nation does not worry about public funding and how that is spent or about keeping records on political donations. That is for the major political parties to worry about. They are too important—they would not even bother to examine the Electoral Act. They paid the price. Again, it was suggested at that time that the No. 2 on the ticket, Senator Harris, who now graces this chamber, would resign in favour of Senator Heather Hill. Two out of two—he is still here. That is not surprising at all. 
I must say that I do not like the concept of dual citizenship on any occasion. I know the modern trend is that you should allow dual citizenship. It is anathema to me that you would vote in more than one country in an election. I do not believe in it. I also believe that it causes enormous problems. If you are taken by a terrorist group overseas and you are a dual citizen, which country represents you? Which country goes to try and free you? You just do not know. And it is just to go through an airport line a bit quicker. I think it shows a bit of a lack of commitment to a particular country to want to be a dual citizen. I understand that, in some circumstances, it is imposed upon you. Some countries never let you, in their terms, `relinquish citizenship'. But I do think it is particularly difficult in these cases.
Senator Brown's constitutional amendment will clear these two areas up. I have looked at it carefully—I am not sure that it solves everything and that I agree with every technical term. But, then again, that is why we have the Attorney-General's Department—to polish up these or other outside things. I think, on the whole, Senator Brown has done a pretty good job with his legislation. I think the only chance of it ever going through will be with a package of other legislative matters.
I can say this with some certainty: of all those that have fallen foul of section 44, none was in fact guilty; it was always a technical breach. None was in a position in which they owed actual allegiance to another country; none was in a position where they could have been suborned on economic grounds—and that is absolutely clear. We have moved on a long way since 1901. What was an office of profit and a problem then has completely metamorphosed into other matters today. To clean up that aspect of the Constitution would be most welcome. It would also save political parties a lot of time in checking. But of course it is an advantage that the major political parties have: both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have been able to check all their candidates. Minor parties find that a lot more difficult. We used to use Senator Cooney as our watchdog to make sure all our candidates were clean. No doubt whoever is given the task next time will know they are on the way out of here.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-05-15,"—I rise to speak in the 2003 debate on the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]. We all know that this bill has been before the Senate previously and the key issue, a review of section 44 of the Constitution, has been subject to a great deal of debate and consideration on many occasions. One commentator on constitutional law has stated:
The disqualifications under sections 44 and 45 [of the Constitution] are of little practical importance, are riddled with difficulty and do not warrant extended discussion.
As a new senator and a previous Commonwealth public servant, I agree with the description concerning difficulty but, as this debate reflects, it is important and the discussion is warranted. Section 44 of the Constitution provides that persons who fail to meet set criteria for election are incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of either house of Commonwealth parliament. Section 44(i)—which I am not going to cover—provides for the disqualification of persons with a foreign citizenship or who have various other allegiances to a foreign power. Section 44(iv) disqualifies those who hold any office of profit under the Crown—an interesting term—or any pension payable under the pleasure of the Crown—another interesting term. Section 44(iv) has been determined to apply to Commonwealth and state public sector workers who wish to nominate for parliament. I am particularly interested in the impact on Public Service workers and the potential disincentive for people in this industry to consider nominating for election in our democracy. There are just more hoops to jump through. 
As an ex-public servant, when I was involved in the interesting and educative process of selection as a candidate I sought advice, just as Senator Mason described earlier, from the Australian Electoral Commission and people in the ALP about qualification. I was familiar with selection criteria and I was fairly comfortable about the concept of meeting requirements for any position—that was my Public Service background. I was fortunate in my search because there was strong search and knowledge of the system and, as a result of the Sykes v. Cleary case, there was a definition of the status for state public servants, the impact of leave without pay and what it really means, and the critical importance in any process in this case of the actual date of nomination. The message that I received from a range of sources was, `Get advice and get it right, because the alternative could be embarrassment, loss and, very possibly, unemployment.' Why is it so damned difficult and why is the impact on public servants so exceptional?
The Constitution is not an easy read and, with respect to a number of comrades who are constitutional lawyers, the language reflects a different environment and requires considerable help in interpretation. The volume of constitutional scholarship reinforces these difficulties. Our Constitution must be a vibrant document and, while making changes to the referendum process is not an easy path to take, nevertheless changes must and can be made. Simply because a situation was real and critical to effective government in 1902 does not mean that effective arguments for amendment to reflect real changes cannot be made at any time with support.
This does not mean that key principles should be dismissed; rather that current operations and needs can be reflected in a Constitution with the support of Australian voters. The principle of exclusion for persons who hold any office of profit under the Crown is based on the need for the absolute independence of government. Any member of parliament must be free from undue influence in doing their job. If your employment is somehow dependent on the Crown—and in 2003 I would interpret that as being our executive government—there could well be a conflict or seen to be a conflict.
There is also the need to maintain the principle of ministerial responsibility. Public servants who implement decisions on public policy and for whom the relevant minister is ultimately responsible cannot themselves be members of parliament. As the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee stated in 1997:
Ministerial responsibility requires that the minister should be accountable to the parliament for the actions of public servants within his or her department. It would be inappropriate if those same public servants were members of parliament.
That committee, among other groups who have reviewed that section of the Constitution over the years, agreed that the policy base for subsection 44(iv) remains sound but the operation of the provision must change. There must not be or be seen to be any double-dipping, nor should there be any perception of divided loyalty or possible confusion or division of activity. 
There is no argument about the issues of conflict for any person elected to parliament. However, when must the public servant lose the `payment of the Crown'? This provision causes real stress for potential candidates and requires a strong personal commitment on their part. Over the years, processes at the federal and state levels for a possible return to the public service for those unsuccessful at an election have been put in place. A Commonwealth public servant has the right to be re-engaged in the service, and so do people across the other states. But, in all cases, public sector workers who desire to nominate for parliament must resign from the service. In the current Public Service, as positions have been reduced and career options limited, particularly in regional areas, this remains a truly significant issue.
While the case of Sykes v. Cleary has clarified the situation for some public sector workers—as described by Senator Ludwig—there remains real confusion regarding the status of workers in local government, universities, statutory authorities and the ever-changing environment of public-private partnerships. The test of office of profit under the Crown seems to be dependent on the establishment of a relevant case. Perhaps we need some more appropriate electoral martyrs from various forms of public employment to determine our future operations. Senator Brown stated that everyone agrees that there needs to be a change—the problem seems to be exactly what change. Certainly, it has been agreed that a change must be made to the Constitution itself through a referendum. The challenges of this process have been described by other senators in this debate today, in particular Senator Ray, and in previous debates on this issue.
Again we seem to be in violent agreement but at a loss over the next step. Maybe there is no perfect form of words, but we need to work it out as a duly elected parliament to ensure that the large numbers of people who are now either confused or ill-informed about their rights to stand for parliament are given the opportunity to be involved in our system. I commend Senator Brown's legislation, and I hope that this time there will be more than rhetoric and there can be some effective action.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) 1998 (NO. 2) [2002]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-05-15,"—in reply—I commend Senator Moore for that excellent contribution to this important debate on the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2) [2002]. Before Senator Moore's contribution, Senator Robert Ray spoke. I am a mite more optimistic than Senator Ray about the prospect for the bill, if it were to pass through this place and the House of Representatives and get into the public domain. One of the things that might assist it, of course, is the recognition that there are some five million voters out there who cannot stand for parliament. It might very much tip the scales when they recognise that supporting this amendment would give them a right that they as citizens have but in the main do not know is taken away by section 44 of the Constitution, either because they hold dual citizenship or because they hold a so-called office of profit under the Crown simply through being on a pension or being in the Public Service.
I note that both Senator Ludwig and Senator Mason referred to the possible difficulty of people who work in universities being caught by section 44. However, I can put their minds at rest. In the particular case of Michael Organ, who is the member for Cunningham in the House of Representatives, I know that story was in the Financial Review. Maybe today's debate has given me some bead on the source of information going to a whole range of media before it finally got published in the Financial Review. It was a speculative story that there was something untoward in Michael Organ's holding of the office. There is not. Senator Mason had difficulty getting an opinion about that, but let me refer to the opinion of the very learned and esteemed John Basten QC, from Sydney, which, at the end, says: 
... there are sound reasons of principle not to extend the concept of an office under the Crown beyond those who form part of the broad structure of Executive government by which the affairs of the State are administered. The University of Wollongong does not fall within that classification.
15.	There is authority to support the conclusion reached above, although it arose in a different context. In Clark v University of Melbourne (No. 2)18 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered whether the University Council could make a regulation imposing a fee on students, without specific statutory authority in that respect. The principle sought to be applied to the University was that no tax could be imposed for the use of the Crown without such authority. The Full Court unanimously held, in response to that argument—
and it is cited as No. 19—
'There appears to be no reason for identifying the University with the Crown, or as a governmental agency of any kind ...'
Although the conclusion was not the subject of detailed reasons, it accords with the approach and conclusion set out above.
Mr Basten concluded:
16.	For these reasons—
and he had earlier reasons in his argument—
I do not think that a member of the staff of the University of Wollongong is the holder of an office of profit under the Crown. Accordingly, Mr Organ is not disqualified by operation of s.44(iv) of the Constitution.
I think Senator Ludwig referred to Michael Organ as a former University of Wollongong activist. He was actually an archivist. There is some difference between those two things, although I think that both are in some ways trying to make sure that the future is the better through their activities.
While we have not got from Senator Mason an indication of where the government's vote will lie on this matter, previously—in 1998—Senator Ellison said that the government did not support the legislation, remarkably enough, but he did say:
I can advise the Senate that the government is currently considering these issues and developing amendment proposals.
Here we are five years later and neither I nor the public have seen any sign of those amendments. There are none on the public record. But there was a commitment from the government five years ago—and I think the government is in the box seat in these matters. It is not good enough for the government not to have come forward with the legislation that I am bringing forward and to have expanded it, if necessary, to meet the recommendations of various parliamentary committees going back to 1981, as Senator Ray has just told us, ensuring that we do have a living and vibrant constitution of the sort that Senator Moore was talking about. That needs a multipartisan approach. We have it in this chamber. We have it with the government, because the government supports the recommendations of the committees upon which this legislation is built. I would find it extraordinary if the government were not to support this legislation. In fact, it would simply be doing a backflip on a commitment it made in 1998 and previous to that in response to the joint committee and other committees that recommended just these amendments. It is extraordinarily important legislation. I am looking forward to the Senate supporting the second reading so that we can make the minor amendments in committee I have foreshadowed and move on to a final vote. 
Question agreed to.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-05-15,"—Tuesday's budget should have improved life for Australian families. That is the test any government budget should meet. Australian families are under growing pressure. They are working longer hours and paying record taxes. The last thing Australian families need is to pay more for vital services like health and education. But that is what Tuesday's budget was all about. A civilised society demands health care based on medical need and education for all based on ability. We believe that health and education are not just about providing services to individuals. They are public goods, for all Australians. We must invest in these vital services. But under the Howard government we are heading in the opposite direction. Instead of improving life for families, this budget is making things worse. It is giving Australian families a miserly $4 tax cut, while destroying Medicare and charging them more for education. The Howard government failed the test on Tuesday night. It is time for something new.
Tonight we want to announce a new deal for Australia and Australian families.
·	 A new deal to save Medicare and bulk-billing.
·	 A pledge to keep higher education affordable and accessible.
·	A plan to save the Murray River from a slow, tragic death.
·	A retirement tax cut for every Australian.
·	A new deal to protect the savings of Australians.
·	An end to public subsidies of executive golden handshakes.
·	A better deal for small business.
·	And a better way to protect Australia and our children.
Most of all we want to give Australians a sense of hope that Australia can remain a fair and decent country that provides opportunities for all.
Saving Medicare and bulk-billing
We believe that every Australian must have the right to access a doctor who bulk-bills and they must have the right to attend a well-funded public hospital without charge. I will not say for free, because it is not free. Australians know that. They have already paid for Medicare through their Medicare levy and their taxes. They have earned it. They should not have to pay again when they visit a doctor. Quality health care must only ever be available on the basis of medical need. It should never be rationed according to ability to pay. It should not be a two-tiered system. It should not be a second-rate system. Look at the United States. Forty-five million people do not have any health cover. They live in fear of serious illness. It destroys family finances, sometimes for generations. That is not the sort of health system I want for Australia.
Mr President, there is a profound difference between the Labor Party and our opponents. We are the builders. They are the wreckers. Labor built Medibank under Gough Whitlam and then Medicare under Bob Hawke because we believe everyone should have access to affordable health care. The Liberals have never believed in affordable health care. They want you to pay more. That is why they wrecked Medibank and that is why the Prime Minister is wrecking Medicare now. That is why tonight we are announcing that a Labor government will act to save Medicare and bulk-billing. We will not allow Medicare to be replaced by an Americanised, privatised system where instead of your Medicare card, doctors ask for your credit card and refuse to treat you unless you pay up-front. Saving Medicare starts with restoring your patient rebate. 
So tonight I am announcing a Crean Labor government will lift the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live, or how much they earn. We will lift your patient rebate immediately upon coming to office to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee, and then take it to 100 per cent—an average rise of $5 for every consultation that is bulk-billed. This is not just for concession card holders. It is for everyone. As we know, access to bulk-billing is declining faster in some parts of Australia than in others. To remedy this, under Labor, doctors who meet bulk-billing targets will receive additional incentive payments. Doctors in metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 80 per cent of services will receive an additional $7,500 a year. Doctors in outer metropolitan areas who bulk-bill 75 per cent of services will receive an additional $15,000. And doctors in rural and regional areas who bulk-bill 70 per cent of services will receive an additional $22,500. This is the equivalent of increasing your patient rebate by as much as $6.30 for a doctor in a metropolitan area, $7.80 in an outer metropolitan area and $9.60 for a doctor in a rural area. This is a significant down payment towards restoring bulk-billing and saving Medicare. Without bulk-billing there is no Medicare. Our objective is to get bulk-billing to a national average target of 80 per cent. It will not happen overnight, but tonight's measures represent a significant down payment. Labor will also increase the number of doctors in rural areas and make more nurses available to doctors who meet Labor's bulk-billing targets. These measures will help take the pressure off our public hospitals because that is where people go if they cannot find a bulk-billing doctor. And Labor will also provide additional funds to ensure that veterans with gold and white repatriation health cards continue to have the access to the bulk-billing they deserve.
There is another important aspect of Medicare that Labor will protect—affordable access to pharmaceuticals. Labor will not support the Howard government's 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines. Last year when I announced Labor's response to this price hike I announced a raft of proposals that will cut the overall cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme but which will not impose charges on you. Medicare is not only the most equitable health system we can have but also the most efficient. Medicare is prudent economics. It is the envy of the world. Why would you want to destroy it? Especially when we know we can afford to save it. Budgets are about values, priorities and choices. Labor's priority has been clear—save Medicare. Labor's plan to save Medicare is responsible and fully funded. In the budget two days ago the Treasurer announced a further $300 million in tax cuts for multinational businesses. Now you know where cuts to your family's health services are going. To help pay for Labor's new deal to save Medicare, I will redirect some of the government's business tax changes from Tuesday night. I will also redirect the savings from scrapping the destructive changes to Medicare that were in the budget. This is not a tax and spend proposal. It is a cut and fix proposal. And it is a question of priorities. Corporate tax cuts do not have the same priority as saving Medicare for Australian families. Let us be clear about this. We have a very different view of Australian society to that of our opponents, and I will be happy to have an argument about these priorities anywhere, any time. 
A new deal for lifelong learning
Education is a bridge to the future. It does not just give individuals opportunity, it advances and strengthens us as a society. It should not be treated as a tradeable commodity. 
The world is changing so rapidly that our children will be working in jobs that have not been imagined yet and will have to update their skills throughout their lives, not just when they are young. This bridge to the future has many paths leading to it. We must invest in putting down those paths and we must not put up financial barriers. Our goal must be the creation of a world-leading system of lifelong learning. It must start with the early years—the crucial years for developing our learning skills. Too many of our children are slipping through the net because they are not getting the help they need. Opportunities are being lost because not enough money is being invested in our schools. While we encourage everyone to get a year-12 qualification, we do not provide enough apprenticeships or enough places at university or TAFE for them. Our vice chancellors advise us that 20,000 qualified young Australians are turned away every year. The cost to them and our country is enormous. Finding those places must be our objective. And we must have a new agreement with the states to create more TAFE places. We also need to give adults more assistance in upgrading their skills throughout their working lives. We must destroy the blight on our society of middle-age long-term unemployment. That is why my new deal for Australian families is a comprehensive plan for lifelong learning—a bridge to the future for all of us. Just as we have done with Medicare tonight, we will outline in the coming months our plans to build a better education system for all Australians. As a result of the changes outlined in Tuesday's budget, students and their families will be forced into massive debt to obtain a university degree. Fees will increase by up to 30 per cent, leaving students with HECS debts of up to $40,000 or more. Many more degrees will cost over $100,000. And students paying those fees will be hit with a six per cent interest charge. 
Mr President, how can we expect our young people to ever be able to buy a home and start a family with debts like these? In the interest of keeping student and family debt down, we will support lifting the HECS threshold to $30,000, but will not support the unfair elements of this government's unfair university package. Tonight we make this pledge to Australian families: we will not allow this government to slug you and your children with a 30 per cent increase in your university fees. We will not allow this government to saddle you and your children with $800 million of new debt. And we will not allow the wealthy to jump the queue and take the university places that rightly belong to the hardest-working and the most able young Australians. The Treasurer said last night that Labor's refusal to pass these measures means we are blocking his big, bold reforms. Charging students tens of thousands of dollars for a degree is not a big, bold reform, Treasurer. Opening up our universities to all Australians—like the Whitlam and Hawke governments did—is a big, bold reform. And we will do it again. The Liberals only ever see education as a cost and something they can slug you for. Labor knows—as every parent knows—that education is the greatest investment we can make in our shared future. 
Water
Our shared future must involve a commitment to save our natural environment. We all love Australia's rugged environment. As a keen bushwalker, I have seen first-hand how beautiful, but also how fragile, our country is. I recently visited the mouth of the Murray River in South Australia. What I saw distressed me. It also angered me. It will do the same for all Australians who see it. The once mighty river's mouth has all but closed. It has shrunk to the length of a cricket pitch. The water is only knee-deep. Barely a trickle flows to the sea. In some places it is flowing backwards!
The Murray is dying. Native fish are facing extinction, exotic species are choking the river and salinity is spreading. If we do not restore the health of the Murray, there will no longer be a river system capable of supporting our farmers into the future. This is a great national challenge and it will require a significant long-term investment. My new deal for Australia will save the Murray. I announce tonight that Labor will restore enough environmental flows to keep the mouth of the Murray open and to restore the health of the river. We will stop large-scale and indiscriminate land clearing to prevent salinity. And we will ratify the Kyoto protocol to prevent more severe droughts in the future. Restoring the flows of our rivers will take serious levels of investment. A Labor government will therefore create the Murray-Darling Riverbank—a special new government corporation to secure long-term funding for much needed investment in Australia's water resources. We will make an initial capital injection of $150 million as the first down payment to save our rivers and attract matching funds from the states and the private sector. Riverbank will invest in innovative projects that will set a new direction for water use in Australia, will help farmers achieve on-farm efficiency improvements and encourage increased water reuse and recycling. It will finance projects in its own right and participate in joint ventures with state and territory governments and the private sector. This will greatly increase the funds available for this urgent national priority. Just as Bob Hawke saved the Franklin River 20 years ago, Labor's pledge is to save the Murray River—the lifeblood of our nation.
Tax and the budget
[My father] was fond of quoting the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, who famously said, `When you pay taxes you buy civilisation.' If you ask me what a civilised society means today, my answer is this: a country where anyone, regardless of where they live or how much they earn, can get the same standard of medical care when they get sick; a country where education is available on the basis of ability, not your ability to pay; and a country that protects its natural environment for future generations to enjoy. That is the sort of civilised society I want Australia to be. This is the vision that should have been Tuesday night's budget. Sadly, it was not. We all know why. This government thinks that by giving you $4 a week you will not notice its real agenda—you pay more. You pay more to see a doctor. You pay more for an education. And you go further and further into debt. It is John Howard's message to all Australians: `Sorry about Medicare, sorry about your kids' education, sorry about your credit card debt, but here's four dollars instead.' The highest taxing government in our history has given you the smallest tax cut in our history. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer think that Australians earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year are so affluent that you only need another $4 a week. But while they give with one hand they slug you with the other—up to $50 to go to the doctor; $32 per week in extra HECS debt; and $125 per week to pay for your new student loan. 
Australians have earned the tax cut in the budget. Labor will pass it on, but Australians deserve more from this government. Four dollars on its own, set against the massive cost increases for health and education outlined in this budget, is miserly and a sleight of hand. A Crean Labor government will return bracket creep through both tax cuts and better services. Tonight I am demonstrating how a combination of those things can make a family better off.
A new deal on superannuation
A key test of your values, choices and priorities is whether you believe in rewarding the many or the few. Tuesday night's budget contains another tax cut—one Peter Costello was too embarrassed to talk about: his superannuation tax cut for the top few per cent of income earners. Especially at a time when superannuation returns are going backwards, Australians need a retirement tax cut to reward the many, not the few. Labor will redirect Peter Costello's unfair superannuation tax cut to pay for a superannuation tax cut for all Australians, cutting your superannuation contribution tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. This means thousands of dollars more for your retirement. Labor has always been the party for pensioners, but we are the party for superannuants as well. Only Labor extended superannuation to all; only Labor will improve it for all.
A new deal to protect your savings
But, Mr President, there is no use investing in superannuation if your savings are not safe. More than 50 per cent of Australians now directly own shares and 90 per cent of Australian workers have an interest in the share market through their superannuation. The retirement savings of the whole nation depend on a well-regulated corporate sector. In the last two years there have been a number of huge corporate collapses, including Ansett, HIH and One.Tel. When this happens, the executives in charge invariably refuse to take responsibility for what they have done. We have all heard of overpaid executives awarding themselves massive bonuses and golden handshakes just as their companies go belly-up. But, rather than punish them, the Howard government rewards these executives with a 30 per cent tax subsidy paid with your taxes. Why should a family struggling to cope with financial pressures caused by bracket creep, the GST, bank charges and other hidden taxes have to foot the bill for golden handshakes as well—handshakes they do not get when they are retrenched. Enough is enough.
Labor will double current penalties when executives break corporate law. We will force top executives to further disclose their pay packages in full, including their share options. We will strengthen Australian shareholders' rights by giving them a vote on these packages when they are unfair and unreasonable. And tonight I announce that Labor will stop your taxes being used to subsidise by 30 per cent the million dollar golden handshakes being given to some executives. This means that under Labor all redundancy payments over the value of $1 million will no longer be eligible business deductions for companies. Labor values Medicare, not corporate greed.
A new deal for small business
Mr President, there were two words missing from the Treasurer's budget speech on Tuesday night—`small business'. While the budget may not allow us to cut taxes for small business, only Labor will cut their paperwork. Peter Costello is spending $150 million of your money to employ 1,230 new tax officials to make your BAS nightmare even worse. Labor will cut that red tape. Under Labor's plan, small business owners will only have to make one simple calculation for each BAS statement based on a percentage of your turnover. The time-consuming and complicated reconciliation process will be eliminated. By substantially reducing your BAS compliance costs, Labor will put more money back into your pocket and give many of Australia's small businesses more time to spend on their business or with their families. 
Protecting our national security
Mr President, the government's budget contains many worthwhile initiatives to make our nation safer. But more needs to be done. Labor will coordinate our security in Australia through a new department of homeland security. Labor will ensure our intelligence agencies talk to each other through an office of national security, headed by a national security adviser. Labor will establish a coastguard—a maritime cop on the beat, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to stop drug runners and gun-runners and people smugglers. And Labor will establish community safety zones to work with your local community to help fight crime. Labor will protect your security, and our national security.
Protecting our children
Recent events highlight the need to protect our children. Something positive must come out of those events. Labor will establish a national commissioner for children, who will develop a national code for the protection of children and oversee checks on people who work with children to ensure that potential child sex abusers do not get access to them. Under Labor's government, all organisations in receipt of Commonwealth funds will have to comply with this code and these checks. We must resolve, as a nation, to ensure that allegations of child sexual abuse are never ignored in the future and that the truth is never again swept under the carpet. Labor will give parents more confidence that their children are safe.
Conclusion
Tuesday night's budget failed Australian families. We have the smallest tax cut from the highest taxing government in our history. We have more debt for our students and their families. And we have the destruction of Medicare.
Mr President, we face serious challenges in rebuilding Medicare, improving access to affordable education and repairing our environment. These must be our nation's long-term national priorities. They cannot be solved overnight. But governments can make a difference. Tonight I have laid out Labor's new deal in each of these areas—significant steps towards our long-term goals. Budgets are about choices. Now the choice is yours. Tonight Labor is offering an alternative—to make education affordable and accessible to all, based on ability; to save the Murray River from its tragic death; to help you save for the future and to make your savings more secure; and to make Australians more secure and better protect our children. Tonight we have a new deal to save Medicare, not destroy it. That is what Labor wants for Australia and that is what Labor will fight for—a new deal for Australians and Australia.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,33,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-05-15,"—Tonight, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I respond to the government's federal budget proposals for 2003-04. I say `proposals' because budgets are always works in progress. It has already been indicated that the Democrats and Labor will not support the health and higher education proposals as they stand. Under no circumstances will the Democrats support higher fees for Australian undergraduate students or allow this government to attack the fundamentals of Medicare. The fact is that budgets have rarely been passed in the version they were originally presented in. Yesterday, we heard the Treasurer on ABC radio saying: 
... back in the old days, budgets used to be enacted by the Senate. That was the theory of democratic government.
That statement is completely untrue and farcical. I ask Mr Costello: when were these supposed good old days? 1975? The only political party that has ever blocked supply is the Liberal Party, currently in government. The only political party that has used the budget to bring down a democratically elected government is the Liberal Party. How dare this Liberal government accuse the Senate of obstructionism! The government will not be successful in using the threat of an early election or false public rhetoric to bully the Democrats into passing any retrograde, ideologically driven legislation. One of the founding principles of the Democrats in 1977 was that we would not block supply. We would not do what the Liberal Party did—hold the government to ransom or hold the country to ransom. That is the only occasion of a Senate not doing its job properly. Since we were formed, the Democrats have held to our vow not to block supply, and we will not blackmail the government or hold the budget or the country to ransom.
The Democrats will do what we have always done for more than a quarter of a century: examine the budget proposals in detail with an aim to make them as fair and environmentally responsible as possible. The reality is—and Mr Costello knows it—the vast bulk of this budget is going to pass through this Senate untouched. But there is still plenty of room for improving the contents of the budget. It is clear that the big battlegrounds in the Senate will be on the health and education packages. The Democrats record on Medicare and on HECS and student fees are clear, longstanding and consistent. Under my leadership, the Democrats will continue our approach of sticking to our party's policies, promises and principles. Changes to the health and education packages will not affect the economic underpinnings of this budget. Any suggestion that, by examining these crucial packages, the Senate is somehow holding the surplus to ransom or is intent on gutting the budget is just false.
The government has whinged continually over the last 12 months about not getting some of their proposals through from last year's budget to make medicines dearer and life more difficult for those on disability support. The fact is that the stopping of those measures by the Democrats only cost the government a quarter of a billion dollars. And yet they could still afford nearly a billion dollars for a war and still have a $4 billion surplus on top of that at the end of 2002-03. All that talk of the disability support pension changes and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes being absolutely necessary for the budget bottom line simply was not true. I believe the Democrats' stance on those issues has been vindicated by this year's budget figures. As we know, this government is often loose with the truth whenever it is convenient, and its silly statements about the Senate and the budget are just another example.
I note in papers such as the Australian and the Canberra Times that the education minister, Brendan Nelson, is saying, effectively, that he is taking an all or nothing approach with this package. If he is seriously saying that he will not negotiate any change, then the higher education package is dead. If Dr Nelson pursues an all or nothing approach, he will get nothing. The sooner they give up the ridiculous rhetoric, the sooner the Senate will be able to do its job of finding better solutions, as the Democrats have successfully done in so many areas in the past—in recent times on welfare reform measures, on business tax, on the sugar industry package, on environment laws, on antipiracy protection, on health care cards for foster children and many other measures. 
That brings us to this year's budget. There are some good measures in this budget, many of which have already been publicly acknowledged by the Democrats and many other colleagues through various statements and media releases. As the federal budget figures show, the Australian economy—and let us not forget that the economy is not this disembodied thing out in the ether—is in effect Australian workers, businesses, industries and communities. Those Australians have produced an Australian economy that has some good economic fundamentals. The economy has continued to grow despite a weaker global economy, and we continue to enjoy—at least by Australian standards—relatively low interest rates and low inflation. However, a few economic indicators are not enough to measure quality of life or to guarantee sustainable environmental practices, individual freedoms or community cohesion. This budget has forecast a surplus for next financial year of $2.2 billion. Despite $2.4 billion in tax cuts in the next financial year, the government will in that same year still collect $4 billion more in individual taxation than it did this year.
Some of the other factors that contributed to the surplus must be noted. The Treasurer received a special dividend as part of his budget of almost $1 billion, paid by Telstra just last month. Of course, if Telstra had not been half sold by the coalition and Independent senators, the dividend would have been $2 billion—
—That was the Democrats!
—It was not the Democrats, thank you. Correct the record, please, Senator. I welcome the government's announcement that it will not be selling Telstra in this term, clearly because it has finally recognised that the Democrats will continue to ensure that Telstra cannot be sold. Mr Costello also received a funding injection from the Iraq war. The temporary spike in oil prices caused by the conflict in Iraq and the build-up to it increased revenue from resource and petrol taxes by about $400 million—a down payment on the war paid for by individual Australians at the petrol pump. 
But despite having a relatively strong economy and a record tax intake, the government is not delivering to Australians the standards of health, education services and income support measures that they deserve and that they need. In the area of housing it must be recognised that Australia's growth and budget surplus have in part been created by the housing price boom and increased debt. This cannot continue forever. We need to ensure the housing boom has a soft landing and we need to recognise that there is a social cost to the boom. The March quarter Housing Industry Association report showed that housing affordability has dropped by a huge 16.6 per cent over the past year. Small income tax cuts are not going to compensate for the growing cost of the fundamental need for housing.
In the area of unemployment we see the continuation of a level of over six per cent and no new initiatives in this budget to promote job creation. Eight years of Peter Costello as Treasurer have failed to break the back of unemployment. It is worth noting, as set out in the Australian Financial Review on budget day, the performance ratings of the major treasurers since 1950. Peter Costello was second last in performance on employment growth—second last. Guess who was last? John Howard. Youth unemployment is at 22 per cent, and advertised vacancies are at their lowest level in nine years. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—It is Mr Howard or the Prime Minister, Senator Bartlett.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I shall note that. Crucially, only eight per cent of the new jobs created in the last two years are full time; the rest—a massive 92 per cent—are part time. But there are no initiatives to promote job creation. One of the disappointments in the lead-up to this budget is that the government dismissed options that would reduce the high effective tax rates, sometimes up to 87 per cent, for people moving from welfare to work.
The best measure in the welfare area in the budget—about the only positive measure in the welfare area—is in fact the Democrats' achievement, which will put $50 million back into the pockets of the unemployed through reduced penalties. The Democrats' successful negotiations on welfare reform also ensured that unemployed people at least will have working credits that were initially taken away by this government restored to them—working credits of up to $1,000 a year. This goes a small way to increasing incentives for people to get off social security. However, more measures are needed to reduce the poverty trap still faced by thousands of Australians. If Mr Costello really wants to reduce unemployment this should be his priority. The budget predicts that the government will save $378 million over the four years by more targeting of people on benefits, but it fails to allocate a cent of those savings back into helping Australia's 600,000 unemployed find jobs.
With regard to the income tax cuts, undoubtedly the public will welcome some income tax relief. But those individual savings will clearly be swamped by increased costs in education, health and housing. The tax measures will increase the gap between high- and low-income earners. The Democrats' preference is for an equal tax cut for all Australians, and we outlined alternative tax options in the week prior to the budget. For example, the option of increasing the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $7,500 would give a $255 tax saving to all taxpayers equally. Maintaining the increase to the low-income tax offset would also provide added assistance for those who earn under $30,000 a year. Under the government's plan, those on $20,000 or less receive just $85 a year in tax cuts while those on $62,500 receive $573. Under the Democrats' proposal, everyone would receive at least $240, with slightly more for those earning under $30,000—fairer tax cuts for all, not just the rich. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table comparing Mr Costello's measures and the Democrats' tax proposals.
Leave granted.

—I thank the Senate. In short, the same amount of money on tax cuts could have been spent in a far fairer way. One of the advantages of the Democrats' proposals is that it is more likely that the additional money given to lower income earners would be spent and reinvested directly into the Australian economy.
We should remember also that the well off have already had their tax cuts. Capital gains tax was halved just a few years ago with ALP support, against the Democrats' opposition, despite the fact that it clearly mainly benefited those wealthy Australians with investment portfolios and share portfolios. Of course, the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance, costing the taxpayer over $2 billion a year, favours higher income earners as well. The government has also decided against acting on the advice of its own Ralph review on taxation to crack down on trust tax avoidance, despite the fact that taxing trusts as companies would earn $450 million a year. That is breaking the promise that was given to the Labor Party to enable those capital gains tax cuts to get Labor support. So the use of trusts to avoid tax continues, while the massive tax cuts to high-income earners through capital gains tax changes are also continuing.
On top of these tax benefits that help higher income earners we still have fringe benefits tax rules that encourage salary packaging for motor vehicles and encourage car use. This tax concession is bad for the environment and bad for government revenue, costing $900 million a year, but the government allows it to continue. The budget's industry measures will favour large corporations at the expense of small business. The government has ignored its commitment to the manufacturing sector to remove the tariff concession system. Leaving this in place will affect small and medium sized businesses.
The budget also contains some international tax proposals which need further scrutiny. The Democrats will examine these carefully when the legislation does appear, to ensure that the tax paid by corporations operating internationally is fair and there is no return to the days when clever international tax planning allowed multinationals to avoid their Australian tax responsibilities. So we will send this legislation to a committee to see if the proposed tax changes improve the simplicity and efficiency of the Australian tax system. But the Democrats do recognise the benefits if Australian businesses are more easily able to invest overseas. If the legislation simply eliminates double taxation and simplifies tax compliance, the Democrats' attitude will generally be supportive. The Democrats will also revise and reintroduce our Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 [2002] to regulate the activities of Australian companies in the areas of human rights, the environment and labour.
Of course, the Democrats are here not just to analyse government policy but also to provide and promote viable alternatives. Last week the Democrats' alternative budget proposals contained our equal tax cut initiative and other revenue measures that would allow us as a nation to invest in freedom, the future and a fair go for all Australians. Disappointingly, the government's budget is marked by missed opportunities, misdirected priorities and a continuation of social insecurity. The bottom line is that, if this budget were passed as it is, Australians would have to pay more to go to the doctor and to go to university. The Democrats are not going to let that happen. The Democrats have always taken a responsible approach to budgets, but we will oppose measures that impact harshly on everyday Australians. The higher education and health proposals would clearly dramatically increase inequality not just of wealth but of opportunity in Australia.
One of the other big problems with this budget is what is missing, and obviously the Senate does not have the legislative ability to remedy those flaws beyond public pressure and ongoing debate to get action. As I have said, there is nothing in this budget about job creation and, apart from the Democrat-negotiated cuts in fines to the unemployed, the only initiative regarding the unemployed is punitive. The government has clearly given up on its own welfare reform agenda, something that it said a few years ago was absolutely essential. The government has given up on decent levels of overseas aid and on adequate funding for the ABC. It is persisting with the poorly targeted baby bonus yet has failed once again to help families with paid maternity leave. As usual, the only substantial environmental initiatives tend to be ones that the Democrats negotiated, this time in the areas of the Great Barrier Reef, the Sydney Harbour foreshores and Sustainable Cities.
There is little for Indigenous Australians, for women or for important industries like tourism, or science and research. There is little in the budget to offer comfort to people with disabilities or to their families and carers. Amazingly, in this year with so much talk and chest-beating about supporting our troops—which continued again today—our veterans have been forgotten. The government could not even find a simple $50 million for basic measures such as improving the treatment of veterans' disability compensation payments or increasing the funeral allowance up to a reasonable level. But it has managed to scrape together billions of dollars to improve interoperability, which is a code word for `more easily able to participate in more wars with the USA'. The government has the money. Why not spend it on health, education and our natural environment? Why not invest in a fairer system, more freedom for Australians and a more hopeful future? 
The proposed higher education package is not equitable or sustainable, and there is no way the Democrats will change our longstanding position and support measures to increase the financial burden on university students. You just have to look at our record on HECS to see that the Democrats were the only ones back in the 1980s who opposed the reintroduction of student fees by the Labor government, and the Democrats have opposed all the increases to student fees which have been passed by Labor and by coalition governments since that time. This higher education proposal is a comprehensive plan to destroy HECS by 2008 and replace it with something even worse—interest-bearing loans for increasing numbers of students. The cost-shifting to students is exacerbated by the government's harsh means test of parental income for student income support which means only a tiny minority of teenage students at university can get access to payments such as youth allowance.
The prospect of significantly higher debt levels and increasing financial reliance on parents is a major disincentive for a huge number of students from low- and middle-income Australia to undertake study at university. Yes, there is some new money for universities, but this is heavily back-ended, put off into the future and still does not come close to replacing the huge amounts of money pulled out of universities by this governments since 1996. In addition, the Democrats totally reject any attempt by the government to blackmail universities into implementing its draconian industrial relations agenda as a condition for accessing new money. Tragically, schools have also been largely ignored in this budget. There is nothing on offer to begin to bridge the growing gap between the resources available to students in the public and private sectors. The government's SES funding model has been responsible for huge increases in private school funding.
Research and science have also fared badly in the budget. The CSIRO received a paltry $20 million for its new flagship initiative, but that lasts for just one year, whilst it faces a review that threatens to dismantle this once great research institution.
The health package of measures is all about the government trying to get out of Medicare. This government is supporting private health insurance instead of supporting and retaining Medicare. Medicare needs commitment to the principles of free hospital care, affordable pharmaceuticals and universal public access to GPs. The Democrats are very pleased that the Senate today supported our proposal to establish a Senate committee inquiry into Medicare to examine a better way to reform the health system. The government has pressed ahead with a destructive budget that would erode the foundations of Medicare, despite its plans to limit bulk-billing and expand private health insurance being decisively rejected by most health and policy experts.
It is worth emphasising the Democrats' record over many years on Medicare, because again that record is clear and consistent. As far back as 1979, our health policy called for emphasis on prevention, health education, healthier lifestyles and a cooperative national health scheme. Once Medicare was introduced by the Labor government in the 1980s, the Democrats pledged that Medicare would not be dismantled whilst ever we held the balance of power in the Senate. The public can be assured that retaining the Democrats in the balance of power will continue to ensure the protection of Medicare, just as it has for the last 20 years. We note Labor's announcements tonight on Medicare. At first glance they appear to go some way to address some of the short-term problems, but they will not address some of the long-term structural difficulties. We will certainly examine them in greater detail before the Senate committee inquiry. 
This budget in the area of environment revealed cutbacks in crucial environment programs, including a decrease in promised expenditure under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Department of the Environment and Heritage has suffered cuts, including to staff, as have other Commonwealth environment agencies, including the Greenhouse Office and the Director of National Parks. The few high points in the environment budget were Democrat negotiated measures: at least $8 million in new money directed towards improving water quality into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; $29 million more to protect some valuable parts of the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, foreshores that would not be protected if it were not for the Democrats; $40 million going on improving our urban environment in areas such as air, water and fuel quality. The Democrats are also proud of the achievements with our long-term work on national fuel and emission standards and the extension of the environmental friendly Photovoltaic Rebate Scheme.
The new Sustainable Cities program, developed through negotiations with the Democrats and announced by the government, will enhance the Commonwealth's role in the management of toxic substances, water and waste and will substantially improve air quality and liveability in our cities. There is a whole range of measures in that package. They are not massive funding measures, but they are good ideas that have a significant, positive impact—and good ideas are not always expensive.
Attention must be drawn to the Prime Minister's broken commitment that he made to Australian families at the last election to make balancing work and family life a key priority of his third term. The inclusion of paid maternity leave in the budget would have been a very good start. The Democrats, along with the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, have clearly demonstrated that a national, government funded, paid maternity scheme is affordable and both economically and socially desirable. A Democrat private member's bill is before the Senate that would provide this without increasing cost to business. The Democrats have led debate on this issue, as has been acknowledged by Ms Goward herself.
There have been ongoing cuts to funding for women's services in crucial areas such as domestic violence. Funding for two important initiatives—the Partnerships against Domestic Violence strategy and the National Initiative to Combat Sexual Assault program—are winding down; again, flying in the face of this government's protestations that it cares about child sexual assault and abuse. This budget should have had money for a royal commission to clean up that tragic stain on our nation.
The government's increasing disregard for human rights is also reflected in its funding for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which, despite a minimal increase, is still 40 per cent less than when the coalition came to power. Of course this is consistent with the government's aim to undermine the independence of HREOC through legislation currently before the Senate. This year's budget contains little to improve Australians' access to justice. With only a very small increase to legal aid funding, more Australians will be denied legal representation in the courts. This is a false economy. More Australians are being forced to represent themselves and the result is that litigation is taking longer and costing more.
In immigration the government has not hesitated to continue to budget enormous amounts of money on detention and detection, turning away asylum seekers at sea and endangering lives. There is the continual wastage of defence funds and misuse of defence personnel, with another $18 million being put towards more Tampa and `children overboard' debacles following on the $41 million that has already been thrown overboard in the last few years. Temporary protection visas—that leftover One Nation policy—have had enormous impacts, not just on genuine refugees but on charities and non-government organisations. If we abolished temporary protection visas there would be significant savings on reprocessing of claims, court challenges, forced deportations and voluntary reintegration. Yet the cost in terms of giving refugees access to adequate support services would only be $26 million. 
As I have noted, there was very little in the budget for our troops of yesterday or of today. The government has ignored the longstanding recommendations of both the RSL and the independent Clarke review of veterans' entitlements. There has been a bit of extra money for monuments and public relations—an extra $1 million for memorials and over $1½ million to help the Governor-General's office give awards. It seems to me to just provide a chance for coalition politicians to stand next to people who really have achieved something. On the eve of troops returning from Iraq, the best the government could do was announce that a draft of the new Military Compensation Scheme would be released shortly, seven years after it was promised.
The government is wrong when it claims that the cost of the Iraq war can be given as a figure in this year's budget. The cost of any war is not known until the last veteran dies. The defence budget confirms the government's priorities and plans of moving more towards acting with the United States in going to war against other countries. This funding does not assist in defending Australia or ensuring a stable region. Australia's commitment to overseas aid remains pathetic—less than half the level recommended by the United Nations—and leaves us lagging well behind the vast majority of OECD countries. So much for this government's professed interests in global security and stability!
This budget has missed the bus in relation to tourism, which is our fourth biggest industry nationally—one of the largest employers in regional Australia—and is now dealing with the cumulative effects of terrorism, the Ansett collapse, the war in Iraq and now the SARS virus. This year alone has seen a dramatic downturn in the inbound tourism market, which could result in losses of up to $2 billion. The Democrats have welcomed continued support for regional air services, but we remain concerned that the Ansett levy stays in place.
Regional Australia will continue to be denied access to the full range of ABC radio networks—nothing for the millions of Australians who cannot get Triple J or Classic FM, NewsRadio and parliamentary broadcasts. I am sure there would be millions of people in regional Australia listening tonight to the Democrats' response if they had that opportunity. The ABC cannot continue to offer digital multichannelling options without additional funding. Given the ABC's multichannelling has been one of the main incentives for people buying digital televisions, this could easily destroy one of the government's key broadcasting initiatives.
In the area of visual arts, the Democrats welcome the announcement in last night's budget of dedicated funding for the visual arts and crafts sector but say it falls well short of the recommended additional funding in the recent Myer report which resulted from the inquiry into contemporary visual arts and crafts. However, this extra funding is an important first step in the process of broader arts reform that will deliver real outcomes for Australia's artists. 
In this year's Indigenous affairs budget the Democrats have welcomed some initiatives. We have been consistently asking for yearly reporting into Indigenous disadvantage, but there is still a major lack of involvement of Indigenous people. The costs of transitional arrangements for ATSIC and ATSIS have not been spelled out. The delivery of services and programs to Indigenous people must not be affected by this bureaucratic reshuffling. With the extra places in the CDEP Work for the Dole program, once again we see Indigenous people expected to deliver services to their own communities at cut price—services which the government would normally fund to the wider community.
In this budget, as with all budgets, there is a lot more to it than just balancing the books. Budgets express the priorities and plans, even the aspirations, of a nation into the future. (Extension of time granted) The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, admitted just last month that our country is not as egalitarian as it used to be and the gap between rich and poor in this country has widened and continues to widen. The Democrats will do all we can in the Senate and the general community to reverse that growing inequality and to protect our future as well as the environment. The Democrats' record in the Senate shows that we do not support changes that will widen inequality in Australia. We will maintain that fundamental approach in examining every single measure of this budget.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,33,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-05-15,"—I congratulate Senator Bartlett on that speech on behalf of the Democrats. I also congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, on his contribution tonight, which stands in great and beneficial contrast to that of the government. Treasurer Costello's eighth budget, which the Greens hope will be his last, is the half-pack-of-cigarettes budget. His $4 tax cut is all the vision his budget has. Mr Costello's budget is strong on economic rationality, but weak on heart and vision.
The Greens' vision is much bigger. We remind the electorate that there is another way. Governmental priorities can and should be refocused on the things that really matter to ordinary Australians. In the Senate, we will attempt to redirect the Treasurer's $2.4 billion tax cut to the health of our community, the education of the nation, the care of the environment that sustains us and our ability to live safely as peaceful citizens of our region and the wider world.
The Greens' vision is for free education at all levels, including higher education, and the abolition of HECS, instead of the government's attempts to Americanise our university system—that would be at a cost of less than $1.7 billion per annum. It is for the use of $6 billion a year estimated by the government's own scientific advisers to repair the environment instead of losing it to the most recent corporate tax cuts, which reduce the rate from 36 per cent when this government came to office to the current 30 per cent. It is for money for the ABC instead of the $270 million corporate tax cut for the multinationals, which we opposed at the outset and which, I understand, the opposition may have followed suit in opposing tonight.
The Greens' vision is for the diversion of $2.3 billion private health insurance rebate to public hospitals, doctors and health promotion and the extension of Medicare to dentistry and mental health services, instead of the government's attempt to dismantle Medicare. It is for giving an extra $3 billion a year, now given to the logging, mining, road transport industries and fuel subsidies in the GST deal, to environmental repair and protection instead. It is for increasing the overseas aid budget by $515 million as a first step toward meeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, instead of the paltry one-quarter of a per cent we give now. It is for a parental leave scheme of 18 weeks, funded up to the average weekly earnings. 
After 20 years, the emperor's new clothes of economic rationalism have worn very thin for most Australians, the majority of whom are losers in this so-called new economy. After decades of this formulaic approach, the credibility of the good news of economic management is in tatters, as many Australians struggle with the bad news experience of a growing divide between rich and poor and a deep sense of insecurity.
It is not just those at the bottom of the economic ladder who are no longer buying the budget night self-congratulation of governments. Those on middle incomes—the majority of Australians—are beginning to doubt the wisdom of the economic rationalist approach altogether. The recent publication of Clive Hamilton's Growth Fetish, Michael Pusey's The Experience of Middle Australia and, indeed, Fred Argy's Where to from Here? provide timely documentation of this groundswell of dissatisfaction. The Greens have long recognised the kinds of trends that led Pusey to say:
The ugly reality of economic reform has taught middle Australia that the level playing field is a moral fiction. In the food chain of the new capitalism they see egoistic and predatory corporate moguls ... at the top and themselves at the bottom.
Pusey reports that middle Australia feels that the benefits of growth have gone to the rich and to big business. This feeling is not due to an inability to understand or an envy for those better off. It is demonstrably true. These matters are demonstrably true. For example, the government's budget this week offers personal income tax cuts of around $4 a week for middle income earners; yet since 1998 business tax rates have fallen from 49 per cent to 30 per cent, as CEOs reap multimillion dollar packages. The proportion of this country's income that goes to our wage and salary earners has fallen by seven per cent in the last 25 years. And, most disturbingly, our political leaders now seem to have accepted that this country will permanently have six per cent of people without a job, many of them living in the same households—in the same families—trapped on the wrong side of the great economic divide. Commenting on this groundswell of unrest, Alex Millmow, an economist from Charles Sturt University, notes:
That stock of altruism—something Adam Smith felt kept capitalism from degenerating into a dog-eat-dog society—is fast wearing down.
Robert Manne, from La Trobe University, writing in the Age last week, echoed that concern. He said:
What many people seem to yearn for is a world in which they are treated not as consumers or as dispensable cogs in an indifferent machine but as citizens and as human beings.
Even the Prime Minister appears to have sniffed the winds of change, saying:
There are still far too many people in Australia who are not getting a share of the bounty of this country, through no fault of their own, to which they are entitled.
But it is hard to see any evidence in this budget that the Prime Minister has taken this concern at all seriously. The Greens say that resolute action is needed to treat the wounds inflicted by economic rationalism, action that we Greens see as both desirable and—note this—affordable.
One of the primary responsibilities of government is to redistribute power and wealth, to benefit the least powerful and the least wealthy. In large measure, this is achieved through investment in public goods, like a strong public health care system, a robust accessible education sector and a social security system that provides adequate support for all of those in need. However, the Howard government prefers to give tax cuts to high-income earners, like last year's proposed reductions in the superannuation surcharge, the corporate tax cuts I have spoken about and the tax cuts announced for multinationals in this budget—all that while it imposes a regressive flat tax, the GST. 
The Howard government prefers to impose a punitive breaching regime on people unable to earn income, fining them $1 billion since 1996. It is stealing money from people who struggle to meet their basic living expenses when it should be working to abolish poverty by providing an adequate social safety net and active job creation policies. 
The Howard government prefers to run down the public health system by robbing it of $2.3 billion every year to subsidise private health insurance and claim it is offering choice—even though this is not the choice of the Australian people. Redirecting this money would go a long way towards restoring bulk-billing of medical services, reducing waiting lists for elective surgery in our public hospitals and extending Medicare to areas of need, like dental and medical health services.
We can also afford a national paid parental leave scheme for new parents who want to stay in the work force. The Australian Greens have developed a model that provides 18 weeks of leave, paid up to the average wage, which could be largely funded from redirecting the poorly directed baby bonus and savings on family tax payments. We can afford this right now.
As the ACTU reminded us all last week, most of the jobs created during the 1990s paid less than $26,000 a year, and indeed half of them less than $15,500 a year. This stands in stark contrast to the total earnings of the top five per cent of income earners of $62 billion a year which, put together, is more than the nation spends on all its social security and family payments. Clearly we are seeing an exacerbation of the divide that is opening up between rich and poor Australians out of the formulaic, economic rationalist direction of governments over the last 20 years. What we Greens are presenting, and will continue to present, is an option that will close that gap and end that increasing poverty, particularly on the wrong side of the gap, which is built into this year's budget.
On education, the Greens see the guarantee of universal access to a quality public education system as a core responsibility of government. From preschool to university and TAFE, investing in the education of our society makes sense economically and socially. The deregulation of fees is perhaps the most significant change announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night. It is a change that sets our universities firmly on a course back to an era of elitism where a good degree was available only to those who could afford it. Introducing a financial selection criterion has no place in the Australian university environment. This, together with the expansion of full fee-paying places for domestic students, is a hammer blow to the egalitarian idea of a comprehensive university system. It will ultimately degrade academic standards and the reputations of our universities.
Aggressively competitive research funding will stratify the sector to the disadvantage of regional and newer universities. These institutions will then be pressurised further by competition from private outfits now able to access government research dollars in what is a creeping privatisation of the tertiary sector, and it will be underwritten by public money.
It is, of course, the students and their parents who will bear the cost changes. Many will decide that it is simply not worth it. The loss of human capital from such short-sighted penny pinching is hard to quantify, but for every bright student who turns their back on the chance of a higher education—and currently universities are turning away 20,000 such students every year—as a result of these reforms that is a loss to Australia's future as well as a loss to them. Meanwhile, the long-suffering academic staff, whose morale is already battered from year after year of underfunding and competitive pressure, are losing their right to bargain collectively in this government package. This measure is pure union bashing. It is an example of government coming between worker and employer, uninvited and unwanted, to make political mischief. 
The Greens reject this restructure and look to commit significant ongoing funds directly from government to achieve the world-class education system that Australia deserves. The Greens will oppose these measures that stratify education and health to give the advantage to the rich and the disadvantage to the poor. We will oppose those measures here in this Senate. We challenge the government, and the opposition for that matter, to explain why we cannot afford the $1.7 billion per annum that it would cost to totally abolish HECS and return to free tertiary education, the right of all Australians. In our view, we can, and we would, do that. It would be a far better investment than most of the $6.8 billion given annually to the corporations through corporate welfare.
On the environment, one of the great disasters of the Howard government has been the handling of this nation's, and indeed the planet's, ecosystems. This budget continues the serial cuts to the environment through underspending year after year. This is financial dishonesty. Every year you see the budget allocations put there, and every year you see that the previous budget allocations were underspent. That is at ministerial direction; that is government policy.
It is a financial dishonesty from Messrs Howard and Costello which is masked by regular changes to the format of the budget statements—designed to confuse and obscure. That of course runs right through the budget presentation each year. However, what is clear is that spending on climate change has been slashed by over half a billion dollars through systematic underspending. Less than half of the nearly $1 billion which the government regularly boasts of having committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions will have been spent by the due date of June next year.
Another $11.6 billion has been added to the government's Rio Tinto energy policy for a so-called `cooperative research centre for carbon dioxide sequestration'—that is, promoting the burning of coal over other options. Since this largesse appears nowhere except in the environment statement, it could indeed be a stuff-up. But if it is not, it is not a financial mistake; it is an environmental one—another hand-out to the coal industry, which is our nation's worst polluter. Fuel taxes are being actively used by this government to promote greenhouse gas emissions, with the loss of automatic indexation of fuel excise but now its application to LPG.
The Prime Minister's own national action plan on salinity this year has been slashed from the planned $150 million to much less than half, at $62 million. The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council costed the repair bill for fixing our natural systems at about $6 billion annually, or $60 billion over 10 years. If we do not do the repair now, that bill will get much greater in the future.
The Greens have a big-ticket vision of what the Commonwealth could do for the environment. We would pour the necessary water back into the Murray now. And I congratulate Mr Crean and the opposition for tackling the issue of repair, reinvigoration and refreshment of the Murray-Darling system—something totally left out of the account from Mr Costello and Mr Howard just two nights ago. 
We would use Commonwealth power to stop broadscale land clearing now. And I note Mr Crean has indicated, while not stating explicitly, the same. We would ratify Kyoto now. And I note that Labor is also promising that. We would move to increase Australia's mandatory renewable energy target to 10 per cent from the current two per cent.
But some of the most important decisions this government could make on the environment would have negligible or positive impacts on the budget bottom line. For example, protecting Tasmania's forests now—the grandest, tallest, greatest hardwood forests in the world—would protect their biodiversity. It would protect their water. It would protect the soil and safeguard—note this—the biggest carbon banks, the biggest hedges against global warming, in the Southern Hemisphere.
Stopping the tax breaks for plantation investors would save money for the government and stop most of the clear-felling of native forests in Tasmania and elsewhere. Without those tax breaks, the costs would not be there. They effectively subsidise the environmental degradation. Introducing vigorous measures to save energy by making buildings, appliances and industrial processes more efficient would be the most cost-effective climate change action the government could take. It would invigorate ecotechnology in this country. It would get behind small business and innovative brain power, which this country has an enormous repository of—and get it going. It would create the jobs and make Australia a powerhouse for environmental technology—not just for our nation but for our region, and indeed the whole world.
Talking of the whole world brings me to the subject of aid. At the heart of the Greens' opposition to the war on Iraq was the knowledge that ultimately peace and security can only be achieved through addressing global injustice. While the Howard government was at the forefront of the war on Iraq—a global leader on the issue, albeit at the behest of President Bush—the opposite is true when it comes to helping to address worldwide poverty and inequality. Why are we not a global leader in promoting the alleviation of poverty and human misery? Instead, this Costello budget has seen overseas aid, our cheque to humanity, slashed again. Australia's overseas aid has slipped to a paltry one-quarter of one per cent of GDP, when the accepted target is 0.7 per cent. It is one third of what it should be. Simply to start the government on the path to meet the global millennium development goals to which it signed up through the United Nations would require $515 million in this year's budget. This is what the Greens would deliver as a very small first step. Instead, the government has a budget allocation of almost $750 million for the war on Iraq.
For this government to lecture anyone on fiscal responsibility is laughable when we consider the haemorrhaging of public funds currently going to finance the ill-conceived pork barrels and corporate welfare that the government has funded.
—It's cheaper than East Timor.
—The member opposite says that the ill-conceived pork barrels in corporate welfare are cheaper than East Timor. I do not think it is a good analogy. I simply think it shows how short on ability to relate to different values those on the government benches are.  
Besides those I have mentioned already, these ill-conceived misdirections of funds include the $60 million crusade to crush the construction union through the Cole royal commission. We had here today members of the government benches arguing that $40 million or $50 million would be too much to allow Australians to decide at referendum whether five million adult Australians should not have the right to stand for parliament—a right denied by a slip-up in the Constitution under section 44. They voted it down on that argument. The government cannot get $40 million or $50 million to give people the option of changing an unintended but really regressive part of the Constitution, but it can find $60 million for this union-chasing Cole royal commission.
Hundreds of millions of dollars went to the so-called Pacific solution of diverting asylum seekers to the prison camps on Nauru and elsewhere. There was $1.7 billion, which should have been means tested, in grants to those wealthy enough to buy a house under the First Home Owners Scheme. The government is spending more money on private schools than the total spent on higher education. Did you know that, Acting Deputy President—that this government actually spends more on private schools than it spends on higher education in this country?
—Of course we did.
—Senator Crossin did. I have not heard anybody on the government bench recognise that. There is a tax concession for four-wheel drive tariffs valued at $190 million per annum. That is promotion of pollution. The most polluting vehicles are being promoted at the expense of less polluting vehicles by this government at taxpayers' expense, with $190 million basically going to the wealthy, once again. Then there is the $500 million baby bonus, which I mentioned earlier.
Australians understand the importance of a fair, progressive and redistributive tax system that ensures people pay their share of the nation's bills. Company tax rates, however, have fallen 19 per cent in the last 15 years, while the GST and a still terribly low tax-free threshold and bracket creep see the lowest paid facing an intolerably high tax burden. Australians also have a sense of fair play which is offended by the completely unequal treatment of people on unemployment benefits or disability pensions compared with corporate welfare cheats. Thousands of people have lost their savings or income in the collapse of companies like HIH and One.Tel and the corporate vandalism of mutual companies like AMP and the NRMA. However, to recover billions for the community from these corporate shonks, the government has only allocated an extra $11 million per annum to regulatory bodies. Compare that with the fact that, to recover $25 million a year—not billions but $25 million—from people on disability pensions, the government has allocated an extra $5 million a year for compliance. That is punitive on the poor and ridiculously easy on the rich. It is a total warping of the priorities and responsibilities of government.
The government should not be relied upon to provide all the answers or deliver the kind of happiness that Clive Hamilton talks about as being so lacking for large swathes of the population. But government does have a crucial role in maintaining an environment in which these goals are realistic for all Australians. Much of this speech, which tonight was to be given by Senator Nettle, was penned by her. In putting this alternative vision, I am enormously pleased and feel empowered by having with me in this parliament Senator Nettle and Michael Organ, the honourable member for Cunningham in the House of Representatives. As we grow, we put to the people of Australia a vision with real alternatives; compared with the economic rationalism which, unfortunately, infests and is ineradicable from both the government and the opposition of the day. Australians are waking up to the fact that the government has lost sight of its basic priorities and the things we as Australians pay it to fairly achieve.  
The rise of the Greens and our alternative proposals for a fairer Australia, with a more secure future based in humanitarian and ecological strategy, gives many Australians a real option in what are pretty daunting times. The Greens will continue to champion a fairer society rather than simply the economy and to champion the parliament rather than simply the stock exchange. The Greens do this in the interests of all Australia's people, through this wonderful democracy of ours, for Australia's land, its culture and our future.
Debate (on motion by Senator Boswell) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,33,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-05-15,"—I first saw him moving quickly toward the front of the hall. He was much taller and more well built than I had expected. While he was in his 80s, he walked with a surety and steadfastness born of having to watch every step. He certainly matched the legend. Come to think of it, he was a much larger figure in every way than the entertainers who fill today's tabloids and assault our senses. Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest, one of the great explorers and adventurers of last century, had come to launch his autobiography in Brisbane. Let me put it very simply: he captivated his audience. But of course, I am biased, for I have admired him since I was a child, although not, it must be admitted, without a touch of envy. 
We admire heroes because they show us what we are capable of. They stand for us and represent our capacity to prevail. They defend us against our own tendency to be sucked down into despair, depression or perhaps even boredom. They raise our hopes and our spirits, they open up new frontiers, even if only within our imagination, and they inspire us. This is particularly so of Sir Edmund Hillary. Mind you, he would likely disagree. At his own insistence, he is no hero. He, too, suffered from doubt. He frequently had a fear of dying. He fell down crevasses, barely escaped avalanches and often suffered severe altitude sickness. He claims no secrets to overcoming fear or failure; only that none of us should be afraid of a long climb to reach our dreams, nor should we let fear of failure stop us from taking that first step. Sir Edmund simply says that he was an enthusiastic climber, was highly motivated and had a deep desire to achieve.
With the 1953 British expedition to Everest, he happened to be in the right place at the right time. The Swiss had nearly reached the summit the year before and then, just days prior to Hillary's and Tenzing's successful ascent, two colleagues had just failed to reach the top of Mount Everest. Mount Everest's mercurial challenges, its `roar of a thousand tigers', had saved her summit for Hillary and Tenzing. Later, Sir Edmund was to engage in many other adventures, including reaching the South Pole with a New Zealand expeditionary party in 1958 as part of the Commonwealth trans-Antarctic expedition led by Sir Vivian Fuchs. I well remember as a teenager watching a documentary on television in the late 1970s about Sir Edmund and a team aboard jet boats attempting to trace the Ganges River from the coast to its source in the Himalayas. In a life full of adventure, honours, writing, fundraising and lecturing, he has achieved so very much. But it is with Everest that Hillary will forever be joined. His assent with Tenzing Norgay on 29 May 1953, 50 years ago this month, will always rank as one of the greatest examples of human endurance, skill and courage. 
Yet despite all the fame and glory that Sir Edmund attracted for this magnificent achievement, it is not why I am addressing the Senate tonight. No, others can better talk about mountaineering and adventuring than I can. I admire Sir Edmund Hillary because even if, as he modestly says, he was just lucky to catch the right time, the expedition, the climbers and the weather to scale Mount Everest, he has done so very much for our world since that first ascent 50 years ago. I admire him because he has purchased so much with serendipity's bequest. With his fame he has bought not riches for himself but a better life for the people of the Himalayas. In the past 40 years, since he established the Himalayan Trust, Sir Edmund has raised funds and helped build 27 schools—`schools,' Sir Edmund says, `among the clouds'—two hospitals and 13 village health clinics for the Sherpa people, as well as many bridges, mountain airfields and freshwater pipelines. It is for his work for the trust and for the people of Nepal that Sir Edmund Hillary truly becomes a great figure. He used nature's gifts of energy, courage and motivation and God's gift of timing to give back to the people of Nepal. It is this contribution to society, this great civic achievement, that is to me the essence of the man and his claim to a special place in our collective admiration. This is his true heroism.
Life has not always been easy for Sir Edmund. The loss of his wife and daughter in a tragic accident in the Himalayas was a blow that he says he still feels guilty about. As those in politics know, even those who climb the highest can never insure against sorrow. But, just as he taught us all to believe in challenges that are so great that they will stretch us and then stretch us some more, so he himself never shirked from living his own advice. Sir Edmund Hillary recently wrote:
I have had much good fortune, a fair amount of success and a share of sorrow too ... Achievements are important and I have revelled in a good number of adventures, but far more worthwhile are the tasks I have been able to carry out for my friends in the Himalayas. They too have been great challenges in a different way—building mountain airfields and schools, hospitals and clinics, and renewing remote Buddhist monasteries. These are the projects that I will always remember.
We cannot all climb Mount Everest. Thank goodness for that, you might say. It is certainly good for Mount Everest. But we should all be thankful for people like Sir Edmund Hillary who show us what we ordinary people of `modest abilities', as he says, are all capable of with just a `goodly share of imagination and plenty of energy', and that we do not have to be famous adventurers and great explorers to strive to climb our own Everests and seek a view from the summit or at least a peek from the Hillary Step.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Hillary, Sir Edmund</title>",Adjournment,34,1
