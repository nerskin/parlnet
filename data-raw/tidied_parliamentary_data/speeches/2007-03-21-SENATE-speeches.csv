"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-03-21,"—At the request of Senator Ellison, I move:

Aged Care Amendment (Security and Protection) Bill 2007
Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2006-2007 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2006‑2007

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-21,"—The long list of bills that the government has put forward for exemption from the cut-off is not warranted. The argument fails. The role of the Senate, as you know, Mr President, is to allow adequate time for public input to important bills, such as those listed. Again this shows the arrogance of this government in wanting to truncate the scrutiny that the Senate and, through it, the public can bring to such legislation. The Greens do not support this motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-03-21,"—That is exactly the same wording that we received from Senator Bob Brown yesterday, when he was complaining about this arrogant government providing extra time for the Senate to consider legislation. It is just the same old mantra, irrespective of the motion or the issue. Today I have moved that certain bills be exempted under the provisions of standing order 111, because they are vital bills. For example, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007 has been drafted to formalise the exceptional circumstance relief payments available to farm-dependent small business operators being affected by the prolonged drought being experienced across Australia. Clearly, Senator Brown and the Australian Greens do not want that legislation to be debated and passed early to assist the drought-stricken farmers of this country.
We also have the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2006. This bill bolsters the Australian government funding commitment to education, so he would seek to delay a funding commitment to education in this country. We have the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Additional Screening Measures) Bill 2007, which provides for extra search capacity as an additional security measure. Once again, the Australian Greens would seek to stand in the way of that. I have outlined a few examples of why these bills require urgent consideration by the Senate. I hope that honourable senators see the sense in dealing with these bills on the basis that the government proposes.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-03-21,"—The Greens are an extremist political organisation and should be recognised as such by all mainstream political parties. That recognition should extend to refusing to do preference deals such as those Labor is doing with the Greens in New South Wales. Greens’ policies are anti family and anti jobs. Most importantly, they are soft on drugs and hard on coal. Their priorities are upside down and inside out.
The Greens’ election pledges include an upgrade of the legal status of all animals from ‘property’ to ‘beings’. This is a radical move aimed at controlling livestock management practices. In Victoria, the Greens offered free gay, lesbian and transgender support services for students as young as 13. I am surprised they did not offer this service to the animal ‘beings’ as well.
Greens MLC Lee Rhiannon told Radio 2GB on 12 March:
We’re also looking to advance adoption rights. If the Labor government—if they’re elected—do not honour their commitment to give all gay and lesbian couples the right to adopt children, the Greens will bring forward a private members’ bill on this issue.
The operative words are ‘do not honour their commitment’. That would suggest that Labor has done a deal with the Greens to introduce legislation to allow gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals to adopt children if Labor is re-elected on 24 March.
What other deals has Morris Iemma done in return for Green preferences? Last year there were reports that clinically produced heroin would be imported into Australia to trial a new treatment for long-term addicts under the Victorian Greens’ drug policy. AAP reported on 6 July:
Supervised heroin injection rooms, such as the one running in Sydney’s Kings Cross, would also be trialled in Victoria while the policy also proposes to scrap all criminal penalties for drug use.
The production, sale or trafficking of illicit drugs would remain an offence, but users would only face a court order requiring them to participate in a health scheme.
Greens health adviser Dr Richard Di Natale added that the drug would not be manufactured in Australia but imported from pharmaceutical companies that supplied other heroin trials across the globe.
On 14 March, NSW Premier Morris Iemma condemned as ‘absurd and disgusting’ a plan by the Greens to decriminalise the use of drugs, including ice. Mr Iemma said such a policy would never go ahead because fair-minded people would not support it. He said:
It is just an absurd, ridiculous and disgusting policy.
Mr Iemma said that any MP who supported such a policy was ‘completely out of touch with reality’. What hypocrisy! If the New South Wales Premier were fair dinkum, he would not do preference deals with a party that comes up with, in his own words, ‘ridiculous and disgusting policy’.
The Greens ‘so soft on drugs’ policy states:
15. Support a rigorous scientific trial of heroin prescribed by accredited medical professionals, with intensive psychosocial support, to registered addicts ...
…         …         …
17. Fund a few additional medically supervised injecting rooms and expanded needle exchange programs in locations where such facilities will improve community health and social outcomes …
…         …         …
19. Support trials of analysis of drugs at dance and other venues to reduce health risks …
…         …         …
23. Make the possession and growing of small numbers of cannabis plants for personal use not illegal;
24. Work towards responsible alternatives to cannabis prohibition, including regulation of cultivation and sale to adults with appropriate legal restrictions and health warnings …
…         …         …
26. Allow drugs to be regulated and prescribed for medicinal purposes based only on their therapeutic and palliative effects …
…         …         …
34. Support the immediate repeal of the legislation that enables the use of sniffer dogs for drug detection where there are no prior reasons to suspect a drug offence has occurred, and still allow for the use of sniffer dogs in customs-related contexts and points of entry security.
The Greens’ policy on drugs makes them the drug-friendly party. They want doctors to prescribe heroin and cannabis. They want marijuana to grow in the backyard next to the Hills hoist. This is how they would green Australia.
The Greens’ economic policy is a classic oxymoron. Firstly, they opposed the tax cuts in the 2006 budget, where Mr Costello handed out $37 billion in tax cuts. In their own words:
The Greens are committed to phasing out the coal industry.
Their policy states:
The Greens will work to:
stop the development of new coal mines and the expansion of existing coal mines and coal handling infrastructure ...
…         …         …
provide just transitions for communities that have traditionally derived income and jobs from coal mining operations;
phase out of all subsidies to coal mining and impose levies on coal mines to pay for just transitions, mine rehabilitation and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency; and
expose “clean coal” and carbon capture and storage as dangerous myths that distract from the urgent task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The Queensland Greens are even more specific, saying:
The Queensland economy is unbalanced because of its dependence on coal exports and coalfired power stations.
The policy, at point 3.6, states that they would:
Place a moratorium on issuing of licences for new coal-fired power stations.
Point 3.7 states that they would:
Begin to phase out coal-fired power stations, starting with older, less energy efficient stations.
Australian mining and mineral processing industries employ more than 320,000 Australians, and ABARE forecast that the combined earnings from Australian minerals and energy exports will increase by eight per cent in 2007-08 to $116.5 billion.
Labor want us to believe that they support working Australians but, by doing preference deals, they are endorsing the sort of left-wing, job-strangling extremism that Bob Brown was peddling in Central Queensland recently. Bob Brown says that we have to stop coal exports and that we have to do it within three years—

Senator Faulkner interjecting—

 (Senator Barnett)—Order! I think you were referring to Senator Bob Brown.
—Senator Bob Brown says that we have to stop coal exports and that we have to do it within three years. But it would be absolutely irresponsible to shut down Australia’s $25 billion export coal industry, which supports 30,000 regional jobs and is the backbone of many regional communities in Queensland. Coal accounts for around 80 per cent of Australia’s power and is Australia’s single largest export commodity.
The Australian Coal Association estimates that 130,000 families are directly or indirectly dependent on the coal industry. Even more families would lose their livelihood if energy intensive manufacturing industries were forced offshore by power generators no longer having access to coal. Senator Brown said that to suddenly ban coal exports would be massively dislocating—he has got that right—but that we have got to do it and we have to do it within a period of three years, a term of government. Senator Brown treats mining-dependent families with utter contempt. They can be moved, reallocated or dismissed. He does not say where to or how. The Greens’ policy is that the transition itself would be funded from the mining industry. How that is going to happen while they are going out of business is anyone’s guess. The only thing that Senator Brown does not want to move is trees. He would go to jail for a tree while sending mining families to the bankruptcy courts.
Peter Garrett has refused to reject a ban on new mines in the Hunter Valley, saying that the expansion of the coal industry such as we have seen in the upper Hunter region over the past decade is a thing of the past. How long will it be before other mining industries also come under attack from a Labor Party prepared to back the anti-mining policies of the radical Greens and include a left-wing, anti-mine protester on their front bench? The coalition government supports mining and mineral processing as valid and valuable contributors to regional employment in particular and to the national economy in general. The government will continue to work with the mining industry to ensure a future in Australia.
Australia’s mining and mineral processing sectors have directly contributed more than $500 billion to Australia’s wealth over the past 20 years and are responsible for significant infrastructure development. Since 1967, the industry has built 26 towns, 12 ports and additional port bulk-handling infrastructure at many existing ports, 25 airfields and over 2,000 kilometres of railway line. Rather than put aside our enormous natural advantage in coal resources, the Australian government believe we should work on ways to reduce the greenhouse consequences of using them. To this end, we have so far invested $275 million in the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund in four projects. That represents an investment of around $1.75 billion in developing low-emission coal technologies. As a result of this investment, it is expected that clean coal power will start being fed into the electricity grid from the year 2009.
Labor plus the Greens equals a dangerous political equation in our parliaments and our economy. There should be no room in Australia for political deals with extremists who are soft on drugs.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-03-21,"—My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Human Services. Can the minister confirm that the government is continuing to evaluate the two access card tenders before the actual access card bill has passed? How can the government be effectively evaluating these tenders when the regulatory framework for the access card has not been established? Will the minister be signing contracts for these two tenders before the bill has become law? What does the minister’s department estimate the value of these proposed contracts to be? Is the minister exposing taxpayers to a financial risk by rushing the implementation of the access card?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-03-21,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm whether any evaluation has been made of the potential risk of any funds following this process of moving tenders forward? Also, given the significant concerns raised by the community during the recent Senate inquiry, why is it that your government is so intent on putting Australian taxpayers’ dollars at some risk by rushing the implementation of this card?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-03-21,"—As previously announced, evaluation of the two tender processes is continuing. That was announced some time ago. What I have said recently is that, in response to the Senate committee report, instead of having the bill brought before parliament in two tranches I have agreed to deal with it as one package. That does not change anything as far as the evaluation of the tenders goes. That evaluation is ongoing. Of course, the signing of any tender would take place after the passing of any legislation.
This is not an unusual practice. We have seen examples previously, such as with the Australian business number. When that was introduced, systems were largely finalised prior to the bill being passed. The systems design work on the maternity payment and maternity immunisation allowance also commenced before the legislation was passed in that case. Another precedent is the working credit initiative under the Australians Working Together initiative, which started in early 2001. Systems design work on that commenced prior to legislation being passed.
So there are certainly precedents for this being done. There is nothing untoward in it. In fact, I think it was Senator Lundy who acknowledged during the public hearing on the access card legislation that the separation of the tender process into components was sound practice. That is what we have done: we have separated that tender process into components. There is no reason why that evaluation of tenders cannot continue. The selection of preferred systems integrator and card issuance and management tenderers will occur later this year.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Smartcard</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-03-21,"—The simple answer to that is that the government is not putting at risk taxpayers’ money. What we are doing with the access card is providing the Australian community with a more efficient means of accessing government benefits, a saving to taxpayers by way of enhanced security against ID fraud and fraud against the government and also a more robust protection of individuals’ identities.
I am sure those opposite and other senators would agree that the Medicare card, which is 23-year-old technology, is susceptible to fraud. It proved to be so just last week—in a Melbourne court we saw someone charged with some 40 counts of fraudulent activity involving Medicare cards. This is what we are trying to do: crack down on fraud, provide Australians with greater efficiency and a streamlined process for accessing government benefits, and provide savings to the Australian taxpaying community. This is a benefit that will bring a great deal of advantage to all Australians. (Time expired)

I draw the minister’s attention to the continued repression of political opponents to the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. I ask the minister whether she can outline to the Senate the government’s position on further targeted sanctions being applied to that country, including further economic sanctions from Australia, and also the suggestion by the former captain of the Zimbabwean cricket team Andy Flower that some kind of sporting sanction could be applied. I do acknowledge that members of the government have made comments to this effect, and I ask the government to outline for us the government’s position on such sanctions.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Zimbabwe</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-03-21,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I asked the minister to outline the government’s opinion on further economic sanctions that have been called for, including from members in this place. I also ask whether the minister is aware of a recommendation by the International Crisis Group, which actually suggests that members of families who are the subjects of those targeted sanctions applied by the EU or the US have their visas or their residency permits cancelled. Is the government aware of any Zimbabweans currently in Australia who fall into that category—that is, the children or relatives of people who are subject to those particular sanctions? If that is the case, what will the government do about considering or revoking those visas or permits? Once again, I want to clarify: is the government saying that it will not consider a sporting sanction but it is clearly leaving it up to the cricket board, or will our government consider, as it has done previously in relation to South Africa and apartheid, supporting a sporting sanction?

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-03-21,"—Thank you to Senator Stott Despoja for a question about a matter that obviously is of great concern to the Australian government and, I am sure, to everybody in this chamber. Before addressing some of Senator Stott Despoja’s specific questions, I wish to place on record, on behalf of the minister, that the government is appalled at the barbaric actions of the Zimbabwean government in violently suppressing the activities of the political opposition on and after 11 March. I am sure the Senate would wish to know that Mr Downer made our views very clear to the Zimbabwean charge d’affaires on 15 March. Mr Downer’s department also called him in on 16 March.
We are urging Zimbabwe’s neighbours—who would have the greatest leverage over Zimbabwe, as Senator Stott Despoja would appreciate—and key members of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to use their influence to persuade the Zimbabwean government to respect the rule of law and the civil and political rights of its people. We are working with countries concerned about the political and economic catastrophe in Zimbabwe to place greater pressure on the leadership, including by allowing the situation to be considered by the United Nations Human Rights Council. I think it has been said in the press, but it is worth repeating that the Australian ambassador and the consul in Harare are appalled at the injuries sustained by Mrs Sekai Holland, Mr Morgan Tzvangirai and other leaders. Inquiries have been made as to their current condition, their having been severely beaten in detention.
Australia has imposed progressively strengthened travel bans and financial sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean government since 2002, and we urge other countries to do likewise. The Zimbabwean government’s policies have crippled a once-thriving economy, leaving citizens to endure hyperinflation. Zimbabwe’s unemployed population is living very close to the poverty line. Perhaps the most appalling statistic is its lowest life expectancy of any country.
Senator Stott Despoja asked about the implications for Australia’s One Day International tour to Zimbabwe. Mr Downer has previously called on the International Cricket Council to change its rules to allow teams to forfeit tours to countries where serious human rights abuses are occurring. It will be up to Cricket Australia to consider a range of issues on its mooted One Day International tour of Zimbabwe, including the security of the Australian team, and to consider with the ICC just how the game of cricket could possibly be seen to be served by international tours to Zimbabwe.
I also have some very recent information, which is that the Prime Minister has apparently said that he will speak to Mr Downer about this issue but that he has an inclination to maintain his previous position that the government would prefer that the tour did not go ahead but that the decision would be left to Cricket Australia, noting that it does have some attendant obligations to the ICC.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Zimbabwe</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-03-21,"—It was a long supplementary question, and I intend Senator Stott Despoja no disrespect by not being able to deal with all of it as comprehensively as I would choose to. Perhaps I will deal with the last question first. It is the case that the Prime Minister has asked Mr Downer to consider the position of the tour. The government’s present inclination is that we would prefer that the tour did not go ahead but that we would leave the decision to Cricket Australia, noting that Cricket Australia has some attendant or other obligations to the ICC. Whilst the government might have a clear preference, the position that Cricket Australia takes will be a matter for it—but the government’s view would be drawn to its attention.
As to the issues to do with economic sanctions, I think those deserve a much longer answer than I am able to give right at this very moment. But I will check, for the purposes of providing a comprehensive answer, whether there are children or relatives in Australia of the category that Senator Stott Despoja talks about.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Zimbabwe</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-03-21,"—On Thursday, 1 March, in a question from Senator Faulkner, I undertook to obtain further information on the force guided missile frigates. I table additional information provided by the Minister for Defence and seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Senator Faulkner asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, without notice, on 1 March 2007:
I refer the minister to the project to upgrade the Navy’s guided missile frigates, originally intended to deliver six fully upgraded, mission capable warships. Is the minister aware that the government canned the upgrade of the two oldest ships in November 2003 because of the massive delays that were already being experienced.
Can the minister confirm that former minister Robert Hill said at the time that the contract would be renegotiated to account for the fact that only four ships would be upgraded, instead of the planned six.
Can the minister confirm that, as a result of those so-called ‘negotiations’, taxpayers will still pay the full price of the upgrade.
Can the minister now explain why he thinks it is a good deal to get four upgraded ships for the price of six.
Senator Minchin—The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
The Government did not “can the upgrade of the two oldest ships in November 2003 because of the massive delays that were already being experienced.” 
 That is an incorrect assertion. What is correct is that the FFG Upgrade now seeks to regain the original relative capability of four guided missile frigates.

On 7 November 2003, the Government announced it had made a number of decisions which would lead to some rebalancing of the Defence Capability Plan as a result of the Defence Capability Review just completed. 
 One of those key decisions was to strengthen the Navy’s defensive air warfare capability.
 
 The anti-ship missile defence projects then being implemented were to be complemented by the introduction of SM2 missiles to four of the FFGs and the acquisition of three air warfare destroyers.
 
 To provide offsets, the two oldest FFGs were to be decommissioned and removed from service from 2006.
 
 This was to address the total operating costs, including maintenance and personnel, for the existing FFG class of six ships.

HMAS Canberra was subsequently removed from service in late 2005. 
 On 16 January 2006, the Minister for Defence agreed to defer the decommissioning of HMAS Adelaide until no later than the end of 2007.
 
 This has subsequently been extended to January 2008 to accommodate operational needs and provide more flexibility in managing the relocation of HMAS Adelaide’s crew.

Disposal of the ships will be through a transfer of HMA Ships Canberra and Adelaide to the Victorian and NSW governments respectively to be sunk as dive wrecks to provide opportunities for tourism and revenue.
Yes.
No. 
 The FFG Upgrade prime contract has been renegotiated and a Deed of Settlement and Release signed 29 May 2006.
 
 This has formalised the Government’s decision (of November 2003) to reduce the FFG Upgrade project from six to four ships; settled a number of outstanding commercial and contractual issues on this project; agreed a revised viable contract master schedule with a Contract Final Acceptance of December 2009 but within the fixed price which was reduced by approximately $40 million dollars (Feb 98 Contract base date price) or $54 million dollars (May 06 Price).
 
 This reduction included savings from the lower installation costs for four ships.

As explained previously, the renegotiated contract includes a price reduction for four ships. 
 The upgrade of the four FFGs is an important capability for the Navy, in conjunction with our eight ANZAC frigates, in maintaining the required total number of air warfare capable ships to support our operational commitments.

The FFG Upgrade contract is a fixed price contract and the contract scope reduction was initiated through the contract provisions of termination for convenience. 
 The reduced contract price requires the contractor to deliver all the contracted supplies except the installation of equipment into the two ships not now being upgraded.

The ‘ship sets 5 and 6’ equipment remain as contractual deliverables and it is likely that this equipment will now be used for a variety of applications. 
 These include provision of in-country training for both operators and maintainers in Sydney and Perth, in some cases replacing training previously provided in the United States; risk reduction activities for the FFG SM-1 replacement project (one set of radar and onboard training system equipment retained in the United States for system development and test activities); additional integration and support assets at the FFG Upgrade Warfare Systems Support Centre in Garden Island, Sydney; and major support spares for the four upgraded FFGs.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-03-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I particularly want to address my remarks at this point to the answers given by Senator Ellison, the Minister for Human Services, to those questions about the government’s proposed access card. In doing so I note, as was evident in the questions, that last week the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled what I said was an excellent report on the proposed Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007. That is the bill that covers the access card.
This report was a near-unanimous report. All members of the committee, except one government senator, agreed with the findings of the committee and the content of the report and supported the recommendation of the report. There was only one recommendation and that was that this legislation should be deferred or withdrawn and only brought back to the parliament as part of a consolidated legislative package to pick up the further tranches of legislation the government have said they are preparing and contemplating. But the report also went on to identify a range of serious concerns that the committee felt the government should consider in preparing that consolidated legislation. These were concerns that were raised by witnesses during the three days of public hearing.
The arrogance of this government was there for all to see in the way that it handled this bill. The committee was given virtually no time—a couple of weeks—to consider this very important legislation and this very complex proposal. The minister today said that there had been an exposure draft released for public comment. It was released just before Christmas last year. Essentially, the public only had the period over the Christmas-New Year months to consider it. What arrogance to release such an important exposure draft at that particular time of the year.
I want to quote from the report. I congratulate Senator Mason on his recent appointment and also on his excellent chairmanship of our committee. The committee said:
With only the first tranche of the access card legislation before it, the Committee has also been put at a disadvantage in that it does not know the detail of key provisions and measures that are intended to be addressed in later legislation. That the provisions held over relate to critical matters such as reviews and appeals, privacy protections and oversight and governance measures does little to allay the Committee’s general unease with the adequacy of this bill.2 In essence, the Committee is being asked to approve the implementation of the access card on blind faith without full knowledge of the details or implications of the program. This is inimical to good law-making.
The committee further goes on—and this refers to the fact that the department already had out there in the marketplace calls for tenders, when this legislation had not been considered by a committee of the parliament or by the Senate itself:
In addition, two tender processes, one for the systems integrator, the other for card issuance and management, were running during the Committee’s consideration of the matter. This could be seen as undermining the authority of the Committee by creating the impression that passage of this legislation is preordained, rendering Senate oversight superfluous.
The committee goes on:
The Committee cannot accept that priority has been given to tender processes at the expense of reasonable time for the Parliament to scrutinise properly a complex piece of legislation.
And there are another 92 pages or so of the majority report that detail the very serious concerns raised during the committee’s public hearing.
Yet in the second reading speech on this bill, when it was put before the parliament, the minister referred to people who opposed this legislation as ‘friends of fraud’. We had the AMA, the Australian Bankers Association, Carers Australia, the Royal College of General Practitioners, Legacy and even the Office of the Privacy Commissioner appear before our committee and point out genuine concerns with this rushed legislation. This government arrogantly called them ‘friends of fraud’. The minister has done the right thing and accepted the committee’s report at last. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-03-21,"—I have to say I am a little disappointed by the approach of senators opposite. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which inquired into the access card, I was quite struck by the bipartisan and cross-party willingness to support the goals, the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007 itself and the efforts to improve the legislation. I appreciate that it is an election year and that there is the strong temptation on the other side to reduce all issues to partisanship. I need to acknowledge that that temptation appears to have been succumbed to on this occasion by Labor senators.
I must put to bed some of the opposition’s assertions. The first is that the Senate finance and public administration committee was damning of the government. Mr Deputy President, you would well know that the Senate’s and the committee’s job is to review legislation and to seek to improve it, and that is what the committee did. What is more, the government appreciated the report. The report actually supported the goals of the legislation. The report said:
... at the heart of the proposed access card system are two primary goals:
Improving delivery of Commonwealth human services and benefits; and
Combating fraud, particularly in relation to identity theft.
It went on to say at 3.2:
The Committee endorses goals to streamline the delivery of Commonwealth benefits and prevent fraud. The Committee supports any policy that will facilitate access to those who are eligible while forestalling access to those who are ineligible.
The report made one recommendation:
The Committee recommends that the bill be combined with the proposed second tranche of legislation for the access card system into a consolidated bill.
The government accepted that recommendation. The report listed a range of other matters for the government to take into account, and the minister has undertaken to take those matters into account. To portray the report as a scathing attack on the government is an unfair depiction. Some of the language was plain and frank, even robust, but the former chair of the committee, Senator Mason, is a very plain-speaking man. The government certainly did not take the report as an attack. How do we know this? The then chair, Senator Mason, was promoted to parliamentary secretary four days later.
Labor are trying to have it both ways. Labor contend that the government through its majority in the Senate has trampled on the Senate, neutered its committees and nobbled its role as a house of review, and that we have a government that is arrogant and out of control. Yet here we have an instance where a committee has done its job. It is doing its job—it is reviewing legislation. It does not look to me like a neutered committee system. And here we have a minister whose response to the report was: ‘What a good report. I’ll accept the one recommendation and I’ll consider the suggestions.’ This is hardly the act of an arrogant government. It is hardly the act of a government hell-bent on ramming the legislation through. To senators opposite: you cannot have it both ways; you have to get your lines straight. The Senate’s systems and committees are either working, as you have claimed today, and reviewing legislation—in which case democracy has not ended, as was predicted, and the Senate has not been trampled on—or not working. You cannot have it both ways.
The access card, as all committee members agreed, is needed. We need it to combat welfare and health fraud, to make identity theft harder and to make accessing services easier for Australians. The access card will certainly do this. At the same time, and very importantly, we need to protect the privacy of the information about Australians which is held by the government. The access card will not and should not be a national ID card. It is not the government’s intention. No-one on the committee would support that. Senator Ellison’s quite sensible proposal to accept the committee’s recommendation to consider both bills together will help to ensure that public confidence in the access card is maintained. That is the objective of the government and the objective of the committee. I commend Minister Ellison on his willingness to consider the committee report, on his ready acceptance of the committee’s recommendation and on his undertaking to consider the further matters which the committee recommended for consideration.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-03-21,"—It is genuinely encouraging to see that so many people here have read the report—although it seems to me that the people who are here were all on the committee. In his answers today the minister referred to the committee’s recommendation. The significant recommendation of our committee was that the bills be put together. It is genuinely encouraging to see that the minister has accepted that. We found that out by him telling us in this chamber—we have not had a formal response—and I would like to see a lot more of that.
In answering questions today, the minister once again—and I am going to quote Senator Fifield’s comment about taking things both ways—acknowledged that there were issues in this report on which all members of the committee agreed, and those issues were around the focus and intent of the legislation. There was never any question that any member of the committee had any problem with the intent of the legislation. That was restated consistently not just by members of the committee but by many of the people who came and gave evidence to our committee. There was no-one who took the time and effort in the extraordinarily restricted time frame to give evidence to our committee who said that they supported fraud in any way, shape or form in any part of government service delivery. That was agreed by everyone, and that was a really important starting point.
The third consecutive minister from this government who has had carriage of the legislation, when asked today quite reasonable questions about process, reverted to the same old attack. Anyone who had any opposition to anything, who had any questions about the extraordinarily ridiculous time frame in which the whole parliament was expected to consider this very complex legislation or who sought more information was immediately labelled as a friend of fraudsters. It is that old tactic of labelling first instead of debating: label first and then maybe get around to talking about the issues, as Senator Forshaw pointed out. The minister said that we should ask questions of ourselves about what our position on fraud is before we start asking questions about the access card. Let us get this really clear: there is no-one in this place who supports the defrauding of government services.
We have not seen this new combined bill. The only information which we had before us as a committee was the original bill. Most witnesses who came before our committee restated their concerns about the speed with which this committee was moving. They were concerned about the lack of detail that was provided to them in this very complex process and they wanted to have all the information before the parliament, and the whole Australian community were forced to live with whatever came out of the process. That is not too difficult a concept. That is, as Senator Fifield presented, the way that this parliament should operate. We should be able to effectively review legislation and improve it. That was the intent of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. There were many points about which members of the community and people who represented different groups were concerned.
—And Professor Fels was one of them.
—You are quite right, Senator Forshaw. Professor Fels, the gentleman that the government appointed to head up the committee looking at the key issues around privacy and protection, was engaged with the committee in a very valuable discussion about the issues that were raised and about ways we could work together to improve them. The main issue, though, was the speed with which the government were moving. They were determined to push through this legislation. They had a three-day committee hearing. We were meeting on the last night until very late just to get some processes completed.
My questions today were about the process, about the letting of tenders and also about the speed of this process. The minister could not come up with a response to the issue of speed. He talked about the issue of tenders but did not answer the question about whether there had been any financial investigation into the possible cost of letting tenders before the infrastructure is clearly defined. We asked those questions and again we did not get answers. We hope that there will be an effective process put in place around this whole issue that balances the issues of privacy and accountability. Minister No. 3, do not accuse us of being friends of fraud. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2007-03-21,"—It is interesting to hear Senator Moore tell us that no-one supports fraud in this place. Perhaps Senator Moore will tell that to Premier Alan Carpenter. I want to put on record a report that appeared on the ABC in which it was revealed—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The previous comment made by Senator Fierravanti-Wells breaches the Senate rules about reflecting on other people.
—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, it might be worth while withdrawing.
—It was not my intention to reflect on someone. My intention—
—Withdraw.
—I withdraw my comments. I want to refer the Senate to some reports that have appeared on the ABC relating to Ms Archer in Western Australia. It was revealed in a report of 12 March that Ms Archer was given a spent conviction 15 years ago for social security fraud and that she had not disclosed this to the Premier. The ABC report says that she was found guilty of receiving a single parent pension on 35 occasions when she was not entitled to one. This is the same Ms Archer who is under pressure over revelations that she acted as a go-between for former Premier Brian Burke to help him obtain information from ministers. The opposition has correctly accused the Premier of being weak for not demanding her resignation. All we are seeing here is the Premier saying that it is unlawful but not being prepared to do anything more. It is all very well to hear about people not wanting to support fraud, but this is the very sort of fraud that we need an access card to combat. I wanted that on the record. We all agree that we need to combat fraud and this is the sort of thing that the access card would address.
In the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I made some comments that were not in unison with the rest of the committee. I do believe that there is some benefit in the bill being combined with the proposed second tranche of legislation into a consolidated bill. It will enable the important concepts of security and privacy protections to be considered in their entirety. But I think that the report fails to give regard to the benefits of the access card in its proposed form in meeting its stated objectives.
I would like to make some comments particularly about the identity card concept. The government has specifically stated in the bill:
… access cards are not to be used as, and do not become, national identity cards.
There are significant penalties in the bill to prohibit people from demanding the card for anything other than health, veterans or social security benefits. An ID card would be carried at all times and presented on demand, and penalties would exist for not possessing a card. The access card has none of these features. The access card would only be required in situations where the cardholder is accessing government services. The primary objective of the access card is to streamline and secure access to government benefits and services. I refer the Senate to extracts of a report by KPMG that were tabled. They estimated that efforts to eliminate welfare fraud would save taxpayers in the vicinity of $3 billion over 10 years. KPMG representatives told the Senate inquiry that they consider this estimate to be conservative. This is the sort of thing which probably would have caught Ms Archer, who on 35 occasions received a single parent pension to which she was not entitled.
One of the issues that have been raised is the photograph. The need for the photograph on the card is a key aspect of the access card. Without a photo on the card the system will still be susceptible to fraud and taxpayers will have to wear the cost. The photo on the card is needed to reduce fraud and system complexity. It will also increase customer convenience by providing a quick and convenient verification of the cardholder, providing a user-friendly and reliable method of accessing Commonwealth benefits, improving access to Australian government relief in emergency situations and permitting access card holders to use their cards for such other lawful purposes as they choose. A photo will allow a person to simply and quickly prove who they are to agencies when accessing Commonwealth benefits. It will also assist in correct identification when customers undertake transactions. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-03-21,"—I want to respond to Senator Coonan who once again deliberately misleads—
—You will need to withdraw that.
—I withdraw—the Australian public about the extent and coverage of broadband in this country. Here are the facts, and I will state them again. I have spoken on this issue before in the chamber. I want to make sure that Australians who are listening today understand the parlous state of the broadband network in this country. Here is what international organisations are saying about Australia’s broadband performance. The World Economic Forum ranks Australia 25th in the world for available internet bandwidth and Australia’s networked readiness at 15th in the world and falling. The OECD ranks Australia 17th out of 30 surveyed countries for the take-up of the ‘fraudband’ known as 256 kilobits per second entry-level broadband.
Despite growth off a low base, Australia’s relative position did not change in the previous two years. In fact, despite Senator Coonan taking a dorothy dixer from her own team to try to champion the state of Australia’s broadband infrastructure, ACCC figures released recently on the pace of Australian broadband take-up show that Australia’s broadband growth rate fell in every quarter of 2006. That is right: fell. Our growth rate is falling. Australia’s broadband growth rate in September 2006 was the slowest since 2002. But it is not just the Labor Party talking about this. Travel anywhere in the country. I have travelled to Bacchus Marsh, a new housing estate. Broadband is a critical piece of infrastructure for the survival of home businesses and small businesses in a modern economy. They could not get access to real, genuine broadband. This is a disgrace in a modern economy like Australia. I have travelled to Hasluck in the outer suburbs of Perth and to the outer suburbs of Melbourne. I have been to Tweed Heads. I have been to Cairns and North Queensland.
—‘I’ve been everywhere, man, crossed the deserts bare, man.’
—Senator Minchin has joined in there, and I hope we can get his singing on the record. I have been to these places and the cry is the same: how can we be living in a modern economy when we have no broadband? I met with a lady who was trying to contact her husband using Skype, a voice over internet application. She needed broadband to speak to her husband, who is one of those brave Australian policemen on duty for Australia helping to stabilise the Solomon Islands. She could not get to talk to him. His children wanted to talk to him. Funnily enough, he could get reception in the Solomon Islands, but she could not get reception in Tweed Heads. That is how farcical our position on broadband is. You can go all over the country, Senator Minchin, and find stories like this.
If Senator Coonan would get out of Sydney and out of the government VIP jet that she uses to tour around the country and meet with people other than at stage-managed media photo opportunities, she would discover that the state of broadband is not as she recently stated on national television when asked: nobody in metropolitan Australia is complaining about their broadband speed? My office computer went into meltdown. The Fairfax website went into meltdown. The ABC website—Senator Coonan was appearing on The 7.30 Report when she said that—went into meltdown. People could not believe that such words were coming from the person responsible—the minister—for enabling this country.
Broadband is an enabling technology. If only the National Party and Senator Nash had had the courage to stick to their guns when that National Party think tank—I know it is an oxymoron—said that we need a fibre-optic network in this country. If only you had had the courage to win the fight—not just go for the cheap $2 billion slush fund, as Barnaby called it—this country would be better off. If only you had had the courage to win the fight, to stick to your guns. You were a signatory to that, Senator Nash. If only you had stuck to your guns— (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-21,"—After four years of mayhem and bloodshed, the time has now come for a new strategy on Iraq. Mr Downer said this morning that we should give the surge—that is, the extra 20,000 American troops going to Iraq—a chance. Mr Howard says that this is now a fight against terrorists and will no doubt say tonight that we must stay the course until the job is done. What they do not say is that the fight has been a miserable, terrible strategic failure. The war on Saddam Hussein was won four years ago by military might and by destroying most of Iraq’s infrastructure and at least 60,000 of its citizens. But the war between longstanding Sunni and Shia enemies and against the occupation cannot be quelled by the military might of the United States and the rest of the coalition by greater fortification of the green zone or by training more Iraqi troops in methods of suppression. Like the so-called war on terror, there is no clearly defined enemy. Civilians are the biggest losers and the conflict is complex and ideological. Iraqis who welcomed Saddam Hussein’s demise now say this occupation is far more repressive.
Australia and the rest of the coalition misjudged this war in Iraq from the start. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was no threat to any other country, much less Australia. The UN did not give its sanction. The Australian parliament was not part of the decision. They also took no account of the internal forces that would be unleashed. There was and still is no exit strategy. The surge of 30,000 more soldiers will not work while the morgues are full in Baghdad and the hospitals are overflowing with people injured in the violence. Prisons are overflowing with insurgents. It will not work while the two million Iraqis who fled Iraq and who are trying to survive in Syria and Jordan remain there. At the present time 50,000 people every month are leaving Iraq.
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq says that 15 million Iraqis are now considered extremely vulnerable. Four million people depend on food assistance and only 60 per cent have access to the public food distribution system, 80 per cent do not have sanitation, 70 per cent have no water, 50 per cent are unemployed and 23 per cent of children are chronically malnourished. There is relentless insecurity and poverty in Iraq. Senior US military officers admitted last week that they were not able to stop what they described as ‘smart, agile and cunning’ insurgents from destroying heavily armoured vehicles and aircraft.
The people of Iraq remember the abuses at Abu Ghraib. Iraqis did not approve of their parliament recently handing long-term control of Iraq’s oil to foreign multinational oil companies. They see the Iraqi government as a puppet of the United States. According to the Pentagon’s latest report, Measuring stability and security in Iraq, the level of violence has reached the highest on record. Attacks on coalition forces as well as civilians rose to almost 1,000 a week. The military tactics of the 200,000 or so occupying forces for repressing the violence are not stopping that violence. This new war cannot be won by shooting more people.
The government talks about staying the course until the war is won. But the Prime Minister does not say what winning means or how long it will take. Military experts here and elsewhere say that this war is exacerbated by our presence, and the Iraqis also say they want us out. So just what should the new strategy be? Firstly, we say that Iraqis must be given a time frame for troop withdrawal, at least by the end of the year, Australian troops should come home at the end of their current tours of duty and control of the country must be handed over to the Iraqis.
Secondly, Iraq’s sectoral leaders and neighbouring countries such as Iran and Syria must be invited to the table and they must be invited by the United Nations. Agreement has to be reached on a way forward for Iraq. This should then be put to the Iraqi people. Thirdly, the United Nations should be brought into the reconstruction effort and many more countries around the world should participate. Iraq needs hospitals, it needs power supplies, it needs water, it needs sanitation, it needs food, it needs schools, it needs housing—and it needs much more. That will be a massive undertaking, but it will probably be a lot cheaper than what the occupation has cost. A report in the Australian the other day suggested that so far $3 billion has been spent by Australia on this war, including debts waived against Iraq.
Fourthly, the broader Middle East is part of this regional strife and a peaceful, fair, two-state solution must be found for Palestine and Israel. Fifthly, Australia must make its own decisions and it must engage with the United States in a much more robust manner on Iraq. And it should engage in that sense with Britain as well. Finally, Australia must never again attack another country without the support of the United Nations and the Australian parliament, and our law in this country should reflect that. The Democrats have in fact tabled a bill in parliament that would require Australia to seek the approval of the whole parliament before ever again attacking another country.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2007-03-21,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this MPI on Iraq and the way forward because it is the future that is important, not the past. It is important for Iraq, it is particularly important for the Middle East and it is important for the world generally. Australia is committed to contributing to the security, stability, reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq. Our assistance is at the request of the Iraqi government, which assumed responsibility on 31 December 2005 following the elections. Our assistance is endorsed by United Nations Security Council resolution 1723, passed in 2006 and extending its mandate well into 2007.
What is entirely clear is that, if the United States-led coalition were to withdraw precipitately from Iraq, it would strengthen terrorists everywhere, damage the global fight against terrorism and abandon Iraqis, including the more than 70 per cent who voted for democracy in the December 2005 election. Unilateral withdrawal from Iraq, however appealing it may appear, is a dead-end policy. The political victory of Hamas in Gaza after the Israeli withdrawal is a recent, clear Middle Eastern example of this. The tragedy of the jihadists and others in Iraq is that they are not powerful enough to govern nor strong enough to defeat the United States but they are powerful enough to spoil. Australia cannot be seen to be, nor can it be, part of any move to strengthen their aims. As an aside I think it is worth making the point that the impact of the Middle East problems on Muslims everywhere cannot be underestimated, particularly in South-East Asia and in Australia’s nearest neighbour and our friend Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim state on earth.
The Senate would be aware that on 10 January 2007 President Bush announced a new surge policy. This comprised additional troops to assist with the security situation, particularly in Baghdad, and a package of over $11 billion in additional funds for reconstruction. The Australian government strongly supports the new security plan. We consider it is the best hope for the Iraqi people. Our desire is that the Iraqi government be given the chance to step up to the plate with this historic opportunity to provide a better life for all Iraqis—and I mean that seriously. Not only should they be given the chance to step up to the plate; they should take it. I think there is some evidence that that is now occurring. To give this historic opportunity a chance, however, the Iraqi government requires the ability to secure itself from increasing criminal and sectarian violence.
What is the progress to date? Iraq now has a democratically elected government that includes representatives from the Shia, Sunni and Kurdish populations. The new security plan for Baghdad is designed, structured and led by Iraqis with US support. The crucial part of the plan is the provision of essential services, and the Iraqi government is expected to spend around $US11 billion on reconstruction and infrastructure projects. Though early in the process, there are some indications that the coalition is disrupting the planning and operations of the terrorists and sectarian militias.
Iraq recently hosted the neighbours conference—and I take up what Senator Allison said about the importance of Iraq engaging her neighbours. The neighbours conference was held on 10 March this year. It was attended by countries neighbouring Iraq as well as other Arabic representatives and the five permanent members of the United Nations. The conference was conducted in a positive atmosphere and resulted in the establishment of working groups to deal with security, refugees and fuel supplies. Further meetings are expected to take place possibly as early as April of this year. Regional cooperation is absolutely essential not just to finding a solution to the Iraq problem but also to balance the other competing major power in the region—namely, Iran.
Additional indicators of some of the progress being made in Iraq are that over 320,000 Iraqi police and soldiers have been trained and equipped. The Brookings Institution in New York says that per capita GDP has increased by over 20 per cent since 2002. Brookings also indicate that there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of children enrolled at high schools since before the war—that is an incredible number. Nearly 3,000 schools have been re-established since the war; crude oil production is at 2.3 million barrels per day, which is about 7½ per cent higher this quarter; oil revenues are higher than projected and latest figures show that they exceeded annual targets by $US1.7 billion in terms of barrels; electricity generation averaged 11 hours per day over the quarter across the country, which is up by two per cent on the last quarter; and 5.3 million Iraqis—which is an increase of one million people since August 2006—now have access to potable water.
What role does Australia continue to play in Iraq? We have two roles: one is our aid project and the other is the role the ADF plays in supporting the Iraqi security forces, particularly in the training of those forces. The coalition continues to make progress in southern Iraq, with two of the four provinces now under Iraqi security control. Australian troops are providing overwatch in these two provinces through the Overwatch Battle Group, are continuing to engage with local leaders and are available as back-up to the Iraqi security forces. The ADF is confident that the battle group will continue to receive the coalition support it requires to safely conduct its operations after the UK partial drawdown.
The situation in Iraq remains of grave concern but progress is being made in developing Iraqi self-reliance. We are proud of the contribution the ADF is making as part of the coalition to establish security and stability. The ADF is playing an important role in training the new Iraqi security force, providing security for Australian diplomatic missions, conducting maritime interdiction operations and air surveillance patrols, and contributing to coalition operations. Australia is also making a strong and effective contribution to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and the reconstruction of Iraq.
Since 2003, Australia has contributed over $173 million in aid: $66 million towards immediate humanitarian needs and $52 million towards reconstruction in the agricultural sector, water sanitation, food supply and distribution, human rights, and law and order. Australia has agreed to forgive some $US850 million in debt. A large part of the aid program is provided through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the UN, which have proven operations in Iraq; and Australia has supported them.
As I mentioned, the ADF in southern Iraq also provides assistance, including the provision of water supply, health clinics, power supply, agricultural assistance, upgrading printing facilities for local newspapers and road repairs. The Australian Federal Police also has a contingent deployed to Jordan to the international police training centre in Amman assisting with training new Iraqi police recruits.
This is a big effort for Australia in helping the Iraqi people build a secure and safe Iraq. There is no way we can look back; we must look forward. We must contribute in the ways that we are both in training the Iraqi security forces and in providing the aid that is necessary to reconstruct Iraq. It is a big effort, as I said. We will continue to do it, and there are signs that there will be a very hopeful and encouraging outcome as we move forward in the next few years.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-03-21,"—I indicate at the start that Labor does not support the exact wording of this matter of public importance, but it is useful that the Democrats have put the matter up for debate today. I want to make some remarks about Labor’s views. I would like to start with one of the things that Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to towards the end of his speech, which is the fact that, while there is political disagreement in this country about our engagement in Iraq, there is cross-party 100 per cent support for our troops there. We know they are operating in very difficult circumstances with a very high level of professionalism. They continue to do Australia proud. Our argument is with the political decisions that govern their deployment.
Let me reiterate from the outset what Labor have been saying for many months. Labor have always been opposed to the war. We voted against Australian participation. We spoke out against the government’s refusal to abide by the United Nations charter and its defiance of the United Nations Security Council resolution, and we strongly opposed the Howard government’s haste to involve our military forces in the war. Labor’s position, and that of the millions of Australians who oppose the war, has in part been vindicated by the horrific events that have occurred since the 2003 invasion.
However, I would like to stress that the debate on this matter is very important not just because it is the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq but because the Howard government’s Iraqi policies continue to feed the civil war that we are now witnessing. The Howard government’s policies have to change. Indeed, the perspective of four years of violence since the invasion just reinforces how wrong the government’s decision has been. Remember the Prime Minister’s reasons for going to war in the first place? He submitted multiple reasons for the ill-conceived 2003 invasion, and each and every one of those reasons has been discredited.
The Prime Minister’s first reason for justifying the invasion was on the basis of eradicating Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. That has been totally discredited. Weapons of mass destruction were not found—they did not exist—and the invasion occurred before the United Nations was permitted to conclude its weapons inspection program.
The second reason for the war was justified by the Prime Minister when he said that military force was necessary because the international sanctions regime had failed. The Prime Minister stated:
The old policy of containment is eroding. Saddam Hussein has increasingly been able to subvert the sanctions.
That has been discredited. It is pretty rich when you realise that the Australian Wheat Board was one of those most active in discrediting those sanctions. The Australian Wheat Board rorted the UN sanctions regime to the tune of $300 million and, furthermore, allowed Saddam Hussein to buy guns, bombs and bullets with the proceeds.
The third reason that the Prime Minister advanced was that we needed to save the Iraqi people, stabilise the country and bring about democracy in Iraq and in the wider Middle East. There is no evidence that that has been delivered either. Iraq is a security mess. There is a violent civil war in Iraq. Almost half of the total violent civilian deaths that have occurred in Iraq over the last four years have occurred in the last 12 months. Mortar attacks have quadrupled since the beginning of 2006. Massive bomb blasts, killing more than 50 people at a time, have nearly doubled in the last 12 months. Fatal suicide bombs, car bombs and roadside bomb attacks have also doubled in the same period. In February 2007, weekly civilian casualties averaged nearly 1,000 a week. The Pentagon’s own statistics show that weekly attacks have increased by 15 per cent since January 2006. The Lancet estimates that over 600,000 Iraqis are dead from the war and its effects. These are terrible statistics.
What is the result? According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 1.6 million Iraqis have been displaced internally and more than 1.5 million have fled to Jordan and Syria. These are significant numbers from an Iraqi population of some 26 million. The security of the Iraqi people has been severely diminished.
The fourth reason the PM has given to justify our role in Iraq is to fight terrorists. Again, the rhetoric does not match the reality. What is disappointing is the reluctance of the Prime Minister to acknowledge what is happening right now in Iraq. Our Prime Minister continues to misrepresent what is happening on the ground. The United States Ambassador to Iraq recently said that the ‘principal force of instability for Iraq was sectarian violence’.
A recent US defence intelligence estimate concluded that parts of Iraq were in a civil war. The evidence is now overwhelming. The classic strategic indicators of a civil war are all present in Iraq: a weak political power of the central government, increasing refugee movements, a level of societal violence and a declining national economy. Iraqi society is enmeshed in a fight between the Shiite majority and the displaced Sunni minority for the geopolitical control of Iraq. That is why Iraq requires a political solution.
Achieving a political solution requires two things—neither of which the Howard government has addressed. First of all it requires the putting of pressure on the Iraqi government to make the necessary political compromises and start governing in the national interest rather than pandering to sectarian interests. There is little evidence that Nuri al-Maliki’s government is willing to take on the militias that have emerged. The Mahdi Army, for example, is his power base. His administration will need to cut links with the Shiah militia death squads and the equally compromising links with Tehran.
The primary way to put pressure on the Iraqi government is to initiate a phased withdrawal of troops that makes the government assume more responsibility for what is happening to Iraqi society. Filling the gap makes for real pressure. This is precisely why Labor endorsed the phased withdrawal strategy recommended by the expert and bipartisan Iraq Study Group, chaired by former Republican Secretary of State James A Baker.
The second way to achieve a political solution is through encouraging Iraq’s neighbours, the other states in the region—like Iran, Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia—to help stabilise the pressure on Iraq and take a responsible and proactive interest in bringing about a sustainable peace. This means Australia should have been engaged in the Baghdad security conference which was recently held over the weekend of 10-11 March. But, despite all its rhetoric about how important Australia’s role is in Iraq, the Australian government was not invited and did not attend. Note how little comment was forthcoming from Foreign Minister Downer on the Baghdad conference. It begs the question as to why Australia did not actively engage by participating. One would have thought that it would have been in the national interest to participate and protect the interests of the Howard government’s policy of military commitment.
Prime Minister Howard said back in May 2003 that Australia would be in Iraq for weeks and not months. He ruled out additional combat deployments during the 2004 election. Despite this, the Prime Minister has constantly moved the goalposts about the role of our commitment of troops in Iraq. First it was about dealing with weapons of mass destruction. Then it was about regime change. Then our engagement was about protecting the Japanese engineers in the al Muthanna province. And then the role of our combat troops became one of ‘security overwatch’. The bottom line is that there has never been a clearly articulated mission statement for our military deployment, just as there was never the careful post invasion planning that is essential to all military operations.
Iraq has been a disaster. The cost in monetary terms of the Australian military commitment is now over $2 billion and rising. The cost to the Iraqi people can never be measured. It is they who have suffered, and it is they who will continue to suffer unless policies change. The Prime Minister in his speech today will again claim that Australia must stay the course in Iraq—whatever that means. But he will not say how it is in our national interest to stay the course in the middle of a civil war. He will not say how he is putting real pressure on the Iraqi government to find a political solution. He will not say what the mission statement for our combat troops is. He will not say what the contingency plan is if the surge strategy fails and the United States decides to begin withdrawing its troops. Australia does not need rhetoric about the past or the future. We need the government to acknowledge the realities. What is John Howard’s plan for our troops in Iraq? Who knows? Certainly Australians do not know. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-21,"—The Greens support this matter of public importance, and I go back to the period in 2002-03 when the Prime Minister of this country, on his own, made a decision to involve Australia in the illegal invasion of Iraq. He made no reference to the Australian parliament, and he ignored massive protest by people in the streets of Australia’s cities. One of the forecasts from international organisations at the time was that a war could lead to the deaths of up to 500,000 civilians. When I spoke about those figures in this place, government members rolled their eyes and laughed. But that is no longer the case, because the casualties, the sheer bloodshed, the terror, the awful inhumanity, the cruelty, the beheadings and the tortures in Iraq have exceeded anything in the Howard government’s experience under Saddam Hussein. And on it goes.
We now have President Bush saying that he will send an extra 20,000 troops to Iraq at a time when countries like Poland, Denmark, Spain and, more latterly, Britain have withdrawn and are withdrawing large contingents of troops from the country. The fact is that we have seen a political imperative to try to overcome increasing odds to win a hopeless war in Iraq. It is not going to happen. But we have President Bush, night after night, changing his position to try to accommodate his failed past pronouncements on the war and, extraordinarily enough, our Prime Minister simply following in his wake. It has been a blight on this nation and the independent regard that Australians hold themselves in that we have had a cipher of a prime minister—a sheriff, as President Bush described Prime Minister Howard when he was on his way to this parliament in 2003.
I remind members that when I spoke to President Bush in our parliament in 2003 about his need to uphold international law if he were to regain the respect of the world—and he broke that law in invading Iraq—the majority voted to have me removed from the chamber. How things have changed now. In 2007 a majority of people in Australia, a majority of people in the United States and a majority of Iraqis want the foreign troops withdrawn from Iraq. The repeated, almost bleating, statements by President Bush about democracy are denied by the hubris of people like President Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Howard, who deny what the public thinks. Mr Howard is worst of all, because he never referred his plans to send a contingent of Australian defence forces, good and true, to President Bush’s adventurism in Iraq to this parliament.
They had to do that in the United States. It was debated in the United Kingdom. But here, it was a decision made by the Prime Minister, arrogantly defying the better interests of this nation. Now, some four years down the line, he does not have the stature to say: ‘I made a mistake. I should bring the Australian troops home.’ Those Australian troops, who have served this nation so wonderfully, should never have been sent to Iraq for the political reasons that the Prime Minister had, and they should be brought home now for the national reasons that are in the best interests of this great country of Australia.
If you look at the upheaval and the insecurity in Iraq, you can see that one great promise that the Prime Minister made—which was that, by fighting in Iraq, we would make the world a safer place—has turned out to be blatantly untrue. Today, on a New South Wales radio station a child read out her essay marking the fourth anniversary of the Howard government’s misadventure in involving Australia in and sending troops to Iraq. In her essay she said that she and her friends felt less safe. They were worried that their bus might be blown up. They did not have a feeling of security. They have an increased sense of insecurity because of Prime Minister Howard and in the wake of President Bush and their failure as leaders to make decisions in the interests of their nation.
This world is a less safe place. Andrew Wilkie, from the Office of National Assessments, had the courage to leave that department, to sacrifice his job and his career—and an honourable career it was—to warn that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq well before the invasion began. For his trouble, he was vilified by this Prime Minister and this government. And, in the event, it has been shown that the government was wrong and, along with the Bush administration, lied to the citizenry. It has also been shown that the evidence of weapons of mass destruction was false. Prime Minister Howard said that he would not take part in a war in Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein—that he was not about regime change. So he cannot use that excuse now. What a mistake he has made.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-03-21,"—Today when we look at the nation of Iraq we see a nation in the middle of a significant transformation—a transformation after decades of neglect, corruption and oppression by a brutal regime. How and whether or not we act now will determine whether that transformation can be one to a nation that can stand up and move forward. It is vital in the context of this debate, and in the view of the Australian government, that Australian troops remain in Iraq to secure and protect that reconstruction process. No-one pretends that it is a simple task or a small challenge, but it is one that we are prepared to meet where we can.
In contrast to previous speakers—excepting, of course, my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald—I want to acknowledge some of the very important things that the Australian government, our troops and our representatives in Iraq are actually doing. As the head of the national coordination for provincial reconstruction teams, US General Eric Olson, retired, is reported in the Bulletin magazine of last week as saying:
A withdrawal would be devastating for a province like Dhi Qar—
one of the provinces where Australia is present—
The US has decided that it does not operate in Dhi Qar anymore because it has gone under provincial Iraqi control. If it weren’t for the Australian Army, I couldn’t have a provincial reconstruction team here and we’d lose all influence and virtually all presence here.
That is a pretty clear statement about the role that the Australian presence plays in Iraq right now.
The Iraqi government itself has only been in office for just over 10 months. It is operating in an extraordinarily difficult security environment, but that government is endeavouring to work for the improvement of the Iraqi people. It is managing a range of issues like security, political and economic challenges, national reconciliation and reconstruction. In that context, the assistance of governments like Australia’s comes at the request of the Iraqi government. It is endorsed by UN Security Council resolution 1723. Our commitment is contributing to the security, the stability, the reconstruction and the rehabilitation of Iraq—and it is a commitment from which we do not intend to walk away.
What is clear is that, if the coalition were to withdraw precipitously, it would embolden terrorists everywhere—not just in Iraq. It would damage the global fight against terrorism. Most importantly, as far as I am concerned, it would abandon Iraqis—70 per cent of whom chose to vote and to exercise a democratic right, which we hold so precious, in their elections in December 2005. I cannot countenance that abandonment and I cannot agree with the proposition that we would help the Iraqis by leaving.
If you examine it critically, you see that the security situation for those in the two provinces of Anbar and Baghdad—where 54 per cent of the violence is occurring—is absolutely devastating. Has that been mentioned in the chamber this afternoon by those who speak in support of this matter and others? I do not think so. It is an important statistic that gets left out of the reporting time and time again.
Our commitment to Operation Catalyst in Iraq and more broadly in the Middle East includes the Australian Joint Task Force Headquarters of about 70 personnel; a security detachment of about 110 personnel, including ASLAVs, providing both protection and escort for government personnel who work in our embassy in Baghdad; and the Overwatch Battle Group West, based in the southern Iraqi province of Dhi Qar, which comprises around 520 personnel, a headquarters, a cavalry squadron, an infantry company, ASLAVs and Bushmaster vehicles.
The men and women involved in that job are extraordinary Australians doing an extraordinary job. The timetable for withdrawal of those people should be based on conditions on the ground, as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence have said, not on arbitrary calendar dates. No-one who says that we should withdraw or that we should pursue other options, including some of those discussed here today, is able to draw a picture of where that leaves the Iraqis. Day to day, where does that leave them? Does it leave everything to militants and terrorists, whose only desire is to bring down any foreseeable democratic process in that country? Is that what we are supposed to do? Is that the alternative with which we are left? I think not.
Our troops have a very important role in training and supporting the Iraqi security forces—previously in Al Muthanna and now in Dhi Qar province. We have recently announced an additional 70 trainers to help rebuild the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, but we cannot take our eye off the main goal of that military commitment: it is a sustainable transfer of security responsibilities to Iraqis. It is about progression for Iraq.
In terms of the humanitarian focus to which this matter of public importance refers, it is not possible—in my view, in the view of many commentators and in the view of the government—to pursue a strong humanitarian focus without security. That is why our role is so important. I go back to the words of General Eric Olson, which I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. Our contribution has been in humanitarian terms—from immediate humanitarian needs early after 2003, towards reconstruction in the agriculture sector, in water and sanitation, in food supply and distribution, in human rights, and in law and order. A large part of that commitment has been provided through multilateral agencies like the World Bank and the UN, which have proven operations in Iraq.
I think we should acknowledge it. I think we should talk about it more. I think we should let the Australian people know more about the importance of that focus, and about its importance to the humanitarian advancement of Iraqis. There are some real success stories in all of that, because work has been able to be carried out, particularly in areas where security has been addressed. Services have been restored in large areas of Iraq, despite repeated acts of sabotage by terrorists who seek to undermine the reconstruction.
In terms of basic health services, in 2005 alone emergency campaigns immunised 98 per cent of one- to five-year-olds against measles, mumps and rubella—something we take completely for granted in Australia—and 97 per cent of children under five against polio. We have been training staff at community based health centres, in conjunction with the international effort. More than 600 primary health care centres have been provided with ‘clinic in a box’ kits of key equipment and furniture, and 2,500 primary health care workers have been trained to expand the availability of essential primary health care services to children under five. In the agriculture sector where we work, we have done extraordinary things in training in the safe use of pesticides to help develop agriculture.
I can do little better than conclude with the words of one our soldiers on the ground in Iraq. Quoted in the Bulletin article was Major Jason Harley, an Australian CIMIC officer, who said:
I personally think Southern Iraq can be a success story. Nation-building is a big strategic operation and civilians do it a lot better than we do, but there can’t be any reconstruction if there’s no security. We’re here to facilitate that, but at the end of the day we’ll need to transition out and the civilians can come in for full reconstruction.
That is from a person doing the job on the ground. (Time expired)

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2007-03-21,"—Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the excursion into Iraq, and yesterday the leader of the federal Labor Party, Kevin Rudd, said that one of his first actions on becoming Prime Minister later this year would be to speak to President Bush and ask him for an exit strategy. I do not think that is an unreasonable request for one of America’s most loyal and longstanding allies to make. We have been allies with the United States formally since the 1950s, but we have had a long relationship with them. They should understand, as I am sure their administration does, that we may not necessarily agree all the time on the actions that they take. It is only right and proper that we seek and demand what the strategy to exit Iraq should be. It is only natural that we should expect it for a military excursion like this, which has been carried out finely by our troops in that part of the world.
The greatest effort by our armed forces since World War II was in East Timor. That is where we had probably the most of our armed forces committed in one single action. Are you telling me that, over in Russell Offices and DFAT, there were not scores and scores of committees and meetings held by those honourable public servants and military officers working on an exit strategy for East Timor? Are you telling me that they were not working out, chapter and verse, what would be the next step for our men and women to come home?
We still have a military presence in East Timor, but we do not have the thousands of troops, air men and women, and sailors that we did when we first went in there, because our people sat down and worked out how we were going to get back. We did that in Vietnam. Even before the Whitlam government was elected in 1972, our troops were on their way home, because those same public servants and military officers worked out what our exit strategy was going to be. So why shouldn’t we demand to know from the United States what their exit strategy is and what ours should be? We have an entitlement to do that.
Senator Payne talked about a ‘nation of Iraq’. Iraq was created after World War I at the peace conferences at Versailles. It is as much a nation, in that part of the world, as any of the other ones created after World War I—and we have seen the disastrous consequences throughout the Middle East and south-east Europe as a result of that. We are seeing a civil war that has been underway on and off for some time, with divisions within the Shia and the Sunni Muslims—let alone the Kurds, who have been demanding their own independence, as they have for some time. So let us not get distracted by the notion that this is about the nation of Iraq. Iraq did not exist before World War I, and it is slowly crumbling now.
Let me also point out certain issues about the exit strategy. President Bush’s father has been criticised because the neo-conservatives claim that during the first Gulf War he should have not stopped at Kuwait but continued through and dealt with Saddam. I wonder why he and his military officers and civil servants did not do that. I imagine it was mainly because the Americans did not know what they were going to do once they got there. They did not have any exit strategy. Their strategy was to kick Saddam out of Kuwait and reinstate the government that had been overthrown. They knew what they were doing there—and it was a success. The state of Kuwait still exists, its government is still in charge there and, for all I know, it is still as antidemocratic as it was before Saddam’s time there.
That leads me again to the fact that government senators have got up here and talked about that part of the world and about America, saying that it is trying to put democracy into Iraq. I wish it luck, because what has happened as a result of America’s excursion into Iraq? For a start, it now has to have relationships with some of the most autocratic and antidemocratic regimes in the world. Where are its relationships with any of these democracies in the Middle East? Maybe Professor Trood will enlighten us when he gets the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It has no such relationships. It is dealing with the most autocratic and antidemocratic regimes in the world, trying to impose—
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator Hutchins, I remind you that Senator Trood has the title of ‘senator’ in this chamber and I ask you to remember that.
—I will take note of that. I am sorry, Senator.
—Senator Professor Trood.
—Senator Professor Trood. It is dealing with some of the most autocratic and antidemocratic regimes in the world. One of the other reasons for our support of the actions in Iraq is associated with an understandable reaction to terror. But is the world safer? Senator Bob Brown said today that young women are ringing up radio stations in Sydney, concerned that they cannot travel on buses. Is the world safer from terrorism now? Has what has happened ended terrorism? Do we have a situation now where most of the Muslim world thinks that America and its allies are not to be trusted or, in fact, where it despises them? Are we not in a situation now where all those belonging to Western nations are slowly seeing their civil liberties eroding as a result of this conflict with terrorism? Haven’t we also seen that religion is being used now as a vehicle in ethnic struggles in Russia, China and India?
This is the result of what is going on in Iraq at the moment, and we rightly demand of the government and of our ally the United States to know what exit strategy there is. As a result of the money that is being poured into trying to prop up this regime in Iraq—they still have poverty of enormous proportions in that country—how long do you reckon it will be before the American people say to their own government that this is no longer tolerable? Maybe it will be at the next election. When do you reckon they might work out that it is more important to, say, raise test scores in Washington DC or in any other part of the United States, because of the money being diverted to actions being carried out internationally that should be carried out domestically?
I think the situation that we are being confronted with is frightening because it may mean that one of the leading democratic powers in the world, the United States, will go back into the isolationism it went into after World War I. Do we really want to see that country no longer engaging in the world? There are plenty of instances where our great ally has done the right thing—where it has used military force against the interests of other people to ensure that there were humanitarian outcomes. I think merely of what it did in Kosovo, when Dutch peacekeepers looked on while Serbs massacred ethnic Albanians. The Americans went in there and bombed them. That made the Serbs stand up, listen and stop what they were doing. The Americans are in difficulty here and it is our difficulty as well—because if we let them withdraw from their international engagements, we as a nation will suffer, as will all democratic countries in the world.
Senator Payne finished on a quote and I would like to finish on one as well. Francis Fukuyama, who wrote an article entitled ‘The Neoconservative Moment’, said:
The poorly executed nation-building strategy in Iraq will poison the well for future such exercises, undercutting domestic political support for a generous and visionary internationalism, just as Vietnam did.

",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-03-21,"—I welcome the opportunity this afternoon to contribute to this matter of public importance debate on Iraq, particularly because it seems to be wholly ill conceived. It seems to proceed on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of Australian policy in Iraq. That policy, of course, is founded on the proposition that we are engaged in reconstruction, rebuilding efforts and non-military activities in Iraq at this time. The matter asserts that we have a special responsibility for assisting in Iraq-building. One wonders who denies this. The government acknowledges that it has special responsibilities in Iraq. It acknowledges that it is a principal party to events there. It is precisely because of this acknowledgement and its determination to fulfil its responsibilities in assisting Iraq towards a politically stable and economically prosperous future that it undertakes this role.
Despite counsel coming from just about every side of Australian politics, including what we have heard in this chamber this afternoon, that we should ignore our responsibilities, neglect our friends and leave the Iraqis to themselves—in other words, desert them—in their time of greatest trial, the government’s commitment is to assist the Iraqis towards a more hopeful, stable, democratic and prosperous future. The debate on this subject in the other place yesterday and in the chamber this afternoon has tended to be preoccupied—at least among those on the other side, but not among my colleagues—with the history of Iraq. This is a pointless exercise. We have to deal with the realities on the ground that exist in March 2007. There is no point debating the past. It is irrelevant to the circumstances with which we are now confronted.
The reality is that we are facing an internecine struggle, a conflict, between the Sunnis and the Shiites, a remnant of the Baathist regime that is trying to reassert its position in Iraq and, most importantly, elements of al-Qaeda and its fellow terrorist travellers. These are the very same parties, the very same fellow travellers, who were implicated in the bombings in London, Bali, Madrid and New York and are supporting the insurgent cause in places all around the world. In recent years terrorist activities have taken place not just in the Western world but in parts of North Africa. That is the reality we are facing, and no-one doubts that this is a volatile mix. No-one suggests that it is anything other than a very difficult and challenging situation. No-one suggests—certainly not on this side of the house—that this is anything other than a very grave set of circumstances. And no-one doubts in that context that the Iraqis are suffering as a consequence of this very difficult situation.
But where in any strategic textbook do we find the proposition that you can improve a situation of the kind that exists in Iraq today by a premature withdrawal of forces? Where in any strategic culture is the idea, the thought or the suggestion that giving a notice of intention, as it were, to leave the battlefield—to withdraw at a certain time—is considered a sensible strategy? Where in any strategic textbook is that said to be a way of advancing a position? That seems to be precisely where the opposition is coming from on this matter.
Insofar as the opposition’s position is clear, the proposition it has put to us is that, once the federal election is held and should it win government, it will begin the process of withdrawal from Iraq. So the question arises: where in the annals of strategic thinking is there a proposition that you should yield a strategic advantage by telling the enemy ahead of time that you propose to depart? Where in Chinese strategic thinking, American strategic thinking, British strategic thinking, Persian strategic thinking or even European strategic thinking is that proposition stated? Of course it is not stated anywhere. Until this moment it had not existed in the context of Australian strategic thinking either. So a proposed Rudd government is putting to us a proposition to change strategic thinking that has existed for generations—thousands of years—that is, the importance of surprise and of maintaining the initiative. It will no longer support that proposition and, instead, we will yield the battlefield. It makes absolutely no sense.
We will withdraw from Iraq in due course. We will end our commitment in Dhi Qar province and Al Muthanna. As the government has made clear, it is not our intention to remain in Iraq indefinitely. The proposition has been put by those on the other side of the chamber today that the Iraqis want us to leave. The reality is far from it. Mr Maliki told the Prime Minister last week that he wishes that Australian forces will remain as long as they can to assist his country. We will withdraw our forces when conditions permit, and when we judge that we have assisted the Iraqis as much as we can to give them a secure future and the prospect of stability. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-03-21,"—At the request of Senator Robert Ray, I present the third report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 3 of 2007, dated 21 March 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In considering the bills that come before it, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee places considerable reliance on the explanatory material that accompanies each bill, in particular the explanatory memorandum.  If this material does not clearly explain the operation and impact of the legislative proposal under consideration then the work of both the committee and the Senate is made more difficult. 
In the Committee’s Third Report of 2007 both the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Customs agreed to amend the explanatory memoranda for the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Debt Agreements) Bill 2007 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007 respectively, to address concerns raised by the Committee. On behalf of the Committee I would like to thank the Attorney General and the Minister for these commitments. 
However the Committee remains concerned that it has to regularly seek information from ministers that should be included in explanatory memoranda.  This includes information on delayed commencement provisions, despite the fact that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel Drafting Directions indicate that such provisions should be explained in the explanatory memoranda. The Committee also regularly seeks advice on issues such as retrospectivity, the rationale for absolute and strict liability offences, legislation by press release, the wide delegation of powers and the reversal of the onus of proof.
Examples are included in the Committee’s Third Report of 2007, whereby Ministers have provided explanations for retrospectivity, in the case of the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007, and strict liability, in the case of the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Additional Screening Measures) Bill 2007, that are acceptable to the Committee.  Had these explanations been included in the explanatory memoranda to these bills the Committee could have satisfied itself that these provisions did not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, without recourse to the Minister.
The Legislation Handbook developed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet states that explanatory memoranda:
“should not simply repeat the words of the bill or restate them in simpler language.  The notes should explain the purpose of the clause and relate it to other provisions in the bill, particularly where related clauses do not appear consecutively in a bill.  Examples of the intended effect of the clause, or the problem it is intended to overcome, may assist in its explanation.”
Despite this direction, the Committee regularly sees explanatory memoranda that simply regurgitate words from the bill or fail to explain the purpose of potentially significant trespasses on personal rights and liberties, such as the imposition of absolute or strict liability.
If legislation is to be accessible to and understood by the Committee, the Senate and the community, it is essential that those preparing explanatory material include clearer and more fulsome explanations of provisions than currently occurs.  The Committee urges Ministers to ensure that explanatory memoranda are put through a rigorous quality assurance process so that they can best meet their aim of assisting “members of Parliament, officials and the public to understand the objectives and detailed operation of the clauses of the bill.” (1999, Legislation Handbook)

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-21,"—When the debate was adjourned for the lunchbreak today I was speaking on the need for Australia to establish an energy savings fund to look at providing funding to encourage energy savings and raise public awareness, to look at cost-effectiveness and to stimulate investment in innovative energy-saving measures. I consider it a completely unbalanced approach that the government is focused entirely on supply and not on reducing demand for energy.
For example, the government has recently announced its ban in relation to light globes. I am very pleased that we are going to see a transition to more energy efficient light globes. But what the government has not considered is the fact that many of the new varieties of light globes have mercury in them and also trigger epilepsy in a number of people. So there are going to be serious issues with the introduction of these. There will need to be some exemptions for people with medical conditions. Also, there may well need to be a deposit component so that you are required to take cradle-to-grave responsibility for these light globes.
If you had this kind of fund, it could fund the necessary research, policy development and so on for energy-saving devices, and there are endless numbers of them. There are different ways of reducing energy. We are going to have the rollout of smart meters—to whatever extent that occurs. I am unsure as to the level of commitment the government has to them. And of course we have all the issues surrounding mandatory energy performance standards, changes to the building code and so on. If we had such a fund, a whole range of innovative measures and technologies could be looked at.
It is exactly the same principle as a low-emissions technology fund to look at the supply side. I propose such a fund to look at the demand and energy efficiency side. It is quite a straightforward proposition, and I would be interested to know why the government is opposing setting up a fund for energy efficiency when it has in principle agreed with the notion of setting up a fund to increase renewable energy. Even though that has been distorted, it is still an in-principle decision to support the supply side but not the energy efficiency side.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-21,"—The Democrats will support this amendment, but I do want to caution against this approach. It is our preference for there to be energy efficiency trading rather than a levy system, which would have its own particular problems. As someone who negotiated $400 million in the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, I frankly do not believe that it is reasonable any longer to ask governments to do this, or at least not some governments. This one has managed to spread that money over a very long time frame. Some of the money is being spent on administration. The projects that were funded were only low-risk projects. There has been lost innovation and very poor demonstration projects at the end of the day.
I do not know that it is the best way to achieve the outcome that we are looking for, but I think Senator Milne recognises that. In many ways it sounds a good kind of project, but in some respects it is the fault of what this government does—gives grants and handouts for things which are not necessarily universal and which do not deliver the change that more structural changes might. Having said that, we will not oppose the amendment, but I think that the history of such proposals shows that there are better ways of doing it.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-21,"—I now move Australian Greens amendment (9) on sheet 5179:
(9)    Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 25), after item 6, insert:
6A  At the end of Part 9
Add:
42  Review of operation of Act
         (1)    The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of this Act to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Act 2007.
         (2)    The person who undertakes the review under subsection (1) must give the Minister a written report of the review.
         (3)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 12 months after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Amendment Act 2007.
This relates to an independent review of the operation of the act to be undertaken as soon as possible after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the act. It requires that there be a written report of the review and that a copy of that review be tabled in each house of parliament within 12 months after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the act.
There is a need for an independent review. We have had enough evidence over a decade of the government being in power—undertakings that were made that did not come to pass—to show that you need independent reviews of the operations of many of these pieces of legislation, as Senator Allison just indicated. We want to make sure that there is an independent review so that there is an honest appraisal of the effectiveness of this legislation. The government has refused to mandate implementation of energy audits and only requires that the audits be carried out, not that action has to be taken. As such, there has to be some assessment of the legislation’s effectiveness and of what energy savings have been made so that we can move to the next step. It is inevitable that there will be mandated implementation.
The independent review will occur after five years. Frankly, I would like to change it to a review after one year and would be happy to take an amendment to that effect if the government would support it. Five years is a very lenient time frame. We need to know who is right. The government is saying that you do not need legislation making it mandatory for companies to implement these audits. It is clear that both the Democrats and the Greens believe that you do. After 12 months or so, let alone five years, it should be obvious. Nevertheless, there is a strong argument for an independent review of the operation of the act.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-03-21,"—The government does not support the amendment. There is an evaluation time line in the explanatory memorandum of the act. The government sees this as an ongoing program that should be subject to continuous improvement. I agree with Senator Milne, though, that because of the public reporting that we talked about earlier it should be evident in a year or so how effective this measure has been in reaching the outcomes that we are seeking. There is public reporting of the outcomes on an annual basis, so there is effectively an annual review process of the effectiveness of this legislation. With the review and evaluation process that was noted in the explanatory memorandum, the government sees that it has the procedures in place to effectively consider the continuous improvement of this process and therefore does not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-21,"—I would like Senator Colbeck to clarify how the ongoing review—as he has described it—is going to let us have some insight into this. My understanding is that the review will be of compliance with the need to conduct an audit and not of what amount of energy savings have been achieved as a result of the audit being in place. The whole point here from my point of view is that we need to know whether conducting an audit is sufficient to change behaviour, result in investment and achieve outcomes in energy savings. We do not want a review that simply tells us that X number of companies conducted their audit. That is an administrative detail. I would like to know from Senator Colbeck what we are going to be told. At the end of 12 months, are we going to be able to see exactly how much energy was saved as a result of the implementation of the audit?",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-03-21,"—Companies, as well as reporting the efficiencies that they see might be achieved, are also required to report which energy savings they are going to implement.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2007-03-21,"—I rise tonight to talk about the announcement today by Labor of their proposal for telecommunications in this nation. Interestingly, we are seeing again a proposal for fibre to the node.
—Think positively about this!
—I am very positive about telecommunications. This fibre-to-the-node proposal looks remarkably like a proposal that came out last year under the then leader, Mr Beazley. What we are seeing with this proposal is absolute proof that Labor does not care one jot about rural and regional Australia. If there was ever a reason for people right around this nation not to support Labor in rural and regional areas, this is it. What they want to do is rip out $2 billion from the Communications Fund that this government set up, pushed very hard by the Nationals, to ensure future reliability in rural and regional areas.
—We want to put $4.7 billion in.
—What do you want to do? You want to rip it out. Not only that, you want to rip $2.7 billion out of the Future Fund—$4.7 billion all up. This is a rehash of a Beazley policy. The only difference with this one is that it has Mr Rudd’s name on the top and not Mr Beazley’s. That is the only reason anyone is taking any notice. They certainly did not take any notice last time this proposal was rolled out, because it was not going to work.
The other thing about this proposal is that it is going to target the capital cities. Interestingly, competition is already looking after the cities. We have a range of carriers in our metropolitan areas who are doing an extremely good job making sure that this nation gets the telecommunications it needs. What about the bush? What about rural and regional areas? There is going to be no money left—not one single bit. It is those rural and regional communities that are going to miss out in the proposal that has been put forward today by Labor.
What about the carriers that are currently providing telecommunications services? I saw Senator Conroy come out with his grand plan today. What happens to all those existing providers that are already rolling out services right across this nation? I wonder what happens to them. I understand it is going to be a tender process. Interestingly, Telstra has most of the infrastructure around this nation. So I wonder what is going to happen when it goes to tender and carriers other than Telstra wants to put forward their bids—interesting! I wonder how good Telstra is going to be at giving up part of its network if somebody else happens to win the tender. They just have not thought it through. This is about a cash grab to try and win over the electorate with some grand plan that has not been thought about at all—not one single bit.
What is absolutely fascinating about today is that those on the other side opposed the sale of Telstra all the way, from beginning to end. They said: ‘We shouldn’t be selling it. Government shouldn’t be selling it.’ We knew we should be selling it because government is not in the business of delivering telecommunications, and neither should it be. The things that are going to deliver real services out there are things like competition and infrastructure. But, no, the whole time the opposition were saying, ‘We can’t possibly privatise Telstra,’ until today, when we magically saw them say, ‘Oh, gosh, let’s privatise Telstra.’ The only reason they want to do that is so they can get their hands on a bucket of money to try and buy votes. It is already being done; telecommunications services are already being rolled out.
There is another absolutely fascinating thing about the grab for the $2.7 billion out of the Future Fund. I understand that the member for Lilley in a doorstop interview on 15 August 2005 said about the Future Fund:
… we have no guarantee this will be a Future Fund which is a locked box. It will be another pork-barrelling institution … If you’re going to have a Future Fund it has to be a locked box.
Guess what—somebody just sprung the lock today. Obviously it no longer has to be a locked box, according to Labor; it can be a very open box, so that they can get the funds out and roll out more money into the capital cities, where it is not needed.
This government has made some very good decisions about telecommunications. That, combined along the way with strong economic management, means that it is this government that has $600 million on the table so that we can get better infrastructure and better services out to rural and regional areas. It is this government that has just put an extra $160 million into Broadband Connect, which, by the way, the opposition want to get rid of. On top of that, we have the $2 billion Communications Fund to guarantee services for rural and regional Australia into the future. That is what this side has done. That side want to spring open the box and get some money with a cash grab, and it is not going to do this nation any good.
Let us have a little walk down memory lane. A bit more than 11 years ago, the opposition had a $96 billion debt. The only reason that they can even think about trying to put $4.7 billion on the table is because of this government’s strong economic management. There is no way in the world under their government that they would have had any funding to do anything like what this government has done for rural and regional services and services right around this nation. They can only talk about spending that money because of our strong economic management and the hard decisions that this government has had to take to pay off that debt and be in a position where we can do things like improve telecommunications services around this nation.
It is a shameless grab for dollars. It is an old proposal repackaged under a new leader—that is all it is. The real shame about this is that it is rural and regional Australians who are going to be the big losers. It is interesting to note that this proposal is called ‘fibre to the node’. I can tell those on the other side—and Senator Conroy, whose bright brainchild this probably is—that there are no nodes where I live out in the central west and that there are no nodes anywhere near where thousands of people in regional Australia live. They are not there. This plan will not work. We will have to start referring to Senator Conroy as ‘no nodes Noddy’ because he does not understand that out there this plan will not work.
The opposition refer very slightly to rural and regional Australia. They are talking about 98 per cent coverage. The carriers that are currently doing it are already moving towards 98 per cent of coverage without one cent of taxpayer dollars. It is already happening. What I find fascinating in this enormous policy document is the bit that says:
The remaining two per cent of Australians in regional and rural Australia not covered by the FFTN network will have improved broadband services.
That is it. That is all it says. It does not say anything at all about how, why and where, and it does not say anything at all because there is not going to be any money left to do anything. Their fund will be gone, the box will be open—Pandora’s box will be well and truly open—and there will be no money for rural and regional Australia.
It is interesting also to note that Korea spent $40 billion rolling out fibre to the node on a smaller land mass than we have here. The opposition is talking about spending a bit over $4 billion for a larger land mass. You do not have to be Einstein to figure out that it is not going to work. The thing that really gets to me in all of this is that it is rural and regional Australians who are going to miss out. This is entirely pitched at the big end of town, where the competition is rolling out the services anyway. This is about Labor stealing from the Future Fund—opening up that box that they said should remain locked forever—so that they can get their hands on some money to try and win some votes. They are pitching this at the big cities to the detriment of rural and regional Australia. It is this government that will do the right thing not only by rural and regional Australians but by people right around this nation in terms of telecommunication services.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,Adjournment,34,1,speech
