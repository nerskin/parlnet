Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:45):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Whish-Wilson, move:


That the South-west Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00326].


That the North Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00324].


That the North-west Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00322].


That the Temperate East Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00321].


That the Coral Sea Marine Park Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00327].


What we have in this debate is the Turnbull government now trying to lock in the largest removal of area in our nation's conservation history. There is not a government anywhere in the world that has ever removed this much area, land or sea, from conservation. There will be many losers as a result of a decision in this chamber not to disallow the redrawing of these boundaries at a time when ocean health is at critical levels right around the world. The people of the world are very, very sensitive to this issue.


We have an opportunity to create resilience in large protected areas, and this is being seriously damaged by a decision of this government to remove all of these protection areas. Recreational fishers have now lost the largest recreation-only fishing area in the world, and large-scale industrial fishing and supertrawlers have now received a standing invitation from this government to exploit Australia's marine life. It is now clear that the only way to protect our oceans is to change the government.


Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg will now forever be saddled with the global reputation of having removed more area from conservation than anyone else ever. Our Prime Minister likes to fancy himself as something of an environmentalist, but he is clearly not. At a time when other countries are putting more into their marine parks, the Australian government wants to take them away. That is despite the fact that we have some of the world's most wonderful marine assets that can and should be protected.


So let's take a look at some of the areas that this government is taking out of marine protection. Let's take a look at what Minister Frydenberg's own hand-picked panel on marine protection said. They said the expert scientific panel:


… is satisfied that the marine bioregional planning programme … was a sound basis and drew upon the best available information for designing the CMR—


Commonwealth marine park—


networks.


In consultation, the government's expert panel said that some of the stakeholders felt 'conservation fatigue'. Listen to this. How thoroughly did the last government do its job? How thoroughly did the Labor government do its job? Over years of consultation done by Labor, six rounds of consultation were held, 245 public and stakeholder meetings were attended by over 2,000 people, there were 210 days of public comment and around three-quarters of a million public submissions were considered.


In not supporting this disallowance motion, which would change the borders on these marine parks, the government is essentially taking us back to square one. The community is going to have to engage all over again to get this job done. And I tell you: we will. These plans revoke about 40 million hectares of high-level national marine parks, almost twice the area of Victoria. This is equivalent to revoking half of Australia's national parks on land. Think about that. These are areas that deserve national-park-type protection. Just because they're underwater does not mean that they don't deserve the same level of attention and that they are not as environmentally important.


Let's look at some examples. In the Coral Sea, Labor's network has 50.78 per cent marine national park protection—half a million square kilometres. The expert panel that considered the boundaries for this didn't do quite as well as Labor. They had 400,000 square kilometres. That's what the experts said should be there. But we now know that this government, in its changing of protection for the Coral Sea, has 24 per cent protection. This is a figure that the Turnbull government tries to go out and proudly promote as strong marine protection. It means, I'm sad to say, 50 per cent of the marine national park zoning is stripped away. It means Australia's largest recreational fishing zone is erased. It's erased in deference to large-scale industrial fishers, and midwater trawling and tuna long-lining are allowed in these areas that should be protected and should be available for recreational fishing. Our network had 18.4 per cent of the Coral Sea reserve set aside for recreational fishing, and the coalition have removed it entirely and replaced it with areas where commercial fishing is allowed in everything other than bottom trawling. I can tell you: I think the government are a bunch of bottom trawlers. It's true to say that recreational fishers can go there, but indeed so can commercial fishers.


We've seen unique reefs like Marion and Kenn stripped back to only partial protection. We've seen big problems too in the temperate eastern waters. The headline here is that one of Australia's longest-standing marine national park zones, Middleton Reef—part of the wonderful Lord Howe Island Marine Park—has been cut back. It was declared right back in 1987, by the Hawke government, and is incredibly important to the network, particularly as long-time marine national parks zones are rare and valuable. And yet you're cutting that back, an area that has been pristine and protected. You are stripping it right back. In the Commonwealth waters around my home state of Western Australia, the Diamantina Fracture Zone, in one of Australia's largest marine national parks, has been reduced to what is now the lowest possible zoning, where again everything is allowed except bottom trawling. Funnily enough, ruling out bottom trawling is not such a big deal, given that it's an area that's between five and seven kilometres deep. There is no fishing or mining out there. Why do you need to take this marine protection off the books? 


Geographe Bay, a really precious area in Western Australia, deserves more protection, but this government has removed two of the very modest marine national parks in this important area. In the north-west, we've had large marine national parks that help sustain the marine life of the Kimberley and the Ningaloo being stripped of much of their protection. In the north, the large marine park on the Gulf of Carpentaria has been stripped away off the Wessel Islands, off Karumba and in the Torres Strait, leaving those important areas also open to bottom trawling and mining.


We have before the chamber today a choice: do we stand up and protect our marine assets or does this chamber lock in the largest removal of area in conservation history? Do we stand up for marine protection in our nation and for our role in protecting the world's oceans? We have some of the best and diverse marine assets in the world. This is a shameful decision coming from this government. Nowhere in the world has anyone ever removed this much from a conservation estate. I call on senators in this chamber to reconsider their position. I agree with the calls of Senator Whish-Wilson that those on the crossbench who have declared their support in opposing this disallowance should come to this chamber and explain themselves. 


I can tell every senator in this place that this issue does not die with a decision on this disallowance today. There are hundreds of thousands of people who support strong marine park protection in our nation. They're very engaged citizens. I know you have email inboxes full of communications from these people. They will be ready and charged in the lead-up to the next election to make sure that we deliver a government that's prepared to stand up for strong marine protection for our nation's oceans.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:58):  In my six years in the Senate, this vote before the Senate today is one of the most important moments for me. I was involved in the marine protected areas campaign. I did some work for the Wilderness Society in South Australia over 10 years ago. Like my colleague Senator Siewert and hundreds of thousands of Australians, I've been campaigning to get better marine protections put in place for over a decade now. In fact, the campaign to get proper marine protections in Australia started well over two decades ago. What we have in the Senate today is the culmination or end point of a two-decade-long campaign for marine protections. However, it is a shameful version or blueprint of what campaigners in this country have been working on for decades now.


The decision is very clear for senators here today: we can reject or reward this government and their systematic attempt since they were elected in 2013, in the last five years, to completely gut plans that were put in place by the community, by the fishing industry, by campaigners right around this country; plans that were put in place by the Labor-Greens government in 2012; and plans that were put in place based on the best available science. In fact, the science has shifted since that time, as you would expect it would over a period of six years. The science shows we need increased protections in our marine environment, not reduced protections.


The government were elected in 2013 on the back of a promise that they would rip up marine protections, and that is exactly what they have done. This disallowance today does not give them the satisfaction of ripping up decades of hard work by campaigners around this country for marine protection. This disallowance today means we go back to the drawing board. It means we have momentum and a campaign to continue what we started decades ago to get proper marine protections in place in Australia.


I ask senators to reflect on the fact that the campaigners, the environmentalists, the stakeholders in the rec fishing industry, some in the commercial fishing industry and so many in the science industry are telling you to support the Greens-Labor disallowance today and not reward the government for what they have done to marine protections. Today is the culmination of their campaign to undermine marine protections in this country at a time when they are so desperately needed.


I myself have seen things change, with my own eyes, since I have been a senator. I was campaigning for marine conservation—as my colleague Senator Siewert was—well over 10 years ago. But I have seen changes in the marine environment where I live in Tasmania. I have seen them on the Great Barrier Reef. I have seen what is happening to our oceans. We talk a lot about the Great Barrier Reef, and so we should. But the south-west waters off Tasmania are known to be a global hotspot for climate change, for a changing ocean environment. And it is not just a greenie conservation thing. Our aquaculture and fishing industries in Tasmania are suffering because of what is going on in our oceans. We have seen our salmon industry have mass mortalities. Over a million fish died in Macquarie Harbour this summer because of warming waters and dissolved oxygen problems. Our abalone industry off the east coast of Tasmania, for the first time, voluntarily decided not to fish their quota because the industry is under so much pressure because of changes in the marine environment. We have seen the same thing in our rock lobster industry. We have seen our oyster industry decimated by viruses from our changing marine environment, from warming waters and from the pressure our marine environments are under.


And we know beyond any reasonable doubt that the only way, the best way, to put in place an insurance policy for these oceans and for future generations is to have proper protections in the ocean through marine parks. We know that is the case. I was interested to see the release of a marine report by scientists at IMAS in Tasmania. Professor Graham Edgar, rather than taking a fisheries management approach to estimating populations of fish, wrote a scientific report, published in peer-reviewed journals, that showed that, contrary to what the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and fisheries stakeholders are saying, we have seen a decline of more than a third in our large biomass fish. That is based on thousands of observations by divers and statistically fed into models. A third of our large biomass fish in our fisheries have disappeared in the last 10 years—a third. Interestingly, that corresponds with a 32 per cent decline in our official catch in these fisheries in the last 10 years. What that study also showed—because there is variability in different areas around those declines—was that, when marine protected areas were in place, they had much less drastic declines in fish biomass. And that just backs up what we have known for years. I won't go into detail today, but I do want senators, and anyone listening to this debate who wants to understand the pressure our oceans are under and just how dire the situation is, to read an article in The Monthly this month that talks about the pressure that our oceans are under. It's called 'The end of the oceans' by James Bradley. It says how the world's oceans and all marine life are on the brink of total collapse.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have never been an alarmist; I have always been evidence based and rational in my deliberations. You may laugh, Senator Macdonald, but I have chaired a number of inquiries in this Senate, initiated a number of inquiries and participated in a number of inquiries around what's going on in our oceans, from our Southern Ocean through to the Great Barrier Reef: warming waters; pollution from the salmon industry; opposing supertrawlers; looking at the impacts on our oceans from shark nets—a whole range of things. And I have to come to the same conclusion: things are dire in our oceans.


Senators, and those following this debate, this plan today is the culmination of six years of a systemic campaign by this government to undermine marine protections. This plan, that you can either reject or accept, has been brought to you by the same people who brought supertrawlers to the country. Senator Colbeck, when he was shadow fisheries minister, and Senator Ruston—both champing at the bit—are the champions of bringing supertrawlers and industrialised vessels to our fisheries. This is the same government that has ignored the recommendations of its own scientific panel. When it set out with its plan to reduce marine protections, it put in place an independent panel, and even its own independent panel recommended much stronger protections than we have in place here. In fact, we have had no explanation from this government as to why it has ignored the advice of its own scientific panel, and ignored the advice of the 1,400 scientists who signed a petition saying, 'Do not reduce marine protections'. And that's why we must have a proper debate today. All we know from Senator Ruston's comments is that she wants to bring more balance to the debate and that means: to give the stakeholders being represented here, the big end of the fishing industry and oil and gas, what they want. That's what that is code for. It is the same fishing industry that made big donations to the Liberal Party around the 2013 election—record donations to the South Australian Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party from the fishing industry. We all know how they're in the pocket of big oil and gas.


The decimation of the protected green zones in the Coral Sea are a classic example of representing the big end of town—a few vested interests. But it shouldn't be a surprise considering what is happening with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and what has happened with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park sits hand in glove with a future marine protected area for the Coral Sea. Combined, they will make one of the biggest marine protected areas in the world. And look at what this government is doing, giving a $444 million grant—seemingly, a captain's call by the Prime Minister—to a relatively unknown private charity with no track record in managing those kinds of funds or dealing with large, complex, scientific projects, supposedly to save the reef, as Senator Birmingham said in here yesterday. Well, we know what will save the reef, and it is not any of the projects that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will look at. They have been labelled by scientists, including some of the best marine scientists in the world, as bandaid solutions. The Australian Academy of Science has put a submission into the inquiry, Senator Macdonald, which I am chairing, that call them bandaid solutions. They will not save the reef. Acting on climate, emissions and land clearing will save the reef. That's what will save the reef. 


The corporatisation—the attempt to give companies the ability to greenwash the sad death of the Great Barrier Reef—is very similar to what we are seeing with a shameful six-year attempt to decimate marine protections in this country. Senators have a choice whether they support that today or they take a stand for our oceans and reject it. The choice is simple: oceans or Mr Abbott, the wrecking ball of Australian politics who started this in the first place—just like he did with climate action in this country, which still hasn't been solved to this day. This is a continuation of that legacy, and I urge senators to reject it. 


I'm a politician. I wanted to read the words today of someone who I deeply, deeply respect. Unfortunately, I missed the chance to talk to him when he came to Launceston recently to launch his latest book. However, I was fortunate to receive a card from him. His name is Mr Tim Winton. He is, in my opinion, along with my brother, David Whish-Wilson, one of the best writers in this country. I love what he writes about and how he writes about the oceans. It reflects so much of my own childhood and my own experiences. I know he's a friend of Senator Siewert. Tim, like Senator Siewert and many others, has campaigned for years to get these marine protected areas in place. I'll read you what he said to me:


Dear Peter, I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk when I was in Launceston; it would have been a great pleasure. I saw your comments in Hansard last week and was grateful for your attempt to bring some sanity and perspective to this debate. Like Rachel, I've been working for more than 20 years towards these marine protected areas, so it will be a bitter defeat if they get legislated. My advice to the movement was to reject this plan outright. There's no honour or integrity in it. What we got under Tony Burke was a massive and painful compromise. To be fobbed off with a filleted version of that is unconscionable. Maybe we should talk about this further. 


That's coming from a man who has, like so many people, hundreds of thousands—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Never heard of him.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Macdonald hasn't heard of Tim Winton—interesting




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Most people haven't.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Hundreds of thousands of Tasmanians and Australians have emailed senators this week urging them to support this disallowance. I would just ask you all to reflect on those people who have spent two decades campaigning for marine protections, including the many scientists who aren't members of the Greens, Senator Macdonald—the 1,400 scientists who have signed the petition calling on senators to support the disallowance and reject this plan. Why would these people be asking you to support the disallowance? You've heard the words of Tim Winton. That is the same sentiment I've heard from so many other people around this country. We have to continue the campaign to get proper marine protections in place in this country. There's never been a more important time, given what's going on in our oceans, to not only put marine protections in place but improve marine protections. 


If this disallowance gets up, there will be existing protections in place under international conservation measures. There will be protections in place under EPBC law and there will be protections in place under the directions of national parks. All the crossbench senators have had all this pointed out to them in recent weeks. Of course, this debate would've been much easier if the Labor and Greens plans had come into force earlier. What we're seeing here today would've been a much starker compromise. But do not be fooled by the argument that, if we don't get these marine protected areas up, we're going to have no marine protections on the water. That is not the case. If you support this today, you are supporting the government's campaign, and the vested interests behind it, to gut marine protections and set an extremely bad example, to reward bad behaviour. It will be noticed all around the world. The environment movement is asking you to stand with them and continue the campaign to get proper protections in place, to make a difference at a time when it's so critically needed.


There are many other things I would love to say today, but I won't have the time. Many other senators need to contribute to this debate. It's not something that we should be sweeping under the carpet. It's one of the most important things I can think of to debate in the Senate—that is, the future of our oceans for the communities that depend on them, be they rec fishers or commercial fishers, future generations, divers, surfers or any Australian who loves their ocean.


I can't understand how we can vote for a plan today that would deliberately set out, from the beginning—in an election promise—to rip up marine protections, to gut 20 years of hard work by so many people. I can't understand how we could do that today. I admit I will be deeply disappointed and shocked if the Senate doesn't support the Labor and Greens disallowance, if it gives satisfaction to those vested interests who have manipulated parliament. It doesn't surprise me that they manipulate the Liberal and National parties. That's why those opposite are here—to represent their mates. But, for those hundreds of thousands of Australians, those millions of Australians, who care about the ocean, please know that I put on the record today my respect for your decades of hard work and I will express my disappointment if this plan gets up. If this goes into force tomorrow then it will officially happen. This is our last chance. We have today and this afternoon to convince senators to not support this government's deliberate attempt to decimate marine protections at a time when they are most desperately needed.


But don't give up heart; don't give up hope. Whatever happens today, the movement will continue to campaign for proper marine protections, and the Greens will continue to campaign for proper marine protections. It doesn't end here today. In fact, I've got no doubt that a Labor government, hopefully, will be elected at the next federal election and will make a difference by putting in place proper marine protected areas.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You can laugh all you like, Senator Macdonald. You won't be here, which is a good thing in my opinion. However, in my last 23 seconds—do not give this mob the satisfaction. You can choose between the oceans and Mr Tony Abbott. That's your choice here today. You can choose between protecting the oceans for future generations and giving this mob what they want.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-16,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:18):  What utter humbug and hypocrisy is the argument of the Greens, particularly, and the Labor Party on this issue! Let me just explain that to anyone who might be listening. The government is bringing forward some plans for marine protection. The disallowance motion of the Labor Party and the Greens is about stopping those marine protection plans. You've just heard 20 minutes of humbug from a Greens senator about protecting the marine environment, and what they are doing today is stopping protections for our marine parks. You always know when the Greens have run out of arguments, which the previous speaker did after about 30 seconds—they start using the old arguments of vested interests. When they run out of any sensible arguments, it's the vested interests that the Greens, particularly, and the Labor Party always try to bring up on any debate to try and align sensible Australians with coalition policy.


Of course, you know they've run out of arguments when they start talking about donors. The Greens talk about large corporate donors, but of course we remember that the Greens political party was the party that received the largest single donation from any corporate entity anywhere in Australia's political history. That was, of course, when Mr Graeme Wood gave them $1.6 million, the biggest donation to a political party ever. Lo and behold, would you believe, I was in a committee a few weeks later when Mr Bob Brown, then Senator Bob Brown, actually tried to get a taxation committee to give an exemption for the sort of online newspaper that Graeme Wood was hoping to set up. They talk about vested interests and hypocrisy and corruption, but the Greens should look in the mirror when it comes to those sort of things.


Now, back to the issue—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Senator Whish-Wilson, on a point of order?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Point of order. Senator Macdonald just made a previous reflection on a previous senator in this place, Bob Brown, as being corrupt. He's a total coward to use parliamentary privilege to do so. I ask him to withdraw that comment.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I don't believe former members of this place are actually covered by the standing order, so I won't rule that way. However, if I'm wrong, someone will tell me shortly and we will revisit it, but I'm pretty sure I'm right there. Senator Macdonald, you have the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Dare I say, I believe you're correct. The record will show that I didn't accuse former Senator Bob Brown of being corrupt, but if that's the way that Senator Whish-Wilson thinks he was, then that's a matter for Senator Whish-Wilson, not for me. I said the Greens political party were corrupt. They were corrupt. Did that not happen? Didn't then Senator Brown, a couple of weeks after this donation was received by the Greens political party, move at a Senate economics committee or make advocacy for getting a tax exemption for online newspapers that were about to start up? And wasn't it Mr Graeme Wood thinking about doing that at the time? I'm not going to accuse any individual of being corrupt, but I'm going to say the Greens political party is corrupt, and you tell me where I'm wrong, because I know you cannot. I know you cannot.


We heard from Senator Whish-Wilson arguments about the dire straits of our oceans, but he forgets to mention that the government that introduced marine protected areas anywhere in the world was a Liberal government when then Senator Robert Hill was Minister for the Environment. It was a Liberal government who did those sorts of things. Don't take my word for it. Have a look at this book put out by the sensible conservation group. It's titled, A Big Blue Legacy. The Liberal National tradition of marine conservation. You should read this book—unfortunately I only have one copy—because it goes through in detail all the marine conservation work done by various Liberal governments over the last few decades, starting, of course, with Malcolm Fraser's protection of Fraser Island and the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and it goes on. None of the Greens are interested in this book, because it's the conservation groups themselves telling the world the truth about which government it is that has actually done something.


It's okay for the Greens to talk; they know they'll never be in government and never have to deliver. The Labor Party, unfortunately, talk a lot and never deliver either. The only party that has ever delivered on marine conservation is the Liberal-National Party, and we continue to do that in these plans that the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to stop. What sort of logic is that? They want to protect the oceans, and yet here they are today trying to defeat the five plans that will protect the oceans. I know what annoys the Labor Party, because under these plans we're going protect 509 conservation features, including reefs, sea mounts and canyons, and 344 sites have received the highest level of protection compared with those under the Labor plan of 331. The Greens urge the people to vote for the Labor Party so they can be in government—because we know the Greens and the Labor Party are one and the same in any case. But answer this: we're putting aside 344 sites of the highest level of protection; Labor wants 331, which is 13 less, and yet the Greens say the Labor Party's plan is a better one than ours—can you please explain that? We are protecting more sites, but you want to go back to the Labor plan that protects fewer sites. We have green zones that are more than 20 times the size of Kakadu and half the size of New South Wales. We protect sea-floor habitats totalling almost the size of Victoria.


I enter into this debate because I'm a Queensland senator. I'm interested in northern Australia, as you may have heard me say before, and part of my electorate, Northern Queensland, actually contains the Great Barrier Reef, and the communities of hundreds of thousands of people who make their living from the Great Barrier Reef. They are the ones who are demanding that we do what we do.


And can I tell you—and I'll specifically refer to the Coral Sea marine park that the Greens and the Labor Party are today trying to stop—there is a plan in place, and the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to abandon it, to stop it, to abolish it. This marine plan that the coalition has introduced, which the Greens and Labor are trying to stop, enables our recreational fishers—those five million Aussies who enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime wilderness experience in the Coral Sea—to continue doing so whilst protecting the Coral Sea.


We've given these fishers up my way, off Cairns, off Innisfail, off Tully, off Cardwell and, indeed, even off Mooloolaba, the chance to fish at iconic reefs such as Kenn Reef, Bougainville Reef, Marion Reef and Wreck Reef in a very, very sustainable way. These are recreational fishers, not commercial fishermen. These are recreational fishers being given that opportunity for very sustainable recreational fishing. That is what the people of North Queensland, of my state, want to happen. And we're doing that in a way that is sustainable and protects an increasing number of parts of our marine environment.


We want some of our professional fishers, including Walker Seafoods, based at Mooloolaba, to continue to export their Marine-Stewardship-Council-certified tuna to markets around the globe. For those who don't understand, if you get the Marine Stewardship Council's tick of approval—which the Greens used to promote years ago, although I don't know what they're doing these days; they're such hypocrites in the Greens' political party that probably they don't like the Marine Stewardship Council anymore—it's for fishing that is done sustainably. And Walker Seafoods in Mooloolaba have got that sustainable tick of approval for certified tuna, and they export to the world. This plan allows for that. The Greens and the Labor Party want to abolish the plan, so that not only could Walkers but anyone could do anything. It's open slather if this motion passes today because there are no plans, no management arrangements, at all. And, would you believe, that's what the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to get the Senate to do: to have no plans—to have an open slather, so everyone can go out and do whatever they want and catch whatever they want. That's what Senator Whish-Wilson is asking you to do today. How sensible is that? What absolute humbug! What absolute hypocrisy!(Quorum formed)You know you've got them on the run when they do those sorts of things, like calling a quorum, to interrupt my speech. Thank you for that, Senator Ketter. That is a real compliment to me. When the arguments start to bite home and the Labor Party and the Greens realise the hypocrisy and utter humbug of the approach they're taking, they then call a quorum so that they shut me up for a minute or two.


What the Labor Party and the Greens are asking you to do today is to remove the current protections of our marine areas. They want it to be open slather. We've just had a Greens senator telling us for 20 minutes that all they were interested in was marine protection, and yet they want to dismiss it. They want to abandon it. They want to abolish it. What absolute and utter humbug and hypocrisy from the Greens political party. Nothing surprises me about hypocrisy and humbug from the Greens, but this one must take the cake. Here we have the biggest amount of marine protection plans anywhere in Australia, ever in Australia. As I recall, under these plans we have the second highest marine protected and conserved areas anywhere in the world, but the Greens and the Labor Party want to stop it. What hypocrisy. What absolute humbug.


I was talking about Walker Seafoods, a great company out of Mooloolaba in my state. They have the Marine Stewardship Council tick for their fishing in the Coral Sea allowed by these plans. The Greens and the Labor Party want to stop that and destroy the jobs and small businesses of tens of thousands of people along the coast of my state of Queensland. They want to deprive the hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders, and other Australians from all over, of the enjoyment of sustainable recreational fishing in the Coral Sea.


We want our northern prawn fishers to continue to supply us with those magnificent banana prawns that you can only get off the coast of Queensland. And yet the Labor Party and the Greens want to stop that. They want us to import vannamei prawns from Vietnam, grown in the—I better not say that, because we like our Vietnamese people. The vannamei prawns from Vietnam, which the Greens and Labor Party would rather us be consuming, are not in the same category—not in the same world—as the wonderful, fresh banana prawns we get out of the Coral Sea in Queensland. It keeps Queenslanders in jobs and it keeps tourists coming to our state, because there aren't many places in the world where you can enjoy fresh fish and fresh prawns straight out of the Coral Sea, farmed and caught in a sustainable way. I know that Senator Ruston, here in the chamber, runs a fisheries regime as fisheries minister which won't even countenance any suggestion of overfishing. The fisheries plans that Senator Ruston oversees and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority carefully limit fishing for our fish stocks to make sure that they are forever sustainable.


Relentless campaigns by Labor and the dark forces who oppose fishing have galvanised and unified—and this is an achievement in itself, I have to say—our professional and recreational fishers. They don't often get on together but they are determined in their support for these plans. I'm not sure I even like to say this, because I've said some nasty things about the Pew regime over the years, but I'm told by Senator Ruston that even the Pew foundation, the great American conservation so-called foundation which originated in oil money out of the Gulf of Mexico—and the Pew foundation, in my view, are always trying to salve their consciences by splashing money around on conservation issues around the world—are in this building this week supporting these plans, and why wouldn't they? If you do what the Labor Party and the Greens want you to do, you'll get rid of every marine conservation plan in Australia and it will be open slather. That's what Senator Whish-Wilson wants. He wants open slather in our marine environment. He just spent 20 minutes telling us how he was so concerned about conservation of our marine areas, and what he is proposing today is that we get rid of all of these plans. What hypocrisy! What utter and absolute humbug! It's the sort of hypocrisy and lies that we've come to expect of the Greens political party, because we know they will simply say and do anything to try and make a point.


This is almost such a simple proposition that it really doesn't warrant much more discussion. You can go with the plans that are already in place, which protect the greatest areas of the Australian marine environment, or you can go with the Greens and the Labor Party and abolish those plans so that there'll be nothing there. It is such a simple proposition that I can't imagine any senator would contemplate joining the Greens and the Labor Party. Those two are only doing it because they hate anything that the coalition government does. They can't stand this booklet that says the only people who have done any work in the marine conservation area are Liberal governments. They hate that. So, for political and ideological reasons, they would have you abandon these plans that are in place and lead you back to open slather with nothing. What hypocrisy!

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:38):  It is not a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald in speaking, in terms of the load of baloney that the minister—that the senator just delivered to this chamber.



An honourable senator:  He never made minister!




Senator SIEWERT:
  He did for a short time, in actual fact. Comments that Senator Macdonald made were derogatory to the Greens and to those that have worked for so long and hard to put in place marine protection. His No. 1 argument is, 'Well, you'd rather have nothing and you're trying to get rid of these marine plans.' That's what that side of the chamber did, when they got rid of the management plans for the marine parks in the marine protected areas, in the first place. So how can he come into this chamber and say, 'Ooh, Labor and the Greens seek to get rid of these management plans,' when that's exactly what his side did?


They got rid of the world's leading series of marine protected areas. They're well acknowledged around the world as being world leading. I cannot believe that he would have the audacity to have a go at us for trying to take it back to what it was, because that government have reduced marine protection in very important areas, bowing to the pressure from the fishing industry. That's exactly what that government did. They took away the protection that had just been put in place.


I, for one, will freely acknowledge that previous coalition governments have done work on marine protection, but to say they're the only ones is a pack of nonsense, when quite clearly we're standing here trying to protect and get back what the previous Labor government put in place. And, yes, we were critical of the things that weren't included in those areas. We wanted them to do better. I'm on the record as having said that. But this government came in place and got rid of those areas. They can play around with wording, but there is absolutely no doubt in the community's mind that that's what they did. They took away that series of marine protected areas and they took away the bioregional marine parks that were put in place as part of that process.


I've been working on marine protection since the mid-eighties. I've been through the highs and the lows. I've been through building community awareness. I've been through the process of arguing that marine protected areas and no-take zones don't protect fishing stocks. We had that really ridiculous argument when people tried to argue that they don't play a role in protecting fish stocks. We've been through that. Some people still like to deny the evidence. We've been through that. We now have acceptance of the importance of marine protection, both for the protection of marine biodiversity and for fish stocks. We've been through that. Now we have a government bowing to pressure from recreational fishers and commercial fishers and it will compromise the protection of really important areas.


I'd like to focus on Western Australia. Andrew Bartlett will talk about the travesty of the cuts to the Coral Sea, but I want to talk about my home state of Western Australia. Overwhelmingly, people in Western Australia love the marine environment. Most Western Australians live by the coast. I think it would be freely acknowledged in this place that we have a lot of very special coast. I go back to the marine campaign. Tim Winton was involved in the campaign to protect the Ningaloo Coast, to make sure that we did not have inappropriate development in Coral Bay that would have damaged the Ningaloo Coast. The Ningaloo rally was one of the biggest rallies we've ever had in Western Australia. I remember marching in Fremantle all those years ago to protect that coast, as did Tim and thousands and thousands of Western Australians. Have no doubt that Western Australians love their marine environment. They love Ningaloo and they love the south-west.


Just for a little bit of one-up-personship: the south-west marine area has the highest number of marine endemic species—far higher than other areas around the Australian coast—so it's very important that we have adequate marine protection there. We are still, in fact, developing our understanding of some of those areas. In Western Australia, under the plans that this government wants to put in place, we've seen cuts to Geographe Bay. It's halved from the 2012 area. We've seen the green zones moved offshore in those really important areas around Bremer, and allowing scallop trawling. We have seen the more intense protection for the Rowley Shoals reduced by 45 per cent. We've seen around Gascoyne and Ningaloo a 75 per cent reduction. They have mucked around the Perth Canyon and moved the protection to the wrong spot. These are important areas for marine biodiversity from around the world, growing more so every day as we understand the impact of climate change on our marine environment. These parks do not now deliver the best system in the world. We did have that, but, because of pressure from industry, and from Senator Macdonald's— (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:45):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Whish-Wilson, move:


That the South-west Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00326].


That the North Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00324].


That the North-west Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00322].


That the Temperate East Marine Parks Network Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00321].


That the Coral Sea Marine Park Management Plan 2018, made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed [F2018L00327].


What we have in this debate is the Turnbull government now trying to lock in the largest removal of area in our nation's conservation history. There is not a government anywhere in the world that has ever removed this much area, land or sea, from conservation. There will be many losers as a result of a decision in this chamber not to disallow the redrawing of these boundaries at a time when ocean health is at critical levels right around the world. The people of the world are very, very sensitive to this issue.


We have an opportunity to create resilience in large protected areas, and this is being seriously damaged by a decision of this government to remove all of these protection areas. Recreational fishers have now lost the largest recreation-only fishing area in the world, and large-scale industrial fishing and supertrawlers have now received a standing invitation from this government to exploit Australia's marine life. It is now clear that the only way to protect our oceans is to change the government.


Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg will now forever be saddled with the global reputation of having removed more area from conservation than anyone else ever. Our Prime Minister likes to fancy himself as something of an environmentalist, but he is clearly not. At a time when other countries are putting more into their marine parks, the Australian government wants to take them away. That is despite the fact that we have some of the world's most wonderful marine assets that can and should be protected.


So let's take a look at some of the areas that this government is taking out of marine protection. Let's take a look at what Minister Frydenberg's own hand-picked panel on marine protection said. They said the expert scientific panel:


… is satisfied that the marine bioregional planning programme … was a sound basis and drew upon the best available information for designing the CMR—


Commonwealth marine park—


networks.


In consultation, the government's expert panel said that some of the stakeholders felt 'conservation fatigue'. Listen to this. How thoroughly did the last government do its job? How thoroughly did the Labor government do its job? Over years of consultation done by Labor, six rounds of consultation were held, 245 public and stakeholder meetings were attended by over 2,000 people, there were 210 days of public comment and around three-quarters of a million public submissions were considered.


In not supporting this disallowance motion, which would change the borders on these marine parks, the government is essentially taking us back to square one. The community is going to have to engage all over again to get this job done. And I tell you: we will. These plans revoke about 40 million hectares of high-level national marine parks, almost twice the area of Victoria. This is equivalent to revoking half of Australia's national parks on land. Think about that. These are areas that deserve national-park-type protection. Just because they're underwater does not mean that they don't deserve the same level of attention and that they are not as environmentally important.


Let's look at some examples. In the Coral Sea, Labor's network has 50.78 per cent marine national park protection—half a million square kilometres. The expert panel that considered the boundaries for this didn't do quite as well as Labor. They had 400,000 square kilometres. That's what the experts said should be there. But we now know that this government, in its changing of protection for the Coral Sea, has 24 per cent protection. This is a figure that the Turnbull government tries to go out and proudly promote as strong marine protection. It means, I'm sad to say, 50 per cent of the marine national park zoning is stripped away. It means Australia's largest recreational fishing zone is erased. It's erased in deference to large-scale industrial fishers, and midwater trawling and tuna long-lining are allowed in these areas that should be protected and should be available for recreational fishing. Our network had 18.4 per cent of the Coral Sea reserve set aside for recreational fishing, and the coalition have removed it entirely and replaced it with areas where commercial fishing is allowed in everything other than bottom trawling. I can tell you: I think the government are a bunch of bottom trawlers. It's true to say that recreational fishers can go there, but indeed so can commercial fishers.


We've seen unique reefs like Marion and Kenn stripped back to only partial protection. We've seen big problems too in the temperate eastern waters. The headline here is that one of Australia's longest-standing marine national park zones, Middleton Reef—part of the wonderful Lord Howe Island Marine Park—has been cut back. It was declared right back in 1987, by the Hawke government, and is incredibly important to the network, particularly as long-time marine national parks zones are rare and valuable. And yet you're cutting that back, an area that has been pristine and protected. You are stripping it right back. In the Commonwealth waters around my home state of Western Australia, the Diamantina Fracture Zone, in one of Australia's largest marine national parks, has been reduced to what is now the lowest possible zoning, where again everything is allowed except bottom trawling. Funnily enough, ruling out bottom trawling is not such a big deal, given that it's an area that's between five and seven kilometres deep. There is no fishing or mining out there. Why do you need to take this marine protection off the books? 


Geographe Bay, a really precious area in Western Australia, deserves more protection, but this government has removed two of the very modest marine national parks in this important area. In the north-west, we've had large marine national parks that help sustain the marine life of the Kimberley and the Ningaloo being stripped of much of their protection. In the north, the large marine park on the Gulf of Carpentaria has been stripped away off the Wessel Islands, off Karumba and in the Torres Strait, leaving those important areas also open to bottom trawling and mining.


We have before the chamber today a choice: do we stand up and protect our marine assets or does this chamber lock in the largest removal of area in conservation history? Do we stand up for marine protection in our nation and for our role in protecting the world's oceans? We have some of the best and diverse marine assets in the world. This is a shameful decision coming from this government. Nowhere in the world has anyone ever removed this much from a conservation estate. I call on senators in this chamber to reconsider their position. I agree with the calls of Senator Whish-Wilson that those on the crossbench who have declared their support in opposing this disallowance should come to this chamber and explain themselves. 


I can tell every senator in this place that this issue does not die with a decision on this disallowance today. There are hundreds of thousands of people who support strong marine park protection in our nation. They're very engaged citizens. I know you have email inboxes full of communications from these people. They will be ready and charged in the lead-up to the next election to make sure that we deliver a government that's prepared to stand up for strong marine protection for our nation's oceans.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:58):  In my six years in the Senate, this vote before the Senate today is one of the most important moments for me. I was involved in the marine protected areas campaign. I did some work for the Wilderness Society in South Australia over 10 years ago. Like my colleague Senator Siewert and hundreds of thousands of Australians, I've been campaigning to get better marine protections put in place for over a decade now. In fact, the campaign to get proper marine protections in Australia started well over two decades ago. What we have in the Senate today is the culmination or end point of a two-decade-long campaign for marine protections. However, it is a shameful version or blueprint of what campaigners in this country have been working on for decades now.


The decision is very clear for senators here today: we can reject or reward this government and their systematic attempt since they were elected in 2013, in the last five years, to completely gut plans that were put in place by the community, by the fishing industry, by campaigners right around this country; plans that were put in place by the Labor-Greens government in 2012; and plans that were put in place based on the best available science. In fact, the science has shifted since that time, as you would expect it would over a period of six years. The science shows we need increased protections in our marine environment, not reduced protections.


The government were elected in 2013 on the back of a promise that they would rip up marine protections, and that is exactly what they have done. This disallowance today does not give them the satisfaction of ripping up decades of hard work by campaigners around this country for marine protection. This disallowance today means we go back to the drawing board. It means we have momentum and a campaign to continue what we started decades ago to get proper marine protections in place in Australia.


I ask senators to reflect on the fact that the campaigners, the environmentalists, the stakeholders in the rec fishing industry, some in the commercial fishing industry and so many in the science industry are telling you to support the Greens-Labor disallowance today and not reward the government for what they have done to marine protections. Today is the culmination of their campaign to undermine marine protections in this country at a time when they are so desperately needed.


I myself have seen things change, with my own eyes, since I have been a senator. I was campaigning for marine conservation—as my colleague Senator Siewert was—well over 10 years ago. But I have seen changes in the marine environment where I live in Tasmania. I have seen them on the Great Barrier Reef. I have seen what is happening to our oceans. We talk a lot about the Great Barrier Reef, and so we should. But the south-west waters off Tasmania are known to be a global hotspot for climate change, for a changing ocean environment. And it is not just a greenie conservation thing. Our aquaculture and fishing industries in Tasmania are suffering because of what is going on in our oceans. We have seen our salmon industry have mass mortalities. Over a million fish died in Macquarie Harbour this summer because of warming waters and dissolved oxygen problems. Our abalone industry off the east coast of Tasmania, for the first time, voluntarily decided not to fish their quota because the industry is under so much pressure because of changes in the marine environment. We have seen the same thing in our rock lobster industry. We have seen our oyster industry decimated by viruses from our changing marine environment, from warming waters and from the pressure our marine environments are under.


And we know beyond any reasonable doubt that the only way, the best way, to put in place an insurance policy for these oceans and for future generations is to have proper protections in the ocean through marine parks. We know that is the case. I was interested to see the release of a marine report by scientists at IMAS in Tasmania. Professor Graham Edgar, rather than taking a fisheries management approach to estimating populations of fish, wrote a scientific report, published in peer-reviewed journals, that showed that, contrary to what the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and fisheries stakeholders are saying, we have seen a decline of more than a third in our large biomass fish. That is based on thousands of observations by divers and statistically fed into models. A third of our large biomass fish in our fisheries have disappeared in the last 10 years—a third. Interestingly, that corresponds with a 32 per cent decline in our official catch in these fisheries in the last 10 years. What that study also showed—because there is variability in different areas around those declines—was that, when marine protected areas were in place, they had much less drastic declines in fish biomass. And that just backs up what we have known for years. I won't go into detail today, but I do want senators, and anyone listening to this debate who wants to understand the pressure our oceans are under and just how dire the situation is, to read an article in The Monthly this month that talks about the pressure that our oceans are under. It's called 'The end of the oceans' by James Bradley. It says how the world's oceans and all marine life are on the brink of total collapse.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have never been an alarmist; I have always been evidence based and rational in my deliberations. You may laugh, Senator Macdonald, but I have chaired a number of inquiries in this Senate, initiated a number of inquiries and participated in a number of inquiries around what's going on in our oceans, from our Southern Ocean through to the Great Barrier Reef: warming waters; pollution from the salmon industry; opposing supertrawlers; looking at the impacts on our oceans from shark nets—a whole range of things. And I have to come to the same conclusion: things are dire in our oceans.


Senators, and those following this debate, this plan today is the culmination of six years of a systemic campaign by this government to undermine marine protections. This plan, that you can either reject or accept, has been brought to you by the same people who brought supertrawlers to the country. Senator Colbeck, when he was shadow fisheries minister, and Senator Ruston—both champing at the bit—are the champions of bringing supertrawlers and industrialised vessels to our fisheries. This is the same government that has ignored the recommendations of its own scientific panel. When it set out with its plan to reduce marine protections, it put in place an independent panel, and even its own independent panel recommended much stronger protections than we have in place here. In fact, we have had no explanation from this government as to why it has ignored the advice of its own scientific panel, and ignored the advice of the 1,400 scientists who signed a petition saying, 'Do not reduce marine protections'. And that's why we must have a proper debate today. All we know from Senator Ruston's comments is that she wants to bring more balance to the debate and that means: to give the stakeholders being represented here, the big end of the fishing industry and oil and gas, what they want. That's what that is code for. It is the same fishing industry that made big donations to the Liberal Party around the 2013 election—record donations to the South Australian Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party from the fishing industry. We all know how they're in the pocket of big oil and gas.


The decimation of the protected green zones in the Coral Sea are a classic example of representing the big end of town—a few vested interests. But it shouldn't be a surprise considering what is happening with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and what has happened with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park sits hand in glove with a future marine protected area for the Coral Sea. Combined, they will make one of the biggest marine protected areas in the world. And look at what this government is doing, giving a $444 million grant—seemingly, a captain's call by the Prime Minister—to a relatively unknown private charity with no track record in managing those kinds of funds or dealing with large, complex, scientific projects, supposedly to save the reef, as Senator Birmingham said in here yesterday. Well, we know what will save the reef, and it is not any of the projects that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will look at. They have been labelled by scientists, including some of the best marine scientists in the world, as bandaid solutions. The Australian Academy of Science has put a submission into the inquiry, Senator Macdonald, which I am chairing, that call them bandaid solutions. They will not save the reef. Acting on climate, emissions and land clearing will save the reef. That's what will save the reef. 


The corporatisation—the attempt to give companies the ability to greenwash the sad death of the Great Barrier Reef—is very similar to what we are seeing with a shameful six-year attempt to decimate marine protections in this country. Senators have a choice whether they support that today or they take a stand for our oceans and reject it. The choice is simple: oceans or Mr Abbott, the wrecking ball of Australian politics who started this in the first place—just like he did with climate action in this country, which still hasn't been solved to this day. This is a continuation of that legacy, and I urge senators to reject it. 


I'm a politician. I wanted to read the words today of someone who I deeply, deeply respect. Unfortunately, I missed the chance to talk to him when he came to Launceston recently to launch his latest book. However, I was fortunate to receive a card from him. His name is Mr Tim Winton. He is, in my opinion, along with my brother, David Whish-Wilson, one of the best writers in this country. I love what he writes about and how he writes about the oceans. It reflects so much of my own childhood and my own experiences. I know he's a friend of Senator Siewert. Tim, like Senator Siewert and many others, has campaigned for years to get these marine protected areas in place. I'll read you what he said to me:


Dear Peter, I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk when I was in Launceston; it would have been a great pleasure. I saw your comments in Hansard last week and was grateful for your attempt to bring some sanity and perspective to this debate. Like Rachel, I've been working for more than 20 years towards these marine protected areas, so it will be a bitter defeat if they get legislated. My advice to the movement was to reject this plan outright. There's no honour or integrity in it. What we got under Tony Burke was a massive and painful compromise. To be fobbed off with a filleted version of that is unconscionable. Maybe we should talk about this further. 


That's coming from a man who has, like so many people, hundreds of thousands—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Never heard of him.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Macdonald hasn't heard of Tim Winton—interesting




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Most people haven't.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Hundreds of thousands of Tasmanians and Australians have emailed senators this week urging them to support this disallowance. I would just ask you all to reflect on those people who have spent two decades campaigning for marine protections, including the many scientists who aren't members of the Greens, Senator Macdonald—the 1,400 scientists who have signed the petition calling on senators to support the disallowance and reject this plan. Why would these people be asking you to support the disallowance? You've heard the words of Tim Winton. That is the same sentiment I've heard from so many other people around this country. We have to continue the campaign to get proper marine protections in place in this country. There's never been a more important time, given what's going on in our oceans, to not only put marine protections in place but improve marine protections. 


If this disallowance gets up, there will be existing protections in place under international conservation measures. There will be protections in place under EPBC law and there will be protections in place under the directions of national parks. All the crossbench senators have had all this pointed out to them in recent weeks. Of course, this debate would've been much easier if the Labor and Greens plans had come into force earlier. What we're seeing here today would've been a much starker compromise. But do not be fooled by the argument that, if we don't get these marine protected areas up, we're going to have no marine protections on the water. That is not the case. If you support this today, you are supporting the government's campaign, and the vested interests behind it, to gut marine protections and set an extremely bad example, to reward bad behaviour. It will be noticed all around the world. The environment movement is asking you to stand with them and continue the campaign to get proper protections in place, to make a difference at a time when it's so critically needed.


There are many other things I would love to say today, but I won't have the time. Many other senators need to contribute to this debate. It's not something that we should be sweeping under the carpet. It's one of the most important things I can think of to debate in the Senate—that is, the future of our oceans for the communities that depend on them, be they rec fishers or commercial fishers, future generations, divers, surfers or any Australian who loves their ocean.


I can't understand how we can vote for a plan today that would deliberately set out, from the beginning—in an election promise—to rip up marine protections, to gut 20 years of hard work by so many people. I can't understand how we could do that today. I admit I will be deeply disappointed and shocked if the Senate doesn't support the Labor and Greens disallowance, if it gives satisfaction to those vested interests who have manipulated parliament. It doesn't surprise me that they manipulate the Liberal and National parties. That's why those opposite are here—to represent their mates. But, for those hundreds of thousands of Australians, those millions of Australians, who care about the ocean, please know that I put on the record today my respect for your decades of hard work and I will express my disappointment if this plan gets up. If this goes into force tomorrow then it will officially happen. This is our last chance. We have today and this afternoon to convince senators to not support this government's deliberate attempt to decimate marine protections at a time when they are most desperately needed.


But don't give up heart; don't give up hope. Whatever happens today, the movement will continue to campaign for proper marine protections, and the Greens will continue to campaign for proper marine protections. It doesn't end here today. In fact, I've got no doubt that a Labor government, hopefully, will be elected at the next federal election and will make a difference by putting in place proper marine protected areas.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You can laugh all you like, Senator Macdonald. You won't be here, which is a good thing in my opinion. However, in my last 23 seconds—do not give this mob the satisfaction. You can choose between the oceans and Mr Tony Abbott. That's your choice here today. You can choose between protecting the oceans for future generations and giving this mob what they want.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:18):  What utter humbug and hypocrisy is the argument of the Greens, particularly, and the Labor Party on this issue! Let me just explain that to anyone who might be listening. The government is bringing forward some plans for marine protection. The disallowance motion of the Labor Party and the Greens is about stopping those marine protection plans. You've just heard 20 minutes of humbug from a Greens senator about protecting the marine environment, and what they are doing today is stopping protections for our marine parks. You always know when the Greens have run out of arguments, which the previous speaker did after about 30 seconds—they start using the old arguments of vested interests. When they run out of any sensible arguments, it's the vested interests that the Greens, particularly, and the Labor Party always try to bring up on any debate to try and align sensible Australians with coalition policy.


Of course, you know they've run out of arguments when they start talking about donors. The Greens talk about large corporate donors, but of course we remember that the Greens political party was the party that received the largest single donation from any corporate entity anywhere in Australia's political history. That was, of course, when Mr Graeme Wood gave them $1.6 million, the biggest donation to a political party ever. Lo and behold, would you believe, I was in a committee a few weeks later when Mr Bob Brown, then Senator Bob Brown, actually tried to get a taxation committee to give an exemption for the sort of online newspaper that Graeme Wood was hoping to set up. They talk about vested interests and hypocrisy and corruption, but the Greens should look in the mirror when it comes to those sort of things.


Now, back to the issue—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, resume your seat. Senator Whish-Wilson, on a point of order?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Point of order. Senator Macdonald just made a previous reflection on a previous senator in this place, Bob Brown, as being corrupt. He's a total coward to use parliamentary privilege to do so. I ask him to withdraw that comment.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I don't believe former members of this place are actually covered by the standing order, so I won't rule that way. However, if I'm wrong, someone will tell me shortly and we will revisit it, but I'm pretty sure I'm right there. Senator Macdonald, you have the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Dare I say, I believe you're correct. The record will show that I didn't accuse former Senator Bob Brown of being corrupt, but if that's the way that Senator Whish-Wilson thinks he was, then that's a matter for Senator Whish-Wilson, not for me. I said the Greens political party were corrupt. They were corrupt. Did that not happen? Didn't then Senator Brown, a couple of weeks after this donation was received by the Greens political party, move at a Senate economics committee or make advocacy for getting a tax exemption for online newspapers that were about to start up? And wasn't it Mr Graeme Wood thinking about doing that at the time? I'm not going to accuse any individual of being corrupt, but I'm going to say the Greens political party is corrupt, and you tell me where I'm wrong, because I know you cannot. I know you cannot.


We heard from Senator Whish-Wilson arguments about the dire straits of our oceans, but he forgets to mention that the government that introduced marine protected areas anywhere in the world was a Liberal government when then Senator Robert Hill was Minister for the Environment. It was a Liberal government who did those sorts of things. Don't take my word for it. Have a look at this book put out by the sensible conservation group. It's titled, A Big Blue Legacy. The Liberal National tradition of marine conservation. You should read this book—unfortunately I only have one copy—because it goes through in detail all the marine conservation work done by various Liberal governments over the last few decades, starting, of course, with Malcolm Fraser's protection of Fraser Island and the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and it goes on. None of the Greens are interested in this book, because it's the conservation groups themselves telling the world the truth about which government it is that has actually done something.


It's okay for the Greens to talk; they know they'll never be in government and never have to deliver. The Labor Party, unfortunately, talk a lot and never deliver either. The only party that has ever delivered on marine conservation is the Liberal-National Party, and we continue to do that in these plans that the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to stop. What sort of logic is that? They want to protect the oceans, and yet here they are today trying to defeat the five plans that will protect the oceans. I know what annoys the Labor Party, because under these plans we're going protect 509 conservation features, including reefs, sea mounts and canyons, and 344 sites have received the highest level of protection compared with those under the Labor plan of 331. The Greens urge the people to vote for the Labor Party so they can be in government—because we know the Greens and the Labor Party are one and the same in any case. But answer this: we're putting aside 344 sites of the highest level of protection; Labor wants 331, which is 13 less, and yet the Greens say the Labor Party's plan is a better one than ours—can you please explain that? We are protecting more sites, but you want to go back to the Labor plan that protects fewer sites. We have green zones that are more than 20 times the size of Kakadu and half the size of New South Wales. We protect sea-floor habitats totalling almost the size of Victoria.


I enter into this debate because I'm a Queensland senator. I'm interested in northern Australia, as you may have heard me say before, and part of my electorate, Northern Queensland, actually contains the Great Barrier Reef, and the communities of hundreds of thousands of people who make their living from the Great Barrier Reef. They are the ones who are demanding that we do what we do.


And can I tell you—and I'll specifically refer to the Coral Sea marine park that the Greens and the Labor Party are today trying to stop—there is a plan in place, and the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to abandon it, to stop it, to abolish it. This marine plan that the coalition has introduced, which the Greens and Labor are trying to stop, enables our recreational fishers—those five million Aussies who enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime wilderness experience in the Coral Sea—to continue doing so whilst protecting the Coral Sea.


We've given these fishers up my way, off Cairns, off Innisfail, off Tully, off Cardwell and, indeed, even off Mooloolaba, the chance to fish at iconic reefs such as Kenn Reef, Bougainville Reef, Marion Reef and Wreck Reef in a very, very sustainable way. These are recreational fishers, not commercial fishermen. These are recreational fishers being given that opportunity for very sustainable recreational fishing. That is what the people of North Queensland, of my state, want to happen. And we're doing that in a way that is sustainable and protects an increasing number of parts of our marine environment.


We want some of our professional fishers, including Walker Seafoods, based at Mooloolaba, to continue to export their Marine-Stewardship-Council-certified tuna to markets around the globe. For those who don't understand, if you get the Marine Stewardship Council's tick of approval—which the Greens used to promote years ago, although I don't know what they're doing these days; they're such hypocrites in the Greens' political party that probably they don't like the Marine Stewardship Council anymore—it's for fishing that is done sustainably. And Walker Seafoods in Mooloolaba have got that sustainable tick of approval for certified tuna, and they export to the world. This plan allows for that. The Greens and the Labor Party want to abolish the plan, so that not only could Walkers but anyone could do anything. It's open slather if this motion passes today because there are no plans, no management arrangements, at all. And, would you believe, that's what the Greens and the Labor Party are trying to get the Senate to do: to have no plans—to have an open slather, so everyone can go out and do whatever they want and catch whatever they want. That's what Senator Whish-Wilson is asking you to do today. How sensible is that? What absolute humbug! What absolute hypocrisy!(Quorum formed)You know you've got them on the run when they do those sorts of things, like calling a quorum, to interrupt my speech. Thank you for that, Senator Ketter. That is a real compliment to me. When the arguments start to bite home and the Labor Party and the Greens realise the hypocrisy and utter humbug of the approach they're taking, they then call a quorum so that they shut me up for a minute or two.


What the Labor Party and the Greens are asking you to do today is to remove the current protections of our marine areas. They want it to be open slather. We've just had a Greens senator telling us for 20 minutes that all they were interested in was marine protection, and yet they want to dismiss it. They want to abandon it. They want to abolish it. What absolute and utter humbug and hypocrisy from the Greens political party. Nothing surprises me about hypocrisy and humbug from the Greens, but this one must take the cake. Here we have the biggest amount of marine protection plans anywhere in Australia, ever in Australia. As I recall, under these plans we have the second highest marine protected and conserved areas anywhere in the world, but the Greens and the Labor Party want to stop it. What hypocrisy. What absolute humbug.


I was talking about Walker Seafoods, a great company out of Mooloolaba in my state. They have the Marine Stewardship Council tick for their fishing in the Coral Sea allowed by these plans. The Greens and the Labor Party want to stop that and destroy the jobs and small businesses of tens of thousands of people along the coast of my state of Queensland. They want to deprive the hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders, and other Australians from all over, of the enjoyment of sustainable recreational fishing in the Coral Sea.


We want our northern prawn fishers to continue to supply us with those magnificent banana prawns that you can only get off the coast of Queensland. And yet the Labor Party and the Greens want to stop that. They want us to import vannamei prawns from Vietnam, grown in the—I better not say that, because we like our Vietnamese people. The vannamei prawns from Vietnam, which the Greens and Labor Party would rather us be consuming, are not in the same category—not in the same world—as the wonderful, fresh banana prawns we get out of the Coral Sea in Queensland. It keeps Queenslanders in jobs and it keeps tourists coming to our state, because there aren't many places in the world where you can enjoy fresh fish and fresh prawns straight out of the Coral Sea, farmed and caught in a sustainable way. I know that Senator Ruston, here in the chamber, runs a fisheries regime as fisheries minister which won't even countenance any suggestion of overfishing. The fisheries plans that Senator Ruston oversees and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority carefully limit fishing for our fish stocks to make sure that they are forever sustainable.


Relentless campaigns by Labor and the dark forces who oppose fishing have galvanised and unified—and this is an achievement in itself, I have to say—our professional and recreational fishers. They don't often get on together but they are determined in their support for these plans. I'm not sure I even like to say this, because I've said some nasty things about the Pew regime over the years, but I'm told by Senator Ruston that even the Pew foundation, the great American conservation so-called foundation which originated in oil money out of the Gulf of Mexico—and the Pew foundation, in my view, are always trying to salve their consciences by splashing money around on conservation issues around the world—are in this building this week supporting these plans, and why wouldn't they? If you do what the Labor Party and the Greens want you to do, you'll get rid of every marine conservation plan in Australia and it will be open slather. That's what Senator Whish-Wilson wants. He wants open slather in our marine environment. He just spent 20 minutes telling us how he was so concerned about conservation of our marine areas, and what he is proposing today is that we get rid of all of these plans. What hypocrisy! What utter and absolute humbug! It's the sort of hypocrisy and lies that we've come to expect of the Greens political party, because we know they will simply say and do anything to try and make a point.


This is almost such a simple proposition that it really doesn't warrant much more discussion. You can go with the plans that are already in place, which protect the greatest areas of the Australian marine environment, or you can go with the Greens and the Labor Party and abolish those plans so that there'll be nothing there. It is such a simple proposition that I can't imagine any senator would contemplate joining the Greens and the Labor Party. Those two are only doing it because they hate anything that the coalition government does. They can't stand this booklet that says the only people who have done any work in the marine conservation area are Liberal governments. They hate that. So, for political and ideological reasons, they would have you abandon these plans that are in place and lead you back to open slather with nothing. What hypocrisy!

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:38):  It is not a pleasure to follow Senator Macdonald in speaking, in terms of the load of baloney that the minister—that the senator just delivered to this chamber.



An honourable senator:  He never made minister!




Senator SIEWERT:
  He did for a short time, in actual fact. Comments that Senator Macdonald made were derogatory to the Greens and to those that have worked for so long and hard to put in place marine protection. His No. 1 argument is, 'Well, you'd rather have nothing and you're trying to get rid of these marine plans.' That's what that side of the chamber did, when they got rid of the management plans for the marine parks in the marine protected areas, in the first place. So how can he come into this chamber and say, 'Ooh, Labor and the Greens seek to get rid of these management plans,' when that's exactly what his side did?


They got rid of the world's leading series of marine protected areas. They're well acknowledged around the world as being world leading. I cannot believe that he would have the audacity to have a go at us for trying to take it back to what it was, because that government have reduced marine protection in very important areas, bowing to the pressure from the fishing industry. That's exactly what that government did. They took away the protection that had just been put in place.


I, for one, will freely acknowledge that previous coalition governments have done work on marine protection, but to say they're the only ones is a pack of nonsense, when quite clearly we're standing here trying to protect and get back what the previous Labor government put in place. And, yes, we were critical of the things that weren't included in those areas. We wanted them to do better. I'm on the record as having said that. But this government came in place and got rid of those areas. They can play around with wording, but there is absolutely no doubt in the community's mind that that's what they did. They took away that series of marine protected areas and they took away the bioregional marine parks that were put in place as part of that process.


I've been working on marine protection since the mid-eighties. I've been through the highs and the lows. I've been through building community awareness. I've been through the process of arguing that marine protected areas and no-take zones don't protect fishing stocks. We had that really ridiculous argument when people tried to argue that they don't play a role in protecting fish stocks. We've been through that. Some people still like to deny the evidence. We've been through that. We now have acceptance of the importance of marine protection, both for the protection of marine biodiversity and for fish stocks. We've been through that. Now we have a government bowing to pressure from recreational fishers and commercial fishers and it will compromise the protection of really important areas.


I'd like to focus on Western Australia. Andrew Bartlett will talk about the travesty of the cuts to the Coral Sea, but I want to talk about my home state of Western Australia. Overwhelmingly, people in Western Australia love the marine environment. Most Western Australians live by the coast. I think it would be freely acknowledged in this place that we have a lot of very special coast. I go back to the marine campaign. Tim Winton was involved in the campaign to protect the Ningaloo Coast, to make sure that we did not have inappropriate development in Coral Bay that would have damaged the Ningaloo Coast. The Ningaloo rally was one of the biggest rallies we've ever had in Western Australia. I remember marching in Fremantle all those years ago to protect that coast, as did Tim and thousands and thousands of Western Australians. Have no doubt that Western Australians love their marine environment. They love Ningaloo and they love the south-west.


Just for a little bit of one-up-personship: the south-west marine area has the highest number of marine endemic species—far higher than other areas around the Australian coast—so it's very important that we have adequate marine protection there. We are still, in fact, developing our understanding of some of those areas. In Western Australia, under the plans that this government wants to put in place, we've seen cuts to Geographe Bay. It's halved from the 2012 area. We've seen the green zones moved offshore in those really important areas around Bremer, and allowing scallop trawling. We have seen the more intense protection for the Rowley Shoals reduced by 45 per cent. We've seen around Gascoyne and Ningaloo a 75 per cent reduction. They have mucked around the Perth Canyon and moved the protection to the wrong spot. These are important areas for marine biodiversity from around the world, growing more so every day as we understand the impact of climate change on our marine environment. These parks do not now deliver the best system in the world. We did have that, but, because of pressure from industry, and from Senator Macdonald's— (Time expired)

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:46):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. Labor has a track record that demonstrates our determination to ensure that law enforcement and national security agencies have the resources they need and the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe. Labor also believes strongly in the importance of upholding the rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation, and I'm sure you would agree with that, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall. It's essential, in designing legislation to protect our way of life, we do not compromise the very rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation and that foster harmony in our community.


National security is a fundamental duty of all parliamentarians, but, in putting in place laws to keep us safe, we must ensure those laws are consistent with the kind of society we're seeking to protect and to strengthen. Labor approaches questions of national security in a bipartisan spirit. However, bipartisanship does mean that Labor will simply agree with every measure the government proposes. Bipartisanship means that Labor will engage constructively with the proposals put forward by the government with a view to testing and, where possible, improving those measures.



It was in this spirit of constructive bipartisanship that, through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's statutory review process, Labor worked hard over 2017 and 2018 to improve several security and law enforcement powers on the Commonwealth statute books. The important work of the bipartisan intelligence committee has seen a significant review into police stop, search and seizure powers, the control order regime and the preventative detention order regime in division 3A of part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914. As well, there's been a review by the intelligence committee of sections 119.2, and 119.3 of the Criminal Code that declared areas provisions. There was a further and important review of the intelligence committee that resulted in its report, The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


This bill responds in part to these three reviews. The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018 was introduced into the other place on 24 May 2018. The Attorney-General referred the bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for a review the same day. The government's complete adoption of the Phocis's recommendations is a welcome continuance of those longstanding conventions that the government of the day implements without reservation the bipartisan recommendation of the intelligence security. The intelligence and security committee's review of the police stop, search and seizure power provided under division 3A of part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914 recommended that these powers be continued. 


The bill inserts new provision CA into division 3 of part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 to require reporting to the minister, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the intelligence committee on the use of stop, search and seizure powers under division 3 of part IAA as soon as practicable after the exercise of power or powers, and an annual report to the minister. This recommendation is entirely in keeping with Labor's abiding commitment that our law enforcement and security agency officers should have the power needed to keep Australians safe. However, the report also recommends that these powers, which are extraordinary, should also be the subject of future review by the parliament and should not be allowed to simply fall into the permanence of the Commonwealth statute book. Similarly, the intelligence committee's recommendation that the control over the regime provided for under division 104 of the Criminal Code be continued, with the provisions sunsetting after three years. The bill adopts these recommendations. These control order powers have only rarely been used. The small number of occasions where they have been used is something that the intelligence committee commented upon in its report.


One feature of the bill is that it introduces new section 104.11A in the new subdivision CA of the Criminal Code. This would enable the court to vary the terms of an interim control order where there is a written agreement between senior Australian Federal Police members and a controlee. The explanatory memorandum states that this new section is designed to facilitate minor and uncontroversial variations to an interim control order, such as changed mobile telephone numbers, change of residential addresses or change in the educational or employment arrangements of a controlee. Labor supports this change as well because it is clearly desirable that there should be a speedy and, as far as possible, informal mechanism for the variation of the control order that deals with minor matters of this nature.


This bill also inserts a new section 104.28AA into the Criminal Code to set out the limitations on the issuing court's abilities to make cost orders in control order proceedings. Under proposed subsection 104.28AA(1), the issuing court must not make an order for costs against the controlee. However, if the issuing court is satisfied that the controlee has acted unreasonably in the conduct of proceedings, it may order costs against the controlee to the extent of the unreasonable conduct. Labor considers it essential that all the powers considered by this review be available to our agencies for as long as they are necessary to ensure the peace, safety and security of the Australian community.


However, Labor also considers powers such as these must continue to be seen and understood as extraordinary. These powers were brought into our criminal law and the law enforcement framework to meet the complex circumstances that have faced security and law enforcement agencies over the last two decades. Because these powers are extraordinary, it is essential that they are subject to sunsetting and continued parliamentary oversight through regular review of the intelligence committee. It was for this reason that the intelligence committee made the recommendation, which the government has also adopted, to amend the Intelligence Services Act for the purpose of providing greater parliamentary scrutiny of these powers. This is something that the intelligence committee, in its report on this bill, has welcomed.


I also note that the bill extends the sunset period for the declared areas provisions contained in the Criminal Code. The bill inserts a new exception to the declared area offences in 119.2(1) for individuals performing official duties for the International Committee of the Red Cross. This is a welcome protection for people in organisations carrying out humanitarian work in some of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. The bill also amends schedule 1 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to provide:


… that the decisions of senior AFP members to provide or refuse consent to vary interim control orders under new section 104.11A of the Criminal Code will not be reviewable under the ADJR Act.


The bill extends the sunset date for the ASIO questioning and detention powers under division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 by 12 months to 7 September 2019. In paragraph 1.32 of its report on the bill, the intelligence committee commented on this particular provision in the bill in these terms:


The Committee notes that while the Bill implements one recommendation from the Committee's report into ASIO's questioning and detention powers, the remainder of that report (including the Committee's recommendation for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power) is still being considered by the Government. As noted above, the intent of this recommendation was that there be sufficient time for a reformed ASIO compulsory questioning framework to be developed and then reviewed by this Committee.


This bill is somewhat unusual in that it responds to a single recommendation of the intelligence committee's report on ASIO's questioning and detention warrant power. While it did recommend the extension of the powers in division 3 of part III of the ASIO Act, which includes the powers provided for questioning and detention warrants, I note that the committee also recommended that the ASIO questioning and detention warrants regime should be repealed. This is a power that has never used by ASIO and, in light of the fact that ASIO is an intelligence agency and not a law enforcement agency, it's a power that Labor agrees is unnecessary because of the fact that ASIO works very closely with the Australian Federal Police. It's also worth noting that the two previous Independent National Security Legislation Monitors had recommended, before this earlier report of the intelligence committee, that this power be repealed.


It's important to note again that this bill does not repeal the ASIO questioning and detention warrant power. Indeed, the effect of this bill is to extend for a year a power that the PJCIS has recommended should be repealed. It's understood, and the intelligence committee has noted that it understands, that in extending both ASIO's powers, the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power, the government simply is seeking to leave the whole regime in place for a period of 12 months while the government seeks to work through a replacement regime for that. Labor accepts that the short extension of the whole regime is appropriate, as did the intelligence committee, in order to allow time for a reformed compulsory-questioning framework to be developed.


It's worth noting that the government has accepted all the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's recommendations in respect of the approximately 10 national security bills that have been brought to this parliament since 2014. While this is the first occasion we're aware of that the government has seen fit to extend a power that is the subject of a repeal recommendation, we in Labor thank the government for its continued commitment to the implementation of the PJCIS report recommendations. We look forward to the full implementation of this recommendation. It's Labor's view that finding the right balance between our security and our rights and freedoms is a critical ongoing task that all parliamentarians must engage in.


Because new threats to our national security may suddenly arise or diminish as a consequence of events unfolding overseas or indeed in our own country, it's particularly important that our national security laws and capabilities are, to some extent at least, never taken for granted as a set-and-forget proposition. It was in recognition of the need for an ongoing review of our national security laws that Labor established the Office of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, and it was in recognition of the ongoing nature of this function that Labor fought hard for the retention of the monitor, even as the Abbott government announced in 2014 that the office would be abolished, in the misguided belief that its purpose was somehow complete. I'm pleased that the then Abbott government eventually backed down on its proposal to abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. The continued worth of the monitor has been shown in this bill, which picked up in a very real sense the 2017 review of the stop, search and seizure powers by the then Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO.


I also note that the government's own independent intelligence review conducted by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant, which reported in the middle of last year, recommended that the intelligence committee should be given a broader power of oversight. I think that there would be general support in this place for the expansion of the intelligence and security committee's oversight role in light of that recommendation of the government's independent intelligence review.


We in Labor have a great respect for the law enforcement and national security officers who are currently serving our nation. We also acknowledge that the laws that we make also play a role in the safeguarding of our rights and freedoms. Members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party recognise that in Australia, as in many other similar democracies, the powers of intelligence and security agencies have been strengthened and expanded significantly in recent years as a consequence of an increasingly complex and unpredictable security environment. Labor agrees that the maintenance of public safety in the current security environment requires enhanced powers for the agency charged with this critical responsibility. 


However, with legislative changes extending those powers, the requirement for reliable, effective external oversight and other safeguards is always critical to maintaining an essential level of trust in the community about the vital work of our security agencies. Labor will always work to keep Australians safe and at the same time will ensure that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Australians are upheld. Getting this balance right can be a challenging task, but we always approach this task in a bipartisan and constructive manner which should leave the Australian community in no doubt that Labor will always seek to ensure that the requirements of our safety and security are proportionate and balanced against the fundamental rights and freedoms that we hold dear as a nation.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:01):  This bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018, continues the slow, zombie shuffle into authoritarianism in this country. It joins the over 200 pieces of legislation that have been passed in the last 20 years in state, territory and Commonwealth parliaments that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in Australia. These are rights and freedoms that we have sent our people overseas to fight and die to protect and enhance over many decades. We are now trading them away with absolutely no reasonable argument that in doing so we are making our community any safer. That's why the Greens have consistently advocated for a counterterrorism white paper so that the arguments can be advanced, considered and assessed as to whether or not these erosions of fundamental rights and freedoms, which are ongoing and accelerating in our country, are doing as the bipartisan Labor and Liberal parties in this place are claiming—that is, making our community safer. 


But it's not just legislation that's having a chilling effect on our democracy. We've seen decisions like the one taken recently by the Attorney-General to charge Mr Bernard Collaery and Witness K with conspiracy, a decision that will have a chilling effect on our democracy and the capacity of citizens in Australia to hold a government to account for its actions. That was a disgraceful decision. The Attorney-General has attempted to pass responsibility for it to the DPP, but ultimately this was a political decision made at the political level by the Attorney-General to charge Mr Collaery and Witness K. In fact there is a very strong argument that the crime here was committed by representatives of the government when they made the decision to bug the East Timorese government in an attempt to defraud Timor-Leste of its rights over the Timor Sea oil and gas fields. That's why—and I want to acknowledge Senator Patrick for his leadership role here—a number of us have referred that matter to the Australian Federal Police, because to the best of our knowledge there was never an investigation made into whether or not the decision to bug the Timor-Leste government was a crime. I believe it was a crime, I believe it went right to senior levels in government and I believe that those people who were involved in that crime need to be held to account for their actions. 


This piece of legislation effectively rolls over a piece of legislation that otherwise would have sunsetted on 7 September 2018. Of course, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did raise significant concerns regarding this bill's trampling of personal rights and liberties and noted that those measures were originally introduced on the basis of being a temporary response to an emergency situation. I would argue strongly that the emergency situation no longer exists, and yet this oppressive authoritarianism marches on in Australia. There are countries around the world which are debating loudly, in the public domain, the slow march to fascism, but that's not a debate that's happening to a meaningful degree in our country. We see this ongoing erosion of the rule of law and of fundamental rights and freedoms—which are part of what actually sets us apart from the people that many call terrorists—without proper checks and balances, only assessed through the closed shop of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is just a bipartisan closed shop; there is no representation from the crossbench on that committee. And when we see this ongoing march towards authoritarianism, totalitarianism and ultimately, unless we put the brakes on, a fascist state in Australia, we all ought to be very concerned. I say to both the parties that get together behind the closed doors of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security: I truly believe history will judge you very harshly for the decisions that you make in the name of public safety and counterterrorism.


This bill deals with two main areas—preventive detention orders and declared areas. In regard to preventive detention orders, I understand that federal law enforcement agencies have yet to use the preventive detention order powers, despite having had the power to do so for a decade. It's important to place on the record that these powers run contrary to the rule of law. They run contrary to the presumption of innocence and they undermine basic rights and freedoms in this country. We've seen no real evidence that these measures make our community any safer, and the government is continuing to fail in its argument for such measures. They have to be seen for what they are: a power grab from a power-hungry government within a police state, cheered on by the Labor Party. While most people read George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four as a warning, Peter Dutton read it as a blueprint.


The declared areas part of this legislation is another example of legislation that in effect presumes guilt without evidence. A prosecution need not establish proof of intent to engage in terrorist activities. We're very concerned about this. Those concerns are shared by Professor George Williams and Dr Nicola McGarrity of the University of New South Wales, and those concerns are on onus of proof, the fact that defences are too limited and the fact that legitimate reasons such as religious pilgrimage, conducting business or commercial transactions or visiting friends are ignored.


As I've said before, the Australian control order regime is, in broad terms, based on the UK model. But there's a big difference between Australia and the United Kingdom: the United Kingdom has protections in terms of the Human Rights Act. Australia remains the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of charter or bill of rights, and that's why the Australian Greens will soon be moving for an inquiry into the form that such a charter of rights should take in Australia and which rights should be protected and enshrined. It's not good enough that we remain the only liberal democracy in the world that doesn't respect civil liberties and human rights enough to enshrine them in some way in law.


This government, as I have said, has consistently failed to make the case for the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms in our country. Again, we in the Australian Greens have consistently argued for not only a charter of rights but also a counterterrorism white paper so that we can assess on a strategic and holistic basis whether or not this ongoing erosion of civil and human rights and freedoms in Australia in the name of counterterrorism is proportional, whether it's warranted, whether the government's made the case, whether Labor has made the case and whether, in fact, this ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms is making us any safer whatsoever. But the government won't do that, despite the fact that we've been calling for it for a while and despite the fact that there has been a counterterrorism white paper in the past. The argument that's put against a counterterrorism white paper, which is that this is a rapidly evolving strategic environment, doesn't stack up. Yes, it is a rapidly evolving strategic environment, but what we need is a living, breathing, evolving white-paper process so that our strategic considerations of how we respond to threats to our community can actually evolve as those threats increase, diminish or change.


We take no comfort at all from the government's assertion that control orders will only be invoked in limited circumstances. History is replete with powers being created for one specific purpose that, down the track, become normalised and used by subsequent governments for a range of other purposes. The danger here is that control orders could become a new normal, and that's particularly true when you fit this piece of legislation into the ongoing and continuing erosion of civil and human rights in Australia.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has reported three times in relation to this legislation and continues to raise concerns about it. I want to place on the record that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights most recently, on 26 June, continued to, in its own words, 'raise serious concerns about the compatibility of the regime with human rights'. Clearly, this bill engages and limits a number of fundamental rights—rights that Australia has signed up in international treaties and protocols to protect and defend. Again, it's the view of the Australian Greens that the government has abjectly failed to make the case around the necessity of those limitations or, in fact, whether those limitations are reasonable and proportionate.


We will be opposing this legislation on the basis that the government has abjectly failed to make the case; on the basis that the government continues to refuse to engage in a process like a white paper on counterterrorism so that it gets an opportunity not only to try and make the case but also to be held to account for any failures to make the case; on the basis that this has only been subjected to an inquiry in the closed shop of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; and on the basis that this continues the slow zombie shuffle into authoritarianism in our country.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. It is the latest in a long line of national security bills that have been introduced into this parliament since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. As outlined in the Bills Digest, this bill has three key purposes: to extend the provisions relating to control orders, preventative detention orders and the declared area offence, and terrorism-related stop, search and seizure powers, for a further three years; to extend the provisions relating to questioning warrants and questioning and detention warrants for a further 12 months; and to implement the government's response to certain recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the PJCIS in their most recent reviews of those provisions.


Centre Alliance will be supporting the bill. Centre Alliance supports appropriate powers being granted to our law enforcement and national security agencies to keep Australians safe. However, Centre Alliance also strongly supports robust oversight measures to ensure that the rights and freedoms that these laws are designed to protect are not compromised. I am pleased to see that the government has agreed to amend the Intelligence Services Act for the purpose of providing greater parliamentary scrutiny of these additional powers.


I note that the PJCIS, in its report on the bill, welcomed this. At paragraph 134 of the committee's report, the committee said:


The Committee also welcomes extension of its oversight to include Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 together with the additional reporting requirements that will be imposed. As the Committee noted in its earlier report, Committee oversight of the stop, search and seizure powers is in line with other review and oversight functions exercised by the Committee in relation to counter-terrorism.


It would come as no surprise that I want to address the need for the Intelligence Services Act to be amended to extend parliamentary scrutiny to the operations of Australia's national security and intelligence agencies. Most senators would be aware that I have attempted to effect this change through a series of amendments, for which I have been unsuccessful in getting support from this chamber. I've also attempted to refer amendments to the PJCIS but once again failed to get the support of the Senate.


On Tuesday this week, I introduced a private senator's bill, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Enhanced Parliamentary Oversight of Intelligence Agencies) Bill 2018. As stated in the second reading speech to the bill, the PJCIS is explicitly prohibited from reviewing the operations of Australia's intelligence agencies. The PJCIS is prohibited by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 from reviewing intelligence-gathering priorities and operations of Australian intelligence agencies or the assessments and reports they produce. The committee is further barred from examining sources of information, operational activities and methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by intelligence and national security agencies. The PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by ministers that regulate the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons. These limitations on parliamentary scrutiny have reflected the historical reluctance of past governments and intelligence officials to trust members of parliament outside of the executive with the most sensitive intelligence information. However, the PJCIS can't hold these agencies properly accountable for their activities if the parliament continues to ban its own committee from reviewing their operations and other activities. Nor can expenditure and administration be adequately examined without consideration and reference to operational performance.


I acknowledge the advocacy of former Senator Faulkner, who strongly urged this broad reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Penny Wong, has also rightly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duty to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. This is absolutely true. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then there is something wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it is ultimately meant to serve.


While I won't be moving amendments that reflect the bill I introduced, I will be seeking the support of the Senate next week to refer it to the PJCIS for inquiry and report. I note that Mr Dreyfus, in his second reading speech on this bill, said:


Labor continues to press for the significant changes to the role of the intelligence and security committee that were recommended by Senator John Faulkner in reforms, which were subsequently have been taken up in a private senator's bill by Senator Penny Wong, and by the independent intelligence review of 2017. These powers of oversight go beyond the expanded powers provided for in this bill, because necessarily the reviews which are reflected in this legislation are limited to the powers that are reviewed. We look forward to the government positively responding to its own review and assisting Labor with the implementation of the Faulkner reforms.


I want to make it clear that Centre Alliance fully supports our intelligence services, but they're not infallible in their judgement and they're not infallible in the execution of their tasking. No-one can be at the top of their game all of the time. So I'm not suggesting any criticism here.


I had the Parliamentary Library look into the times where our intelligence services' decisions have been called into question or the conduct or effectiveness of their operations has been called into question. It is quite a lengthy document, but it covers a number of decades. I will give you a few examples I have pulled from there: ASIS and the Chilean coup, I think it was in 1973; the Sydney Hilton bombing; the Sheraton Hotel incident; the Haneef affair; and, of course, the 2004 bugging of the East Timor cabinet rooms, which most people will be familiar with as the witness K story.


I note that people are still using the word 'alleged' when they refer to that bugging. But I think we can be absolutely satisfied that there was truth in that. There are proceedings on foot in the ACT in relation to what I presume is the revealing of those operations. I'm not conceding that on anyone's behalf, but I suggest that you can't bring proceedings about the release of information about a fictitious operation. That doesn't make any sense. So I think we can get away from calling the operation 'alleged'; it occurred. That operation occurred back in 2004, at about the same time that Jemaah Islamiyah were engaged in planning and actually bombing the Australian Embassy. At that time, we diverted our intelligence resources from the counterterrorism task to spying on the East Timorese during negotiations over oil rights in the Timor Sea.


East Timor has been a good ally and loyal friend of Australia. Their support of our soldiers fighting the Japanese in 1942 was vital. The East Timorese suffered 40,000 deaths due to aerial bombings and the Japanese destruction of villages suspected of sheltering Australian troops. Australian troops were protected—and I quote from Senator Neville Bonner—'at the expense of the lives of many, many East Timorese'. So I find it unconscionable, immoral and illegal conduct for our spying agencies, when we are engaged in a joint-venture negotiation with one of the poorest countries in our region, to spy on them to gain advantage during those negotiations. Hopefully, the AFP will conduct its investigations into the matter thoroughly. I put it that there has been a breach of ACT law in respect of that. If we had parliamentary scrutiny in place at the time, that operation may never have occurred. It was an operation that was authorised by the Liberal government—and perhaps the weight of the moral compass of the Labor Party at the time would have made sure that did not occur.


We now have an intelligence service that has 7,000 officials working in the field and a budget of about $2 billion. This parliament has extended its powers—and some of them are secret powers, powers exercised in secrecy. When we do that, we need to make sure we have the right checks and balances in place. I congratulate the government in this instance as they have increased a power, or extended the time associated with a power, to balance that correctly with parliamentary oversight. Parliamentary oversight is a good thing. Our allies use it. Our Five Eyes allies have parliamentary or congressional oversight. The USA has very, very strong parliamentary oversight. The Canadians have parliamentary oversight. The UK has parliamentary oversight. So we are an outlier. Parliamentary oversight of the intelligence services would strengthen the public's confidence in our intelligence services. I commend this bill to the Senate, but I strongly urge that we get on and deal with proper oversight of our intelligence services at the first available opportunity.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-16,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:24):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. This bill extends powers that are due to sunset on 7 September 2018. It's almost not necessary to explain why I oppose this bill, because just reading out what those powers are that are being extended is almost sufficient by itself. I will go through them. The bill extends for three years the Commonwealth control order regime. This allows a court to impose restrictions on a person without needing to suspect the person of a crime or to intend to charge the person with a crime and where noncompliance with that order can lead to five years imprisonment.


The bill extends for three years the Commonwealth preventive detention regime, which allows the Australian Federal Police to detain a person for up to 48 hours without needing to suspect the person of a crime or to intend to charge the person with a crime and where, again, noncompliance with that detention can lead to five years imprisonment. It extends for three years the Commonwealth's declared areas provisions, which make it an offence punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment to enter or remain in an area in a foreign country declared by the foreign minister. It extends for three years the Commonwealth's stop, search and seizure powers, which allow a person in a Commonwealth place in a prescribed security zone to be searched without a warrant and without the need for reasonable suspicion. The bill also extends for one year ASIO's power to have a person who is not suspected of a crime forcibly taken into custody, detained for up to seven days, required to answer questions and provide documents, and required to not disclose the questioning and detention, with noncompliance punishable by up to five years imprisonment.


These five powers—four to be extended for three years, one for one year—are scarcely used. The control order regime has been used just six times. The preventive detention regime has never been used. The declared areas provisions have never been used. The stop, search and seizure powers have never been used. ASIO's power to hold people for questioning for up to seven days, which they're not allowed to tell anyone about, has been used 16 times. So the question is: if those powers are not being used, why are they there? There is no specific threat referred to as justification for extending them. On the one hand, in a liberal democracy—a true, free society—they are of little use and benefit. They would, on the other hand, be of considerable benefit to an authoritarian regime which was seeking to establish its authority. Therefore, this is a risk to society. This is a risk to our freedom. This is a risk to liberal democracy. We are handing powers, which we say are fine—they haven't been used; they will only be used in rare instances—to authorities basically as a blank cheque. As Senator Patrick has so eloquently discussed just prior to me speaking, there is no parliamentary oversight for the use of those powers. This is a travesty of democracy. It is contrary to the principles of a free society. I emphatically oppose this bill.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-16,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:29):  I thank the honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. Since September 2014, Australia's national terrorism threat level has been at 'probable'. This means that there is credible intelligence assessed by our security agencies indicating that individuals or groups continue to possess the intent, the capacity and the capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia.


In this prevailing threat environment, it is critical that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to protect the community from the threat of a terrorist act. Consistent with the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, this bill extends the operation of the control order regime, the preventive detention order regime, the declared area provisions and the terrorism stop, search and seize powers beyond their sunset date of 7 September 2018. These powers will operate for a future three years, until 7 September 2021.


Each of these powers plays an important role in equipping our agencies with the capabilities they need to address the threat of terrorism. The control order and PDO regimes are vital preventive powers that enable law enforcement agencies to take proactive steps to mitigate the threat of a terrorist act where traditional law enforcement powers are not available. The declared areas offence forms an important element of managing the risk posed by the return of Australians who have participated in conflicts overseas with a listed terrorist organisation. It equips our law enforcement and prosecution agencies with the tools to arrest, charge and prosecute returning foreign fighters. Terrorism stop, search and seize powers under the Crimes Act enable law enforcement agencies to act immediately in the event of a terrorism threat to or a terrorism incident within Commonwealth places such as airports and defence establishments.


The bill will continue the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's questioning and questioning and detention powers in relation to terrorism offences for a further 12 months. This will enable the continuation of these important intelligence gathering powers while the government considers the PJCIS's other recommendation in relation to ASIO's powers.


In accordance with the recommendations of the PJCIS and the INSLM, the bill also makes other amendments to these counterterrorism provisions to ensure they continue to meet the operational needs of law enforcement agencies whilst also ensuring the proportionality of these regimes. The bill also increases independent oversight of these counterterrorism provisions to promote greater accountability and transparency around their use. Enhanced oversight provides confidence that these extraordinary powers are being exercised judiciously and in appropriate circumstances by Commonwealth agencies.


I'd like to thank the PJCIS and the INSLM for their detailed consideration of each of the sunsetting counterterrorism powers and offences. The work of the PJCIS and the INSLM was invaluable in informing the deliberations of government on the necessity and effectiveness of these critical counterterrorism provisions and ways to improve their operation. I also thank my colleagues across all sides of the chamber for recognising the need for these important measures. This bill reflects the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australia's counterterrorism legislative framework remains robust and that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to respond to the evolving threat of terrorism.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:46):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. Labor has a track record that demonstrates our determination to ensure that law enforcement and national security agencies have the resources they need and the powers that are necessary to keep Australians safe. Labor also believes strongly in the importance of upholding the rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation, and I'm sure you would agree with that, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall. It's essential, in designing legislation to protect our way of life, we do not compromise the very rights and freedoms that define us as a democratic nation and that foster harmony in our community.


National security is a fundamental duty of all parliamentarians, but, in putting in place laws to keep us safe, we must ensure those laws are consistent with the kind of society we're seeking to protect and to strengthen. Labor approaches questions of national security in a bipartisan spirit. However, bipartisanship does mean that Labor will simply agree with every measure the government proposes. Bipartisanship means that Labor will engage constructively with the proposals put forward by the government with a view to testing and, where possible, improving those measures.



It was in this spirit of constructive bipartisanship that, through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's statutory review process, Labor worked hard over 2017 and 2018 to improve several security and law enforcement powers on the Commonwealth statute books. The important work of the bipartisan intelligence committee has seen a significant review into police stop, search and seizure powers, the control order regime and the preventative detention order regime in division 3A of part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914. As well, there's been a review by the intelligence committee of sections 119.2, and 119.3 of the Criminal Code that declared areas provisions. There was a further and important review of the intelligence committee that resulted in its report, The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


This bill responds in part to these three reviews. The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018 was introduced into the other place on 24 May 2018. The Attorney-General referred the bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for a review the same day. The government's complete adoption of the Phocis's recommendations is a welcome continuance of those longstanding conventions that the government of the day implements without reservation the bipartisan recommendation of the intelligence security. The intelligence and security committee's review of the police stop, search and seizure power provided under division 3A of part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914 recommended that these powers be continued. 


The bill inserts new provision CA into division 3 of part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 to require reporting to the minister, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the intelligence committee on the use of stop, search and seizure powers under division 3 of part IAA as soon as practicable after the exercise of power or powers, and an annual report to the minister. This recommendation is entirely in keeping with Labor's abiding commitment that our law enforcement and security agency officers should have the power needed to keep Australians safe. However, the report also recommends that these powers, which are extraordinary, should also be the subject of future review by the parliament and should not be allowed to simply fall into the permanence of the Commonwealth statute book. Similarly, the intelligence committee's recommendation that the control over the regime provided for under division 104 of the Criminal Code be continued, with the provisions sunsetting after three years. The bill adopts these recommendations. These control order powers have only rarely been used. The small number of occasions where they have been used is something that the intelligence committee commented upon in its report.


One feature of the bill is that it introduces new section 104.11A in the new subdivision CA of the Criminal Code. This would enable the court to vary the terms of an interim control order where there is a written agreement between senior Australian Federal Police members and a controlee. The explanatory memorandum states that this new section is designed to facilitate minor and uncontroversial variations to an interim control order, such as changed mobile telephone numbers, change of residential addresses or change in the educational or employment arrangements of a controlee. Labor supports this change as well because it is clearly desirable that there should be a speedy and, as far as possible, informal mechanism for the variation of the control order that deals with minor matters of this nature.


This bill also inserts a new section 104.28AA into the Criminal Code to set out the limitations on the issuing court's abilities to make cost orders in control order proceedings. Under proposed subsection 104.28AA(1), the issuing court must not make an order for costs against the controlee. However, if the issuing court is satisfied that the controlee has acted unreasonably in the conduct of proceedings, it may order costs against the controlee to the extent of the unreasonable conduct. Labor considers it essential that all the powers considered by this review be available to our agencies for as long as they are necessary to ensure the peace, safety and security of the Australian community.


However, Labor also considers powers such as these must continue to be seen and understood as extraordinary. These powers were brought into our criminal law and the law enforcement framework to meet the complex circumstances that have faced security and law enforcement agencies over the last two decades. Because these powers are extraordinary, it is essential that they are subject to sunsetting and continued parliamentary oversight through regular review of the intelligence committee. It was for this reason that the intelligence committee made the recommendation, which the government has also adopted, to amend the Intelligence Services Act for the purpose of providing greater parliamentary scrutiny of these powers. This is something that the intelligence committee, in its report on this bill, has welcomed.


I also note that the bill extends the sunset period for the declared areas provisions contained in the Criminal Code. The bill inserts a new exception to the declared area offences in 119.2(1) for individuals performing official duties for the International Committee of the Red Cross. This is a welcome protection for people in organisations carrying out humanitarian work in some of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. The bill also amends schedule 1 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to provide:


… that the decisions of senior AFP members to provide or refuse consent to vary interim control orders under new section 104.11A of the Criminal Code will not be reviewable under the ADJR Act.


The bill extends the sunset date for the ASIO questioning and detention powers under division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 by 12 months to 7 September 2019. In paragraph 1.32 of its report on the bill, the intelligence committee commented on this particular provision in the bill in these terms:


The Committee notes that while the Bill implements one recommendation from the Committee's report into ASIO's questioning and detention powers, the remainder of that report (including the Committee's recommendation for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power) is still being considered by the Government. As noted above, the intent of this recommendation was that there be sufficient time for a reformed ASIO compulsory questioning framework to be developed and then reviewed by this Committee.


This bill is somewhat unusual in that it responds to a single recommendation of the intelligence committee's report on ASIO's questioning and detention warrant power. While it did recommend the extension of the powers in division 3 of part III of the ASIO Act, which includes the powers provided for questioning and detention warrants, I note that the committee also recommended that the ASIO questioning and detention warrants regime should be repealed. This is a power that has never used by ASIO and, in light of the fact that ASIO is an intelligence agency and not a law enforcement agency, it's a power that Labor agrees is unnecessary because of the fact that ASIO works very closely with the Australian Federal Police. It's also worth noting that the two previous Independent National Security Legislation Monitors had recommended, before this earlier report of the intelligence committee, that this power be repealed.


It's important to note again that this bill does not repeal the ASIO questioning and detention warrant power. Indeed, the effect of this bill is to extend for a year a power that the PJCIS has recommended should be repealed. It's understood, and the intelligence committee has noted that it understands, that in extending both ASIO's powers, the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power, the government simply is seeking to leave the whole regime in place for a period of 12 months while the government seeks to work through a replacement regime for that. Labor accepts that the short extension of the whole regime is appropriate, as did the intelligence committee, in order to allow time for a reformed compulsory-questioning framework to be developed.


It's worth noting that the government has accepted all the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's recommendations in respect of the approximately 10 national security bills that have been brought to this parliament since 2014. While this is the first occasion we're aware of that the government has seen fit to extend a power that is the subject of a repeal recommendation, we in Labor thank the government for its continued commitment to the implementation of the PJCIS report recommendations. We look forward to the full implementation of this recommendation. It's Labor's view that finding the right balance between our security and our rights and freedoms is a critical ongoing task that all parliamentarians must engage in.


Because new threats to our national security may suddenly arise or diminish as a consequence of events unfolding overseas or indeed in our own country, it's particularly important that our national security laws and capabilities are, to some extent at least, never taken for granted as a set-and-forget proposition. It was in recognition of the need for an ongoing review of our national security laws that Labor established the Office of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, and it was in recognition of the ongoing nature of this function that Labor fought hard for the retention of the monitor, even as the Abbott government announced in 2014 that the office would be abolished, in the misguided belief that its purpose was somehow complete. I'm pleased that the then Abbott government eventually backed down on its proposal to abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. The continued worth of the monitor has been shown in this bill, which picked up in a very real sense the 2017 review of the stop, search and seizure powers by the then Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Hon. Roger Giles AO.


I also note that the government's own independent intelligence review conducted by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant, which reported in the middle of last year, recommended that the intelligence committee should be given a broader power of oversight. I think that there would be general support in this place for the expansion of the intelligence and security committee's oversight role in light of that recommendation of the government's independent intelligence review.


We in Labor have a great respect for the law enforcement and national security officers who are currently serving our nation. We also acknowledge that the laws that we make also play a role in the safeguarding of our rights and freedoms. Members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party recognise that in Australia, as in many other similar democracies, the powers of intelligence and security agencies have been strengthened and expanded significantly in recent years as a consequence of an increasingly complex and unpredictable security environment. Labor agrees that the maintenance of public safety in the current security environment requires enhanced powers for the agency charged with this critical responsibility. 


However, with legislative changes extending those powers, the requirement for reliable, effective external oversight and other safeguards is always critical to maintaining an essential level of trust in the community about the vital work of our security agencies. Labor will always work to keep Australians safe and at the same time will ensure that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Australians are upheld. Getting this balance right can be a challenging task, but we always approach this task in a bipartisan and constructive manner which should leave the Australian community in no doubt that Labor will always seek to ensure that the requirements of our safety and security are proportionate and balanced against the fundamental rights and freedoms that we hold dear as a nation.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:01):  This bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018, continues the slow, zombie shuffle into authoritarianism in this country. It joins the over 200 pieces of legislation that have been passed in the last 20 years in state, territory and Commonwealth parliaments that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in Australia. These are rights and freedoms that we have sent our people overseas to fight and die to protect and enhance over many decades. We are now trading them away with absolutely no reasonable argument that in doing so we are making our community any safer. That's why the Greens have consistently advocated for a counterterrorism white paper so that the arguments can be advanced, considered and assessed as to whether or not these erosions of fundamental rights and freedoms, which are ongoing and accelerating in our country, are doing as the bipartisan Labor and Liberal parties in this place are claiming—that is, making our community safer. 


But it's not just legislation that's having a chilling effect on our democracy. We've seen decisions like the one taken recently by the Attorney-General to charge Mr Bernard Collaery and Witness K with conspiracy, a decision that will have a chilling effect on our democracy and the capacity of citizens in Australia to hold a government to account for its actions. That was a disgraceful decision. The Attorney-General has attempted to pass responsibility for it to the DPP, but ultimately this was a political decision made at the political level by the Attorney-General to charge Mr Collaery and Witness K. In fact there is a very strong argument that the crime here was committed by representatives of the government when they made the decision to bug the East Timorese government in an attempt to defraud Timor-Leste of its rights over the Timor Sea oil and gas fields. That's why—and I want to acknowledge Senator Patrick for his leadership role here—a number of us have referred that matter to the Australian Federal Police, because to the best of our knowledge there was never an investigation made into whether or not the decision to bug the Timor-Leste government was a crime. I believe it was a crime, I believe it went right to senior levels in government and I believe that those people who were involved in that crime need to be held to account for their actions. 


This piece of legislation effectively rolls over a piece of legislation that otherwise would have sunsetted on 7 September 2018. Of course, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did raise significant concerns regarding this bill's trampling of personal rights and liberties and noted that those measures were originally introduced on the basis of being a temporary response to an emergency situation. I would argue strongly that the emergency situation no longer exists, and yet this oppressive authoritarianism marches on in Australia. There are countries around the world which are debating loudly, in the public domain, the slow march to fascism, but that's not a debate that's happening to a meaningful degree in our country. We see this ongoing erosion of the rule of law and of fundamental rights and freedoms—which are part of what actually sets us apart from the people that many call terrorists—without proper checks and balances, only assessed through the closed shop of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is just a bipartisan closed shop; there is no representation from the crossbench on that committee. And when we see this ongoing march towards authoritarianism, totalitarianism and ultimately, unless we put the brakes on, a fascist state in Australia, we all ought to be very concerned. I say to both the parties that get together behind the closed doors of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security: I truly believe history will judge you very harshly for the decisions that you make in the name of public safety and counterterrorism.


This bill deals with two main areas—preventive detention orders and declared areas. In regard to preventive detention orders, I understand that federal law enforcement agencies have yet to use the preventive detention order powers, despite having had the power to do so for a decade. It's important to place on the record that these powers run contrary to the rule of law. They run contrary to the presumption of innocence and they undermine basic rights and freedoms in this country. We've seen no real evidence that these measures make our community any safer, and the government is continuing to fail in its argument for such measures. They have to be seen for what they are: a power grab from a power-hungry government within a police state, cheered on by the Labor Party. While most people read George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four as a warning, Peter Dutton read it as a blueprint.


The declared areas part of this legislation is another example of legislation that in effect presumes guilt without evidence. A prosecution need not establish proof of intent to engage in terrorist activities. We're very concerned about this. Those concerns are shared by Professor George Williams and Dr Nicola McGarrity of the University of New South Wales, and those concerns are on onus of proof, the fact that defences are too limited and the fact that legitimate reasons such as religious pilgrimage, conducting business or commercial transactions or visiting friends are ignored.


As I've said before, the Australian control order regime is, in broad terms, based on the UK model. But there's a big difference between Australia and the United Kingdom: the United Kingdom has protections in terms of the Human Rights Act. Australia remains the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of charter or bill of rights, and that's why the Australian Greens will soon be moving for an inquiry into the form that such a charter of rights should take in Australia and which rights should be protected and enshrined. It's not good enough that we remain the only liberal democracy in the world that doesn't respect civil liberties and human rights enough to enshrine them in some way in law.


This government, as I have said, has consistently failed to make the case for the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms in our country. Again, we in the Australian Greens have consistently argued for not only a charter of rights but also a counterterrorism white paper so that we can assess on a strategic and holistic basis whether or not this ongoing erosion of civil and human rights and freedoms in Australia in the name of counterterrorism is proportional, whether it's warranted, whether the government's made the case, whether Labor has made the case and whether, in fact, this ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms is making us any safer whatsoever. But the government won't do that, despite the fact that we've been calling for it for a while and despite the fact that there has been a counterterrorism white paper in the past. The argument that's put against a counterterrorism white paper, which is that this is a rapidly evolving strategic environment, doesn't stack up. Yes, it is a rapidly evolving strategic environment, but what we need is a living, breathing, evolving white-paper process so that our strategic considerations of how we respond to threats to our community can actually evolve as those threats increase, diminish or change.


We take no comfort at all from the government's assertion that control orders will only be invoked in limited circumstances. History is replete with powers being created for one specific purpose that, down the track, become normalised and used by subsequent governments for a range of other purposes. The danger here is that control orders could become a new normal, and that's particularly true when you fit this piece of legislation into the ongoing and continuing erosion of civil and human rights in Australia.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has reported three times in relation to this legislation and continues to raise concerns about it. I want to place on the record that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights most recently, on 26 June, continued to, in its own words, 'raise serious concerns about the compatibility of the regime with human rights'. Clearly, this bill engages and limits a number of fundamental rights—rights that Australia has signed up in international treaties and protocols to protect and defend. Again, it's the view of the Australian Greens that the government has abjectly failed to make the case around the necessity of those limitations or, in fact, whether those limitations are reasonable and proportionate.


We will be opposing this legislation on the basis that the government has abjectly failed to make the case; on the basis that the government continues to refuse to engage in a process like a white paper on counterterrorism so that it gets an opportunity not only to try and make the case but also to be held to account for any failures to make the case; on the basis that this has only been subjected to an inquiry in the closed shop of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; and on the basis that this continues the slow zombie shuffle into authoritarianism in our country.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-08-16,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. It is the latest in a long line of national security bills that have been introduced into this parliament since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. As outlined in the Bills Digest, this bill has three key purposes: to extend the provisions relating to control orders, preventative detention orders and the declared area offence, and terrorism-related stop, search and seizure powers, for a further three years; to extend the provisions relating to questioning warrants and questioning and detention warrants for a further 12 months; and to implement the government's response to certain recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the PJCIS in their most recent reviews of those provisions.


Centre Alliance will be supporting the bill. Centre Alliance supports appropriate powers being granted to our law enforcement and national security agencies to keep Australians safe. However, Centre Alliance also strongly supports robust oversight measures to ensure that the rights and freedoms that these laws are designed to protect are not compromised. I am pleased to see that the government has agreed to amend the Intelligence Services Act for the purpose of providing greater parliamentary scrutiny of these additional powers.


I note that the PJCIS, in its report on the bill, welcomed this. At paragraph 134 of the committee's report, the committee said:


The Committee also welcomes extension of its oversight to include Division 3A of Part IAA of the Crimes Act 1914 together with the additional reporting requirements that will be imposed. As the Committee noted in its earlier report, Committee oversight of the stop, search and seizure powers is in line with other review and oversight functions exercised by the Committee in relation to counter-terrorism.


It would come as no surprise that I want to address the need for the Intelligence Services Act to be amended to extend parliamentary scrutiny to the operations of Australia's national security and intelligence agencies. Most senators would be aware that I have attempted to effect this change through a series of amendments, for which I have been unsuccessful in getting support from this chamber. I've also attempted to refer amendments to the PJCIS but once again failed to get the support of the Senate.


On Tuesday this week, I introduced a private senator's bill, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Enhanced Parliamentary Oversight of Intelligence Agencies) Bill 2018. As stated in the second reading speech to the bill, the PJCIS is explicitly prohibited from reviewing the operations of Australia's intelligence agencies. The PJCIS is prohibited by the Intelligence Services Act 2001 from reviewing intelligence-gathering priorities and operations of Australian intelligence agencies or the assessments and reports they produce. The committee is further barred from examining sources of information, operational activities and methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by intelligence and national security agencies. The PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by ministers that regulate the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons. These limitations on parliamentary scrutiny have reflected the historical reluctance of past governments and intelligence officials to trust members of parliament outside of the executive with the most sensitive intelligence information. However, the PJCIS can't hold these agencies properly accountable for their activities if the parliament continues to ban its own committee from reviewing their operations and other activities. Nor can expenditure and administration be adequately examined without consideration and reference to operational performance.


I acknowledge the advocacy of former Senator Faulkner, who strongly urged this broad reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Penny Wong, has also rightly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duty to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. This is absolutely true. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then there is something wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it is ultimately meant to serve.


While I won't be moving amendments that reflect the bill I introduced, I will be seeking the support of the Senate next week to refer it to the PJCIS for inquiry and report. I note that Mr Dreyfus, in his second reading speech on this bill, said:


Labor continues to press for the significant changes to the role of the intelligence and security committee that were recommended by Senator John Faulkner in reforms, which were subsequently have been taken up in a private senator's bill by Senator Penny Wong, and by the independent intelligence review of 2017. These powers of oversight go beyond the expanded powers provided for in this bill, because necessarily the reviews which are reflected in this legislation are limited to the powers that are reviewed. We look forward to the government positively responding to its own review and assisting Labor with the implementation of the Faulkner reforms.


I want to make it clear that Centre Alliance fully supports our intelligence services, but they're not infallible in their judgement and they're not infallible in the execution of their tasking. No-one can be at the top of their game all of the time. So I'm not suggesting any criticism here.


I had the Parliamentary Library look into the times where our intelligence services' decisions have been called into question or the conduct or effectiveness of their operations has been called into question. It is quite a lengthy document, but it covers a number of decades. I will give you a few examples I have pulled from there: ASIS and the Chilean coup, I think it was in 1973; the Sydney Hilton bombing; the Sheraton Hotel incident; the Haneef affair; and, of course, the 2004 bugging of the East Timor cabinet rooms, which most people will be familiar with as the witness K story.


I note that people are still using the word 'alleged' when they refer to that bugging. But I think we can be absolutely satisfied that there was truth in that. There are proceedings on foot in the ACT in relation to what I presume is the revealing of those operations. I'm not conceding that on anyone's behalf, but I suggest that you can't bring proceedings about the release of information about a fictitious operation. That doesn't make any sense. So I think we can get away from calling the operation 'alleged'; it occurred. That operation occurred back in 2004, at about the same time that Jemaah Islamiyah were engaged in planning and actually bombing the Australian Embassy. At that time, we diverted our intelligence resources from the counterterrorism task to spying on the East Timorese during negotiations over oil rights in the Timor Sea.


East Timor has been a good ally and loyal friend of Australia. Their support of our soldiers fighting the Japanese in 1942 was vital. The East Timorese suffered 40,000 deaths due to aerial bombings and the Japanese destruction of villages suspected of sheltering Australian troops. Australian troops were protected—and I quote from Senator Neville Bonner—'at the expense of the lives of many, many East Timorese'. So I find it unconscionable, immoral and illegal conduct for our spying agencies, when we are engaged in a joint-venture negotiation with one of the poorest countries in our region, to spy on them to gain advantage during those negotiations. Hopefully, the AFP will conduct its investigations into the matter thoroughly. I put it that there has been a breach of ACT law in respect of that. If we had parliamentary scrutiny in place at the time, that operation may never have occurred. It was an operation that was authorised by the Liberal government—and perhaps the weight of the moral compass of the Labor Party at the time would have made sure that did not occur.


We now have an intelligence service that has 7,000 officials working in the field and a budget of about $2 billion. This parliament has extended its powers—and some of them are secret powers, powers exercised in secrecy. When we do that, we need to make sure we have the right checks and balances in place. I congratulate the government in this instance as they have increased a power, or extended the time associated with a power, to balance that correctly with parliamentary oversight. Parliamentary oversight is a good thing. Our allies use it. Our Five Eyes allies have parliamentary or congressional oversight. The USA has very, very strong parliamentary oversight. The Canadians have parliamentary oversight. The UK has parliamentary oversight. So we are an outlier. Parliamentary oversight of the intelligence services would strengthen the public's confidence in our intelligence services. I commend this bill to the Senate, but I strongly urge that we get on and deal with proper oversight of our intelligence services at the first available opportunity.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-08-16,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:24):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. This bill extends powers that are due to sunset on 7 September 2018. It's almost not necessary to explain why I oppose this bill, because just reading out what those powers are that are being extended is almost sufficient by itself. I will go through them. The bill extends for three years the Commonwealth control order regime. This allows a court to impose restrictions on a person without needing to suspect the person of a crime or to intend to charge the person with a crime and where noncompliance with that order can lead to five years imprisonment.


The bill extends for three years the Commonwealth preventive detention regime, which allows the Australian Federal Police to detain a person for up to 48 hours without needing to suspect the person of a crime or to intend to charge the person with a crime and where, again, noncompliance with that detention can lead to five years imprisonment. It extends for three years the Commonwealth's declared areas provisions, which make it an offence punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment to enter or remain in an area in a foreign country declared by the foreign minister. It extends for three years the Commonwealth's stop, search and seizure powers, which allow a person in a Commonwealth place in a prescribed security zone to be searched without a warrant and without the need for reasonable suspicion. The bill also extends for one year ASIO's power to have a person who is not suspected of a crime forcibly taken into custody, detained for up to seven days, required to answer questions and provide documents, and required to not disclose the questioning and detention, with noncompliance punishable by up to five years imprisonment.


These five powers—four to be extended for three years, one for one year—are scarcely used. The control order regime has been used just six times. The preventive detention regime has never been used. The declared areas provisions have never been used. The stop, search and seizure powers have never been used. ASIO's power to hold people for questioning for up to seven days, which they're not allowed to tell anyone about, has been used 16 times. So the question is: if those powers are not being used, why are they there? There is no specific threat referred to as justification for extending them. On the one hand, in a liberal democracy—a true, free society—they are of little use and benefit. They would, on the other hand, be of considerable benefit to an authoritarian regime which was seeking to establish its authority. Therefore, this is a risk to society. This is a risk to our freedom. This is a risk to liberal democracy. We are handing powers, which we say are fine—they haven't been used; they will only be used in rare instances—to authorities basically as a blank cheque. As Senator Patrick has so eloquently discussed just prior to me speaking, there is no parliamentary oversight for the use of those powers. This is a travesty of democracy. It is contrary to the principles of a free society. I emphatically oppose this bill.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-08-16,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:29):  I thank the honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018. Since September 2014, Australia's national terrorism threat level has been at 'probable'. This means that there is credible intelligence assessed by our security agencies indicating that individuals or groups continue to possess the intent, the capacity and the capability to conduct a terrorist attack in Australia.


In this prevailing threat environment, it is critical that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to protect the community from the threat of a terrorist act. Consistent with the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, this bill extends the operation of the control order regime, the preventive detention order regime, the declared area provisions and the terrorism stop, search and seize powers beyond their sunset date of 7 September 2018. These powers will operate for a future three years, until 7 September 2021.


Each of these powers plays an important role in equipping our agencies with the capabilities they need to address the threat of terrorism. The control order and PDO regimes are vital preventive powers that enable law enforcement agencies to take proactive steps to mitigate the threat of a terrorist act where traditional law enforcement powers are not available. The declared areas offence forms an important element of managing the risk posed by the return of Australians who have participated in conflicts overseas with a listed terrorist organisation. It equips our law enforcement and prosecution agencies with the tools to arrest, charge and prosecute returning foreign fighters. Terrorism stop, search and seize powers under the Crimes Act enable law enforcement agencies to act immediately in the event of a terrorism threat to or a terrorism incident within Commonwealth places such as airports and defence establishments.


The bill will continue the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's questioning and questioning and detention powers in relation to terrorism offences for a further 12 months. This will enable the continuation of these important intelligence gathering powers while the government considers the PJCIS's other recommendation in relation to ASIO's powers.


In accordance with the recommendations of the PJCIS and the INSLM, the bill also makes other amendments to these counterterrorism provisions to ensure they continue to meet the operational needs of law enforcement agencies whilst also ensuring the proportionality of these regimes. The bill also increases independent oversight of these counterterrorism provisions to promote greater accountability and transparency around their use. Enhanced oversight provides confidence that these extraordinary powers are being exercised judiciously and in appropriate circumstances by Commonwealth agencies.


I'd like to thank the PJCIS and the INSLM for their detailed consideration of each of the sunsetting counterterrorism powers and offences. The work of the PJCIS and the INSLM was invaluable in informing the deliberations of government on the necessity and effectiveness of these critical counterterrorism provisions and ways to improve their operation. I also thank my colleagues across all sides of the chamber for recognising the need for these important measures. This bill reflects the government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australia's counterterrorism legislative framework remains robust and that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to respond to the evolving threat of terrorism.

  We should be held to a higher standard than the standard that we set within our community, not to a lower standard.

People will tell you it's inappropriate to use sexist, misogynist language directly against a member of this place. People will tell you it is not appropriate to invoke the Holocaust to support your racist views of the world. It is no good to simply say, 'We condemn the behaviour,' when then you go ahead and vote against a censure motion, as the government and the ALP did yesterday.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:49):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. It's lunchtime on a Thursday in the Senate, and we all know what that means. It means senators are wining and dining themselves in the members' and senators' dining room and the bureaucrats take charge of this asylum we call the Senate. Over the next hour these bureaucrats will rush 12 bills reflecting their grand plans through this near-empty Senate chamber, aided by a government lackey and a collaborating senator from the opposition.


The first bill to be rushed through today is the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. It inserts one line into Australian law and, by doing so, makes a 48-page international tax treaty Australian law. This undermines our sovereignty. Where are the red-blooded nationalists we normally hear so much from—the senators from One Nation, the Greens and the old Xenophon team, and the solo senators representing Katter's Australian Party, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, the Australian Conservatives and the Justice Party? Perhaps they are nattering about the dangers of globalisation up in the senators' and members' dining room, over their plates of foie gras.


I represent the Liberal Democrats, a serious, small-government party, so I've read the bill before us today and I have an understanding of what it will do. By absorbing a vague 48-page international tax treaty into Australian law, the bill will make our tax system harder to understand, which will make it harder to do business in Australia, which, over time, will make everyday Australians worse off. On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I oppose this bill. Unfortunately, we don't currently have enough representatives of serious, small-government parties in this place to block this bill. For the sake of Australia's sovereignty, this must change.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:49):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. It's lunchtime on a Thursday in the Senate, and we all know what that means. It means senators are wining and dining themselves in the members' and senators' dining room and the bureaucrats take charge of this asylum we call the Senate. Over the next hour these bureaucrats will rush 12 bills reflecting their grand plans through this near-empty Senate chamber, aided by a government lackey and a collaborating senator from the opposition.


The first bill to be rushed through today is the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. It inserts one line into Australian law and, by doing so, makes a 48-page international tax treaty Australian law. This undermines our sovereignty. Where are the red-blooded nationalists we normally hear so much from—the senators from One Nation, the Greens and the old Xenophon team, and the solo senators representing Katter's Australian Party, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, the Australian Conservatives and the Justice Party? Perhaps they are nattering about the dangers of globalisation up in the senators' and members' dining room, over their plates of foie gras.


I represent the Liberal Democrats, a serious, small-government party, so I've read the bill before us today and I have an understanding of what it will do. By absorbing a vague 48-page international tax treaty into Australian law, the bill will make our tax system harder to understand, which will make it harder to do business in Australia, which, over time, will make everyday Australians worse off. On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I oppose this bill. Unfortunately, we don't currently have enough representatives of serious, small-government parties in this place to block this bill. For the sake of Australia's sovereignty, this must change.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (13:45):  This is now my third partial contribution on this bill, and it would appear I probably have enough time to finish before question time, so I will try and make this about as exciting as Star Wars: Episode III, given this is part 3 of my NBN speech. What I've really tried to do in my previous two contributions is to outline some of the complaints that my office receives on a regular basis—I know many others do as well—about poor NBN service quality and lack of coverage in too many parts of Queensland. I think in my first contribution I spoke about what this bill seeks to do, and I put forward Labor's position on that, so I may leave it at that in terms of the content of the bill itself. In my remaining time, I just want to pick up on some very concerning news that emerged overnight that demonstrates how much this government is leaving regional Australia behind when it comes to telecommunications and, in particular, the NBN.


As I say, on a regular basis my office receives complaints from people in regional Queensland—particularly Central Queensland, where I'm most active—about poor NBN service quality. When I ceased my previous contribution, I was talking about some of the horror stories that were put forward by Central Queensland businesses when I hosted a roundtable several months ago with our regional communications shadow minister, Steven Jones. I should point out two of the participants in this roundtable that stick in my mind most confessed that they were pretty much lifelong LNP supporters but that the poor service they had been receiving from the NBN under this government was actually most likely to shift their vote at the next election. So, even if the government isn't serious about delivering good-quality telecommunications and NBN to rural and regional Australia because it is the right thing to do—especially in a geographically decentralised state like Queensland, where good telecommunications are essential to businesses being able to compete with big urban centres and with the rest of the world—there is a very good political reason for this government to start acting on regional communications as well.


One of the instances from that roundtable that sticks most in my mind was a motorcycle dealership. The proprietor of that shop was talking to me about the immense frustration she had had with NBN services interfering with phone services and EFTPOS services. She was telling me that, pretty much from the time the NBN was installed in her dealership, she had technical difficulties that kept arising with all of her technology. She was able to point to numerous examples where customers had come into her store and walked up to the counter with, in some cases, literally over $1,000 worth of goods that they wanted to buy—it might have been motorcycle helmets, jackets or all sorts of motorcycle related materials. They'd go to pay by EFTPOS but couldn't actually pay, because the NBN difficulties were causing all of the shop's technology to go down, including their EFTPOS. They couldn't get a connection to bank services online, which meant that the customer couldn't pay for these goods, so the customer would say, 'Look, I'll go up the road and get a bit of money out of the ATM.' And, too often, customers would leave the store, leave their goods on the counter, walk out the door—allegedly to go out and get some money out of the ATM—and never come back. So, over and over again, this store was having customers walk out the door and effectively deciding not to go ahead with their purchase because of the EFTPOS and NBN related difficulties that this store was having.


Even worse was the example of a florist who attended our roundtable. Everyone who is in the habit of buying flowers for our spouses on Valentine's Day or for our mothers on Mother's Day understands that, if you are running a florist business, these are probably the two biggest days of that year. This florist was able to tell me that on both Mother's Day and Valentine's Day, the biggest days of the year—I am pretty sure she was talking about last year—her phone line went down, her NBN line went down, all of her technology went down because of NBN problems. You might as well cripple a florist store if it can't work effectively on Valentine's Day and Mother's Day—and that's what was happening here. Understandably, people who rang up this florist to try to get their flowers organised and were told that they couldn't pay for them, that it couldn't be done, went to the florist up the road and used that service instead.


These are real-life examples of how people in south-east Queensland are already suffering from the poor NBN rollout under this government. We got some more news about this overnight which showed yet again how out-of-touch NBN Co and this government, as its overseer, are with the needs of regional Australia when it comes to telecommunications. It emerged at the NBN joint committee last night that NBN Co was planning a significant price rise for regional customers. What came out in the questioning was that NBN Co is preparing to introduce new wholesale prices that discriminate between rural and regional areas on the one hand and big metropolitan centres like capital cities on the other. If you are a customer in a metropolitan area on a fixed line service—it might be Brisbane, it might be Sydney, it might be Melbourne—the wholesale rate that is going to be applied will be $45. But if you live in a rural or regional area and you are on a fixed wireless network—it might be Rockhampton, it might be Townsville, it might be Mackay, it might be Western Queensland—then the price will be $65. So there will be a $20 difference based on simply where you live and the technology that you are utilising.


Good telecommunication is really an essential tool of business no matter where it is located in this day and age. It is the way people can connect to their customers and their suppliers on a quick and efficient basis. But under this government the NBN rollout has been so poor that rural and regional Queenslanders and Australians are being left behind. Not only is that occurring as a result of the poor rollout; now NBN Co wants to discriminate on the basis of price as well. So rural and regional Queenslanders are going to be paying more for the privilege of having a worse service from the NBN than people living in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne.


It is unbelievable that a government that claims to represent rural and regional Australia would allow that to happen. We hear over and over again from our National party representatives in Queensland  that they are the guardians of the bush, the guardians of rural and regional Queensland. But here is yet another example where they have let rural and regional Queensland down. They do it on penalty rates, they do it on my behalf, they do it on poor funding for rural and regional hospitals and schools—and now they are doing it when it comes to NBN as well. Is there a single National Party representative from Queensland who is actually prepared to get up and have a go at the government for the second-rate system of NBN that continues to be laid out in regional Queensland and for discriminating against rural and regional Queenslanders when it comes to prices? Unfortunately, we are still waiting for that to happen.


This bill does go some way to providing all Australians, whether they be city based Australians or rural and regional Australians, with the kind of guarantee of good service they are entitled to. As I mentioned in a previous contribution, the first aspect of this bill is to legislate with certainty that all premises in Australia can continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure beyond the NBN rollout. It really says it all about this government's poor NBN rollout. Simply having the NBN say to people that they will ensure that all Australians can continue to access high-speed broadband infrastructure isn't enough. They have actually got to go the extra mile and now enshrine it in legislation because the NBN, under this government, cannot be relied upon to deliver. We are pleased to see this government actually put it beyond doubt in legislation that all Australians, no matter where they live, are going to have access to high-speed broadband infrastructure once the NBN is rolled out. But, as I say, it says something very grave about this government's rollout of the NBN that it actually has to take that step.


The NBN really has become one of the running sores of this government. No matter which electorate people represent here in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, every single day people are coming to our electorate offices complaining about the poor NBN rollout and service under this government. It has become an embarrassment. The number of countries that have better NBN services and better broadband than Australia, including in parts of the developing world, really put this government to shame when it comes to the NBN. So I hope that this bill is the beginning of a change of attitude, a proper rollout of the NBN, guaranteeing people the services that they need to be able to function properly in the new millennium.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:56):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2018 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2018. As my colleague Senator Watt has just indicated, yesterday afternoon we heard some very concerning details about the Turnbull government's plans for regional broadband users, details that clearly demonstrate that the Liberal and National parties do not care about regional Australia, details that clearly demonstrate that the Liberal and National parties are happy for people in regional Australia—families on the fringe of towns, businesses on the land, and hard-working small-business people who work from home—to pay more for less.


Yesterday before a Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, NBN Co admitted its plans to charge regional Australians on the fixed wireless network $20 per month more than a customer on the same 50 megabits-per-second speed who lives in the city—$20 a month, $240 a year. And this charge is likely to attract the 10 per cent GST so, in fact, it will be an impost on those Australians who happen to be on the fixed wireless service of over $264 a year. This equates in percentage terms to someone in the regions paying 44 per cent more than someone in a nearby town for the same 50 megabits per second. What sort of government would allow this to happen? Well, let me tell you, the Turnbull government allowed this to happen. What sort of government would abandon Australians like this? The Turnbull National-Liberal government is a government led by a man who knows the fine details of the swing against him in the Braddon by-election, who claims to have created the internet and who even claims to have created the term 'Battery of the Nation', who does not care about the regions, who doesn't care about small family businesses, and who doesn't care about creating opportunities for all Australians.


You see, the people who are typically on fixed wireless are those living on the outskirts of our regional towns and cities. They may be farmers, they may have a small land holding or they may be on a normal residential block. They have either moved to the urban fringe to enjoy the country lifestyle or because the price of housing is more affordable than in a town or city. They face the same cost-of-living challenges as those in the towns, except they need to get in the car every time they need anything. To impose an arbitrary $264 charge on these households per year will only make things harder. It will mean that many will go without decent broadband for their small business or family, or they will go without something else—maybe a family holiday, a trip away. This Prime Minister cannot—

They're not interested in the pensioners that have to put extra doonas on to keep themselves warm in winter. They are not interested in these things. They are focused on an election where they need the support of GetUp! to win marginal seats in Melbourne. That's what they are focused on.


At that meeting last week, it was very, very clear from the delegation from Victoria that they were focused on one thing: their re-election, not the reduction of power bills for the Australian people. That was their focus. Right through this process, the Victorian government have otherwise supported the National Energy Guarantee. They've supported good policy to try and find a stable and consistent policy framework for our nation in this space. And then, guess what? Just as they receive a few emails from GetUp! and some people that they're scared of, they jump to that tune. We know who sings the song for the Labor Party in Victoria, and it ain't the average families in this country. It is the activists in Melbourne who are leading the Victorian government down a garden path that is not about lowering prices but meeting emissions reduction targets and nothing else.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:12):  I have tried to persuade all I've spoken to about the common sense of adopting the National Energy Guarantee. It is the right approach to help bring down power bills for the Australian people. If you'd like to have a briefing on why the National Energy Guarantee is the right approach, Senator Marshall, I'd love to have that discussion with you. We still to this day don't know what the Labor Party's position is on the National Energy Guarantee. When I hear Mr Butler, the energy spokesperson for the Labor Party, get up and speak, all I hear him talk about is emissions reductions. That's all he talks about. He doesn't talk about lowering power bills for the Australian people.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cameron, on a point of order.




Senator Cameron:
  This is on relevance. This was a very specific question: has the minister attempted to persuade Assistant Minister Pitt to support the government's position? The minister's attention should be drawn to the specific question.



The PRESIDENT:  You've very kindly done so, Senator Cameron. I note the minister has 14 seconds remaining to answer.




Senator CANAVAN:
  As I said, I try to convince everybody of common sense and good policy in this nation, and this policy is common sense. It does provide the potential to lower power bills, and that's what this government is focused on.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, a final supplementary question.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:14):  I haven't seen those quotes, and I can't comment on quotes from my colleagues or others that I haven't seen in context. But it is instructive. I don't think the power bills of the Australian people at the moment are a laughing matter. I don't think when people receive that little envelope with their bill inside of it that they see that as a laughing matter. They expect us to try to solve these problems. That is what we are focused on doing. We are focused on finding a plan.


We still don't know the Labor Party's plan. All we know from the Labor Party is that they are focused on one thing, and that is doing whatever the Greens tell them to do. That is what they are doing in this space. We, however, will focus on good policy that can bring down power prices for Australians and secure their jobs.

I've confirmed that no farmers have been included in the initial phase of the trial.


I also wish to add to an answer regarding your question, Senator Siewert, about the number of people involved in the trial. I am advised that less than 300 people have been contacted by the Department of Human Services to update their details in the initial phase.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Marshall today relating to the National Energy Guarantee.


Like a couple arguing in the food court, this spat about energy has now become extremely embarrassing for everybody else around them. It's awkward enough watching the Prime Minister abandon the principles that he was willing to stand by when he lost the Liberal leadership the first time around, but it is truly tragic that, despite the fact that he has capitulated on all fronts, given up everything and lost the last shred of credibility he may have been clinging to, he still can't keep this party room together. He emerged out of the party room meeting and he was claiming victory, but it is possible that he spoke too soon, because, shortly after that, it seems we saw backbencher after backbencher ringing Sky News just to make sure that, in the constant news coverage, everybody understood who'd be crossing the floor. People wanted to know about their heroic plans, and so Mr Abbott, Mr Christensen, Mr Gee, Mr Hastie, Mr Kelly, Mr Andrews, Mr Joyce, Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Abetz and Mr Pasin were all on the front page of the paper, indicating: 'Our intention is, in fact, not to support the NEG. In fact, so much so that we are not going to vote for it.'


This is a group of people who are split on policy, split on the personalities and almost congenitally unable to craft an energy policy. We are now five years into a government and we are still waiting for a coherent energy policy that can resolve the crisis that this government has placed us in as a nation. A lot of it, of course, is driven by Mr Abbott. It has produced some hilarious moments, including this, reported in the paper, when the Prime Minister asked Mr Abbott:


""Could you please do me the courtesy of allowing me to finish my sentence?""


Colleagues of Mr Abbott said he responded: ""I would have, if you had allowed me the courtesy of finishing my term.""


So it's obviously quite a little bit personal. Mr Abbott has then gone on to describe, in other remarks, Mr Turnbull's ideas as 'merchant banker gobbledegook'. He has also criticised Mr Frydenberg. He said that, in John Howard's time, a submission of the kind that Mr Frydenberg presented would have had to go back to the drawing board.


But it's not just confined to Mr Abbott. We've had frontbenchers as well. Mr Dutton was asked by Ray Hadley on 2GB: 'Is the NEG suboptimal?' What did the Minister for Home Affairs say? A ringing endorsement? He said, 'Well, it's a policy that the government's got.' That's just the kind of back-up you want, isn't it? When you're out there prosecuting a policy case, one of your front-line guys says, 'Well, it's a policy the government's got.' Thank you very much, Mr Dutton. The Australian is now reporting that other frontbenchers, including the Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Pitt, are, in fact, considering resigning their places because of their opposition to the NEG.


But, of course, there are new policy ideas continuing to swirl around as this very sophisticated debate unfolds. Apparently, Mr Joyce has made a demand for price controls. I thought it would have been obvious to everybody that that was inconsistent with Liberal values, but it took the Treasurer to point that out to Mr Joyce. We now understand that the member for Dawson has issued an entire list of demands to the Prime Minister in a meeting. The demands include the creation of a new clean coal fund, a cut in the NEG's emissions reduction target from 26 per cent to 17 per cent and changes that would allow the competition watchdog to keep AGL's Liddell coal fired power plant operating in New South Wales beyond its planned 2022 closure date. Apparently this was all very, very cordial. He was called into the Prime Minister's office. The Prime Minister 'wanted to know ideas that we have that could improve the NEG or deliver price reductions, and so I put a list to him'.


The people on the other side today would have you believe that this is all just business as usual. Well, nobody else believes that. It is a very, very public demonstration of the total dysfunction on that side of politics in relation to energy policy that has seen five years of utter paralysis. During the five years, the investment community went on strike in relation to energy, unable to invest because of a complete lack of certainty about what the policy settings are likely to be and how the energy market will work, and it is consumers who are paying the price with higher and higher prices. It has been a disaster.


Senator McKenzie, very helpfully during the last hour, pointed out that it is team work that makes the dream work. A pithy observation? I would put it to Senator McKenzie and, indeed, to everyone over there that we are not in a dream; we are in a horrible nightmare and you need to sort it out.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-08-16,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  It's always edifying to get to this point in the day when we commence the take-note debate and really do what the Australian people want us to do, and that is nitpick at one another. Anyway, here we go. Let's get into it. I appreciate the media commentary, the media briefing, that Senator McAllister just provided, talking us through what's been said on Sky and what's been said in The Australian—all of the quotes from the newspapers. It is very, very helpful to have all of that provided to us. What does trouble me about the tone of the debate and the questions being asked by those opposite is that it's not actually about seeking a solution; it's all about what's going on over here and who is talking to whom. Who went to that meeting? Did you ring that person? This is not a constructive contribution to the national debate; this is politicking, which is something that had been alluded to by a number of the answers provided by Senator Cormann and anyone who answered questions on this particular issue.


The point was made about the Labor states, particularly the state of Victoria, which, of course, as we all know, has state elections coming up towards the end of this year—in the month of November, I believe. So, instead of doing what is right and what ought to be done—such as focusing on how to bring down power prices for Victorians, who, as I understand it, have, over a period of time, seen power prices increase by something like 300 per cent—instead of doing something that would aid them and bring down power prices, we see the Andrews government finding ways to try and make things as difficult as possible to achieve national agreement on the plan that's before the country: the plan before COAG, the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee. That's what was highlighted today. This is all about politics for the Labor Party. This is not about something we should all be talking about. There is only one side of the debate that's actually talking about the important point here today, and that is how to bring down power prices: the Liberal and the National parties. The coalition are the people who have taken this policy forward. There is one thing we're all concerned about, and that is power prices. Sure, people are making their points and their concerns known. Discussions are had. That's what happens when you want to make sure that the end product that we present to the Australian people as the policy that's going to apply to them is right. Having those discussions is an important thing to do. It's a proud hallmark of any political organisation that people are allowed to discuss, express views, put forward ideas and suggest changes. But, on the other side, that's seen as a terrible thing to do—'You can't do that. We must accept whatever is served up to us and march forth united. No debate; just do what the leader says.' That's not how it works. I don't think that's how it should work.


I look forward to contributing to the debate on this as we move forward, as I hope—as I've already mentioned—the Labor states in particular will do also, in the interests of the people they represent, the people who need to have their power prices come down. In my home state of Tasmania, under the former Labor-Green government, we saw power prices go up by 65 per cent—a shocking indictment on that government. Thankfully, we've turned the corner on that particular issue. We see power prices now heading south. People will hopefully be able to save a lot more money under the NEG when it comes into full force and people will be able to turn their heaters on at winter time. I'll never forget when the former Premier Lara Giddings, in her little newsletter to the people of Franklin, said, 'Ways to save on your power bill: turn your heater off and put on an extra jumper.' What a great message to send to the pensioners of Franklin: 'Hey, you know what: just turn your heater off. You might not be able to afford to use it. We won't do anything about power prices. We just want you to suck it up and put on an extra jumper.'


I return to the main point, and that is: this is about power prices. Not once today, not in any of the questions asked on the issue of the NEG did those opposite talk about prices. No-one mentioned the need to reduce power prices. It is not their chief concern. It is about playing politics. It is about trying to whip up some sort of division and paint a picture of how they want things to be based on what they read in the newspapers and what they hear on Sky News here in Parliament House. So my advice to those opposite, those who would like to seek to leave this country and government—God help us hopefully they never do—is to start thinking about the people we represent. Do something to bring down power prices rather than just fly up here from wherever you come from and sit in here to play politics every single week.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  Let me commence my contribution by saying that Australians want lower electricity prices. That is absolutely clear. I said yesterday in this place that that is something that is absolutely necessary for us to come the grips with. What is also clear is that the policy uncertainty, at least over the past five years—if you look at media reports, some attribute the policy uncertainty over the past 10 years—is being driven by one man: former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. He and his cohort of climate sceptics are seeking to sabotage the national interest. But the tragedy in this situation, of course, is that we have a Prime Minister who lacks the authority to deal with this group within his government.


As I rise to take note of answers, I want to start by noting that bipartisanship is the answer to the problem of rising electricity prices. The business community needs bipartisanship in order to invest for the long term. We have seen some small glimmers of bipartisanship this week in our joint response to the deplorable contribution by Senator Anning. I want to remind the voters of Queensland that, regardless of his new party allegiance, Senator Anning was put in this place because of Senator Hanson's One Nation party. So we can, from time to time, work together. If we have that bipartisanship on a regular basis we can deal with energy prices.


Households are struggling whilst the government refuses to negotiate with the Labor opposition on this matter. We are seeing households struggle, particularly in Victoria. I note the St Vincent de Paul Society has put out a report this week in relation to Victorian households. We see that Victorian households are on the worst electricity deals in the market, paying $1,000 or more each year for the same amount of power as those on the best offers. This is where we see this lack of bipartisanship affecting people who are the most vulnerable.


It is painfully clear this week that the Liberal-National government are totally, hopelessly and irreconcilably divided on this issue. You only need to look at some of the media that has been around for the last couple of days. Senator McAllister has dealt with that.


I want to return to this point that members of this government refuse to accept the science. I think there has been a significant announcement this week from the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. They said that building more coal-fired power stations would be an environmental and economic mistake. They have made a statement amid media speculation the government would use the ACCC's recent report to justify underwriting baseload power investments based on coal. The ATSE president, Professor Bradlow, said the academy had long advocated for technology-neutral policies that could address the energy trilemma. He went on to say that new coal-fired power stations will not reduce the cost of electricity and will not aid efforts to reduce emissions. Let's listen to the experts. Let's listen to the scientists in this area and let's knuckle down and deal with the issue of coming up with some areas of agreement. On our side, we've been prepared to extend the hand of bipartisanship to negotiate something, but on the other side we have a government which is hopelessly crippled by the division within it.


It is time for this government to get out of the way so that we can deliver certainty for energy prices. We know that this policy uncertainty is driving up prices. We heard this from the Treasury officials at estimates. The LNP has done nothing to encourage business investment in renewables. That is what is needed. Their inaction has paralysed the industry. It was Labor that set up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to encourage investment in renewables. We have a strong record on protecting the environment and addressing climate change. We have ambition and drive. We need this government to get out of the way.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:25):  I too rise to take note of the minister's answer. I say at the outset that I could not be prouder to be a member of the coalition team. We have had extremely robust debate on this critically important issue. I was in the party room and I spoke in support of the NEG package. I'm very proud of what Minister Frydenberg, in particular, has done with the support of his cabinet colleagues. I think those opposite sometimes forget or don't even understand that robust debate inside a party room is actually a healthy thing to have on such an important policy. No matter how often those opposite say otherwise, both party rooms strongly endorsed this program for the National Energy Guarantee.


Let's have a look at how we've developed this plan and what we found when we came to government. Those opposite very often like to pretend that nothing happened and that we didn't inherit any particular situations in this or any other policy area. So let's have a look at Labor's track record, federal and state, and see the position that Labor left us in, which we have been successfully dealing with. It is absolutely a fact to say that the Labor Party is a party of higher energy prices. Remember last time Labor was in office, electricity prices—guess how much, Senator Fawcett. Madam Deputy President, when you were in government, how much did power prices rise over your six years? They rose by 100 per cent. Over your six years, Australian men and women, families and businesses were paying 100 per cent more for their power than when you came to government.


Over the past decade, those opposite have nearly crippled this nation with successive flip-flops on energy policy. Who can forget the CPRS, the carbon tax and the CET, the ETS and the EIS, the pink batts, the contract for coal closures, 'cash for clunkers' and the citizens assembly? Speaking about the carbon tax, when the coalition repealed the carbon tax, which those opposite promised they would never bring in but of course did, it led to the largest fall in electricity prices on record, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Even more importantly, the ACCC said that it saved $550 on the average household bill. That was due to the actions of this side of the chamber, and I am incredibly proud to have been part of that.


During those six years of Labor government, electricity prices doubled. The federal and state Labor policies have continued to put pressure on prices, through things like their job-destroying gas bans and moratoriums, unrealistic and unachievable renewable energy targets and open hostility to reliable base-load power. Those opposite don't yet seem to get that there is a direct link between these extremist green ideologies and power prices. In fact, they doubled the power prices on Australian families during their last term in office. And the tragedy is they've got the same policies now, if not worse. Not only do they sit there criticising this side of the chamber for making sound policy decisions to fix the problems that they created, but, if they got in again, they would do exactly the same thing to Australian businesses and households. This government's action is already having positive effects. Wholesale electricity prices are down around 25 per cent in 2018 compared to last year. Retail power bills have been reduced, as of 1 July, across New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. You can see that our policies are working. The National Energy Guarantee will continue the progress. (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:30):  What I was saying before we ran out of time during the last debate was that our marine environment is one of the most unique and spectacular marine environments on the globe. I heard those opposite talk about the fact that Australia has these large marine protected areas. That's good. We also have one of the largest EEZs in the world. So of course we should be putting in place proper protection for these areas. It is hugely disappointing that the government in some areas has changed the level of protection for the areas that are contained within the regional plans. That means that these really important areas, some of which have marine species that are found nowhere else on the planet, are at more risk. 


I think what I got up to when we were finishing was talking about the impact of a warming planet on our marine environment. We're still getting an understanding of what that impact is. I also heard those opposite talking about support from some marine conservation organisations for their approach, but I don't think there'd be anybody, certainly from the Greens, who didn't think long and hard about what to do about these plans. As someone who's been fighting since the mid-1980s for bioregional marine planning, it is not without a heavy heart and much thought that I personally came to the conclusion that we really need to keep fighting for better protection and that we need to take a stand. And that's from someone who's fought for years and years to get adequate marine protection. I've had lots of emails from people supporting our stance: that is, to support these disallowances. The bulk of the marine conservation organisations are also saying these plans aren't good enough. I've already articulated why we in Western Australia are deeply concerned, given that we have such a vast marine environment and we have so many special areas: the Bremer Canyon; the Perth Canyon; that whole south-west marine environment; the areas off the Gascoyne coast including Ningaloo and the Rowley Shoals. There are so many important areas. Those areas that I've mentioned are the ones where the level of marine protection has been adversely impacted by these plans. 


We will continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that we have a set of marine parks and a set of bioregional marine plans that are the best in the world, that go back to being the best in the world, so Australia can honestly claim that we have the best system for marine protection on the planet. I encourage and ask those who are still making up their mind about these disallowances to support these disallowances so that we can get superlative marine protection in this country.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (15:34):  I know that we only have limited time for this debate, so I will keep my comments a lot shorter than they otherwise would have been. Obviously I support all of these disallowance motions, but, as a senator for Queensland, I wanted to speak specifically about the one with regard to the Coral Sea. I don't want to get too parochial about it, but, certainly amongst all of these, it's hard not to see this as at least equal in significance to other areas that are also dramatically reduced in protection as a direct result of the consequences of this government and the Abbott government preceding it.


The Coral Sea directly adjoins the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which I would hope everybody in this chamber would agree is not only an environmental wonder of the world and recognised as such but also an incredibly important economic job generator for Queensland, particularly regional and Northern Queensland. I back up Senator Siewert's acknowledgement that it is one of the positive achievements of the Howard government. There's not a lot I'd point to, but one was a significant expansion of protected areas within the marine park, and I commend that achievement.


It needs to be said that, despite all the doom and gloom predictions of what it would cause, particularly to recreational fishers' opportunities, it has been clearly proven, as was suggested, to significantly improve fish stocks and actually enhance the attractiveness of a whole lot of recreational fishing opportunities along the Queensland coast. In the short time I've been back in the Senate role for the Greens in Queensland, I've had that said to me by a number of recreational fishers in regional Queensland, and tourism people are saying that the local areas are developing reputations for being more attractive to recreational fishers because of the environmental improvement that is a direct result of increasing marine protection.


The Coral Sea, of course, does not have coastal areas. It directly adjoins the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which we all know is severely under threat not only but most severely from climate change. The Coral Sea and its incredible natural assets are now much more at risk because of the vandalism caused by the decision of the Abbott government to rip up the protected areas that were put in place by the previous Labor government. It must be said that it's not just about fishing and the impact of commercial fishing; it is also about the potential for oil and gas exploration in this area. It wasn't until this disallowance was moved that I remembered that, way back in 2002, when I was a Democrats senator in this place—I was actually party leader at the time—we managed to uncover the fact that a government agency was attempting, secretly, to carry out surveying to enable it to assess more clearly whether there were oil opportunities in parts of the Coral Sea.


The reduced marine park protection that's in place that needs to be disallowed is not solely about reefs, although, of course, that is crucial. It is also about protecting those marine environments more broadly from the dangers of being opened up in the future for oil exploration and extraction. Let's not forget that one of the key reasons that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park first came into being—as a result of very commendable community action driven by people locally in Queensland and supported by others around the country—were the threats of the Queensland government at the time to basically open up the reef for drilling. That sort of legacy and those historical factors that drive campaigns do not go away with the passage of time, and the people who tried and pushed and might have failed in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park keep looking for opportunities in other areas. The failure to strengthen marine park protection in the way that was done previously—that's now been undone—is another example of that vandalism.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  To call Australia home is to inhabit an ancient continent set beneath a reef of some of the world's most magnificent marine biodiversity. It is to be the custodian of some of the most pristine and beautiful natural places on planet Earth. It is to have the honour and sacred duty of stewarding the protection of these places so that they may exist for the majesty of their own right and for the enjoyment of future generations for centuries to come.


For 20 long years legislators, community groups, stakeholders and scientists have debated, argued, discussed and attempted to come to a plan and a compromise that would protect these precious places. In five short years this government has sought to do nothing else except rip them apart, to tear them asunder at the behest of large corporate supporters, simply to make life easier for itself. I cannot think of a more profound dereliction of duty than the active destruction of these precious places. Yet this is what this government is attempting to allow to take place. Not content with their profound failure to act on global warming, not content with their continued failure to protect the great forests of the south-west and of the Tarkine, not content with allowing the freshwater of this nation to be poisoned by gas, they would also see us lay our oceans bare so that corporate profit margins can be increased.


My state of Western Australia, and its glorious jewel that is the Ningaloo Reef, will lose 75 per cent of its protection. It is an absolute disgrace. The Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea—all of these precious, vital ecosystems will be placed at risk and subject to irrevocable harm simply because this government wishes to make its life easier and to reap the benefits of acting as a corporate stooge. I do not know what I will say to my children when they ask me why we allowed this damage to be done, but I will at least be able to tell them that I and the party I am a member of, the movement that I serve, spoke up against it and did what we could to repair it. I thank the chamber for its time.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (15:44):  When you listen to that speech, you would think we've destroyed our oceans completely but that is not the case. One Nation will be supporting the government in opposing this disallowance notion. This came into play on 1 July. If we do not support this immediately, straight away from tomorrow, we are going to see all holds off. That means that people can come in and fish, because there's going to be no plan whatsoever.


My understanding is this has been 12 years in the making. It has been 12 years of discussions, talking to businesses, talking to the fishing sector, talking to many organisations and talking to scientists about what is the best way to go with this. Twelve years it has taken, and now it has been implemented. So if it goes out the door today, if everyone votes to get rid of this with the disallowance motion the Greens are putting up, it is going to go back to nothing—no protection, nothing. This is for a 10-year plan, but it can be looked at in five years time. Actually, at any time, a minister can change it and put it back through the review process.


Why throw the baby out with the bathwater? Why not let this stay as it is? There are protections in place now. If you are not happy with it then work on it in the next parliament. There are 120 days of consultation that have to go on. We know that we are facing an election. If you throw this out today, nothing is going to happen for at least a year or more. So we're going to allow these people to come in here and fish our waters and do more damage than we have with these protections we have put in place. We are talking about 2.2 million square kilometres of Australia's marine environment that will have no marine park protection. That is what is going to happen.


I am sick of the scaremongering that goes on in this place. Tell the people the truth. If you are not happy with the marine parks that are there now—there was nothing before it came into place on 1 July. What are you complaining about now? There was nothing in place. You actually have something in place now. Work with it. I support the fact that we now have protection out there. I support the fishermen and businesspeople who need it. We need the tourism here as well. The Greens want to lock up everything. They want to lock up our fishing, they want to look up our national parks, they want to lock up everything. They don't want to do anything in this country. They want to destroy businesses.


There is sustainability, and there is a guarantee that there are no foreign fishing vessels in these waters. There is a guarantee there are no super trawlers in these waters. This is the government's plan. Also, the fact is that the marine park covers 36 per cent of Australia's oceans and is the second largest in the world—and it is three times larger than the UN's benchmark of 10 per cent. How can you argue with that? I hear the Greens go on in this place all the time about the UN and our responsibilities. We have surpassed the UN's requirements. We have 36 per cent. How can you argue with that?


You raised the Pew foundation. I wanted to hear their advice and I rang them up. They said: 'Pauline, you have to support the government on this. It's not everything that we want, but it's better than nothing.' I have come from a small business background—a fish and chip shop. I relied on Australian fish and that is what I sold—not all the rubbish that we get in from overseas that we see so much of in our shops. We Australians have the right to eat that fish and not see it being exported to overseas. This will ensure our sustainability—that we have fish for Australians. It is not going to be overfished. The Fisheries Management Authority looks after that as well.


We are talking about the protection of our oceans, and I fully support the government on this. When I'm back in this place, whoever is in government here, if this is not good enough, if there are a lot of Australians out there who are not happy with this, I will work with them to increase the marine park zones or whatever needs to be done. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you throw this out today, you'll have nothing—no protection whatsoever.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:49):  Let's be absolutely clear what we are voting on here today. We are voting to allow a very comprehensive marine park network to remain in place or we are not. Those opposite would have you believe that this is a choice between the marine park management plans that are set in place and on the water at the moment and a set of plans proposed six years ago that never came into effect. That is not what we are voting on today. Today, we get to vote for our scientifically based, fully consulted, broadly supported plans that are currently in place and providing on-water protections, or no plans at all. If this disallowance is successful, 2.2 million square kilometres of Australia's marine environment will have no marine park protection tomorrow morning.


The choice is quite clear here for those in the chamber: provide certainty for everyone who enjoys our oceans or create more uncertainty; support the rights of five million recreational fishers, who are great stewards of our marine environment, or lock them out; support our sustainable fishers who catch the seafood that so many Australians want to eat for dinner tonight or run them out of business; support our tourism industry and the regional communities along our coastline that rely on our marine environment for their existence or shut them down; support Australia's international reputation as one of the best managed marine environments in the world or let it be discredited, purely for political pointscoring.


But don't be fooled by the misinformation being peddled by the zealots, who would have everyone locked out of our marine environment. It is largely false and certainly misleading at best. There have been claims that our waters will be invaded by supertrawlers. There are no supertrawlers. There can be no supertrawlers in our waters without the consent of this parliament. Remember: we banned them. Another claim is that foreign fishing boats are taking all our fish. There are no foreign fishing boats in our waters and absolutely no plan for any to be here. They claim that our fish stocks are declining, ignoring the fact that our fisheries management in Commonwealth waters is quota managed. These quotas are set within very conservative levels to ensure sustainability of all of our fish stocks, and our fish stock reports in fact show that our fish stocks are increasing.


So let's get the facts on the table. The plans that these disallowance motions are seeking to remove came into effect on 1 July 2018. And here are the facts. Our marine park network covers 36 per cent of Australia's oceans. That is the exclusive economic zone. It's the second largest in the world. It is over three times in excess of the Aceh target, the United Nations target of 10 per cent. It is based on independent science and followed extensive consultation with all legitimate stakeholders, and it strikes a balance by protecting both the marine environment and the social and economic interests of current and future generations of Australians. What you won't hear from those opposite is that it protects more environmental features than the plans that were proposed under Labor in 2012.


Yet, today, Labor and the Greens want to roll back these protections. Make no mistake: if these disallowance motions are successful today, it will represent the greatest roll-back of marine protections ever. Has there ever been a more bizarre situation? By moving these disallowance motions, it is the Labor Party and the Greens who want to remove protections from our marine environment. It is the Labor Party and the Greens who want to rip up the protections that are already in place. Today, the Labor Party and the Greens are asking this Senate to take away the rights of Australians to drop a line in the water and catch their dinner. They are asking you to decimate sustainable industries and destroy thousands of jobs in many regional communities. They are basically forcing Australians to eat foreign seafood instead of the safe, healthy, clean and sustainably fished local seafood. They want you to listen to foreign-funded NGOs and not the Australian people. They demonstrate their contempt and distrust of Australians by trying to keep them locked out of their own sovereign waters.


I thank the thousands of people who have been engaged in this process—the rec fishers; the people who catch the fish that goes into our fish and chip shops; the tourism operators; the guy in the bait store; and the many thousands of Australians who enjoy our oceans in so many ways. I particularly thank the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation, with Brett Cleary and Glenn Hurry before him, and Allan Hansard, who worked tirelessly at the beginning; the Australian Fishing Tackle Industry, with Colin Tannahill; and the Game Fishing Association, with Doug Sanderson.


I thank all of our wonderful state recreational fishing bodies—Recfishwest, TARFish, VRFish, Sunfish Queensland, the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory and RecFish SA. I also want to thank our commercial fishers: the Seafood Industry Association, with Jane Lovell and Veronica Papacosta; the state seafood industry associations; the Northern Territory Seafood Council; the Queensland Seafood Industry Association; and the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council.


A very special thanks goes to Colin Buxton, Peter Cochrane and Bob Beeton, who undertook the independent review. You have had your reputations attacked by those who have no credibility themselves, but you remained solidly committed to the science. To Michelle Grady of the Pew foundation: Michelle, I know you sought to have more no-take zones, but your support to maintain these quite extensive protections is greatly appreciated. And to the crossbench: this week you have been bombarded by those who would have 'nothing be the enemy of the good'. I thank you all for your time that you have afforded me to brief you, and the opportunity to rebut the many outlandish claims that have been made.


And finally, to all Australians who enjoy our marine environment: your government believes that Australian waters belong to the Australian people, not the Labor Party and not the Greens or their foreign-funded cohorts, and we will continue to fight to stop those opposite discrediting our internationally recognised sustainable fisheries. And we will fight to stop them locking you out from your oceans, because our marine environment is a shared resource for the enjoyment of all Australians. I call on the Senate to reject these disallowance motions.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (15:55):  I believe that something is better than nothing. These new protections for five marine parks are a step in the right direction, even though they are not ideal. The potential consequences of going back to zero protections are considerable. There would unavoidably be zero protection for a significant period, possibly years, before new legislation is passed. It seems to me at this time that there is no guarantee or sufficiently strong reason to suggest that any future parliament would pass better quality plans. It is possible that a future parliament could pass worse plans, especially given the possible future composition of the Senate.


There are many opportunities to campaign and advocate for improved quality of the marine parks, even if the disallowances fail. Those opportunities seem to have strong potential to be successful over time through strong leadership. I've consulted widely, including with Andrew Forrest, a great advocate for the conservation of our marine environment. With an election not far away, it is time for the major parties to acknowledge that the current protections are not good enough and to pledge that they will improve the protections for the Coral Sea Marine Park. I am determined to use my time in the Senate to campaign for improvements in the quality of our marine parks.


The choice for the Senate is to have some protection or to have zero protection at this point in time. There are strong risks that these disallowances could lead to worse outcomes for our marine environment; therefore, it seems that there is more reason to vote against these disallowances and campaign for improvements to the current protections.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:57):  In closing the debate today, I am very proud to have moved these disallowance motions with Senator Whish-Wilson. Our nation is the guardian of the world's third-largest marine territory. We have the most diverse marine life on earth within our waters. And we, as elected representatives, should be exercising our responsibility to protect our vulnerable oceans and marine life. In decimating the original plans, which had been worked on for so long, that is something the government has failed to do as they have put their vastly weakened plans forward.


The Australian government's plans have introduced marine park plans that cut back marine sanctuaries, and we should be standing for strong sanctuary protection of our ocean's marine life now and in the future. You have ignored decades of science. You have also ignored the advice of the government's own independent review. You have also ignored the wishes of local communities and, indeed, the voices of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who were consulted during the Labor government's process for marine park planning.


When you released your draft plans last year, there was a massive call from scientists, nearly 1,500 of them, rejecting the plans that you'd put forward. Indeed, at that time, when you put your own plans forward, more than 80,000 Australians made a submission asking for more, not less, protection. And you know what? Those submissions calling for more protection included over 16,000 recreational fishers. Your flashing of protection for many of Australia's top marine icons includes one of Australia's oldest sanctuaries, as I highlighted before in the debate, including that of Lord Howe Island. For me, devastatingly, it includes Geographe Bay, in the south-west of WA, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Kimberley. But, as we know—and it's been well put on record in this debate—worst hit is the Coral Sea, which is the cradle to the Great Barrier Reef. I understand the Greens will move to separate out the disallowance motion for the Coral Sea so we can put those questions separately, highlighting the significance of the attacks on the Coral Sea.


Let's be clear: It's not like we don't understand that we're between the devil and the deep blue sea on this question—bad plans or no plans. But let's be very clear: the plans that you've put forward do not do the job of protecting Australia's marine life or, indeed, benefitting local communities. Those plans must be improved and they should have been improved by the government, but, instead, we commit ourselves in the Labor Party to fixing this problem in government. What we need from government on both sides—and you've been completely negligent on this—is delivery of a science based network that reflects what our oceans, our communities and the Australian public want. I commit myself, along with the rest of the Labor Party, to restore high-level sanctuary zone protection within Australia's marine parks. We cannot afford to let these sanctuary cutbacks compromise our marine ecosystems and our marine life.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I just want to seek your guidance on whether we move a separate motion regarding the Coral Sea and then, following that, move a motion for the other. I can tell you which marine parks they are.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator, as I understand it, the procedure that was set was to have all of these questions dealt with as one, but am I to understand that you're asking the chamber to consider separating the questions?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  On the point of order, my understanding is that we were going to vote on them all separately.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  They were moved by leave together. We're in the hands of the chamber if you want to seek to have them dealt with separately.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I can give a short explanation as to why I am moving them separately.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  So you're seeking leave to explain your position?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  A two-minute explanation on why I want to move them separately.




Senator Fawcett:
  On the point of order: it wasn't agreed by leave; it was agreed by resolution, so it's actually a resolution of this chamber that they be considered together.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator.




Senator Ruston:
  For clarification: did you not say that we had to determine that the chamber would want to vote differently?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I haven't given that indication. Is leave granted to put the Coral Sea question separately to the others?


Leave granted.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 5 with respect to the Coral Sea Marine Park be agreed to.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:30):  What I was saying before we ran out of time during the last debate was that our marine environment is one of the most unique and spectacular marine environments on the globe. I heard those opposite talk about the fact that Australia has these large marine protected areas. That's good. We also have one of the largest EEZs in the world. So of course we should be putting in place proper protection for these areas. It is hugely disappointing that the government in some areas has changed the level of protection for the areas that are contained within the regional plans. That means that these really important areas, some of which have marine species that are found nowhere else on the planet, are at more risk. 


I think what I got up to when we were finishing was talking about the impact of a warming planet on our marine environment. We're still getting an understanding of what that impact is. I also heard those opposite talking about support from some marine conservation organisations for their approach, but I don't think there'd be anybody, certainly from the Greens, who didn't think long and hard about what to do about these plans. As someone who's been fighting since the mid-1980s for bioregional marine planning, it is not without a heavy heart and much thought that I personally came to the conclusion that we really need to keep fighting for better protection and that we need to take a stand. And that's from someone who's fought for years and years to get adequate marine protection. I've had lots of emails from people supporting our stance: that is, to support these disallowances. The bulk of the marine conservation organisations are also saying these plans aren't good enough. I've already articulated why we in Western Australia are deeply concerned, given that we have such a vast marine environment and we have so many special areas: the Bremer Canyon; the Perth Canyon; that whole south-west marine environment; the areas off the Gascoyne coast including Ningaloo and the Rowley Shoals. There are so many important areas. Those areas that I've mentioned are the ones where the level of marine protection has been adversely impacted by these plans. 


We will continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that we have a set of marine parks and a set of bioregional marine plans that are the best in the world, that go back to being the best in the world, so Australia can honestly claim that we have the best system for marine protection on the planet. I encourage and ask those who are still making up their mind about these disallowances to support these disallowances so that we can get superlative marine protection in this country.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (15:34):  I know that we only have limited time for this debate, so I will keep my comments a lot shorter than they otherwise would have been. Obviously I support all of these disallowance motions, but, as a senator for Queensland, I wanted to speak specifically about the one with regard to the Coral Sea. I don't want to get too parochial about it, but, certainly amongst all of these, it's hard not to see this as at least equal in significance to other areas that are also dramatically reduced in protection as a direct result of the consequences of this government and the Abbott government preceding it.


The Coral Sea directly adjoins the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which I would hope everybody in this chamber would agree is not only an environmental wonder of the world and recognised as such but also an incredibly important economic job generator for Queensland, particularly regional and Northern Queensland. I back up Senator Siewert's acknowledgement that it is one of the positive achievements of the Howard government. There's not a lot I'd point to, but one was a significant expansion of protected areas within the marine park, and I commend that achievement.


It needs to be said that, despite all the doom and gloom predictions of what it would cause, particularly to recreational fishers' opportunities, it has been clearly proven, as was suggested, to significantly improve fish stocks and actually enhance the attractiveness of a whole lot of recreational fishing opportunities along the Queensland coast. In the short time I've been back in the Senate role for the Greens in Queensland, I've had that said to me by a number of recreational fishers in regional Queensland, and tourism people are saying that the local areas are developing reputations for being more attractive to recreational fishers because of the environmental improvement that is a direct result of increasing marine protection.


The Coral Sea, of course, does not have coastal areas. It directly adjoins the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which we all know is severely under threat not only but most severely from climate change. The Coral Sea and its incredible natural assets are now much more at risk because of the vandalism caused by the decision of the Abbott government to rip up the protected areas that were put in place by the previous Labor government. It must be said that it's not just about fishing and the impact of commercial fishing; it is also about the potential for oil and gas exploration in this area. It wasn't until this disallowance was moved that I remembered that, way back in 2002, when I was a Democrats senator in this place—I was actually party leader at the time—we managed to uncover the fact that a government agency was attempting, secretly, to carry out surveying to enable it to assess more clearly whether there were oil opportunities in parts of the Coral Sea.


The reduced marine park protection that's in place that needs to be disallowed is not solely about reefs, although, of course, that is crucial. It is also about protecting those marine environments more broadly from the dangers of being opened up in the future for oil exploration and extraction. Let's not forget that one of the key reasons that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park first came into being—as a result of very commendable community action driven by people locally in Queensland and supported by others around the country—were the threats of the Queensland government at the time to basically open up the reef for drilling. That sort of legacy and those historical factors that drive campaigns do not go away with the passage of time, and the people who tried and pushed and might have failed in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park keep looking for opportunities in other areas. The failure to strengthen marine park protection in the way that was done previously—that's now been undone—is another example of that vandalism.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  To call Australia home is to inhabit an ancient continent set beneath a reef of some of the world's most magnificent marine biodiversity. It is to be the custodian of some of the most pristine and beautiful natural places on planet Earth. It is to have the honour and sacred duty of stewarding the protection of these places so that they may exist for the majesty of their own right and for the enjoyment of future generations for centuries to come.


For 20 long years legislators, community groups, stakeholders and scientists have debated, argued, discussed and attempted to come to a plan and a compromise that would protect these precious places. In five short years this government has sought to do nothing else except rip them apart, to tear them asunder at the behest of large corporate supporters, simply to make life easier for itself. I cannot think of a more profound dereliction of duty than the active destruction of these precious places. Yet this is what this government is attempting to allow to take place. Not content with their profound failure to act on global warming, not content with their continued failure to protect the great forests of the south-west and of the Tarkine, not content with allowing the freshwater of this nation to be poisoned by gas, they would also see us lay our oceans bare so that corporate profit margins can be increased.


My state of Western Australia, and its glorious jewel that is the Ningaloo Reef, will lose 75 per cent of its protection. It is an absolute disgrace. The Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea—all of these precious, vital ecosystems will be placed at risk and subject to irrevocable harm simply because this government wishes to make its life easier and to reap the benefits of acting as a corporate stooge. I do not know what I will say to my children when they ask me why we allowed this damage to be done, but I will at least be able to tell them that I and the party I am a member of, the movement that I serve, spoke up against it and did what we could to repair it. I thank the chamber for its time.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (15:44):  When you listen to that speech, you would think we've destroyed our oceans completely but that is not the case. One Nation will be supporting the government in opposing this disallowance notion. This came into play on 1 July. If we do not support this immediately, straight away from tomorrow, we are going to see all holds off. That means that people can come in and fish, because there's going to be no plan whatsoever.


My understanding is this has been 12 years in the making. It has been 12 years of discussions, talking to businesses, talking to the fishing sector, talking to many organisations and talking to scientists about what is the best way to go with this. Twelve years it has taken, and now it has been implemented. So if it goes out the door today, if everyone votes to get rid of this with the disallowance motion the Greens are putting up, it is going to go back to nothing—no protection, nothing. This is for a 10-year plan, but it can be looked at in five years time. Actually, at any time, a minister can change it and put it back through the review process.


Why throw the baby out with the bathwater? Why not let this stay as it is? There are protections in place now. If you are not happy with it then work on it in the next parliament. There are 120 days of consultation that have to go on. We know that we are facing an election. If you throw this out today, nothing is going to happen for at least a year or more. So we're going to allow these people to come in here and fish our waters and do more damage than we have with these protections we have put in place. We are talking about 2.2 million square kilometres of Australia's marine environment that will have no marine park protection. That is what is going to happen.


I am sick of the scaremongering that goes on in this place. Tell the people the truth. If you are not happy with the marine parks that are there now—there was nothing before it came into place on 1 July. What are you complaining about now? There was nothing in place. You actually have something in place now. Work with it. I support the fact that we now have protection out there. I support the fishermen and businesspeople who need it. We need the tourism here as well. The Greens want to lock up everything. They want to lock up our fishing, they want to look up our national parks, they want to lock up everything. They don't want to do anything in this country. They want to destroy businesses.


There is sustainability, and there is a guarantee that there are no foreign fishing vessels in these waters. There is a guarantee there are no super trawlers in these waters. This is the government's plan. Also, the fact is that the marine park covers 36 per cent of Australia's oceans and is the second largest in the world—and it is three times larger than the UN's benchmark of 10 per cent. How can you argue with that? I hear the Greens go on in this place all the time about the UN and our responsibilities. We have surpassed the UN's requirements. We have 36 per cent. How can you argue with that?


You raised the Pew foundation. I wanted to hear their advice and I rang them up. They said: 'Pauline, you have to support the government on this. It's not everything that we want, but it's better than nothing.' I have come from a small business background—a fish and chip shop.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (15:55):  I believe that something is better than nothing. These new protections for five marine parks are a step in the right direction, even though they are not ideal. The potential consequences of going back to zero protections are considerable. There would unavoidably be zero protection for a significant period, possibly years, before new legislation is passed. It seems to me at this time that there is no guarantee or sufficiently strong reason to suggest that any future parliament would pass better quality plans. It is possible that a future parliament could pass worse plans, especially given the possible future composition of the Senate.


There are many opportunities to campaign and advocate for improved quality of the marine parks, even if the disallowances fail. Those opportunities seem to have strong potential to be successful over time through strong leadership. I've consulted widely, including with Andrew Forrest, a great advocate for the conservation of our marine environment. With an election not far away, it is time for the major parties to acknowledge that the current protections are not good enough and to pledge that they will improve the protections for the Coral Sea Marine Park. I am determined to use my time in the Senate to campaign for improvements in the quality of our marine parks.


The choice for the Senate is to have some protection or to have zero protection at this point in time. There are strong risks that these disallowances could lead to worse outcomes for our marine environment; therefore, it seems that there is more reason to vote against these disallowances and campaign for improvements to the current protections.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:57):  In closing the debate today, I am very proud to have moved these disallowance motions with Senator Whish-Wilson. Our nation is the guardian of the world's third-largest marine territory. We have the most diverse marine life on earth within our waters. And we, as elected representatives, should be exercising our responsibility to protect our vulnerable oceans and marine life. In decimating the original plans, which had been worked on for so long, that is something the government has failed to do as they have put their vastly weakened plans forward.


The Australian government's plans have introduced marine park plans that cut back marine sanctuaries, and we should be standing for strong sanctuary protection of our ocean's marine life now and in the future. You have ignored decades of science. You have also ignored the advice of the government's own independent review. You have also ignored the wishes of local communities and, indeed, the voices of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who were consulted during the Labor government's process for marine park planning.


When you released your draft plans last year, there was a massive call from scientists, nearly 1,500 of them, rejecting the plans that you'd put forward. Indeed, at that time, when you put your own plans forward, more than 80,000 Australians made a submission asking for more, not less, protection. And you know what? Those submissions calling for more protection included over 16,000 recreational fishers. Your flashing of protection for many of Australia's top marine icons includes one of Australia's oldest sanctuaries, as I highlighted before in the debate, including that of Lord Howe Island. For me, devastatingly, it includes Geographe Bay, in the south-west of WA, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Kimberley. But, as we know—and it's been well put on record in this debate—worst hit is the Coral Sea, which is the cradle to the Great Barrier Reef. I understand the Greens will move to separate out the disallowance motion for the Coral Sea so we can put those questions separately, highlighting the significance of the attacks on the Coral Sea.


Let's be clear: It's not like we don't understand that we're between the devil and the deep blue sea on this question—bad plans or no plans. But let's be very clear: the plans that you've put forward do not do the job of protecting Australia's marine life or, indeed, benefitting local communities. Those plans must be improved and they should have been improved by the government, but, instead, we commit ourselves in the Labor Party to fixing this problem in government. What we need from government on both sides—and you've been completely negligent on this—is delivery of a science based network that reflects what our oceans, our communities and the Australian public want. I commit myself, along with the rest of the Labor Party, to restore high-level sanctuary zone protection within Australia's marine parks. We cannot afford to let these sanctuary cutbacks compromise our marine ecosystems and our marine life.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I just want to seek your guidance on whether we move a separate motion regarding the Coral Sea and then, following that, move a motion for the other. I can tell you which marine parks they are.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator, as I understand it, the procedure that was set was to have all of these questions dealt with as one, but am I to understand that you're asking the chamber to consider separating the questions?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  On the point of order, my understanding is that we were going to vote on them all separately.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  They were moved by leave together. We're in the hands of the chamber if you want to seek to have them dealt with separately.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I can give a short explanation as to why I am moving them separately.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  So you're seeking leave to explain your position?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  A two-minute explanation on why I want to move them separately.




Senator Fawcett:
  On the point of order: it wasn't agreed by leave; it was agreed by resolution, so it's actually a resolution of this chamber that they be considered together.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator.




Senator Ruston:
  For clarification: did you not say that we had to determine that the chamber would want to vote differently?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I haven't given that indication. Is leave granted to put the Coral Sea question separately to the others?


Leave granted.

The speeches read as follows—



COASTAL TRADING (REVITALISING AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING) AMENDMENT BILL 2017


The Australian Government is committed to ensuring safe, secure and efficient coastal shipping as a part of Australia's national transport system. 


As part of this commitment, the Government has introduced the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017.


Between 2010 and 2030, Australia's overall freight task is expected to grow by 80 per cent, but coastal shipping is only forecast to increase by 15 per cent. 


With Australia's extensive coastline and broad network of ports, there is scope for this figure to be much greater. 


However, it is clear that the current regulatory system does not fully support that potential being realised.


Following the Minister's appointment, he has engaged with stakeholders in the coastal shipping sector – Australian operators, users of coastal shipping and Australian seafarers. 


The stakeholders he has spoken to all agree that there are aspects of the current Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 (Coastal Trading Act) that are unreasonably limiting, inflexible or onerous. 


These restrictions are limiting or preventing the use of shipping to move domestic freight. They are pushing costs up for business. 


It is an important part of the Government's red tape reduction work to ensure legislation in place is being effectively implemented and not imposing excessive administrative burden.


This Bill makes amendments to the existing regulatory regime, rather than fundamentally restructuring it.


These amendments were set out in a discussion paper that Minister Chester released for industry consultation in March this year and received significant support from stakeholders. 


The Australian Aluminium Council, in its submission in response to the discussion paper, said:


'These amendments would reduce the regulatory burden for shipping users and increase the efficiency of the coastal shipping regime'.


Manufacturing Australia, in its submission, said:


'The proposed amendments are pragmatic, achievable and likely to deliver a material benefit in lower costs for Australian manufacturers'.


Turning to the amendments in detail, under the Coastal Trading Act applicants must specify a minimum of five voyages they intend to undertake in order to secure a Temporary Licence.


The Minister is aware of one instance where a shipper was unable to obtain a Temporary Licence to move a piece of heavy machinery between two ports as it required only a single voyage and was therefore ineligible for a Temporary Licence. 


The machinery was instead moved by road, which required a police escort due to the size of the machinery, and overhead utilities had to be moved. 


This was far more complicated and more costly than a voyage by ship would have been, but it was the only option available.


This Bill removes the five-voyage requirement, increasing flexibility for industry.


The Coastal Trading Act contains strict tolerance provisions for voyages under Temporary Licence that do not reflect the daily realities of how the shipping industry and supply chains in Australia operate. 


The tolerance restrictions mean that a shipper has to apply for a variation to their Temporary Licence if they are going to move their cargo more than 5 days before or after the approved loading date or if they need to load 20 per cent more or less than the approved amount of cargo. 


Such strict limits fail to reflect the fast-paced nature of the shipping industry.


For example, the Minister is aware of an Australian company who received a last minute request from a customer for 2,000 tonnes of cargo to meet a customer shortage. 


Despite already holding a Temporary Licence to carry 8,000 tonnes of cargo on a similar route, the ship it had chartered had to wait an extra day in port for a variation to come through, at a cost of $15,000 US dollars in port costs. 


Every time delays and costs like these are incurred by business, it impacts on profits and puts Australian jobs at risk. 


The amendments in this Bill relax the tolerance provisions to provide businesses with the flexibility and certainty they need to operate profitably.


This bill will also simplify the consultation provisions of the Act, while not removing the protections that all General License (Australian) vessels currently exist. 


All General Licence holders must be consulted for a minimum period of either one or two days before any temporary licence is granted, or approval for any new voyage is granted.


That is mandatory even where there is no General Licence (Australian) vessel capable of carrying the cargo or passengers the applicant wants to move. 


For example, there have been no crude oil or petroleum tankers operating under General Licence conditions since June 2016. However, the consultation requirements have resulted in the absurd situation where industry has spent 446 cumulative business days since 1 June 2016 waiting for consultation with a General Licence holder that does not exist!


This Bill will streamline the application by removing the requirement to consult when there is no General Licence vessel that is able to carry the cargo or passengers.


The changes Minister Chester has introduced will also extend the geographical reach of the Coastal Trading Act, to support the Australian energy sector.


The current coastal trading regime is hindering the use of Australian crude oil and condensate products in Australian refineries. 


The Australian Institute of Petroleum told Minister Chester earlier this year that uncertainty over the status of oil tankers moving between floating production storage and offloading units and floating storage units and mainland Australian actively discourages the use of Australian crude oil and condensate in Australian refineries.


This Bill will enable voyages occurring between a floating production storage and offloading unit, or a floating storage unit, and the mainland to be covered by a coastal trading licence.


This Bill will also allow vessels undergoing dry-docking to be covered by the coastal trading licensing system.


Under current arrangements, vessels undertaking scheduled maintenance in dry docking facilities are subject to importation under the Customs Act 1901. 


Covering vessels undergoing dry-docking in the coastal trading licensing system will provide certainty to operators and potentially increase the use of Australian facilities.


The amendments also change the voyage notification requirements by removing the need for industry to submit a notification when none of the voyage details have changed. 


The Bill will require ships to provide their International Maritime Organization number rather than their name as an identifier. 


Ships are able to change their name – having the IMO number of vessels operating in our waters will improve the Government's ability to verify that operators are complying with the requirements of this and other Australian legislation. 


The Turnbull-Joyce Government has a vision for a simpler and more flexible costal shipping industry that is positioned to carries meet an increased share of Australia's freight task. 


This Bill removes some of the red tape and unnecessary administrative burden that the current legislation has imposed on the coastal shipping sector.


MIGRATION (VALIDATION OF PORT APPOINTMENT) BILL 2018


As a government, we are committed to upholding the integrity of our borders and deterring dangerous and unauthorised maritime ventures to Australia. 


The Migration (Validation of Port Appointment) Bill 2018 (the Bill) confirms the validity of the appointment of a proclaimed port in the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands contained in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. GN 3, 23 January 2002 (the Appointment).


The measures in the Bill are in response to a small number of ongoing proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court and the Federal Court, in which the validity of the Appointment is being challenged. 


The impugned Appointment was gazetted in 2002 by the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Philip Ruddock MP. 


The Appointment was designed to ensure that unauthorised boat arrivals who entered certain waters of the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, an 'excised offshore place' for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act), would thereby become 'offshore entry persons', now 'unauthorised maritime arrivals', under the Act. The Appointment was critical to determining the status of persons as unauthorised maritime arrivals under the Act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 January 2002 and 1 June 2013 (from which time unauthorised maritime arrival status extended to persons entering Australia by sea at any place on the mainland without a visa). In addition, unauthorised boat arrivals who became unauthorised maritime arrivals by reason of having entered the proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands between 13 August 2012 and 1 June 2013 (and were not taken to a regional processing country) also became 'fast track applicants' under the Act. 


A successful challenge to the Appointment could mean, subject to any appeal, that affected persons did not enter Australia at an excised offshore place and are therefore not unauthorised maritime arrivals under the Act. It could also mean that some affected persons are not fast track applicants under the Act. 


The Bill addresses these risks by confirming the validity of the Appointment to: 


ensure that there was a properly proclaimed port at Ashmore and Cartier Islands at all relevant times; and 


ensure that things done under the Act (such as actions taken or decisions made) which relied directly or indirectly on the terms of the Appointment are valid and effective.


The effect of the Bill will simply maintain the status quo for unauthorised maritime arrivals and, where relevant, fast track applicants, under the Act who entered Australia via this proclaimed port between 23 January 2002 and 1 June 2013.


The Bill reiterates the government's original intention that the Appointment is, and has always been, valid. However, due to ongoing proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court and Federal Court which are currently challenging the validity of the Appointment, the Bill will not apply to cases where judgment has been delivered by a court before these provisions commence, if:


the validity of the Appointment was at issue in the proceedings; and


the judgment either set aside or declared the Appointment to be invalid.


Government policy around management of unauthorised maritime arrivals has been highly effective in responding to the enduring threat of maritime people smuggling. It is unacceptable for individuals to seek to rely on minor and inadvertent omissions in the wording of the Appointment in an attempt to undermine this policy.


It is imperative that we uphold the intent of the Appointment to protect the integrity of Australia's migration framework and maintain public confidence in our border protection arrangements.


Debate adjourned.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (16:21):  I move:


That the Senate:


(a) notes that:


   (i) Pure Compound Sodium Fluoroacetate ('1080') poison is classified by the World Health Organization as a Class l(a) poison – their highest rating for toxicity,


   (ii) in Australia, 1080 is listed as a schedule 7 poison, surpassed only by addictive, illicit and other prohibited substances, and is considered a chemical of security concern by the Australian Government


   (iii) despite most other countries adopting alternative, more humane, pest-management strategies, Australia and New Zealand account for the vast majority of 1080 use worldwide,


   (iv) 1080 poison is a cruel alternative to other known methods of pest control, including poisons with effective antidotes, and


   (v) 1080 poison is aerially distributed across Australia, including often untracked use throughout national parks, leaving other species and domesticated animals susceptible to agonising deaths that can last as long as five days; and


(b) calls on the Federal Government to regulate for the orderly phase-out of 1080 poison.


I want to start today with a story that will make me sound naive. Years and years ago—decades ago—I had a mate across the Ditch, in New Zealand, who was a helicopter pilot. He did most of his work in the South Island. When I asked him what he actually did, he said he dropped tonnes of carrots for the deer to eat. Being an animal lover and a campaigner against animal suffering and cruelty for more than 40 years, I thought, 'Gee, that's great.' Then he explained that this was not a humanitarian aerial food drop for Bambi; the carrots were laced with the deadly poison 1080. I'd never heard of it. I have since learned that one teaspoon of 1080 can kill 100 people.


All these years later 1080 is still being used in New Zealand and here in Australia, including in our national parks like Kosciuszko National Park, just around the corner. In fact I have been told the world's largest manufacturer of 1080, the Tull company in Alabama, sells at least 80 per cent of its 1080 to Australia and New Zealand. Some is also sold, I believe, to Japan and Israel.


I checked with New Zealand yesterday and the poisoned carrot drops from helicopters and planes are still going on over there, but the main target now is not deer but possums. The obvious problem is that aerial drops of this deadly poison are so indiscriminate. So many other species of non-feral critters die as well, as the targets, in agonising deaths that can take up to four or five excruciating days. I have seen evidence of farmers' dogs dying from 1080 poisoning. One farmer, who has been corresponding with my office, tells me he's lost 16 dogs to 1080—sixteen! Additionally, dosage of 1080 is almost impossible to control. Even if an animal consumes a sub-lethal dose, it'll still be left permanently disabled and in terrible pain.


A 2005 peer-reviewed study in New Zealand found that this practice is so indiscriminate, so untargeted, that even reducing the dosage of 1080 in these poisoned carrots could not save native wildlife. Crucial bird species over there, like the tomtit, would have their populations smashed by factors of up to 50 per cent. In recent months we have seen news reports of several Kiwi families who have suffered near-fatal illnesses because they have eaten 1080-infested wild pig.


I recently read an article by an American poisons expert, Joanna Grossman, PhD. She was attacking the USDA—the United States Department of Agriculture—over the use of deadly poisons. She said:


… there's something particularly shocking about our government stockpiling and deploying some of the deadliest poisons in the world in a scorched earth attempt to deal with wildlife.


The fact that Australia is following this practice, especially while there are other known methods of pest control available, including other poisons with known antidotes, defies logic.


Speaking of wildlife, there's an agency in the United States called Wildlife Services. It is a program within the US Department of Agriculture that is cynically known as the 'killing agency'. They are the federal government's exterminator. They kill between 3 million and 5 million animals each year using some of the most inhumane methods imaginable. We are talking about chemical poisons; cruel, body-gripping traps that mangle target and non-target animals; aerial gunning operations gone bad that have even led to pilot deaths; and even sometimes using vehicles to run over and hit animals in a crude attempt to knock off unwanted pests. 


As Ms Grossman pointed out, all of these methods are dangerous and suspect, but, as she said, there is something particularly shocking about a government stockpiling and deploying some of the deadliest poisons in the world in a scorched-earth attempt to deal with wildlife. 


This is less about wildlife management, which presumably would at least involve a first attempt to effectively manage any problematic wildlife through non-lethal means rather than 'kill first, ask questions later' philosophy that that rids the ecosystems of native carnivores and countless other animals that add to the rich biological diversity of outdoor spaces. Simply put: why would a government need to use something like 1080 to mitigate wildlife damage? Can an agency supposedly committed to the coexistence of people and wildlife really not do better with all the funds and expertise at its disposal? 


In 2005 a CIA report on weapons of mass destruction revealed that 1080 was found in Saddam Hussein's chemical stockpile. In other words, the US federal government thinks that the tool of a mass murderer is apparently suitable to spread on public lands, and they are doing it using taxpayers' dollars. Joanna Grossman points out that President Richard Nixon signed an executive order in 1972 that prohibited the use of poisons like 1080 and sodium cyanide on public lands—and with good bloody reason. That executive action was unfortunately reversed, but the Nixon administration had the right idea. These deadly poisons have no place in and around the wild open spaces and trails that people use for hiking and recreation. No-one should ever have to fear losing their beloved dog because they stumbled upon some horrific killing device that was secretly placed there by government agencies. And that is happening here in national parks in Australia. 


The unfortunate reality is that, if an odourless and colourless poison such as 1080 came into the wrong hands, it could be used to poison a public water supply. Before you scoff at that one, go back a few weeks to a story out of Alice Springs which had police warning Territorian pet owners to look out for symptoms of poisoning after a large amount of 1080 was stolen from a pastoralist's property near Alice Springs. Thieves broke into a locked shed and a locked box and stole the schedule 7 poison, which is also a listed as a chemical of security concern by our government. Alice Springs Superintendent Pauline Vickery said that police held concerns for people and animals potentially exposed to the chemical. She said: 'It is concerning that this chemical is out in the public domain. We urge people not to handle it as we believe it has toxic ramifications.' Police urged pet owners to secure their animals so they couldn't get access to deadly bait that may have been placed in a public space. 


This is the very poison being seeded, I believe recklessly, in our national parks. One anti-1080 campaigner asked the authorities for details of any register, especially in Victoria and New South Wales, of where 1080 was being laid, especially in national parks where people go hiking in the bush with their kids. Even though dogs are banned, how do you stop a pet dog from straying there and taking a bait? My informant was told there is no such register. He was told that if he wanted to find out such information he would have to contact every single agency, every single branch, every single distributor in the country. 


I know my detractors will say that this is a perfectly regulated practice tightly controlled by state licensing schemes and zoning requirements. Let's take a look at that one. Last year, as part of a thing called Project Eden, the Shire of Shark Bay in WA introduced its baiting program along the Peron Peninsula. Locals were told, don't worry, baits will be tightly restricted to 100 metres away from roads and 20 metres from private property boundaries. Twenty metres! 


Good luck stopping a pet dog from making it 20 metres beyond your fence line. To me, the thought of a child making this simple mistake is almost too horrible to consider. To make matters worse, the local community was told that the coastal strip, which had previously been bombed by 1080, was still an exclusion zone. If baits can't be removed or even traced after their deployment, then how is this a targeted or safe practice?


I want to conclude by going back to where I started: a novice, a rube—me—believing all those years ago that carrots were being dropped by helicopter to feed Bambi. In real life, one of the most dangerous poisons in the world, a concentrated compound poison which would take only a teaspoon to kill 100 people, is still being used, I believe recklessly, in Australia and New Zealand. I fervently believe that 1080 should be, and must be, phased out in the very near future.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-08-16,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (16:31):  I rise to speak on this matter of the use of 1080, particularly in a Western Australia context. Without being flippant, this is the Australian parliament and what happens in New Zealand is something that we cannot control. What we can control is what happens within our borders. And as a senator from Western Australia, I have a particular interest in what happens within the border of Western Australia. 1080 is both an essential and vital part of our wild dog control program in Western Australia.


The reality is that 1080 is a poison. It kills animals, and it can kill humans, if it is ingested. That's what poisons are. It's a naturally occurring poison. That doesn't matter; a poison, whether it's synthetic or naturally occurring, is still a poison. This is interesting and very important in the Australian context, and, more importantly, in the Western Australia context, because this is a naturally occurring compound in some 40 plant species particularly in Australia, but also in Brazil and Africa. There are several native Australian plant genera that contain the toxin, including, most importantly, gastrolobium. I probably didn't know the technical name earlier today, and I think many more of us in the farming community would know it as poison P. It is fairly common, particularly in the south-west of WA, but parts of this genus are found right across Australia. As a result, particularly in the south-west of Western Australia but more broadly throughout Australia, there is a high level of tolerance to this toxic compound in native Australian animals. I'll go through that in more detail later.


As I said when I began, this is a poison, and we do have to view all things with a wider perspective. I think I'm probably one of the few people in this place—and I suspect, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, you are another—who has seen both the outcome of 1080 bait ingestion and the outcome of a wild-dog attack on sheep populations. I'm happy to accept that the outcome of 1080 bait ingestion on a wild dog is dramatic, but even more dramatic is the impact of even one wild dog on a sheep herd or on millions of native Australian animals every year.


1080 bait has been used in Western Australia, particularly through what was called the Western Shield program. It has been a broad-scale program that has been targeting foxes in particular and also wild dogs since about 1994. What has it led to? There's an ongoing problem with wild dogs—I do acknowledge that—but it has had some very positive impacts, in certain areas, on enabling the ongoing presence of sheep. It has also had a positive impact on populations of a number of native animal species. The findings—and I believe this comes from the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia—are that there has been a significant improvement in the population of several native species. In fact, for the first time, it led to three species of mammals being taken off the Endangered Species List. That is a direct result of the baiting program using 1080 for the control of feral animals in Australia. Feral animals have a devastating effect on agricultural production. There are whole areas in Western Australia—in particular, the eastern rangelands around Kalgoorlie and parts of the southern Pilbara—where traditional sheep areas now cannot produce sheep. They have moved into goats and/or cattle. Some have gone out of production altogether because of the presence of wild dogs.


Senator Hinch said there are a number of alternative approaches; and there may will be in the future—in particular, genetic approaches that can take away the need for trapping, shooting and the use of poisons—but they are not effective and certainly they are not able to be rolled out at the moment. When you consider the vast open spaces of Western Australia, particularly the areas where agriculture meets the non-agricultural parts of Western Australia, the idea of using a poison with an antidote is both meaningless and completely redundant, even if such a poison were available and cost-effective.


So we need to use a suite of measures. Nobody believes that 1080 alone is going to be successful in controlling the wild dog populations and protecting both agriculture and native species, but it is an important component in what we are trying to do. A review of 1080 conducted in 2008 found that there was poisoning of non-targeted animals. However, it was significantly limited and did not adversely affect the overall population of non-targeted animals. On the other side of that, there are obviously a large number of animals protected when predatory animals are killed.


Whilst the poisoning of non-targeted species is, of course, something that nobody wants, 1080 is a highly restricted product. It is restricted under legislation which requires significant control of its supply and its use. It has to be used by trained persons who are authorised by state and territory governments. Western Australia also has a significantly enhanced set of control regimes: 1080 is not available to the general public, authorisation is required before anyone can obtain 1080 baits, a risk assessment is undertaken before authorisation is given, training requirements are stipulated and must be met and reporting of any incidents is mandatory. So it is a highly regulated poison. It is regulated under the federal acts and under the state Poisons Act. In terms of its lethality—I think this is worth mentioning—the lethal dose is the generally used measure of the lethality of poisons, and it is measured in milligrams per kilogram. In Western Australia, for a dog, it is 0.11; for a fox, it is 0.14; for a bobtail skink, a native species, it is over 800; for a particular species of goanna, it is 235; for the brushtail possum, it is 118; for the western grey kangaroo, it is 47; for the quoll, it is seven; and for emus, it is 96. Again, for dogs and foxes it is under one—0.11 and 0.14 for dogs and foxes respectively. So, obviously, you have very significant differences in lethality for the targeted species, particularly introduced species, and native species.


Just for some context: wild dog control is obviously very important in Western Australia, particularly for the protection of the sheep meat and wool industry but also increasingly for rangeland goats, and I have been hearing over the last year—and I'm sure Senator Smith would have heard the same thing in his travels in the north of Western Australia—that cattle are increasingly coming under threat due to the size and scale of the problem in some areas. So, in our livestock industries, you're talking about a very significant asset that we are protecting across Western Australia, and this is a very important part of that control.


Just briefly, before I finish up, I would also like to mention that farming and farming industries would prefer not to have to use any chemicals or any poisons; it's as simple as that. Nobody uses these things on a farm with any joy. Farmers are very keen to minimise the use of chemicals and poisons at every opportunity. But they are a part of the reality of farming and farming systems, and, at the moment, in the suite of tools we have available to us, the use of 1080 is a vital part of our armoury, particularly against wild dogs.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-08-16,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:41):  Labor is unable to support Senator Hinch's motion. It is the job of the regulator in Australia, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, to assess the safety of compounds used in agvet products and approve their use. The regulator is responsible for the protection of the health and safety of all Australians and of our environment, animal and crops.


Once again, Labor puts on the record in the Senate that, unfortunately, public confidence in the APVMA is already in decline because of the Turnbull government's decision to forcibly relocate it from Canberra to Armidale. The best way to keep our community safe is to maintain the regulator's independence and to rebuild its capacity to do its work in the most effective and timely manner. The Turnbull government must make it a priority to restore Australia's confidence in the APVMA by reversing the damaging relocation of the APVMA. The APVMA CEO, Dr Parker, has already been forced to acknowledge that the APVMA cannot recruit the necessary regulatory scientists to work in Armidale. On 2 July this year, a statement from the APVMA announced:


""Our existing plans for teleworking, an enhanced reliance on external scientific assessors and recruitment into Armidale have not reduced our relocation risks to an acceptable level and more must be done,"" Dr Parker said.


""Retaining the knowledge and expertise of our scientists is essential to the effective operations of the APVMA and accommodating these specialist staff in a Canberra office further supports the APVMA to deliver its statutory obligations.


""I have advised the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the Hon. David Littleproud MP, that in addition to core regulatory operations to Armidale, we will retain a unit of 30 to 40 specialist scientists and decision makers in Canberra.""


Labor has always said the forced relocation of the APVMA would risk the capability of the independent authority. It is important for the Senate to reflect on the word 'independent'. It is crucial that the Australian community can have complete and full trust in the regulation of agricultural chemicals. At the heart of that is a truly independent and scientifically competent regulator that is free from undue commercial and political influence.


The government has been reckless in the way it has forced the regulator to relocate to the former Deputy Prime Minister's electorate of New England, a decision that required a government policy order, a GPO—signed off by the finance minister, Senator Cormann, on 23 November 2016—to force it to relocate. The current CEO of the APVMA is now in direct conflict with the GPO, as it states that the APVMA must be located in a regional community and within 10 kilometres by road of the main campus of a regional university that is recognised for research and teaching in the field of agricultural science. The GPO defined 'regional community' to mean a community that is not within 150 kilometres by road of Canberra or the capital of a state. We also know it is in direct conflict because Dr Parker informed senators that no staff would be allowed to stay in Canberra. On 24 October 2017 former Senator Gallagher asked the following question at Senate estimates in relation to the APVMA relocation and concerns about retaining its highly qualified staff: 'As part of that you wouldn't be looking to maintain an office presence in Canberra of any sort?' Dr Parker said: 'No. That would be against the government order.' So what has changed? Is the GPO no longer valid or did Dr Parker mislead the Senate committee?


The Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources need to start taking the failing relocation seriously, otherwise Australian agriculture, our environment and the safety of all Australians and their pets will be compromised, but not because we think the staff will make poor decisions. The APVMA will continue to maintain rigorous and robust scientific assessments for managing the risks associated with chemicals used in ag vet products. However, the timeliness of decisions could be severely impacted, and this will have negative consequences.


With regard to the specific chemical brought to the attention of the Senate today, sodium fluoroacetate, or 1080, is a poison used to control vertebrate pests in Australia such as foxes, wild dogs, feral pigs and feral cats. It is a critical component of the integrated pest control program for foxes, wild dogs, feral pigs and feral cats. This is not only essential for farmers to protect their livestock but also to support effective pest control programs in Australia's national parks and reserves.


The chemical is already heavily restricted and controlled. This includes by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. The APVMA approval and registration provides that, when used in accordance with labelled directions, the product should not present any unacceptable risk to users, non-target animals or the environment more broadly. The APVMA's control scheme for this is already rigorous and comprehensive. The APVMA has classified it as a restricted chemical product to ensure that only authorised persons under the relevant state or territory law can use or supply 1080 products. State and territories also employ various regulatory and non-regulatory measures to ensure the product is used responsibly and in full consideration of risks to non-target animals. For example, in Victoria, a 1080 user must:


1. have completed recognised training (or be directly supervised by a trained and licensed person)


2. have a licence to use the product


3. obtain the product from an accredited supplier


4. use the product according to the Directions for the use of 1080 and PAPP pest animal bait products in Victoria


5. comply with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth), the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Control of Use) Act 1992 (Vic), the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic) and associated regulations.


Other states and territories have similar controls.


Like any pesticide, 1080 should be used as part of an integrated pest management program combining other control measures. Integrated pest control might include trapping, better fencing and other options. Chemical alternatives are limited, although PAPP became available in 2016. 1080 remains in use in several other countries. New Zealand uses 1080 to control possums, rats, rabbits and deer. The US uses 1080 to control coyotes. Mexico, Japan, Korea and Israel use it for rodent control. The product's possession, sale and use is heavily restricted in Australia. This is appropriate. It remains an important tool for agriculture and natural resource management. It is inappropriate for the Senate to call on the government to regulate chemicals in Australia. As already stated, this is a job for independent regulator.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-08-16,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:49):  I rise to speak on this motion about the use of 1080. I thank Senator Hinch for bringing this motion on for debate this afternoon. I want to begin by reflecting on what happens when an animal is poisoned by sodium fluoroacetate, or 1080 poison. It's truly awful. This is the description on the RSPCA Australia website:


The initial obvious symptoms of 1080 poisoning are retching, vomiting, anxiety, disorientation, shaking, frenzied behaviour, manic running, vocalisation and drooling. Once the poison enters the central nervous system affected animals will experience convulsions, uncontrolled paddling and muscle spasms, followed by total collapse and death. During periods of prolonged convulsions animals may be conscious between fits and experience pain or anxiety. There is also potential for animals to injure themselves over this period. Symptoms usually appear within 3 hours of bait ingestion with death occurring 2-10 hours later.


The Greens have made a number of previous efforts to ban or phase out 1080, including a temporarily successful move in Tasmania to ban its use under the Greens coalition government. But that ban has since been reversed by the current Liberal government. However, in saying that, I also want to acknowledge that 1080 does indeed currently play a critical role in invasive species and pest control. It's used widely and in most cases very carefully by park rangers and other natural resource managers to tackle foxes and other invasive mammals.


We Greens understand the importance of protecting native and local systems and so acknowledge that, without some form of intervention to reduce pest animal populations, pests and invasive species on habitats and food chains actually can lead to distressing and considerable animal suffering in addition to endangerment and extinction. And, indeed, there is no doubt that the use of 1080 has saved untold numbers of small marsupials from being killed and eaten by foxes, wild dogs and cats, particularly in Western Australia where many native fauna have pre-existing genetic resistance to the active ingredient in 1080, which makes it more straightforward to use 1080, because you're not going to be killing the native wildlife that you are trying to protect. This has resulted in species that were likely to have become extinct because of predation by foxes and cats being brought back from the brink. But that doesn't mean that we've got to stick with the status quo.


Needless animal suffering is never justified and alternatives to 1080 are beginning to be available. The reason the Greens are supporting this motion today is the fact that it is calling for the orderly phase-out of 1080. And that orderly phase-out is an animal welfare priority of the highest order. In some environments, that orderly phase-out would mean an immediate ban or a reinstatement of the ban because other alternatives are available, other more humane and just-as-effective alternatives are available. In others, a staged phase-out would mean, yes, we keep using 1080 while new, more humane alternatives are approved and regulated.


There is no doubt that 1080 is currently used in circumstances where it's not justified and where it should not be used. Senator Hinch talked about the use of 1080 for deer populations. In the eastern states, 1080 is not widely used for killing deer populations. There are other methods of control that should be being used but are not being used for deer populations. In Tasmanian eucalypt plantations, 1080 is being used to kill off small wallabies, which is totally unjustified. The use of 1080 for the killing of wild dogs is also, in many circumstances, not justified, because there are other poisons available that have fewer animal welfare concerns.


Where there are other alternatives, 1080 should be immediately phased out. But where those alternatives don't yet exist, the government must massively scale up research and innovation to develop those alternatives. Greens policy, which I'll summarise, says that on the interaction of animal welfare and protection of animal species, we must use the most humane, effective means available in the control of introduced species, including humane population management methods. We need much more research and development of those more humane methods for the management and control of introduced species. It's important to note that in general those alternatives are generally going to be more effective and more humane if they don't require the wide-spread killing of mature animals, and that there is so much potential for biological control and fertility control. If you have methods that use those, that is a much more effective and much, more humane method of dealing with pest animals than the use of poisons which require you to go out and kill large numbers of mature animals. 


To achieve this balancing act of protecting animal welfare and dealing with pest animals is only going to be possible with a government that puts a high priority on both animal welfare and environment protection. Bring on that government. The Greens look forward to being part of such a government, because it will surprise no-one that the current government cares about neither. You can see its lack of care about animal welfare, its lack of care about environment protection. You can see it in its failure to ban the horrendous practice of live exports. You can see it in its addiction to facilitating broad-scale land clearing. You can see it in its rolling over of its failed logging laws that destroy both our forests and the animals that live in them. You can see it in the fossil fuel expansion and its never-ending cuts to the environment department. 


But even if the government were to find its inner environmentalist, its inner animal welfarist, there is the relocation of the APVMA and the catastrophic damage to its functioning. Because the APVMA is having its capacity completely slashed due to the relocation, the regulatory changes that would be required to bring in these new methods of pest animal control and to facilitate new and more effective solutions would be stuck in limbo for months, if not years. It's simply not good enough.


To sum up, the Greens fully acknowledge there is work to be done on the transition away from 1080. Alternatives are needed for the role it now plays in protecting native wildlife. But it is absolutely necessary that that work begins as soon as possible. That is why the Greens will be giving support to this motion today.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-08-16,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:57):  Once again we have the Greens telling our farmers how we should look after our land and feral animals. I find it amazing, Senator Rice talking about the Greens and the environment. I tell you what the Greens do to the environment. With all their power and sway over the Labor Party, they lock up land for national parks, lock it up and leave it. There is virtually no hazard reduction burning, no grazing allowed—you can't have hard-hooved animals in national parks. Of course, the deer and goats and wild pigs walk around national parks in ugg boots to protect the environment, I'm sure. Sorry for my sarcasm. It rains, the grass grows higher, the fuel levels get higher and higher, the lightning strikes and we burn the national parks and kill the animals. That's conservation, Greens style. 


Here they are once again, telling us how to run our farms. Is it any wonder that the farmers loathe the Greens. The Greens hate farmers. They only hate miners worse than farmers. When we moved to Inverell in 1979, we bought 7,100 acres. It was moving with rabbits, and I mean moving. We ran around 6 to 6½ thousand sheep and probably 30,000 rabbits. I wonder how the Greens would have suggested we reduce the rabbit population? You couldn't use a rabbit trap—that could be cruel. Go out and shoot them one by one? They'd breed faster than you could produce the bullets. We put 1080 on the whole property—7,000 acres. We cleaned the rabbits out. We went around and picked up the dead ones, because most of them, when they get 1080 poison, go down a rabbit warren or into a hollow log and you can't find them. We never lost a sheep dog. That was our main concern—that we didn't lose our dogs. If foxes died, I couldn't care. If wild pigs died, I couldn't care. If crows died, I couldn't care either, but of course the crows are very clever birds: they just vomited it out and survived. It was a bit different in the old days with hallucigen. That one was a bit smart for the crows, and we didn't have the crows then picking the eyes out of our sheep when they got down. But the Greens wouldn't understand this issue of looking after animals. The real environmentalists are the farmers, looking after the animals and their land as best they can. Sadly, it's pretty hard for many of them to be green when so many are so far in the red, but hopefully that will turn around with rain, low interest rates, a low dollar and the better commodity prices that we've worked so hard on.


Widespread rabbit plagues are another thing we brought to this country that should never have been brought here. How do the Greens and even Senator Hinch suggest we get rid of them? What about the wild pigs? How do we get rid of the wild pigs? My wife and I have a problem at home with wild pigs. We went out one night, and we could hear four or five wild pigs circling little lambs. The little lambs were about a week old. The wild pigs had cut them off from their mothers. Luckily, when we drove over the contour bank at about 10 o'clock on a cold night they cleared off. We saved the lambs; they ran off to their mothers, to the ewes, to be protected.


This is the point I make: we have these feral animals causing so much loss of production to our country as far as wool, mutton, lamb and beef goes, and yet the big issue is the cause of the environment. Senator Hinch, I will gladly take you to our property and show you where the pigs are nosing up the soil; they're opening it up and exposing it to soil erosion. Rabbits: there are pictures of dryland farms from years ago, from before the 1950s and when 1080 was not allowed here—we didn't have it. The country was so bare. The wind was blowing the topsoil away. And when it did rain, of course the soil was washed away because of the erosion caused by rabbits, and their digging of their warrens and holes et cetera. They do huge environmental damage, and so 1080 is essential to get rid of rabbits.


Wild dogs are in national parks and on farms. Sadly, they're spreading far and wide across our nation too. When I talk to graziers at Tenterfield, many are going out of sheep because of wild dogs. We hear about the wild dogs out in Queensland. They went out of sheep up there because the dogs simply killed the sheep, mauled them to death. Senator Rice talks about painful deaths. She should go and have a look at the sheep when they have been mauled, when they've had the wool pulled from out of their sides and out of their shoulders, by wild dogs. Then the flystrike hits the sheep. Is that a good death, is it?


You talk about deaths. I know what the Greens are like. I was on a Senate committee hearing at Byron Bay. It was quite amazing. We were talking about sharks. We had two witnesses that day who told the committee the life of an animal is equal to the life of a human. How outrageously ridiculous. They were saying if you're driving down the road in a B-double—65 tonnes all up—down a steep hill and a kangaroo comes out on one side of the road and a three-year-old boy runs out on the other side of the road, you should contemplate hitting the boy and saving the kangaroo. Absolutely outrageous! That is out of tune, that animals are as equally important as human life. I have seen it with the Greens; this is how they behave.


The call is to ban 1080; to phase it out; to let the rabbits breed back to the huge populations we saw in the early 1900s; to let them destroy the environment, eat out the native grasses, create barren land, cause soil erosion; and to let them reduce our production of beef and sheep et cetera, our food production, and to starve the states, starve the country and starve those people we feed overseas. Is that the plan? The biggest problem with 1080—I've been tempted to use it in recent months, but I fear for our sheepdogs. I haven't used it. Sure animals do die, sadly, but not often. We've seen an inquiry by the APVMA saying non-targeted animals have died because of 1080, because it stays in the meat for a long time—until it literally rots away. It even stays in the bones. That is one fear I always have for our dogs: that they'd eat it. I can assure you our sheepdogs at home are very much loved.


But what do we do about the feral pigs? Foxes? Yes, we've got PAPP for foxes and wild dogs. That might be working well, but 1080 is a good, cheap way to destroy those feral animals that are causing so much damage to our farmland and our farm production. And you can't get it easy, I tell you, Senator Hinch; you can't get it easy. I've bought 1080 on many occasions, going to what was then the PP Board—the Pasture Protection Board—and dealing with the 1080 rabbit inspector. We'd buy the carrots crushed up, no poison on them. We'd go and feed the rabbits and they'd clean all the carrots up. Two days later we'd feed them again; we'd put out the poison carrots and then we'd go and pick up the dead rabbits.


It's amazing how not having rabbits can restore the country. Rabbits can graze the country down to about a millimetre high. They call them 'underground mutton'. They'd even eat underground, if they could. They destroy our native grass, our native pastures and our agriculture production. People are saying, 'Do away with it.' No, don't do away with it. Be careful with it. It is a very dangerous poison. I'm well aware of it. It's very dangerous. But we have strict regulations. To access 1080, don't think you can just walk into the hardware shop and buy it. It is certainly not like that. It is strict to get to it. They have to know who you are. When you prepare your property for 1080, you have to ring all your neighbours and tell them you're putting it out. You've got to put signs up on your fences on your property saying, '1080 poison being applied on this property.' You must work with your neighbours to look after the animals and see that the animals you are targeting are the ones you are killing.


It's a slow and painful death, Senator Rice says. Go and see the sheep that are ripped apart by wild dogs and tell me whether that's a quick, pain-free death, Senator Rice. It is appalling. That wouldn't worry you, Senator Rice. The painful death of having 1080—



Senator Rice interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  That's what you said—it's a slow and painful death. Yes, it may be, but what about the animals being destroyed? What about the lambs when the pigs are ripping them apart? That's a quick, peaceful death, is it? Give me a break. You have no idea. I support the retention of 1080. I support the huge restrictions on access to it. Of course we must do things as landholders, as far as notifying the neighbours is concerned. It's up to us to see that our sheepdogs are protected. Keep them in the yard, don't let them out, pick up the dead animals—the dead foxes, not that sheepdogs are keen to eat dead foxes, I can assure you, but they might. You only need one sample and your dog is in serious trouble. Senator Hinch, you say to phase it out. What will replace it? You might have PAPP for wild dogs and foxes. What are we going to use to control the rabbits and the pigs? That's the big question.


As I said—I'm repeating myself—the enormous environmental damage these animals are doing to our land is just amazing. The loosening of the soil and accessing the soil, causing erosion when it does rain. Sadly, that's not a worry at the moment because of the big drought we're in, but the rains will come, as sure as I stand here. We know the rains will come; we just can't tell exactly when. I wish I knew. We'd be in a good position to manage our farms very well if we knew when it was going to rain, but one thing we do know is that the drought will end, the rains will come and the drought will return. I don't know when. This is about managing our environment, looking after our land, doing the right thing and keeping the feral animals where they should be—dead.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:02):  The document is a response from the General Secretary of the Queensland Teachers' Union, Mr Graham Moloney, to a resolution—a quite bizarre resolution, I must say—that was agreed to by a majority of the Senate back in March 2018. It was basically just a beat-up motion in response to a beat-up article in The Courier Mail about distribution of stickers of the Eureka flag, which somehow was turned into a suggestion of politicised teachers everywhere trying to poison the minds of young children with horrendous political propaganda.


When I spoke last on this issue I did say, as somebody who's practised—not extensively, but for a year or so, a few years back—as a contract high school teacher in some government schools in South-East Queensland, that to suggest that you can talk about and teach and engage in a meaningful way with topics in areas like history, economics or a lot of what used to be called, and are still occasionally called, the SOSE subjects without considering matters that might fall under the idea of being political is frankly absurd and shows how little people understand about teaching, as the original motion did. The response from the QTU secretary made clear that the resolution of the Senate is basically full of factual errors. I should also say on the record that I'm still a member of the Queensland Teachers' Union at the moment, along with over 45,000 other teachers in government educational institutions across Queensland.


What the Senate really should be spending time on, if it's looking at the actions and the views of teachers and how to strengthen the education that our young people get, is supporting the campaigns of teachers' unions across the country, and the campaigns of parents, staff and many others involved with government schools, for fair funding now.


The simple fact is that it is this government that has cut the amount of funding that would have been provided to government schools. In Queensland alone, there is around half a billion dollars less provided to Queensland government schools than would otherwise have been provided—as a direct budgetary decision of this government. And let's not kid ourselves that we cannot afford it. This Senate just recently passed massive tax cuts for wealthy individuals and passed tax cuts for business, and this government is still trying to push tax cuts for large corporations—easily going over $100 billion once you add all those together—and says that we can't afford half a billion for state schools in Queensland. That is simply an indication of the political priorities being totally distorted by this government. They want to spend their time putting forward ridiculous motions, completely misrepresenting the actions of teachers in schools, rather than doing their job of ensuring that schools are properly funded.


It is quite clear that this government is continuing to stuff up royally the issue of funding for schools, continuing to have underfunding and continuing to have unfair, unequal and unjust distribution of funding. Too much is still going to some of the wealthier schools—and it's not surprising. As I said earlier, this government's ideological agenda very much favours assisting those on the wealthiest end of the spectrum. Not surprisingly, that's also where they get their donations from. Until we fix this rigged system and get an approach that seeks to deliver educational outcomes for all of us equally, so that all children have an equal opportunity in ways that appropriately meets their individual needs, we are going to sell ourselves short as a society as a whole, we're going to sell ourselves short in terms of future economic opportunity and productivity, and we are particularly going to fail our core responsibility to the next generation. Many of the young people today have to deal with significant disadvantages from the start of their life, and the least we can do is ensure that their school education is properly funded.

Child care is supposed to be about enabling parents, usually mothers, to return to the workforce. It's also about giving children a good start with respect to education. Getting mothers back to work is good because they don't lose their skills and slip down the employability ladder. They earn money, which boosts their standard of living. It's also good for the economy, because they consume, pay taxes and do not require welfare. The problem is that child care is regulated so heavily and is so distorted by red tape that it has become extraordinarily expensive. For many people, the cost of child care is not much less than what they can earn by returning to work. Some mothers are eager to return to the workforce. But, for those who would rather stay at home with their children, the necessity to earn an income is the only reason they use child care. If the cost of doing so is too great, they won't return.


We hear a lot about the benefits of early childhood education, and many of the witnesses focused on that. The national regulatory scheme seeks to ensure the quality of that education is high. There is evidence that quality child care is of genuine benefit in the case of children in dysfunctional households, as the Productivity Commission has noted. But we seem to have lost sight of the fact that quality costs money. Offering it to everyone and increasing the credentials of the educators costs money. Raising standard beyond those needed to ensure the safety, comfort and happiness of the children costs money. And when it costs too much money, it's not used; mothers stay at home with their children. Of course, mothers are not early educators and don't have qualifications in early childhood education. They only offer the love and care of a mother.


Red tape that makes it harder and harder to afford child care not only damages the economy but also limits the standard of living of many families, particularly those on modest incomes. Low- and middle-income families most need to return to work. Low- and middle-income families most need child care to be affordable. Low- and middle-income families are most hurt by red tape. The government's response to childcare unaffordability has been to subsidise it. The cost of that subsidy is now $8 billion, rising to $9 billion over the forward estimates. A decade ago, it was zero. That's red tape for you. The source of the red tape is a COAG partnership with the states and territories. This incorporates the National Quality Framework; the Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority; a national quality standard; a national quality rating system; and a national regulatory system. What could possibly go wrong!


Most submitters and witnesses to the inquiry support the NQF's regulation of the early childcare and education sector but many complained about the effect of regulation. The committee noted that 'the department has not recently reported any significant regulatory savings in early childhood education and care' and recommended that these savings should be reported in the department's next annual report for the deregulation agenda. But the Australian Childcare Alliance New South Wales warned that 'regulatory requirements usually come at a cost and can become burdensome, excessive and/or, arguably, counterproductive'. Others were less sanguine also. The Australian Childcare Alliance said: 'The government must acknowledge the increase of paperwork and stress that has been introduced to the sector over the past 10 years.' The Centre for Independent Studies said: 'The childcare sector in Australia has been characterised by growing government intervention in recent decades, culminating in the introduction of the National Quality Framework. Inevitably, this has precipitated new forms of red tape for the sector. Many of the NQF regulations entail significant administrative and compliance costs, while many of the cited benefits are contestable and not based on compelling evidence.' Family Day Care Australia argued that its sector 'has been adversely affected, resulting in excessive administrative burden, service closures and a decrease in high-level quality ratings'.


It was a matter of concern to the committee that family day care is suffering. Given its much lower cost structure, it ought to be thriving. Clearly, something is wrong. A key area of concern for both family day care and long day care providers was the regulation of staff qualifications and ratios. The committee acknowledges that there is rationale for imposing staff ratios and qualifications but is not convinced that current policy settings are correct. There just isn't sufficient evidence in this area. The committee recommends establishing a sound evidence base to promote the relationship between staffing, qualifications and children's outcomes, and between staff ratios and outcomes, to avoid the perception of that regulation being unnecessary red tape. The committee also recommends that the principles of the National Quality Framework be amended to reflect the fact that child care is, in effect, competing with home based parents who are not qualified early childhood educators.


On the subject of subsidising childcare, the committee noted that there were concerns in relation to transitioning to the new funding formula. It recommends that the department report in greater detail on this. More generally, the committee recommends that the government review the objectives of fee assistance to ensure it is actually targeting maternal workforce participation, with an emphasis on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.


I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their interest and participation in the hearings and the committee's deliberations generally. These include Senators Burston, Griff, Watts, Paterson and Brockman. I commend the report to the Senate and look forward to the government's response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:31):  I take note of the sixth interim report of the Senate Select Committee on Red Tape, Effect of red tape on child care. The Select Committee on Red Tape was established in October 2016 to inquire into and report on the effect of restrictions and prohibitions—that is, red tape—on the economy and the community. It has presented interim reports on the sale, supply and taxation of alcohol; tobacco retailing; environmental assessment and approvals; pharmacy rules; and health care. I introduced the report on child care yesterday.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (19:18):  I'll be brief in my comments on this report, document No. 3. I have already spoken to this, so I won't go on at length again. This is the Auditor-General's report into the implementation performance of the cashless debt card trial. It has already been well noted by many people, including me, that this is a very scathing report, which calls into question the genuineness of these trials and whether it's all about the politics of it. 


The single thing I want to emphasise tonight is that I don't know when this legislation will come on and I may well not be in this place by the time it does. So I really want to take the opportunity to make a plea, because the Greens' and Labor's position on this legislation regarding the attempt to extend what is clearly a failed and inadequate trial further into Queensland, into the electorate of Hinkler and the communities around Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, is that the Greens strongly oppose it. I very strongly oppose it, having gone to both of those communities and met with and spoken to many people there. I know the mayor of Hervey Bay is opposed to it and I know the mayor of Bundaberg, a former LNP member of the Queensland parliament, is opposed to it being expanded into that community. If there is money available to spend—because this trial will cost money, not save money—it won't generate a single job in those communities. It won't get a single person who is currently on social security into employment. It will just put more red tape around their lives. If there's money available, spend it directly in those communities and generate some employment, economic activity and services for some of those people that do need support, that the government says it's seeking to try to deal with by virtue of this trial. 


Likewise, the view of the coalition and the One Nation party, which votes with them pretty much all the time, is that they're going to press ahead with this, despite that opposition I've mentioned. So it does come down to others on the crossbench here who have not yet committed to a view. I really would take the opportunity to urge those senators, the Centre Alliance senators, Senator Storer, Senator Hinch, possibly Senator Leyonhjelm, whose views about reducing government regulation are hopefully contrary to expanding this unnecessary control over people's lives. On behalf of the people of those communities, who I have visited and spoken to—unlike the government-controlled Senate committee into this proposal, who have never bothered to travel to the community that will be affected—I would really urge those crossbench senators to vote against that legislation. This Auditor-General's report here gives plenty of reasons why. Look at plenty of submissions that were provided by people from the community, including the mayor of Hervey Bay. I'd really encourage them to do that. Hopefully, if they do, they'll recognise that this is not something that should be expanded into communities in Queensland, and they'll vote against that legislation. 


Question agreed to.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (19:22):  Last month I had the great honour of representing Australia as a member of the Commonwealth Observer Group to the Pakistan national election on 25 July. It was my first but certainly will not be my last visit to this fascinating, friendly and wonderfully diverse nation. I found Pakistan a culturally, religiously, ethnically and geographically diverse nation, a nation that defies a single or easy definition. It would be hard to find a nation more at the centre of global geostrategic thinking. Pakistan is a nuclear power sitting at the fulcrum of South Asia and the Middle East. It borders with India, China and Afghanistan and it sits on the Arabian Sea. It has a rapidly growing population, now consisting of over 200 million people, with a high proportion under 20 years old. It comprises five major ethnic groups, and it now has more refugees than any other country. Religiously, it is overwhelmingly a Sunni Muslim nation with close ties to Saudi Arabia, and it has a range of minority religious groups. Pakistanis face economic and social challenges that Australians could not even dream of. Despite that, on 25 July they came together as a nation to vote in hope of a change for themselves and their children. Pakistan matters to the world. Pakistan matters to the Commonwealth family, and it also matters to us here in Australia.


Election observation itself supports democratic partners in delivering free and fair elections within their own electoral laws. It is always strictly impartial and independent and with the support of the country that we observe in. This 15-member Commonwealth observer group was ably led by General Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigeria's former head of state. The observer mission spent 12 days in Pakistan, observing events both leading up to the election and on the polling and counting day. Also, we observed the declaration of the results. I'd like to commend Baroness Scotland on the professionalism of her team and the high esteem in which they were held by all of the Pakistani groups that we were fortunate enough to engage with. As a consequence, there were no closed doors to our observer group. Our group met delegations from political parties, civil society, the media and also the military to understand the pre-election environment and, afterwards, to receive feedback on the conduct of the election. It is my sincerest hope that the election proves to be a democratic game changer for over 200 million Pakistani citizens.


This was truly a historic election for Pakistan. It was only the second consecutive democratic transition of power in the nation's history. As chair of the Australian parliament's Electoral Matters Committee, I am deeply aware that, in all democracies, including our own, to accept the outcome of an election, citizens must have confidence in the integrity of the electoral system itself and they must have confidence that the results declared accurately reflect the ballots cast. This election was closely observed by domestic and international observers. In addition to the Commonwealth observer group, there was also one other overseas observation group, from the European Union. Also, there were many diplomats based in Pakistan who observed the election. The local Pakistani Free and Fair Election Network also deployed 20,000 citizen observers at 80 per cent of the polling booths. There is no question at all in my mind that the result represented the overwhelming majority of Pakistani voters and also, I believe, their citizens.


I must commend the Electoral Commission of Pakistan, the ECP, who did an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances. The electoral reform strengthened the country's election framework, and the expanded power of the ECP clearly assisted in the successful delivery of this election. Despite the very short time the ECP had to implement these significant reforms, they did an outstanding job in seeing their mandate was delivered and transparent elections were upheld and done on schedule. But what really blew me away was the logistics of the election itself. They were simply staggering. There were 106 million eligible voters, and they cast ballots in 270 of the 342 National Assembly seats and 570 provincial seats. There were 122 registered political parties, 12,570 candidates, 85,390 polling stations and 800,000 polling officials, and 450,000 police and 350,000 military personnel were deployed at polling places across the nation. Despite some violence and a suicide attack, polling did occur peacefully at the vast majority of polling booths. There was a 53 per cent turnout, which is significantly higher than the last election, when it was 48 per cent. Most encouragingly for me, there was a record turnout of women right across the nation. Assessment reports by all observer groups were consistent in saying that the election was conducted transparently. Whilst there was no doubt that the Electoral Commission faced a range of unique challenges—challenges that certainly are not familiar to us here today here in Australia—as I said, the vote represented the will of the vast majority of Pakistanis and has been joyously welcomed by their communities right across the globe.


The results also represent a wholesale rejection of dynastic politics in Pakistan. The monopoly enjoyed by the previous two mainstream parties has been broken, and I think this is a very quiet but very clear democratic revolution. Imran Khan now faces challenges that would appear unimaginable and certainly insurmountable to most Western politicians. But the world is watching on with incredible goodwill, and we all hope that Prime Minister Khan can now deliver for the Pakistani people. Pakistan has evolved, and Pakistanis, I observed, are no longer prepared to tolerate poor governance, injustice and totally iniquitous life. A generational shift is clearly occurring. I heard, over and over again, that the younger generation no longer feels trapped by the past, closed minds and the conventions of the establishment—and they certainly made great use of social media in this election to communicate and also to persuade others.


I believe that Australia, the United States and, indeed, all members of the Commonwealth have a great opportunity to assist Pakistan in moderating the influence of the military in civil society and in encouraging the judiciary to direct its efforts now towards new anticorruption measures. And I think we can also help in other ways. Pakistan is also now uniquely placed to take advantage of the One Belt, One Road initiative in a way that can ensure their economy grows and their society benefits from this initiative. We have a great opportunity to work with Pakistan to develop their own sovereign economic opportunities in their own best interests.


I would like to pay particular tribute to the Australian High Commissioner in Pakistan, Margaret Adamson, for her engagement and for her support in providing me so many additional opportunities to meet members from right across Pakistan civil society. We had interesting, robust and really challenging and stimulating discussions. I thank her for that. Both I and the wonderful Dame Winnie Laban, from New Zealand, were extraordinarily well supported not only by the High Commissioner but by all of her staff. The High Commission staff in Islamabad have a very clear passion and wonderful respect for the nation that they serve Australia in. It was very clear that the High Commissioner and her staff are held in high regard by the government of Pakistan, by the parliament and also by a wide range of civil society representatives. They all serve our nation with great distinction, and we owe them a great deal of thanks for that.


I and all members of the Commonwealth Observer Group congratulate all Pakistanis for the way they conducted this election. I hope that their desire for a better life for themselves and for their families is able to be realised by the new government. I thank the Commonwealth for the opportunity.
