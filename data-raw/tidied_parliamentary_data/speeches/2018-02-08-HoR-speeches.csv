Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (09:31):  I am making a short statement today to the House on the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The royal commission delivered its final report to the Governor-General on 15 December 2017. The report is the product of five years of hard and harrowing work for all those involved, and today we honour the bravest among them—the survivors and their families. They relived the worst moments of their lives, often telling their stories for the first time, so that these terrible abuses will never be allowed to happen again.


The report's 409 recommendations propose significant reforms to ensure that children in the care of any Australian institution are protected. There is no more important obligation for every Australian adult than keeping our children safe from harm. Reading some of the witness statements, it's clear that being heard and being believed mean so much to the survivors, so much more than many of us would imagine—three words: 'I believe you', coming after years, often decades, of authorities' denial of responsibility.


Over the course of the royal commission, more than 16,000 individuals made contact with the commission and the commission has heard more than 8,000 personal stories. More than 1,000 survivors provided a written account. These were not isolated or only historic cases; more than 4,000 individual institutions were reported as places where abuse has occurred. The youngest victim the royal commission interviewed was seven years of age. He had recently been abused. Some of the victims are still at school now. More than half of the survivors were aged between 10 and 14 years when they were sexually abused.


Victims often do not disclose sexual abuse until many years later, and the survivors in the private sessions took around 24 years on average to tell somebody about their abuse. Now that those stories have been told, now that they are on the record, we must do everything within our power to honour those stories and to act. I am committed and my government is committed to doing everything possible to make sure that this national tragedy is never repeated. I urge all Australian governments and the non-government sector—churches, charities and other institutions—to respond to the report by June, as was recommended by the royal commission.


To coordinate this formidable effort, my government has established a task force within the Attorney-General's Department. My government has already begun progressing some of the report's key recommendations, in conjunction with the states and territories. We've developed the National Statement of Principles for Child Safe Organisations, and these 10 principles will provide the basis for a culture of child safety in all places providing services to or care for children. I look forward to Friday's COAG meeting agreeing to those principles.


We are also strengthening the Working with Children checks. We're leading the development of nationally consistent standards for screening, and last year the former Attorney-General wrote to states and territories offering to fund the creation of a national database to enable these checks to occur. These changes will ensure that only the most trusted people will be allowed to have children in their care.


The redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse is another recommendation adopted by my government. The scheme will commence on 1 July and it's important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is about unequivocally accepting that the events occurred. The significance of those three words—'I believe you'—cannot be overstated. Secondly, the scheme recognises the suffering that survivors have endured as a result. Thirdly, the scheme is designed to ensure that institutions take responsibility for the abuse that occurred on their watch, perpetrated by their people, people entrusted with caring for our children, and some of the most vulnerable children.


But the scheme will fulfil its promise of justice only if we have maximum participation across all jurisdictions. For this to occur, the states must take urgent action and refer the appropriate power to the Commonwealth in order for them to participate from 1 July. We have been working closely with each jurisdiction to encourage their participation in the scheme. Unless the states agree to participate, institutions within their jurisdictions will not be able to join. Survivors deserve much better and I urge the premiers in all the jurisdictions to prioritise this work and join the redress scheme without further delay. I also urge the non-government institutions to commit now to joining the scheme.


We owe it to the survivors not to waste this moment, and we must continue to be guided by their wishes. My government will appoint a survivor-focused reference group to facilitate the delivery of a national apology to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse and to advise us on its form and content. On behalf of the nation, I will deliver that apology before the end of the year. As a nation, we must mark this occasion in a form that reflects the wishes of survivors and affords them the dignity to which they were entitled as children but which was denied to them by the very people who were tasked with their care.


I take a moment now to express the government's and the parliament's deepest thanks to all those whose selflessness and professionalism have enabled us to shine a light on this national tragedy. I thank the commissioners, Mr Bob Atkinson, Justice Jennifer Coate, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, Professor Helen Milroy, Mr Andrew Murray, the chair of the royal commission, the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, Senior Counsel Assisting Gail Furness SC, and, in total, 680 other members of the royal commission staff, who worked with such dedication over the past five years. I acknowledge the individuals, the expert witnesses, the researchers and the government and non-government representatives who came forward to give evidence over the course of the commission. I look forward, as I'm sure do all honourable members, to doing justice to their hard work and to the survivors by ensuring that together we take the steps needed to keep our children safe.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (09:38):  I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.


… we were treated as slaves, beaten and abused, used for their perverted desires. These were terrible years. No love or kindness, no safety or warmth. Always hungry and always frightened.


That's a bare 30 words from the royal commission's final report—one survivor's account of the abuse that he suffered and the betrayal he endured. It is just one story among thousands. Open almost any page of the final report and you can find words that shake us to our core. The child with disability abused daily, who couldn't get an uninterested police officer to take any notice of their plea for help. The good Catholic boy who, after each time he was abused sexually by his priest, had to go to confession and confess his sin of impurity to his abuser. And then this boy, this child, being preyed upon by this monster would be asked if he was sorry and told to do three Hail Marys for penance. There was the student who, after years of being groomed and then sexually abused by her teacher, saw her parents take his side of the argument because she was the instigator.


Every story is different and every story is individual. But, in every young life broken and betrayed, there are common threads. First, there is the disgusting sense of moral superiority, the presumption that the abuser had the authority—even the right—to commit these unforgivable crimes, because they were an adult dealing with a child, or because they were white and the child was black, or because they did not have a disability and the child did, or because they claimed to be acting in the authority of religion. Second, there is the harsh reality that, no matter where the survivor turned for help, they would not be believed. They were children, seen and not heard. They could not find a counsellor to listen to their story. They could not find justice in a criminal court or compensation in a civil court.


These institutions failed our fellow Australians, and then our nation did. People continue to count the cost of that failure in a hundred different way: lives of violence and addiction, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress, poverty and incarceration; lives that never recovered their equilibrium; childhood stolen from children; people who never learned to trust again, who would never love again, whose faith in their fellow human beings was shattered beyond repair. As one survivor put it:


I felt dirty, and responsible for what happened to me as a child. I have isolated myself … hidden my true feelings. The loneliness I have experienced is overwhelming …


Sometimes, when we say child abuse is unspeakable, actually for too long that was precisely the problem. It wasn't spoken of. Instead, the survivors were silenced. Perpetrators were protected. The reputation of powerful institutions and individuals was put ahead of the welfare of children. Truth was buried, with only trauma and scar tissue to mark its place.


But the royal commission stripped away the denial and betrayal of decades. Painfully at times, it exposed the most unforgivable, unimaginable acts of evil. It has shown without doubt or exception the extraordinary courage of all of the survivors who stepped forward to tell their story, the brave souls who reached back into the darkness of their memories and brought their suffering to light, not for their own sake but because they don't want another generation to ever suffer what they did, to be disbelieved the way they were and to live with the pain that they had to. I also think they did it for all of the other kids who didn't make it.


Therefore, I want to pay tribute to Julia Gillard for her leadership in establishing this royal commission. I actually think that with every passing day that decision enhances her legacy. I thank the royal commission and its staff, as the Prime Minister has done—remarkable, their work. Even though she's not going to ask me to do this, I also think the House should recognise the work of the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, who supported the endeavour with 100 per cent of her passion for social justice.


I had the privilege of standing alongside Jenny and a group of the remarkable campaigners from CLAN when the commission's final day of hearings was handed down and then the report. They're extraordinary Australians, and I know many members of parliament on both sides of the House have spoken to them and know them, so they'll know what I'm saying. These are survivors. They've spent five years travelling to the royal commission hearings around the country to provide support to others as they tell their stories. I pay tribute to each and every one of them. Again, although she would modestly share credit with all others, I think it is appropriate that I note and salute the incomparable Leonie Sheedy—fierce, fearless, with a heart as big as this continent. Australia owes her and all that she represents a huge debt.


I have to say about the royal commission, the commissioners and their team that at all times they balance their human compassion for those providing testimony with a legal detachment to recommend a constructive way forward. But, as the Prime Minister has done, every member of this place, I think, would agree that the hardest task, the most important work and the greatest credit belong to the survivors themselves. First, as the Prime Minister has done, I say to the survivors: 'Australia believes you. Australia thanks you. Your bravery and honesty has done something that no parliament, no court, no media outlet on its own could or would ever do. You faced us up to a hard truth about our history, and you have shown us that we must do better in the future.'


I can't speak for everyone in this House or indeed Australians, but I for one was shocked at the extent of the abuse. Now it is up to our parliament and to our nation to do just that—to be better, to prove worthy of the courage of the survivors. The report cannot be left to sit on a shelf and gather dust. The stories of raw pain and powerful resilience cannot be consigned to one uncomfortable corner of the national conversation. The royal commission has given us a blueprint; we must follow it. The report calls for the Commonwealth and every state to formally respond to every recommendation within six months. It is a deadline we should meet. Since 2015 federal Labor's focus has been on the design and delivery of the national redress scheme, one where the states and the institutions responsible for the abuse help fund the compensation that is owed.


Compensation in many ways is an unfair term, because anyone who has survived this knows that they are not in it for the compensation, and the compensation can never give them back their childhood or their trust. You cannot ever repair the damage done. No dollar figure can make shattered lives whole or bring people back. But that is no reason for delay, no reason for avoiding clear-cut obligations. As of today not a single dollar has come from any of the states or institutions whose names and deeds fill the pages of this report. I say to the institutions and indeed the states: the time for lawyers is over; the time for justice is here.


If we believe the survivors, and we do, and if we accept responsibility, and we must, then conscience demands only one course of action: we must deliver a truly national redress scheme, one underpinned by uniformity and equity. Trauma does not stop at state borders. Justice should never depend upon your postcode. The Commonwealth has a contribution to make in dollars and in leadership. I invite the Prime Minister to think about an event at this parliament itself to thank and recognise the survivors. But, having spoken about the Commonwealth's obligations, the bulk of the funds must come from state governments and all those institutions who so badly failed their duty of care and trust to children. The money does matter. Compensation at least helps people get back on their feet a bit, but it is also a tangible admission that the institution was at fault and should pay for its wrongs.


I believe that every member of this parliament feels this matter most keenly. When I was a child my mother used to take me to the Polish mass at Sacred Heart in Oakleigh. We lacked Polish ancestry. I said to my mum, 'Why do we go do this mass?' There were four other sessions. It turned out she took us to that service because she didn't like the priest, Father O'Donnell. He approached us to become altar boys. I said, 'What do you think, Mum?' She said no. How lucky was I! It is that sense of a shark swimming imperceptibly, unseen, so close to you. Chrissie and Anthony Foster at that same church, and hundreds of other families affected by this monster, were not so lucky. Thousands of Australians didn't by mere luck avoid their monsters. It is for these people that we must deliver redress.


I would not wish to hear anyone describe the push for national redress as 'rushed'. Survivors have been waiting decades for justice that they are owed, and some—too many—have not even lived to see it. To everyone upon whom redress depends, I simply say this: our nation turned a blind eye to the abuse that our fellow Australians were suffering, and now we know the truth, we cannot turn our backs—no more tricky legal tactics, no more litigation to exhaustion, no more artful means of delay. The days of excusing the inexcusable are long gone. This issue is not about politics, but it is what politics should be about: doing the right thing, making good wrongs and helping the vulnerable. Fundamentally, this is a test of who we are as a parliament, as a people and as a country which calls itself the home of the fair go.


I wish to conclude using the commissioner's final address. On presenting the report, he said:


The sexual abuse of any child is intolerable in a civilised society. It is the responsibility of our entire community to acknowledge that children are being abused. We must each resolve that we should do what we can to protect them. The tragic impact of abuse for individuals and through them our entire society demands nothing less.


Let that profound and clear statement guide us and challenge us to right the wrongs of the past and do better in the future. I thank the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (09:52):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The government is committed to supporting the Australian innovation ecosystem by providing a tax and regulatory environment that will help innovative Australian businesses raise capital, grow and succeed; and get more Australians into more and better-paying jobs.


This government, the Turnbull government, is the government of innovation, jobs, business creation and growth. We want to see new businesses and new enterprises get off the ground and get going in creating prosperity for all Australians.


As promised in the budget, we are putting in place the world's most forward-leaning regulatory sandbox for fin-tech development.


The Turnbull government sees an active fin-tech sector as a critical driver of more competition in our banking and financial system. We want to see more competition, because it will increase the pressure on financial service providers—traditional and emerging—to be more responsive to customers' needs, to the needs of businesses, to the needs of families, to the needs of householders, and deliver better outcomes for Australians.


I am a strong believer that choice empowers customers, households, families and small businesses, to seek the financial services that best suit their needs without being tied to businesses that don't listen to them.


The enhanced regulatory sandbox will allow firms to test new products and services without needing to obtain a financial services licence or a credit licence from ASIC first. It will allow trial and error in a controlled environment, giving firms a chance to confirm their concept through initial testing with clients.


In simple terms, this will help Australians and Australian businesses to access cheaper financing and better financial products so they can grow and they can invest. The productivity benefits that will flow from this are substantial. They're huge. Most investment equals more jobs and better wages. 


Those in business know the importance of meeting customer needs. The regulatory sandbox will provide a means to test market demand. It will give firms looking to do things differently—to do things better for customers—a real leg-up and clear air to get going. It will reduce the time it takes to make their products and services available to customers and it will mean entrepreneurs are more informed in making decisions on their offering before applying for a licence.


We have worked hard to develop a legislative regulatory sandbox which builds on ASIC's licence exemption. But we have also been mindful of ensuring the firms in the regulatory sandbox maintain protections for retail customers. 


The government's enhanced sandbox is about helping fin-tech businesses overcome the initial regulatory burden and costs of licensing that may otherwise hinder innovative change—disruptive change that will see our banking and financial system become more competitive and more tailored to the needs of customers around the country.


Schedule 1 to this bill takes the first step. It extends the regulation-making powers in the Corporations Act, establishing the foundation for the government's new framework. 


The regulations will then set out the detail regarding eligibility criteria, the types of products and services that can be tested, and conditions that will need to be met during testing.


Prescribing the detail in regulations will mean timely adjustments can be made in response to the evolving market. This will ensure the regulatory sandbox stays fit for purpose in this rapidly moving sector. This approach, which combines legislative authority and flexibility, sets Australia apart from its international peers.


The draft regulations were released for public consultation between late October and November of last year. The government will consider those responses as we work to finalise the design of the regulations. 


Under the proposal released for consultation, businesses will be able to test a wider range of new and innovative fin-tech products and services. This includes holistic financial advice, the issuing of consumer credit contracts and facilitating crowdsourced funding.


An extended 24-month testing time frame was proposed and will give more time for businesses to adjust their offering as they evaluate commercial interest and test the validity of their concepts.


As I've mentioned, while businesses will be able to operate without a licence, they will still be required to meet key consumer protection requirements, including responsible lending obligations, best interests duty, and to have adequate compensation and dispute resolution arrangements.


I believe the regulatory sandbox will be a game changer for Australia. It will support businesses that can revolutionise the financial services sector, bring the positive disruption that brings real benefits to customers right across the spectrum of innovation, including payments, insurance, credit, data and analytics and personal finance management. 


Customers are already benefiting from the emergence of fin-tech firms. These nimble and consumer focused firms are putting pressure on traditional financial service providers and models to be more responsive and to deliver better outcomes for Australians—Australians that would get locked out on the opportunity to access capital. These firms, these innovations, bring the channel of finance that can see their business dreams, their economic dreams, being realised.


I would like to thank the fin-tech sector for their work with the government—their very proactive work with the government—to develop the regulatory sandbox and other initiatives we have progressed in the last two years. 


The regulatory sandbox will no doubt be a source of many breakthrough innovations in fin-tech in the coming years.


Schedule 2 to this bill makes a number of minor technical amendments to the early stage venture capital limited partnership, venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early stage investor regimes to clarify the income tax law and ensure that these provisions operate in accordance with their original policy intent. 


The tax incentives for early stage investors measure and the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships measure were introduced as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. Together, these measures are designed to promote an innovative, risk-taking and entrepreneurial culture by providing incentives for investors to invest in Australian innovative, high-growth potential start-ups and venture capital. This is where growth comes from. This is where more and better-paid jobs come from. This is where higher wages come from.


The amendments being made by this bill will ensure that investors in innovative Australian businesses continue to benefit from effective, generous government support and have certainty as to how these programs are intended to operate.


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:14):  Firstly, I thank all the members who have contributed to this debate. This bill delivers on the remainder of the government's enterprise tax plan introduced in the 2016-17 budget. The first element of that plan, which has been previously legislated for firms earning up to $50 million in turnover each year, was a watershed change for businesses around this country, particularly for small businesses earning between $2 million and $10 million in turnover each year. Not only does that reduce the tax rate for those businesses but it also provides businesses that have a turnover up to $10 million access to the small business tax incentives: the instant asset write-off, pool depreciation and GST on a cash flow basis. All of these are important measures that assist genuine small businesses which, this government believes, are businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. That is a different view to those who sit opposite.


The Labor Party believe a small business should only be defined as a business earning up to $2 million. The Henry review suggested it should have been up to $5 million, and we thought it should go further than that. A business earning up to $10 million can have some 22 employees. It is not Google or Microsoft or any of those sorts of businesses—they're genuine small businesses which we find in all of our electorates. This government provided those businesses with the most significant tax relief that those types of businesses have ever seen, because we understand small businesses. We know what a small business is. We know where they are, we know what they need, we know the support they need and we know the recognition they need. That's why we legislated tax relief—tax cuts—for small businesses, and the Labor Party opposed it. We know, because the Labor Party have said—in relation to these measures and in relation to the $65 billion of estimated revenue impacts over the 10 years, which includes the tax relief to not just businesses earning between $2 million and $10 million but businesses all the way to zero in turnover—that they have factored that into their costings. They've spent all that money and they still have a deficit which is greater than what the coalition put forward at the last election. They spent all that and then spent more and then had an even worse fiscal position.


It's clear that the Labor Party, if they are elected at the next election, have factored into their costings the reversal of tax cuts for small- and medium-sized businesses. The bill that's now before the House would see the next cab off the rank—businesses earning between $50 million and $100 million—get a tax cut. It's bad enough that the Labor Party would deny those businesses that. Again, they're not multinationals or even big domestic companies necessarily but businesses in South Australia, businesses in Tasmania—businesses all around the country—that are modest, growing and hungry businesses that want to put more and more Australians into jobs. I cannot understand how keeping taxes high for these businesses helps them employ more Australians or boost their wages. It doesn't make any sense. 


I know there are plenty of critics of the government's plan that we have consistently held to, that we took to an election and that we won an election on; it was confirmed by the Australian people. I know that. But what of the question put to the counterfactual? How on earth does keeping business taxes high help one business employ one more Australian or give one more Australian a wage rise or help them invest one more dollar in their business—in plant, in equipment, in technology, in training, in developing new products or in going after new markets? Keeping business taxes high is a complete numpty of an idea. It doesn't make any sense. Anyone who thinks that's good economic policy has absolutely lost their economic compass and cannot find their way around the economic debate in this country.


We're putting forward the continuation of our plan to continue to drive the jobs and the growth that we are seeing. Last year over 400,000 jobs were created. That was a record year for jobs growth, eclipsing all others since records were first taken for jobs in this country. It is stronger than the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government's best years, stronger than the Howard government's best years, stronger than the Keating government's best years, stronger than the Hawke government's best years, stronger than the Fraser government's best years and stronger than the Whitlam government's best years—the strongest jobs growth on record.


It's part of a plan. It's not the whole plan. There's our $75 billion infrastructure investment, which we know is equally, for similar reasons, supporting investment in our economy, supporting growth and supporting the case for strong wage outcomes for Australians. There's our investment and stickability when it comes to the issue of opening up new markets through trade. That's something the Labor Party used to believe in but, like everything else, have changed their tune on. We stick to things, and we're sticking to this plan. We're sticking to this plan because we know it's in the economic interests of Australians.


It's often said to me, 'It's unpopular with some.' That may cause the Labor Party to lose their faith, to lose their belief and to lose their conviction that these things are good for the economy. But what I do know is popular is this: more and better paid jobs. As a government you've got to be prepared to do the things that achieve those outcomes and not go to water the first time that someone makes a criticism of your policy. This government will not relent to that. We stick to our plans, practically, to get the outcomes that we know produce more and better paid jobs.


That's why we're sticking to our plans on innovation. Just this morning we announced further changes, particularly to the early stage venture partnerships, which is part of that innovation agenda that continues to be rolled out by the government. The defence industry plan is supporting Australia's advanced manufacturing industry to transition. Our global economy is changing, and we're supporting our advanced manufacturing sector to change with it through the biggest recapitalisation of our defence forces since the Second World War, producing the two great dividends that coalition governments have always delivered—national economic security and national economic growth.


The importance of these reforms cannot be understated. The academic debate about this, I am sure, will continue, but Australians are interested in the results that the coalition government is delivering. And it's not just us; around the world, the global economic consensus of sensible governments is that we must reduce the tax burden on businesses that employ our citizens so as to give them the headroom to ensure that they can give our citizens more and better paid jobs.


The Labor Party have opposed us on this. They want Australia to be stranded on a high-tax island. They want to see jobs, investment, innovation and training—all of these things—go offshore. That's their choice and they must own the consequences for those decisions done on the basis of populism, not on economic policy. They have lost their economic compass in opposing this bill. We know that they once supported these measures. In government, many years ago, under treasurers and prime ministers, they implemented similar measures. So it is disturbing that we see this shift occurring in the Labor Party when it comes to economic policy and the re-education program that has been put on the Labor Party by the Greens in this country as they move ever closer to the cohabitation on economic policy with the Greens, which we will only see further fused in the upcoming by-election in Batman. It was the Leader of the Opposition, then Assistant Treasurer, who said on 30 March 2011:


… corporate tax reform helps Australia’s private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


… lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses … creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize.


In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller—and the size based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth.


We know that the Labor Party have stood for these sorts of changes before, but today in this place they continue to make excuses as to why they will not vote for their previous convictions. Their convictions have evaporated in the face of having to actually stand for economic common sense.


The shadow Treasurer joins me at the table—not out of flattery but because he's on duty and he is welcome. With his leader, on 6 June 2016, he said: 'You'd need a microscope to find the impact of the corporate tax cut on economic growth.' But this stands in stark contradiction to what he said in his own book in 2013, where he said:


It is a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


So Labor says that it can't be done because it cannot be afforded. What I don't understand, then, is what I said before: they reverse the company tax cuts and they end up with a bigger deficit. Explain that one to me. It can't be afforded, but, even when they get rid of them, they end up with a higher deficit. We know that the shadow Treasurer said in February this year: 'The objection to the corporate tax rate is that this nation, at this point, cannot afford it. It is the biggest single hit on the budget that either side will propose.' But in 2013 he said, 'The United Kingdom, facing a much tougher fiscal situation than Australia, has cut its company tax rate to 23 per cent in April 2013 to be further reduced to 21 per cent in April 2014.'


We know that the Leader of the Opposition talked about the need for company tax cuts to be part of an agenda for investment and growth when the deficit was at $41.5 billion and rising, back in 2011. In 2012, as Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Any student of Australian business and economic history since the eighties knows part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.' The deficit at that point was $37.1 billion and rising. The shadow Treasurer said on 22 September 2015: 'I would like to see the corporate tax rate come down over time'—which is what this bill proposes, by the way. 'I've previously said that the nation should be aiming for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate'—the deficit at that time was $35.1 billion. The problem is that the shadow Treasurer aims for this thing but can't hit it, because he's lost his conviction to follow through on the things he once believed in.


The shadow minister for financial services said on 2 February 2016 that Australia would go better with a lower company tax rate. The deficit at that point was $37.4 billion. Then there's the case regarding inequality. 'Recent trends,' the shadow Treasurer said in 2017, 'certainly don't inspire optimism when the government tells people to trust them that the tax rate cut for business will magically trickle down.' Yet his own leader said on 30 March 2011, in a speech to ACOSS, 'Reducing the corporate tax rate sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will flow on to workers in the form of higher wages, thereby improving the standard of living.'


Finally, they say you can't have the AAA credit rating and a corporate tax cut. With no help from the opposition, Australia has retained the AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies—that was confirmed in the last few weeks—and we're one of only 10 countries to do so.


These are excuses for why the Labor Party are not supporting this bill. As to whether they've changed their mind, never believed it in the first place or have lost their way, I'll let the Australian people decide. When they stand in this place today and vote against a plan that has already demonstrated in its first instalment its support for jobs growth in this country, and go against everything they've previously believed in government to court the chorus of populism, it's a sad day for the Labor Party. This is the day when in this place they will vote their economic credentials out of existence. This is why they cannot be trusted to manage our $1.8 trillion economy—because they have lost their economic compass. They don't know where they're going. They don't know how to drive growth in the economy. They have no plan to lift wages in this country. They have embarked on their voyage to the other side to cohabit with the Greens, who now write economic policy for the Labor Party. As I said the other day in this place, when it comes to economic policy, if you don't know what you believe, no-one will believe in you, and that's why no-one believes in the Labor Party's economic credentials anymore.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (10:14):  Firstly, I thank all the members who have contributed to this debate. This bill delivers on the remainder of the government's enterprise tax plan introduced in the 2016-17 budget. The first element of that plan, which has been previously legislated for firms earning up to $50 million in turnover each year, was a watershed change for businesses around this country, particularly for small businesses earning between $2 million and $10 million in turnover each year. Not only does that reduce the tax rate for those businesses but it also provides businesses that have a turnover up to $10 million access to the small business tax incentives: the instant asset write-off, pool depreciation and GST on a cash flow basis. All of these are important measures that assist genuine small businesses which, this government believes, are businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million. That is a different view to those who sit opposite.


The Labor Party believe a small business should only be defined as a business earning up to $2 million. The Henry review suggested it should have been up to $5 million, and we thought it should go further than that. A business earning up to $10 million can have some 22 employees. It is not Google or Microsoft or any of those sorts of businesses—they're genuine small businesses which we find in all of our electorates. This government provided those businesses with the most significant tax relief that those types of businesses have ever seen, because we understand small businesses. We know what a small business is. We know where they are, we know what they need, we know the support they need and we know the recognition they need. That's why we legislated tax relief—tax cuts—for small businesses, and the Labor Party opposed it. We know, because the Labor Party have said—in relation to these measures and in relation to the $65 billion of estimated revenue impacts over the 10 years, which includes the tax relief to not just businesses earning between $2 million and $10 million but businesses all the way to zero in turnover—that they have factored that into their costings. They've spent all that money and they still have a deficit which is greater than what the coalition put forward at the last election. They spent all that and then spent more and then had an even worse fiscal position.


It's clear that the Labor Party, if they are elected at the next election, have factored into their costings the reversal of tax cuts for small- and medium-sized businesses. The bill that's now before the House would see the next cab off the rank—businesses earning between $50 million and $100 million—get a tax cut. It's bad enough that the Labor Party would deny those businesses that. Again, they're not multinationals or even big domestic companies necessarily but businesses in South Australia, businesses in Tasmania—businesses all around the country—that are modest, growing and hungry businesses that want to put more and more Australians into jobs. I cannot understand how keeping taxes high for these businesses helps them employ more Australians or boost their wages. It doesn't make any sense. 


I know there are plenty of critics of the government's plan that we have consistently held to, that we took to an election and that we won an election on; it was confirmed by the Australian people. I know that. But what of the question put to the counterfactual? How on earth does keeping business taxes high help one business employ one more Australian or give one more Australian a wage rise or help them invest one more dollar in their business—in plant, in equipment, in technology, in training, in developing new products or in going after new markets? Keeping business taxes high is a complete numpty of an idea. It doesn't make any sense. Anyone who thinks that's good economic policy has absolutely lost their economic compass and cannot find their way around the economic debate in this country.


We're putting forward the continuation of our plan to continue to drive the jobs and the growth that we are seeing. Last year over 400,000 jobs were created. That was a record year for jobs growth, eclipsing all others since records were first taken for jobs in this country. It is stronger than the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government's best years, stronger than the Howard government's best years, stronger than the Keating government's best years, stronger than the Hawke government's best years, stronger than the Fraser government's best years and stronger than the Whitlam government's best years—the strongest jobs growth on record.


It's part of a plan. It's not the whole plan. There's our $75 billion infrastructure investment, which we know is equally, for similar reasons, supporting investment in our economy, supporting growth and supporting the case for strong wage outcomes for Australians. There's our investment and stickability when it comes to the issue of opening up new markets through trade. That's something the Labor Party used to believe in but, like everything else, have changed their tune on. We stick to things, and we're sticking to this plan. We're sticking to this plan because we know it's in the economic interests of Australians.


It's often said to me, 'It's unpopular with some.' That may cause the Labor Party to lose their faith, to lose their belief and to lose their conviction that these things are good for the economy. But what I do know is popular is this: more and better paid jobs. As a government you've got to be prepared to do the things that achieve those outcomes and not go to water the first time that someone makes a criticism of your policy. This government will not relent to that. We stick to our plans, practically, to get the outcomes that we know produce more and better paid jobs.


That's why we're sticking to our plans on innovation. Just this morning we announced further changes, particularly to the early stage venture partnerships, which is part of that innovation agenda that continues to be rolled out by the government. The defence industry plan is supporting Australia's advanced manufacturing industry to transition. Our global economy is changing, and we're supporting our advanced manufacturing sector to change with it through the biggest recapitalisation of our defence forces since the Second World War, producing the two great dividends that coalition governments have always delivered—national economic security and national economic growth.


The importance of these reforms cannot be understated. The academic debate about this, I am sure, will continue, but Australians are interested in the results that the coalition government is delivering. And it's not just us; around the world, the global economic consensus of sensible governments is that we must reduce the tax burden on businesses that employ our citizens so as to give them the headroom to ensure that they can give our citizens more and better paid jobs.


The Labor Party have opposed us on this. They want Australia to be stranded on a high-tax island. They want to see jobs, investment, innovation and training—all of these things—go offshore. That's their choice and they must own the consequences for those decisions done on the basis of populism, not on economic policy. They have lost their economic compass in opposing this bill. We know that they once supported these measures. In government, many years ago, under treasurers and prime ministers, they implemented similar measures. So it is disturbing that we see this shift occurring in the Labor Party when it comes to economic policy and the re-education program that has been put on the Labor Party by the Greens in this country as they move ever closer to the cohabitation on economic policy with the Greens, which we will only see further fused in the upcoming by-election in Batman. It was the Leader of the Opposition, then Assistant Treasurer, who said on 30 March 2011:


… corporate tax reform helps Australia’s private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


… lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses … creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize.


In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller—and the size based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth.


We know that the Labor Party have stood for these sorts of changes before, but today in this place they continue to make excuses as to why they will not vote for their previous convictions. Their convictions have evaporated in the face of having to actually stand for economic common sense.


The shadow Treasurer joins me at the table—not out of flattery but because he's on duty and he is welcome. With his leader, on 6 June 2016, he said: 'You'd need a microscope to find the impact of the corporate tax cut on economic growth.' But this stands in stark contradiction to what he said in his own book in 2013, where he said:


It is a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


So Labor says that it can't be done because it cannot be afforded. What I don't understand, then, is what I said before: they reverse the company tax cuts and they end up with a bigger deficit. Explain that one to me. It can't be afforded, but, even when they get rid of them, they end up with a higher deficit. We know that the shadow Treasurer said in February this year: 'The objection to the corporate tax rate is that this nation, at this point, cannot afford it. It is the biggest single hit on the budget that either side will propose.' But in 2013 he said, 'The United Kingdom, facing a much tougher fiscal situation than Australia, has cut its company tax rate to 23 per cent in April 2013 to be further reduced to 21 per cent in April 2014.'


We know that the Leader of the Opposition talked about the need for company tax cuts to be part of an agenda for investment and growth when the deficit was at $41.5 billion and rising, back in 2011. In 2012, as Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Any student of Australian business and economic history since the eighties knows part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.' The deficit at that point was $37.1 billion and rising. The shadow Treasurer said on 22 September 2015: 'I would like to see the corporate tax rate come down over time'—which is what this bill proposes, by the way. 'I've previously said that the nation should be aiming for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate'—the deficit at that time was $35.1 billion. The problem is that the shadow Treasurer aims for this thing but can't hit it, because he's lost his conviction to follow through on the things he once believed in.


The shadow minister for financial services said on 2 February 2016 that Australia would go better with a lower company tax rate. The deficit at that point was $37.4 billion. Then there's the case regarding inequality. 'Recent trends,' the shadow Treasurer said in 2017, 'certainly don't inspire optimism when the government tells people to trust them that the tax rate cut for business will magically trickle down.' Yet his own leader said on 30 March 2011, in a speech to ACOSS, 'Reducing the corporate tax rate sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will flow on to workers in the form of higher wages, thereby improving the standard of living.'


Finally, they say you can't have the AAA credit rating and a corporate tax cut. With no help from the opposition, Australia has retained the AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies—that was confirmed in the last few weeks—and we're one of only 10 countries to do so.


These are excuses for why the Labor Party are not supporting this bill. As to whether they've changed their mind, never believed it in the first place or have lost their way, I'll let the Australian people decide. When they stand in this place today and vote against a plan that has already demonstrated in its first instalment its support for jobs growth in this country, and go against everything they've previously believed in government to court the chorus of populism, it's a sad day for the Labor Party. This is the day when in this place they will vote their economic credentials out of existence.

They don't know how to drive growth in the economy. They have no plan to lift wages in this country.

As I said the other day in this place, when it comes to economic policy, if you don't know what you believe, no-one will believe in you, and that's why no-one believes in the Labor Party's economic credentials anymore.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (10:55):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the re-listing of al-Murabitun as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's report on the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the relisting of al-Murabitun as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code.


The Criminal Code enables the committee to review the listing of terrorist organisations and report its findings to the parliament within the 15-day disallowance period.


This is the first time Islamic State Khorasan Province has been listed as a terrorist organisation. Islamic State Khorasan Province is a recognised partner of Islamic State with an estimated membership of up to 11,000 members. The group's primary objective is to establish the province of Khorasan (a region encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia) as part of the global caliphate of Islamic State. Since 2015, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks including suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.


Al-Murabitun is an al-Qaeda aligned Sunni Islamic terrorist group that is committed to enforcing sharia law in West Africa and uniting Muslims and Islamic movements across Africa against non-Muslim and secular influences.


The group was first declared a terrorist organisation by the Australian government in November 2014. Since then the group has reaffirmed its alliance to al-Qaeda and continues to conduct attacks in West Africa. The group funds its activities through smuggling, connections with other terrorist organisations and kidnappings for ransom. In 2016, the group kidnapped Australian citizens Jocelyn and Kenneth Elliott. The group claimed the primary motive for this kidnapping was to gain the release of their captives. Jocelyn Elliott was released but Kenneth Elliott, sadly, has not yet been recovered.


In conducting its review, the committee considered publicly available information and carefully reviewed the procedures followed by the government and the merits of the listings themselves.


The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that both organisations should be listed as terrorist organisations.


The committee therefore supports the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the relisting of al-Murabitun, and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instruments.


I commend this report to the House.

I will fight every day in this place for real, quality and secure jobs for the people of Townsville. We suffered Clive Palmer from the Gold Coast axing 800 jobs from QNI, we suffered Campbell Newman's government in Brisbane slashing jobs in our community, and now we are suffering the Turnbull government in Canberra cutting jobs in Townsville in our schools and hospitals, more than in any southern capital city.



I am sick of these jobs cuts, and I am sick of the missed opportunities for Townsville. I will never back down from arguing for secure and quality jobs for the people of Townsville. I fought for the Townsville Stadium. Labor promised to deliver, and it is now delivering 750 local jobs. I fought for large infrastructure projects that Townsville needs to secure our energy and water future. Labor has provided $200 million to support hydro on the Burdekin Falls Dam, which will deliver 150 construction jobs. Labor will provide $100 million to ensure Townsville's water security.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is making substantial progress in Indigenous advancement and there is much more to be done. I will set out, on Monday, in the Closing the Gap report, where we are doing satisfactorily and where there is a lot more work to do.


I want to advise the House about the very real advances that have been made. We're making a $5 billion investment over four years to 2021 in the Indigenous Advancement Strategy—front line service funding that'll improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We're providing an estimated loading of $4.4 billion for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, with students with greater needs attracting a higher level of funding due to the implementation of the model that David Gonski designed and that we are delivering. In 2018, this additional funding will benefit over 200,000 Indigenous students.


Last year I announced a $138 million education package to further enable the economic and social inclusion for which the 1967 referendum campaigners fought, and that will include more opportunities for our First Australians to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We're empowering communities through our Indigenous Procurement Policy, with over half a billion dollars in Commonwealth spending going to 956 Indigenous businesses. This is a spectacular increase from just $6.2 million being won by Indigenous businesses in 2012-13 under former policies. We're investing $14 million in empowered communities to provide critical capability for Indigenous leaders as they work with their communities and partner organisations to identify local priorities, needs and aspirations.


Our Prison to work report commissioned in my 2016 Closing the Gap speech has since been delivered and released by COAG. From early this year a voluntary program will provide sentenced Indigenous people in prison with employment assistance to access the support they need on their release. That will prepare them better to find employment and transition back into the community. And of course last year we appointed June Oscar AO as the first female Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. We've got a lot more to do, but we are getting on with it. We are working with our First Australians. We are doing things with them, not doing things to them.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (15:23):  On Monday, Senator Louise Pratt, Labor colleagues and I met with dozens of charities concerned about the latest salvo in the Liberals' war on charities. They included the Australian Council for International Development, CHOICE, Red Cross, Oxfam, CARE Australia, the Consumer Action Law Centre, Financial Counselling Australia, ACOSS, World Vision, RESULTS Australia and Pew Charitable Trusts. There is bipartisan support for banning foreign political donations. Indeed, it's been a year since the Leader of the Opposition introduced a private member's bill that would do just that. But banning donations to political parties should not entail cutting down free speech.


We have had an extraordinary array of opponents to the government's attempt to include charities in the scope of its draft laws. These laws have been opposed by GetUp! and the Institute of Public Affairs—probably the only time in Australia's history when GetUp! and the IPA have agreed on the same thing. Credit where it's due—they have achieved the impossible. But it's not the first time they have brought together a range of people across the political spectrum. There have been two open letters to the Prime Minister complaining about attacks on charities. The most recent was signed by Volunteering Australia, Carers Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Community Council of Australia, Justice Connect, Philanthropy Australia and the Starlight Children's Foundation. Again, the Liberals are bringing charities together—against them. 


The fact is the latest bill conflates political campaigning and issue advocacy. Charities have told us about many concerns they have about how this might affect their operations. One charity told us about a program where they bring Indigenous leaders to Canberra, which might have to cease. Another talked about their anti-tuberculosis work, important not only in the Pacific but also in the Torres Strait, which may have to stop. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation currently funds parliamentarians on both sides to visit aid projects in developing countries. That might have to cease. Take the example of a New Zealand family whose child was helped by a local state based charity. They might be unable to give to that charity. Religious charities have said that the new laws might mean that, before passing around the collection plate on Sundays, they might have to a say, 'If you're a foreigner, don't put money in the plate.' That's Malcolm Turnbull's new Australia—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! The member for Fenner will refer to members by their title.




Dr LEIGH:
  That's Prime Minister Turnbull's Australia—an Australia in which immigrants are excluded from putting money in the church collection plate. Consumer protection agencies have told us that they might have to cease their campaigning on product safety. And what international NGO would set up in a country with such draconian laws when it comes to dealing with foreign donations?


A survey by Pro Bono has found that two-thirds of Australian charities are finding it harder to be heard by the federal government than they were five years ago. When you look at how the Liberals have spent the last five years, it's not very surprising. We've had five ministers in five years responsible for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission: Kevin Andrews, Scott Morrison, Christian Porter, Michael McCormack and Michael Sukkar. And we saw a period, from 2011 to 2016, in which the Liberals tried to close down the charities commission, a body supported by four out of five charities. The Liberals have put gag clauses in social services agreements, have attempted to shut down the ability of charities to advocate and are now trying to expand the ban on overseas donations to political parties to also cover charities. To paraphrase the great Malcolm Tucker, those on the other side of the House have a rap sheet longer than a Leonard Cohen song. 


After a period in which Susan Pascoe, the well-respected head of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, had not been reappointed, the government decided to appoint well-known charities critic Gary Johns to head the commission. So proud they were of this decision that they announced it at the very same time at which this House was passing its historic vote on same-sex marriage. That's what you do when you're proud of an announcement. Appointing Gary Johns to head the charities commission is like putting Ned Kelly in charge of bank security; it's like putting Bronwyn Bishop in charge of transport for politicians. Let's go through some of the things on Gary Johns's track record. As he appointed Mr Johns, the minister admitted he hadn't read his work, so let's go through a few of the things Gary Johns has said. 


Gary Johns has said, 'The Abbott government should deny charity status to the enemies of progress.' Who are the enemies of progress? Well, who's to know which charity is in the firing line. He believes in the scrapping of the Charities Act 2013, which would take charities law back to the 1600s. The head of the charities commission would like to see charities law returned to the Shakespearean era. I love Shakespeare, but I think we can do better than the Shakespearean era when it comes to our charities law. He said, 'There is a great deal of impure altruism in the charity business.' And he has gone after specific charities. How do mental health charities feel about the fact that the new charities commissioner has attacked beyondblue for their work with LBGTI people?


How would Indigenous charities feel about the fact that the charities commissioner has said:


Look, a lot of poor women in this country, a large proportion of whom are Aboriginal, are used as cash cows, right?


How would welfare charities feel about the fact that the charities commissioner said:


If a person's sole source of income is the taxpayer, the person, as a condition of benefit, must have contraception. No contraception, no benefit.


How would Indigenous charities feel about the statement that the charities commissioner has made that:


… Recognise, is the officially sanctioned propaganda arm of the Australian Government.


How would multicultural charities feel about the fact that the charities commissioner has said:


Australia is sucking in too many of the wrong type of immigrant … There is no doubt many Australians have considerable misgivings about Muslim immigration and the ability of many to fit in.


How would environmental charities feel about the fact that the new charities commissioner has said:


… we know for a fact that renewable energy is a cause of the blackouts.


Labor has engaged with charities around the country, such as Welcome to Australia, whose founder, Brad Chilcott, characterised the Turnbull government's approach to charities by saying:


The message that charities should not be involved in advocacy is akin to saying 'you can plant a tree but you can't protect a forest'.


The advocacy voice of charities and not-for-profits is not only the voice of the various organisations—it is the voice of every Australian who donates, volunteers or is a member of a charity. When the voice of charities and not-for-profits are threatened, so is our democracy.


The approach that the Turnbull government takes towards charities is that they should be seen but not heard, that they can serve out soup in a soup kitchen but can't talk about the causes of poverty, that they can plant trees but can't talk about deforestation, that they can assist Indigenous people on the ground but they can't possibly talk about the root causes of Indigenous disadvantage.


The government want to put a velvet rope across the entry to the public square. They are hurting not only charities but also the very quality of Australian public debate, which demands a multiplicity of voices. Australian democracy isn't just about the voices of politicians; it's about the choices of charities who—let's be honest—enjoy far higher trust than traditional political parties. They have a right to be heard. Australians want them to be heard in the political conversation.


While the government is continuing its war on charities, prompting open letters and protests from the sector, Labor is engaging with charities. Bill Shorten has created a portfolio of shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits. For the first time this important sector has been recognised by the Labor front bench. Labor is working with states and territories to encourage them to cooperate with the charities commission so our voluntary sector spends less time doing paperwork and more time engaging with the vulnerable. Labor supports Justice Connect's campaign to fix fundraising, moving from a patchwork of state based laws to a uniform national scheme operating within the Australian Consumer Law and giving a week per year back to charities, who no longer have to waste it doing unnecessary paperwork. Labor has conducted nine Reconnected forums across Australia, bringing together more than a thousand charities to explore new approaches to boosting community engagement.


Wouldn't it be great if, the next time heads of charities came to Canberra, they were engaging with the government on constructive reform, not fighting yet another battle in the coalition's war on charities?

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-02-08,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:33):  That is a grab bag of character assassinations, complaints and the shadow minister crowing about being the shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits. I looked at the MPI that he put forward earlier. Your title is longer than the entire remainder of this document. We have the Hon. Dr—or Professor, as we like to call him over here—Andrew Leigh, shadow assistant treasurer, shadow minister for competition and productivity, shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits, shadow minister for trade in services, member for Fenner. Was that your pay-off? You went to the Leader of the Opposition and said, 'Throw a couple more titles in there, just to make me feel better.'


Character assassination is not going to cut it here, Member for Fenner. In that diatribe of complaints from the member for Fenner, we didn't hear any thought or concern for the people who fund charities: the donors. You never hear the member for Fenner talking about donors. All the member for Fenner does is enter into character assassination and, quite sadly—as I pointed out during your contribution—why would you attack a former Keating minister? Does this show how far your party has moved to the Left in that you are focusing all of your attention on attacking a former Keating minister—a minister that, quite frankly, will be remembered much more than you ever will be, member for Fenner. Someone said to me when I was first elected that the member for Fenner was the new attack dog. I was sitting here watching you then, and I saw a lot more chihuahua than German shepherd.


Getting down to the range of unsubstantiated claims made by the member for Fenner—I won't go through the multitude of other titles—when we look at foreign donations, the member for Fenner used the most ridiculous examples and he didn't answer the basic question, which is what the Labor Party needs to answer: Do they think we should allow foreign individuals, foreign entities and foreign governments to directly participate in Australian elections or Australian political processes? The Labor Party will not answer this question. Do they fundamentally believe that there's a role for foreign money to enter our political sphere?


We believe political parties, candidates and campaigners should be prohibited from receiving foreign donations. One would think that would be uncontroversial. One would think that the Labor Party would work constructively to try and ensure we could get that outcome. This ban has been carefully designed to prevent loopholes for foreign money. We believe foreign interests shouldn't be funding election advertising or how-to-vote material, regardless of whether that campaigning is undertaken by a political party or somebody else.


I say to the member for Fenner, 'Focus on the objective.' We don't want political interference from anybody associated with a foreign entity, a foreign government or foreign interests, who don't necessarily have our best interests at heart. The member for Fenner should reflect on that and show some leadership. He should, like his very lofty title suggests, show some leadership, and try to pull his leader, who has lurched massively to the Left, into a sensible position on this. That would be leadership people would appreciate.


Turning to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, I will say again that I've had a number of individuals contact me, who are very disappointed with the conduct undertaken by the member for Fenner. The character assassination of somebody appointed through a statutory process—a person serving the government—is quite outrageous. You would expect that a member with a constituency in Canberra would understand that. This process you're undertaking is discrediting you, member for Fenner. It's discrediting you. I think Dr Johns, as he has pointed out, will apply the law and will enforce the law as the ACNC is there to do. The ACNC is not an advocacy body for the sector. The ACNC, like ASIC and like any other regulator, is there to regulate the industry.


The member for Fenner doesn't talk about donors. He never talks about the people who fund the altruistic activities of charities and not-for-profits. He couldn't care less, because he's captive to a very small group of individuals who have very close links to the Labor Party and very close links to the member for Fenner—quite dubiously close links, in fact. He shouldn't be trading on those.


The Turnbull government's position is very clear. We obviously had a process over many years of seeing the ACNC in action. The member for Fenner referred to the former ACNC Commissioner—whom the government reappointed, I might add. He is someone who was respected. Now we have another highly respected individual, in Dr Johns, who will take carriage of the ACNC. The ACNC's job is to ensure that charities are used for the purposes for which they are on the register, the purposes for which they obtain tax concessions generously provided by taxpayers. The ACNC's job is to ensure that there is no 'set and forget' for charities. Once you are on the register, once you are entitled to generous tax concessions provided by Australian taxpayers, you must continue to act in accordance with what you've promised you're going to do.




Ms Claydon:
  We are. What are you suggesting?




Mr SUKKAR:
  Well, we've had 59 knocked off the register. Clearly, there are charities—and that's the whole purpose of the ACNC, I'd remind you—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SUKKAR:
  Did you not vote for the ACNC when you were last in government? The whole purpose of the ACNC is to maintain and ensure integrity in the sector. That will clearly mean that, in egregious circumstances, charities will be knocked off the register. Why is that done? Because it maintains integrity in the entire sector. There are 55,000 charities. It doesn't take many charities—including those in the recent AUSTRAC ACNC report—to do the wrong thing to muddy the names of so many others. So I would suggest to you that the sector actually wants integrity because it engenders more trust and more giving from donors.


I would say to the member for Fenner that this government has a very proud record of doing three things. We protect donors and ensure that we are engendering a spirit of giving through integrity in this sector. We also ensure that we are reducing red tape for charities. One of the most significant aspects of what this government has sought to do is to ensure that charities and not-for-profits can spend less time complying with paperwork, less time complying with government regulations and more time undertaking what it is they are there to do.


Of course, with the foreign donations bill, we have to ensure that to obtain a very important public policy outcome—that is, no interference from foreign political interests—we assist our charities to comply with that. And we absolutely will. The test will be for the member for Fenner to see if he can get his party to a sensible outcome and if he can cease this disgraceful character assassination of the ACNC Commissioner, who is doing a wonderful job, who is already winning plaudits in the charities and not-for-profits sector. I'm very confident that, after his term is completed, the ACNC Commissioner will be remembered for the same high standards as the former ACNC Commissioner is remembered.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:43):  I thank the member for Fenner, Dr Leigh, for his speech just now. I joined with the member for Fenner in meeting with representatives of dozens of charities in Canberra this week. Those representatives of dozens of charities came to Canberra because they are concerned about this government's latest assault on charities. Unfortunately, it is an attack that is being carried out on multiple fronts. The Liberal Party has a long history of attacking charities, going right back to the Howard government when Peter Costello, as Treasurer, tried to prevent charities, through the use of tax laws, from continuing their vital role in advocacy. The Liberal Party has never understood the proper role of charities in advocating for changes in government policy, which is why they attack charities that engage in advocacy and attempt to shut them down.


As we've just heard from the member for Fenner, there are proposed amendments to our electoral donations law which will have a drastic impact on charities and the vitally important work that they do. That vital work that charities do has become even more important in recent years as the Abbott and Turnbull governments have driven up living costs and cut vital services, leaving more and more Australians in need of the help that charities provide. The government claim that they have to cut because there just isn't enough money. But, of course, they have no trouble putting together $65 billion to hand to the big end of town.


The attack on charities in the donations bill was concerning enough, but the government has opened up another front, whether by design or inadvertence, in the form of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill is one of four national security bills in the package that was brought into the parliament on the last sitting day of 2017. This particular bill was introduced by the Prime Minister himself. Of course, we agree with the government that any attempt by foreign powers to disrupt or influence our democratic processes must be stopped. We accept the comments that are being made by ASIO about the work of foreign powers 'clandestinely seeking to shape the opinions of members of the Australian public, media organisations and government officials in order to advance their country's own political objectives'.


Our commitment is, of course, to bipartisanship on national security matters, but it does not extend to giving the government a blank cheque to do what it wants. We'll engage with the government constructively on the national security laws. It is through the process in the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that we've successfully argued for a very large number of amendments to the various national security laws introduced by the government since 2014. We are adopting that same approach to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill, but it is a bill which introduces an onerous registration scheme for individuals or entities said to be undertaking certain activities on behalf of a foreign principal.


Laughably, the member for Deakin has just had the gall to suggest that the government wanted to reduce red tape for the charities sector. This bill increases red tape for the charities sector. The effect of extraordinarily expansive definitions in the scheme means that the bill will capture Australian charities whose conduct, activities and purposes are entirely benign and completely benefit our nation. This will be imposed on charities despite the fact that these charities are all already closely regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. These charities contribute in an overwhelmingly positive manner to our society, but the effect of this bill, as it stands, will be to strangle many of them in wasteful and unnecessary regulation. I hope that that effect is only the unintended consequence of this bill—a consequence of sloppy drafting; the origin of which was made clear by the former Attorney-General's claim that he was closely involved in the formulation of the bill. But, if on the other hand, this is the intended effect of the bill—to silence charities—it is truly shameful. The proposed exemptions in the bill are exceptionally narrow and, with respect to charities, relate solely to an activity the person or entity undertakes in relation to humanitarian aid or humanitarian assistance.


We in the Labor Party think that giving in to an assault by the government on Australian civil society is an abdication of our responsibility to protect and nurture the crucial role that Australian civil society plays in creating a fair and equal nation. I will finish with a letter I got from the Archbishop of Melbourne, Denis Hart, who said to me in that letter last week: 'The bill is drafted with significant breadth and will likely capture any charity— (Time expired)

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-02-08,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:48):  I always welcome the interjections of those opposite in arguing that I live up to the title of 'Freedom Boy'. It is a title I wear with pride—so I encourage you to keep doing so. But let's not get distracted from the substance of this MPI put forward by the member for Fenner, which is of course that we all support the purpose and mission of charities. Everybody in this place—on this side of the House and on that side of the House—does. I imagine even the crossbenchers and even the Marxist member for Melbourne may see some room for the private sector that private citizens or organisations can do charitable works.


We all agree that, when donations are made in this country, they should, of course, go to the people to which they are served, to try to minimise overheads and to make sure that people can get the support and assistance they need and that, even if the money is given in pursuit of helping people overseas, it will see its same destination. Of course, we want people to participate in charities and be constructive and be part of it. But there are some things I would hope we also agree on. I would hope that we agree on the idea that, when people give money to charities, it's used, as I said, for people, and not for some people to get elected to parliament. We also believe that charities should not become siphons to fund political campaigns to distort our democracy. Those things are exactly what many of the bills that have been put before this parliament by this government seek to do.


I am hearing a lot of complaining from the other side. There have been some very entertaining and somewhat hysterical over-reactions, but what I haven't heard is any solutions. What I've heard is a lot of complaints but no solutions. The offer is always there to those opposite to put constructive ideas on the table, but we're not actually hearing that one little bit. In the end, this whole MPI is setting up for one purpose, which is that the member for Fenner was given the task by his whip: 'Can you come up with a matter of public importance today?' He looked around and would have said: 'I've said so many things. I've talked about how you should cut taxes, so I won't do it on that, because that would embarrass me and make a fool of me. I looked around and realised that there was all this research which said I believe in free markets, so I can't attack the government on its economic policy, because that would make me look a fool. So often I've written about why I believe in cutting back red tape'—and he still couldn't find anything! So he thought, 'I know—I'm going to put forward an MPI that says the government is undermining Australia's charities and then come up with a long, purposeless list of confected outrage against a former Labor minister.'


It's not normally my practice to support and defend Labor ministers. You normally would leave that up to those people on the other side, on the opposition benches. But the reality is they're now eating their own young. This is how it works in the modern Labor Party. Once you turn your back on them and accept an appointment from a coalition government to do work, to actually improve the future of this nation, to stand up and support the charities which will enable Australians to continue to donate with confidence, their response is to mock, to ridicule and to undermine. And they have the temerity to talk about the idea that they believe in free speech, while consistently demanding, saying he isn't up to the job, on the basis that he has opinions and has expressed them. This is the reality of the modern Labor Party. It is completely disconnected from reality and isn't focused on what actually needs to be done.


There are laws that need to be introduced in this country to make sure we can have confidence in the charitable sector. We all agree with that. It is important that those laws are targeted and specific to make sure that the money that people donate to charities for pursuit of a cause actually gets delivered and helps the people that they care about. What there is concern about across the general community—and, yes, inside the parliament—is that that is not happening. In some cases, what we're seeing is charities engaging in activity that goes beyond their remit, that goes beyond the purpose of influencing and having a discussion around public debate and to improve the delivery of public services, which improves the lives of Australians, toward a process where you can see the risk where charities can become agents—as it's just been acknowledged by the shadow Attorney-General—for the pursuit of foreign interests. We have to stand up for our country and its interests.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (15:53):  The member for Deakin, in an interesting contribution to this debate, said that there were three things that the government had approached with consistency in this area. I probably shouldn't say, but I'd better get the record straight—he only actually got to two. The fact remains that there is only one element that can be said to be a consistent attitude of the government to the charities sector and indeed to civil society generally—that is, to shut it down. This government has been determined, under the member for Warringah and now under the member for Wentworth, to shut down any dissenting voices. Unfortunately, Member for Goldstein, this is a government that does not have the courage of its convictions. Those who were warriors for the cause of individual freedom before they came here seem to think that authoritarianism is the new black.




Mr Conroy:
  And now they're fleeing the chamber.




Mr GILES:
  Yes! It's unfortunate that there isn't more time for us to explore the confusion in government ranks on every aspect to do with charities regulation, bar their insistence of preventing any meaningful scrutiny or advocacy on issues that may affect Australian politics. But there are a few aspects of the member for Deakin's contribution that deserve examination, given his responsibilities. Firstly, and this is really troubling—I know he's a former lawyer and we should stick together in this club—he described the legislation as 'carefully drafted'. I cannot wait for Senator Cormann to find out about that, because he has said, quite rightly, that the legislation will need very significant amendment, which, of course, it does. So, bad luck, member for Deakin. Back to the drawing board.


He also said, 'It doesn't take many charities doing the wrong thing to muddy all of their names,' or words to that effect. That's probably true. But he should reflect on what this means. What we have seen in opinion polling is that Australians have a very high, and increasing, level of trust in charities. The same cannot be said of this place, or indeed of political parties. The contrast is striking. I think this explains why this rudderless, 'agendaless' government is so determined to continue its crackdown on charities and any dissenting voices in civil society. Governments members know in their heart of hearts that not only is their agenda unpopular but any discussion of the issues it is prosecuting in the community through this place—when it can get its agenda through this place—is only going to drag it down further. It is a shameful, cowardly response to not having an agenda that resonates with Australians, because, frankly, this government's agenda says very little to the concerns of Australians.


The member for Fenner has gone through the litany of attacks on the charities sector the government has engaged in from day one. They've also made a couple of comments in this debate that, I think, require examination. They talked about our unwillingness to offer solutions. Well, I say this to government members: since 2008 the Labor Party, as part of a wide-ranging reform to clean up our politics, has put forward proposals to ban foreign donations to political parties—10 years! Unlike this crazy bit of legislation that landed almost literally at one minute to midnight at the end of last year, without a proper regulatory impact statement and without any public consultation, the Labor proposals were generated through a proper green paper, white paper process. That's why they have stood the test of time and that's why this parliament should bring on the private member's bill in the name of the Leader of the Opposition and get to work on it. If they were serious about it, that's what they would do. If government members have concerns with particular elements of our proposal, let's have the debate. Let's bring that on and get on with removing foreign influence from our politics.


In doing so, let's recognise a fundamental truth: that there is a big difference between those of us who seek to hold public office in the legislature and the executive and those who seek to hold us to account. Government members don't recognise that. They refuse to recognise that. But this side of politics welcomes a strong civil society. I know that the Shorten Labor government will welcome our engagement with critical voices not only in building an agenda to change Australia but in strengthening Australian democracy. It is such a pity government members have no faith in their cause.

"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2018-02-08,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (15:58):  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this MPI. I would like to start by saying it's regrettable that the member for Fenner has characterised this debate as 'charities struggling to be heard'. Three evenings ago, members of all parties gathered in Parliament House, under the leadership of Ovarian Cancer Australia, to listen to the plight of those with ovarian cancer. We heard about one of the deadliest cancers affecting so many women across this country, and the incredible inspiring story of Jill Emberson. Nearly every sitting day, a charity will come to this place or hold an event and talk to politicians about their needs, their hopes and their aspirations.


Charities across Australia have and will continue to have a very important voice in this place. I can assure members opposite—for those who were there, joined by the women members of the press gallery—that Ovarian Cancer Australia was not concerned about this politicking. Ovarian Cancer Australia was concerned about the women dying from ovarian cancer across this country.


The problem with this debate and Labor's conduct in this debate is that it's all about saying no. Nearly everything that this government does, Labor opposes. Company tax cuts to grow jobs, Labor opposes—it previously supported them. Our attack on multinational tax avoidance, Labor opposes. On our trade agreements, Labor cannot decide whether it's Arthur or Martha. There is our national energy guarantee. There is our cashless welfare card, which certain Labor members said they were going to support, but then, in a mad swing to the Left, led by the Leader of the Opposition, Labor is now opposing a policy which is changing the lives of kids in Indigenous communities.


The government has announced a review of the legislation governing the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, and that is required by legislation. It is right and proper to do so. The review will provide a chance for the public, the not-for-profit sector and other stakeholders to contribute their ideas and experience to help improve how this sector is regulated. Why is this review important? Because charities must be held to account, like every other organisation. Most of the 55,000 charities across Australia do an incredible job, but we have seen many examples of those who don't. Why would Labor not fully support a process which drives integrity in the system? If they are going to be the recipient of generous tax deductions courtesy of the Australian taxpayer, it is right and proper that charities be held to account.


The ACNC has the responsibility of maintaining, protecting and enhancing public trust and confidence in the charities and not-for-profit sector. That's what we are interested in—supporting the accountability and transparency of the sector. Frankly, it is extraordinary that members opposite, this shabby Labor Party, of which Paul Keating and Bob Hawke are now so ashamed, have stooped so low as to attack a former very fine Labor minister, Dr Gary Johns, who has been appointed as the full-time Commissioner of the ACNC for a five-year period.


Contrary to a misleading and misinformed scare campaign, the foreign donations bill has no impact on the vast majority of charities. We've put protections in place to ensure the bill has no effect on foreign funding for charities' non-political activity or charities' political campaigning where it is funded by Australians. We are taking action to ensure that election advertising, including how-to-vote material and campaign robo-calls, is not funded by foreign interests. This should be the case regardless of whether campaigning is done by a political party, a campaign group, a business or a charity. It's long been a requirement for any individual or entity that incurs a significant amount of political expenditure to disclose this to the Australian Electoral Commission. I want to make this very important point: just seven of the 55,500 registered charities in Australia reported political expenditure in 2016-17, which is 0.1 per cent of Australian charities. So, far from targeting charities, the bill ensures the Electoral Act continues to apply to all participants in Australian elections. We are incredibly proud of the work we are doing to stand up and support the wonderful work that thousands of charities are doing across Australia.

Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I did hear the member for Oxley withdraw. I didn't hear anything else. If there was, I didn't hear it.




Ms KEAY:
  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important issue because, in my electorate, local charities are the fabric of the local communities and, in every town, those charities are supported almost always by volunteers. They are there to support the disadvantaged and the vulnerable people in my communities who are doing it tough. But it is very clear that this government is continuing to undermine the very work of these very decent, hardworking volunteers as they go about doing this work in these communities. They already undermine these people to such an extent that local charities are too afraid to speak out on issues of importance.


I know from conversations with many local groups that they are too afraid to speak out because they are worried that their funding will be cut. This is the climate of fear that they currently operate in thanks to the government sitting opposite. But now this government wants to go even further and stifle their voice and tie them up in bureaucratic knots. It is some sort of warped priority that this government could claim to be the advocates for free speech when at the same time they make it harder for charitable groups to express a public view. How is it that this government says it's alright for someone to be a bigot but it's not alright for a charity to call for increased funding to tackle homelessness?


Once again, we see evidence that this Prime Minister continues to lurch to the far Right and become captive of the ideologues in the coalition. But, then again, when it comes to supporting our charities, this government has a track record that, by any reasonable measure, it could not be proud of. For six years the coalition had a policy to abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. The government already forces social services charities to sign gag clauses to prevent them from speaking out on policy issues. Since being elected, there have been multiple ministers responsible for charities, with one minister refusing to meet with the charities commission head. To top it off, before the end of last year, this government appointed as the head of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission a person who is opposed to the work of charities. Gary Johns might be a nice man—I have never met him—but, from what he has said about charities, he could not possibly be the right person for the job. Any person who attacks the work of beyondblue, supporting vulnerable young LGBTQI people, is clearly unfit for the role.


It is clear that those opposite have not spoken to or engaged in any positive way with charities. Just seven days ago, Pro Bono released a survey and found that that many charities are unclear and uncertain about how they stand to be affected by the government's electoral funding and disclosure reform bill. In fact, 96 per cent of the respondents had not been consulted by the government on this bill.


Last year I had the great pleasure to participate in the Vinnies CEO Sleepout. It is a national program, and I hope everyone has the same opportunity to participate. This campaign is to raise awareness of homelessness and the reasons that people themselves in this situation. Can someone from the other side please explain why this charity should be stifled and tied up in knots through a political disclosure regime? Why should they feel threatened to speak for the need for extra funding to address homelessness?


I do agree that front groups for political parties should have a higher degree of scrutiny. In my state of Tasmania, in the middle of a state election, big, vested interstate interests groups are openly funding a third-party campaign against the opposition party. These types of activities certainly need proper scrutiny and a more timely reporting mechanism. The community should also be given the opportunity to know who is behind the campaigns and how much is being contributed. The community should have the right to know who the puppetmaster is who is pulling the Tasmanian Liberal Premier's strings. But that does not mean that charities such as beyondblue, Anglicare, St Vincent de Paul and many others should be caught up. The government needs to go back to the drawing board and redraft its legislation and maybe even talk to these charities. You could actually learn something for a change. Maybe then we could have a sensible conversation with those on the other side of this House.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:09):  It is a somewhat unclean debate today, given that both sides of this chamber are so strongly in support of the not-for-profit sector and many of us receive support from the not-for-profit sector ourselves. Given the almost 'political heritage' of having an MPI at the end of the week where the opposition screams that the government is bringing the world to an end, it is difficult to tease out exactly what the concern is. Obviously, to be traducing Gary Johns is disappointing. In a simplistic sense, I don't have a dog in this fight if Labor wants to tear apart a former Labor minister; but to tear down someone once he has taken up the position as ACNC Commissioner is I think one of the more disappointing positions these Labor MPs have taken. Sure, we can all dig through the comments someone has previously made; but, honestly, in a world of political poodles it is time someone spoke straight and said what they think. I admire Gary Johns for that, though I might not always agree with him; but he is now doing a very important job and all evidence points to him doing it with assiduous attention to detail. Indeed, that is precisely what he is commissioned to do. His job is to identify not-for-profits that have drifted away from their commission. It is an incredibly tiny number. There are 54,000 charities and only a dozen or two have drifted so far that, for reasons of misconduct or mismanagement, they have had to lose their status.


Let no-one on either side forget that this gift of deductibility is from the Australian people, not from government. The gift of being able to raise money and not pay tax allows these entities to devote and invest more in what they're commissioned to do. Everyone supports that. All the people listening around Australia just want not-for-profits to get on with doing what their bread and butter business is. There is no disagreement there.


Where there is this frisson of disagreement coming from the other side is the suggestion that stopping foreign money coming in and being involved in party politics is actually tying the hand of not-for-profits or stifling them. The government can't agree with that at all. I thought the contribution from the Labor MP who spoke just before me was a reasonably balanced assessment of that. She conceded that some of these third party entities are actually fighting the Labor Party. I know traditionally we have seen the very large developed ones fighting the right of centre, but she conceded that we do need a higher level of scrutiny for these entities. Let's go through it step by step. They take the gift of tax deductibility from the Australian government, and they take that money and engage not in their core business but in party-political activity. First of all, that activates the electoral laws on domestic donations, which rightly it should. But if it's coming from overseas—I seem to recall it was the Labor Party that was most vocal about stopping this foreign money from 'pouring in'. Labor were very concerned about fat cats coming in and influencing local elections. So here we have a simple manifestation of stopping it but, all of a sudden, Labor have just seen a spark of political opportunism where they can, firstly, take down Gary Johns and then, secondly, scare all 54,000 charities that can't bear to say a word in case they get shut down!


This is such a distortion of the truth. Let's go right back to the simple facts. Nothing stops not-for-profits from advocating for their stated causes, the things for which they were commissioned to do. The bill allows them to continue to take foreign donations even, so long as they are not involved in political activity. There is no better party-political example than GetUp!. I love the word 'temerity'. They had the temerity to turn up to the Queensland election and fight against Adani. Did they turn up to fight against the Labor government that approved Adani? No, they didn't. They turned up in Queensland and they held out a piece of paper that said, 'Malcolm Turnbull, through the NAIF, is considering funding a rail line that runs to Adani, so please vote for the Labor Party'—please vote for the Labor Party, which approved Adani, because we hate so much a Prime Minister who was contemplating giving a loan, paid back with interest, to build rail infrastructure for this great nation! It would have been a concessional loan with interest. The interest rate on a concessional loan is slightly lower than the market interest rate, so it is every dollar, and interest, paid back to the Australian people for the first time ever to build rail infrastructure in this country using private money. And they fought to the death to stop it. GetUp! was at every polling booth I could see, telling everyone, 'Please, hate Malcolm Turnbull and vote for the party that approved Adani.' It is this completely distorted thinking, this political involvement with overseas funding, that will stop this legislation. That it is why we support it.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (16:14):  I think we just heard the reason why the member for Bowman, a member of the government, wants this bill introduced. We just heard about the last state election. What happened in the Bowman electorate when this activism happened? The seat of Bowman returned Labor members of parliament; in fact, the LNP lost seats in the electorate of Bowman. We got the fantastic new member for Redlands, Kim Richards.


So what does the LNP do? I'll put it like this. It is as if, in the PM's office, the Young Liberal apparatchiks who were sitting around, dreaming that when they got the brief they would do something in a constructive way about political donations to stop overseas donations, said: 'I know what we're going to do. We're going to get charities at the same time. We're going to roll that in. We're sick and tired of those Knitting Nannas. We're sick and tired of those people protesting outside the foreign minister's office demanding that foreign aid be increased and making demands on all those issues. We're sick and tired of walking around in the community and being criticised for our policies. You know what we're going to try and do? We're going to try and shut down the dissent. We're going to shut down the dissent!' And that's exactly what this bill and this government want to do.


You would think they were the party of freedom of speech, the party that demand that we enable freedom of speech, but what do they do when this legislation comes in? They shut down freedom of speech. But we know that those opposite—and we saw it today in this debate, talking about everything, talking about tax giveaways, talking about multinationals handouts—are not interested in the charity sector. If they were, they would not be introducing this sort of legislation, and they would be supporting the over 50,000 charities to have a voice and to speak out on behalf of the tens of thousands of members that they represent. But not the modern Liberal Party. Not the party of Menzies. This is an extreme right-wing, conservative agenda that we're seeing time in and time out, and this is the latest attack, through the charitable sector in Australia.


But I want to get to my other interest. We're seeing a collapse: the red tape that this government wants to introduce around charities. For those government members who are here, when you go back to your electorates, do a poll in your electorate for those people who donate to World Vision. Do a poll of those hardworking men and women who donate $4.80 a week to the charity of their choice—they may be sponsoring a child overseas. Your legislation, your changes that you're demanding that the Australian people support, will mean that the very people who donate $4.80 a week to World Vision will have to do paperwork of a declaration and have a JP or police officer sign that form each year. That's just for those people who want to donate to World Vision. That's what your legislation will deliver: an attack on free speech by those charities speaking out and criticising your government, and an increase in red tape.


The extreme Right has been speaking today in this debate. I want to ask them: what's changed that you're delivering this to the Australian charities sector and delivering the new commissioner, Gary Johns? There's only one answer to that. You want to stop freedom of speech and the attacks on your government. We see it time and time again. This is the quote from the new Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commissioner, Gary Johns. He said: 'There is a great deal of impure altruism in the charity business. On the donor side, there is some self-regard and some agenda chasing. On the charity side, there is agenda pushing and organisation enhancement. No set of rules could hope to create a clean market of pure motives and perfect outcomes.' That is the person that you want overseeing the charity sector. That quote says it all.


Well, I'm here to defend the charities in my electorate, those hardworking men and women who give up their time, selflessly delivering for the communities and for those right across the country. I know that, for the thousands of hours that people give up to volunteer their hard-earned time and money, they deserve much better than an attack on their organisations.


Gary Johns's appointment signals a major escalation in this government's war on charities. It shows that this government is beholden to the far Right of its party. There's absolutely no denying it. I thank the member for Fenner for putting this in the public arena, because the public deserve to know what the government wants to do to the charity sector. You can hide behind your words all you want; the charity sector and the thousands of people are on to you, and we will keep supporting them.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (16:19):  Thank you to the opposition for raising this important issue. I don't get enough time to talk about charities in this chamber. They fulfil a vital role in our society and in our communities, helping everyone when they need a hand. I work very closely with a large number of charities, both local and national, and I consider many of their staff and volunteers to be friends. I'd like to think that, if any of them were feeling undermined, they would tell me. I have nothing but praise for those who work or volunteer with charities. They are the most selfless, kind and caring members of our communities.


I am very proud to have some excellent local charities in Bennelong, and I'm privileged to work very closely with them. Helen Crouch and her team at North Ryde Community Aid & Information Centre are wonderful contributors to the Ryde area. Every year my office and I take part in packing and delivering their Christmas hampers; it's a highlight of the year. I'm very proud to say that this is an immovable fixture in my calendar—hell, high water and even a by-election won't keep me away! This year my sisters Annette and Susan joined me, and we had a great time.


Heather Pinto and her dedicated people at Christian Community Aid are just as vital to the residents of Eastwood and Epping. CCA helps with services ranging from transport to child care. Particularly impressive are the language-assistance classes and support they offer, helping the many people from Eastwood with English as a second language to access the vital services they need. There are many more local groups like these in our community, providing essential support for many locals. Sadly, I do not have time to mention them all; there are just too many generous people in the electorate.


But Bennelong is also home to many other charities that don't just focus on helping locals, but extend their services more widely across the state or country. Our Stronger Communities Program grants have provided thousands of dollars across our communities, and much of it has been directed towards charities. We're aiming to give $43,000 to local charities in our latest batch of grants. In the last three weeks, I've had the pleasure of informing Jo-Anne Reeves of Parkinson's NSW that the government will be providing $20,000 to refurbish their community meeting rooms. I've also been able to tell Epilepsy Australia that we'll be giving them $10,000 to upgrade their IT so that they can reach more people touched by epilepsy. And Glyn Henman and Llew Morris of Young Life Australia will be getting $3,500 to help them engage with more young people and help them find their way in the world. We're also home to the excellent YouthSafe, run by the inimitable Warren Johnson. This group arranges training for our young people on how to stay safe in their daily lives, especially on and around our roads. Our road toll is too high, especially at this time of the year, so any work done in this area deserves all our support.


I'm also a particular fan of the follically focussed charities. For many years I've sported a moustache for Movember, and just before my recent enforced absence from this place I had my head shaved by the students of North Ryde Public School for the Leukaemia Foundation. Just before the shave, I walked 100 kilometres around my electorate to raise money and awareness for this great cause, while this small school raised more than any other school. I had also previously done a similar walk, and raised nearly $10,000 for Motor Neurone Disease Australia.


My time is almost up, but I'd also like to drop the names of Tanya Hall from hearts4heart, and Christine Nolan from Breast Cancer Network Australia. Both of these groups are dedicated to helping people with heart and cancer conditions, and I have been delighted to welcome both of these charities to this House in the last year, aiming to get more support for these causes.


That's a quick run-down of 10 charities that we're not undermining, and if I had time I would love to go on and mention all of the selfless Bennelongians who are helping others in our community. Thank you everyone in Bennelong and across Australia who give time, money and support to a charity. The work you do is essential, and we can never thank you enough.

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (16:29):  I wanted to rise tonight here in this place to talk about an exceptional group of people and organisations that I honoured on Australia Day as part of the 14th annual Holt Australia Day awards 2018. We honoured 27 outstanding individuals and seven local organisations for their contribution to the community at the 10th annual Day of the Nations celebrations in Hampton Park, which was organised by the Hampton Park Progress Association and supported by the City of Casey. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the Holt Australia Day Awards Committee, which consisted of Chris Drysdale, Judy Owen, Leanne Petridis, Mladen Krsman and Ron Webb, for selecting the award recipients.


Australia Day, in my view, is a day where we can honour those that really do make this country a great place. When people ask me what it is to be an Australian, my first thought is that we live in a place of such breathtaking beauty and diversity, of arid deserts, of mountain ranges, of tropical forests and amazing coastline. I lived on the edge of the desert as a young man in Kalgoorlie for some seven years. Apart from the physical characteristics of Australia, what I think makes the country great is the characteristics of its people. I really do believe that we are an egalitarian country, committed to equality of opportunity and accepting all of those who come to this boundless country, asking only that these people share our values of tolerance, diversity and respect for community, its institutions and the rule of law. You could really say that citizens of this country are truly equal in the eyes of God, regardless of race, regardless of colour and regardless of beliefs. On that Day of the Nations on Australia Day, we celebrated those who I thought truly encapsulated what it means to be an Australian—those who believe in sacrifice, those who believe it is their duty to make a contribution for the better of the wider community.


We awarded some very exceptional people the Australia Day award. If I can read quickly into the record those whom we honoured: Aaron Grant, Carol Bosward and Sandra Rotunno, Casey Garba, Christopher Klepacz, Pastor Decal Nono, Ellie Blackburn, Elyse Cumine, Heather Triffett, Hispana Ventana—Spanish Window—Jean-Marie Jean-Pierre, John Cooper, John Foy, Josh and Eden Carell, Julie Cini, Karen Alsop, Pastor Keith Vethaak, Pastor Kerrigan La-Brooy, Lyn and Barry Leeds, Mary-Ann Spencer, the National Servicemen's Association of Australia South East Sub Branch, Pastor Phil and Pastor Norma Cayzer, Cranbourne-Narre Warren Relay for Life, Ruth Croft, South East Melbourne Vietnamese Associations Council, Southern Masters Cycling Club, Star News Group, Sue Owen, Tammie McKill, Tareq Bakhtani and Zoe Panagiotopoulos.


Those names I've read into the parliamentary record are names of people and organisations that didn't seek the limelight for the work that they did to make their community a better place. I think that is one of the other truly defining characteristics of the Australian character. Those who pull together for the common good, those who sacrifice for their community—even some of the recipients who fed the homeless out of their own funds, who decided to be a role model in what they chose to do so—didn't do this in a way that sought publicity; they did it in a quiet, quintessentially Australian, understated way. 


When we have a discussion about what it means to be an Australian, Australia Day is a good time to celebrate those people. You would notice I read a number of names of people that came from all walks of life and all corners of the globe. I really do believe that the diversity of this country is the strength of this country and that, as I said to those that attended the Australia Day awards honouring their achievements, this country's best days are yet to come, and having people like these will ensure that this country reaches its great future.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (10:00):  The growing crisis in aged care is a disgrace, and we must speak out and not accept this as okay. The latest figures that I've seen reveal that more than 100,000 Australians are now languishing in limbo, waiting for home care packages so they can get appropriate care. There are more than 60,000 senior Australians now with no package at all—nothing; zip. More than 40,000 have a package at a lower level than they actually need. This includes nearly 80,000 older Australians waiting with higher needs, many with dementia.


Numerous people in my electorate in recent months have been stuck at home with no care. Their families are now coming to our offices in despair and in distress. In light of this, what did the minister responsible for this crisis, this calamity, suggest that people do? He said, 'Even if, after you've waited a year, the government hasn't properly assessed your circumstances and you get an offer below what you actually need, then just take what you can get'—take what you can get. He said, 'I would encourage people on waiting lists that, whatever level you're offered, you should just take that offer'—like it or leave it.


The government have known about this problem for over a year and have done nothing. It has just crept up on them, with no action. The minister's a decent man—he is—but he's not up to the job, and he's just repeating now the government's nonsense. When asked about this, he said, 'Well, senior Australians can't be cared for because of budgetary pressures and fiscal constraints.' Yet this is a member of a government who voted to give himself a tax cut, to give the high-income earners of Australia a tax cut, and now he's voted to give a $65 billion handout to big business, for negligible benefits to the economy—maybe one per cent economic growth in 20 years. It is an old trick, isn't it—tax cuts for the rich and multinationals, while you cut services and raise taxes on poor and working people. It's not good enough.


Even worse, there's no plan. There's no end in sight for the backlog. And the waiting list, the government has said, will just continue to grow. The Turnbull government's own website states that the most vulnerable Australians will be waiting, now, more than one year for a package. It's shocking that this crisis has been worsening for months and yet the government has done nothing.


The government could have made a genuine financial commitment in the midyear budget update. They could have done that. Instead, they've done nothing. They've buried their heads in the sand, despite Labor's calls for over a year to address the problem.


It is incredibly distressing for people in my community. One of the most distressing things I do—I'm sure it is a distressing thing that other members do—is to talk to families with no hope in sight. The uncertainty surrounding the lack of a plan makes it impossible for families to even plan for the care of senior Australians while they wait, and wait.


The mess can't be fixed overnight, but the government needs to find the funding and announce a plan and a timetable so that families at least know what to do. It comes on top, of course, of its complete lack of response to the revelations last year in the residential aged-care sector, which—while state and territory governments are responsible for this regulation—also needs a national approach.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (11:17):  I rise to pay my respects following the passing of Ronald Joseph Walker AC, CBE, otherwise known as Mr Melbourne, a man who was celebrated in life and will be mourned in death, a friend to many and somebody who was deeply committed to his local community, to his state and to the betterment of those who were less fortunate than him. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their three children, Joanna, Campbell and Candice. We send our warmest wishes at this difficult time.


Ron Walker was, in a way, bigger than life. I was fortunate to know him and talk to him regularly about the Liberal Party and, during his battle with cancer, about the listing of the drug which prolonged his life beyond what many thought. He was always passionate about the causes he supported. He thought deeply and he was brave. In terms of his record, as a businessman, as a party official and as a proponent of Melbourne in attracting events to our city and our state, he had very few equals. He was elected to the Melbourne City Council, aged 30, in 1969. He was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1974 to 1976. He was the Liberal Party's honorary national treasurer, which the Prime Minister has described as the most challenging job in politics, having himself held that role. Ron fulfilled that responsibility between 1987 and 2002. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his service to local government, and the citation for his Companion of the Order of Australia read:


For service to business, the arts and the community, and to raising the profile of Australia internationally with significant benefit for tourism and employment.


His success in attracting the Grand Prix to Melbourne and other major sporting events and his ability to reach across the political aisle to the new Premier of Victoria at the time, Steve Bracks, showed that he wasn't deeply partisan when the interests of his community demanded a different approach. We pay tribute to his vision for Melbourne and to his philanthropic activities, which were far and wide, many of which are not known more broadly, for that is the way Ron wanted it. And we thank him for what he did for Melbourne, what he did for the Liberal Party and what he did for the country. May he rest in peace and be remembered fondly for all that he achieved.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (11:21):  It's a melancholy duty to speak on condolence in relation to a hero of our country, a hero of Melbourne, a hero of the Liberal Party and a hero of so many communities. Of course, I'm speaking about Ronald Joseph Walker AC CBE—or 'Big Ron', or Ron Walker, as he was more commonly known. I will say firstly to Ron Walker's wife, Barbara, and their three children and three grandchildren that we send our warmest wishes and thoughts at this obviously difficult time. And I say it's melancholy because, on one hand, as a city—Melbourne—and as a country we mourn the loss of such a great man as Ron. But we inevitably—and I think it's important that we do—rejoice in his life and see it as an example for all of us to try to emulate. The truth is that very few of us will be able, in any way, shape or form, to emulate what Ron Walker was able to do. And I refer to the contribution of my good friend the member for Kooyong, who outlined so many of the achievements of Ron Walker. I think each of them can be marked by service to others—service to our community, service to our city and, of course, service to our country more broadly.


Ron was a giant of Melbourne, literally and figuratively. He resurrected the city that was unflatteringly known as 'moribund Melbourne' in the early nineties, in the dark days of the recession. He played a role in delivering so many of the institutions that people like me, who grew up in Melbourne in the eighties, take for granted and that so many Melbournians, thankfully, take for granted as just being the fabric of our culture. He chaired the Victorian Major Events Company. He secured the hosting rights for the Grand Prix—and I will say how important that was, as a young man growing up in Melbourne, for our sense of identity and for the re-emergence of Melbourne and the re-emergence of Victoria in a very figurative way. It gave us a sense of confidence. For those of us who remember very fondly the Kennett years, when our numberplates said, 'Victoria—on the move', Ron Walker and the work that he did through the Victorian Major Events Company embodied that and absolutely gave us that sense of confidence and pride. We are very parochial and proud as Victorians and Melbournians, and Ron Walker gave us so much to be proud of.


He was truly a stalwart in business and politics, serving as lord mayor in the seventies, and he dedicated his very scarce spare time to the Liberal Party and our causes. He was a man who embodied our values: entrepreneurship, hard work, aspiration, pulling yourself up from your own bootstraps, doing it yourself. Ron was someone from humble beginnings who achieved so much. He embodied what we stand for, and it was a great honour for our party to have somebody of his status and stature support so many members of parliament and support our Liberal cause more broadly.


This was a man who served his community in countless ways. Towards the end of his life, his generous philanthropy and work for causes such as access to life-saving and life-extending medicines came to the fore. No doubt, Ron Walker had engaged in philanthropy in those ways throughout his adult life, but he gained greater notoriety and greater public acclaim, particularly for the work that he did campaigning to get the drug Keytruda added to the PBS. There will be countless Australians who benefit from that campaign whom you can add to the list of countless Australians who, in some way, shape or form, benefitted from Ron Walker's life, benefitted from the work that he did on behalf of others. I, therefore, again, extend my deep condolences to Barbara Walker, their three children and three grandchildren, and thank them for supporting Ron to enable him to make a difference to the lives of so many. We've lost a true giant of our country, of Melbourne and of the Liberal Party. May he rest in peace. God rest his soul.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (11:27):  I rise to join my colleagues in acknowledging the life and work and achievements of Ronald Joseph Walker, to join with the many who, over the past few days since his death, have provided wonderful accolades of his service to the community, and to extend my condolences to his widow, Barbara, and members of the Walker family. In the many accolades that have been given about Ron Walker, both in this place and elsewhere in the last few days, there obviously has been great emphasis on his service to the community, particularly in Melbourne—to his work, firstly, as a successful businessman, his term as Lord Mayor of Melbourne and, more significantly, his chairing of the major events activities in Melbourne, including the Commonwealth Games and the Grand Prix, and then subsequent charitable work, particularly for others less fortunate than himself.


It's just one other, I suppose, in the life of Ron Walker, relative minor episode that I want to remark upon today which goes to the character of the man. It relates to a small country town in the north-east of Victoria named Walwa. Walwa is hundreds of kilometres from any major centre. It's on the Murray River, in the valley there—a beautiful spot in north-eastern Victoria between Albury to the west and Towong and the Snowy Mountains to the east. There had been, and indeed still is, a country bush nursing hospital at Walwa for many decades.


Walwa's a small town. At the 2006 census, the population was listed, I think, as 268. There are undoubtedly more people in the surrounding farming areas, but you get the sense of a remote community in this beautiful part of Victoria. There'd been a local doctor as well as the bush nursing hospital at Walwa for more than 20 years. But, due to funding constraints, there was a question about whether or not that hospital could continue to operate. Indeed, in about 1998-99, there was a real crisis in terms of the continuation of services in the community. 


I remember one day, when I was the Minister for Ageing in about 2001 or 2002, getting a phone call from Ron Walker asking, 'Can't we do something about keeping this hospital open in Walwa?' Why was he interested? It was because there had been a story in the Herald Sun in Melbourne highlighting the plight of people in this remote community if they were to lose their doctor, which they'd had for many decades, and, indeed, if they were to lose their hospital. He said that he would do whatever he could to ensure that this hospital remained open. I think it was at the urging of his wife, Barbara, to do something for the locals there, not that he had any particular connection with them. He was urging me as the minister from the Commonwealth level to try to do something with the states as well. To cut a long story short, Ron Walker pledged $150,000 for the maintenance of this hospital, a pledge which he subsequently renewed some years later. In many ways, he was the saviour of the Walwa bush nursing hospital, so much so that by 2006, through a period of development, what came out of that was a medical centre, an accident and emergency 24-hour response centre and, in addition to that, independent living units that in effect brought together hospital and aged care. His frustration in conversations I had with him at the time was that, if the states and the Commonwealth could only get together, we could provide these services rather than having a division between the two. Through his championing of this through his personal financial contributions and his continued interest, the people of Walwa in north-eastern Victoria today continue to have medical and aged-care services that otherwise they wouldn't have. That would mean for them, for the farmers and for the townspeople in Walwa a journey of an hour or an hour and a half at least to a major centre such as Albury or further afield to get those services.


As I said, this small episode in a wonderful life is an indication of the character of a man who saw a problem in a remote rural town and decided that he could do something about it not just in his contribution of finances to the continuation of the hospital but by getting on the phone to the likes of me and the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, to see what we could do and, by working with us, come up with a solution.


The other thing that is said about Ron Walker is that, even though he was a lifetime Liberal and a great contributor to the Liberal Party, not just financially but in other ways as well, he nonetheless had an ability to work with people on all sides of politics. He did that when he was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, he did that through the major events and developments in Melbourne and he did it in a lot of other ways. He did it by bringing people together and heading towards a goal, less concerned about the political differences than achieving the goal. He was able to achieve a huge amount for Melbourne, for Victoria and for many ordinary people. We stand in his debt. I extend my condolences once again to his wife, Barbara, and to members of his family. May he rest in peace.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11:33):  I join with my colleagues, both on this side of the chamber and opposite, to pay tribute to Ron Walker, a great Australian, a great Melburnian and a well-loved constituent in my electorate of Higgins. He was a man who achieved so very much in his more than 50 years of public life. The fact that people flocked from all over Melbourne and across the nation to be at Ron's state funeral speaks volumes about his contribution and lasting legacy. Despite his deep affiliation with the Liberal Party, people from both sides of politics and from all walks of life came to pay their respects.


He was a man of extraordinary vision and was renowned for his determination, capacity for hard work and commitment to public service. As Ron's lovely son, Cam, said of his dad this week, 'If someone said it could not be done, he worked even harder to make sure that he succeeded.' I think there is a lesson in that for all of us here in this place.


Ron's contribution to Melbourne and Victoria is the stuff of legend. Ron was not known as Mr Melbourne for nothing. So many have said so much about his contribution, but I want to highlight a couple of things. Matthew Guy has said that Ron was the greatest premier that Victoria never had, and I think it is an apt description. There is no doubt that his work helped Melbourne become the modern capital that we all know and love. Following Ron's passing, his partner at Hudson Conway, Lloyd Williams, was quoted as saying, 'I don't think there is anyone who has done more for the City of Melbourne for 200 years.' As we know, in the 1960s and 1970s, Ron served as a councillor of the City of Melbourne, followed by a stint as Lord Mayor. He very famously brought the Formula 1 Grand Prix to Melbourne in the 1990s. Whether you loved it or loathed it, there is no doubt that it was more than just about motor racing; it was about putting Melbourne on the map, promoting this great city, our great city, to the world. As the chairman of the Melbourne major events corporation, Ron was instrumental in bringing the Commonwealth Games to Melbourne. Under his stewardship Melbourne went on to host what is considered by some to be one of the best Commonwealth Games ever.


Notably, Ron made a significant contribution to public health. In 1990, his wife, Barbara, suffered chronic pain after a breast cancer operation. After a long search across the globe for a cure to her pain, Barbara eventually entered the ADAPT course. Ron and Barbara were so impressed with this treatment program that they founded the Barbara Walker Centre for Pain Management at St Vincent's Hospital to give others the same treatment that she had received. In 2012, after being diagnosed with cancer, Ron took part in a trial of a breakthrough drug, KEYTRUDA. Less than two years later, Ron was cancer free. Oncologist Grant McArthur treated Ron's melanoma. This week Grant wrote that he quickly learned that during his appointments Ron would want to focus on the latest research developments in the field before moving on to discuss how other patients could get access to the same treatment. For Ron Walker it was not just a personal journey, but a mission on behalf of his fellow Australians. As Grant put it, Ron was simply relentless in his pursuit of opportunities for good health for all Australians with cancer. As we know, Ron then, happily for everyone, successfully lobbied the Federal Government to ensure that KEYTRUDA was added to the PBS, making it available to the general public at an affordable price and saving so many lives.


Ron was renowned for his generosity, but he was also very humble. Reports since his passing suggest that Ron's true contribution to philanthropic causes will never really be known. Such was his humility that he would often make anonymous donations to support people in need.


Of course Ron was a giant of the Liberal Party. For many years he served as the party's honorary federal treasurer, and he was an immense fundraiser. He has been someone that Liberal Prime Ministers, Premiers and ministers have frequently turned to for advice over a period of many years. On a personal note, I can say that he was exceptionally kind to me in both my local and ministerial capacities. His unswerving commitment to our party has been nothing but colossal. My deepest and sincerest condolences to Ron's family, including his wife Barbara and his adult children, Campbell, Jo and Candice, and their children. We share your sense of loss, but I know that his proudest achievement is his family. There is no doubt that Ron Walker will forever be remembered for his contribution to our great city, our state and our country. His legacy will live on. Vale Ron Walker.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:39):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to reflect on the life of a giant of the great state of Victoria and of Melbourne, Ron Walker. The truth is that I didn't know Ron Walker that well. He was one of those people that I knew from a distance, as a child growing up in the 1990s watching the state of Victoria enter into new energy and dynamism after the period before. Ron Walker was one of those people that, as a young child, I watched on television, watched in newspapers and read about as a giant of the state who was doing amazing things in helping to revitalise our great city. Of course, there was nothing that embodied the revitalisation for many people, particularly somebody as young as myself, so much as the symbolism of the Grand Prix, which made itself to Melbourne courtesy of Ron Walker efforts and the efforts of many others. In fact, that became the symbol not just for the revitalisation of a city but for the people and the energy that came with it, and you can never take that legacy away from him. He was the champion of that cause and was tasked with getting the Australian F1 Grand Prix away from Adelaide in the mid-1990s. He served as chairman of the Australian Grand Prix for nearly 20 years and leaves behind an incredible legacy, where it continues to operate today. But the legacy isn't just of the event; it is of the spirit.


It was only later in my life that I started to learn a bit more about Ron Walker and his contribution to the rebuilding of Victoria. He was part of, shall we say, a group of people at the time who seized the opportunity to turn a rust-bucket state into a shining jewel that continues to guide this great nation, and that is part of his legacy. That's why Jeff Kennett said recently that, without Ron Walker, Melbourne—and Victoria—would not be what it is today, and I wholeheartedly share those sentiments.


But it was only later in life that I really came to terms with the full legacy of Ron Walker and what he has done for our great state. He was elected the Lord Mayor of Melbourne City Council from 1974 to 76, having served on the council since 1969. During that time, he was named as Victoria's Outstanding Man of the Year during his lord mayoral term, as well as Victorian Father of the Year in 1976, Victorian of the Year in 1994 and many other incredible honours.


He, of course, also had a highly successful career in sports administration, which began off the back of a successful business career. He even led Melbourne's bid to host the Olympic Games in 1996. But, when it comes down to it, he was a family man, and that becomes clear as you listen to and hear the eulogies and read many of the things that have been said since his passing. And it's that spirit that I want to acknowledge, and I pay my condolences to his wife, Barbara, and his children for their sad loss. But having grown up with Ron Walker as a pre-eminent figure in Victoria and Melbourne throughout my childhood, as I got towards the latter stages of my life—or the present stages of my life today—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr TIM WILSON:
  I know, I'm still fit and healthy!—I actually did get to meet Ron Walker a couple of times. It was in the mornings as he did his regular routine of walking around the botanical gardens track, the Tan, and anybody who has lived in and around the south Yarra area will know that the Tan is incredibly popular with the community, particularly for residents in nearby areas, as a part of an ordinary morning fitness routine. Ron fulfilled his surname by being one of the most regular walkers who covered the Tan most mornings—although I do remember the gaps and absences when he was getting treatment and care because of his health conditions.


So, to Ron: I remember you as a man who made a great contribution to the state of Victoria, a man who made incredible contributions not just to our state, not just to our city, but, of course, to our nation—somebody whose life will barely be replicated by others, because the task ahead of him and what he achieved was so great. But what I will always remember you as is a man who walked in the mornings around the Tan with humility and purpose, and now you walk into the sunset.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (11:44):  I rise to express my condolences upon the passing of Ron Walker AC CBE. I first met Ron Walker when I was a young journalist with Channel 7 news in the 1980s, during the days of Hudson Conway when Crown Casino was under construction. He was a giant of Victoria then. He saw in this particular project a project which would transform Melbourne, and that's exactly what has happened. I recall that Lloyd Williams, his great friend and partner in the project, took me on a tour when Crown Casino was under construction. I walked into the main foyer and said, 'I'm a bit worried about the design. There are no windows.' Lloyd said, 'That's the whole idea, Sarah.' They were transformational days.


As we've heard in this debate today, Ron Walker was a giant of Victoria. He chaired the Victorian Major Events Corporation. He secured the Grand Prix for Victoria, which was monumental at the time. He served as the chairman of the Grand Prix Corporation. He was the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, and in 1988 he was appointed as a commissioner for Melbourne's 1996 Olympics bid. He worked very closely with former Premier Jeff Kennett. They had a wonderful friendship and they had a great vision for Victoria, and together they achieved great things. The mark of the man was that Ron Walker also worked very closely, and with a great sense of bipartisanship, with former premiers Joan Kirner and Steve Bracks in particular. As chairman of the Melbourne Major Events Company, which managed the bids for both the Grand Prix and the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Ron Walker made a lasting impression on Melbourne and, of course, on Victoria.


He was an extraordinary man, but, as we've heard in this debate, much of his contribution to Melbourne and to Victoria was through his philanthropic contributions and, in the more recent years, his contributions to cancer research. Once Ron Walker determined he was going to do something, he certainly did it. He made an extraordinary contribution to the Liberal Party of Australia and he was a great mentor to many members of the Liberal Party. I didn't have so much to do with Ron when I entered politics, but my mother was a minister and the member for Geelong in the 1990s and worked with Jeff Kennett, and she worked very closely with Ron Walker. He made an impression upon me as a young journalist in the 1980s and he's still making an impression with his legacy. He left such a mark on Melbourne and on Victoria. He was a visionary and, for that, he is to be forever commended for the incredible work that he did for our state.


I wish to express my sincere condolences to his beloved wife, Barbara, and his children, his grandchildren and his other family members. May he rest in peace.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:48):  As the shadow assistant minister for cybersecurity and defence, I welcome the proposed amendments to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The amendments will address legislative inconsistencies in areas relating to mutual assistance, proceeds of crime and extradition—all issues that will be faced with the international characteristics of the types of crime I see emerging in the cybersecurity portfolio. The bill also proposes amendments in a number of areas that Labor has a very strong track record on: international crime cooperation, support for vulnerable witnesses, slavery, forced labour and forced marriage, anti-money-laundering and federal policing.


While the amendments are welcome, there are also emerging crimes that will pose challenges to our legal frameworks, both domestically and internationally. These are in the areas of cybersecurity and also in the increased focus and increased exposure of sexual violence in conflict as a war crime under the United Nations women, peace and security agenda. The technical amendments in this bill highlight the increased prevalence of technology and its use in both the commission of crime and, on the flipside, the monitoring, surveillance and prosecution of crime. Amendments align the existing provisions under the mutual assistance act and the telecommunications interception act, authorising the sharing of information with foreign countries, with the International Criminal Court Act. The type of material that may be shared with the International Criminal Court could be stored communications, historical telecommunications data, prospective telecommunications data and surveillance assistance. As the shadow minister I welcome the changes, because cybercrime activities—in all their forms, from cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism and cyberespionage through to child pornography and exploitation, ransomware, phishing and spear phishing—in this global world, through the internet, are cross jurisdictional activities.


There is no doubt that there will need to be greater focus on what international cooperation will look like when it comes to prosecuting people and organisations for these crimes, some of which are new or emerging types of crime that present a challenge to our traditional legal procedures, precedents and frameworks. Not only will it be a telling exercise for the preparedness and responsiveness of countries, when it comes to their cybersecurity frameworks, but also for the cooperation between governments in terms of data and the compulsion to release it. While a cooperative and collaborative relationship exists between government and corporations in Australia's e-safety regime, we need to constantly look at how we can further enhance our cooperation in these areas at the international level. It will be an interesting test to see how much of these frameworks will emerge in an international environment, when it has been difficult to establish regulatory norms for cybersecurity. Fortunately, this is still the Holy Grail that we're trying to establish. We have the Tallinn manual that outlines the range of international law that applies to the cybersecurity space. The UN GGE has been unable to meet agreement on cybersecurity norms and how the norms should operate in cyberspace. Without that sort of multilateral framework, we are now faced with having to try and get those norms established at a bilateral, quadrilateral or regional level.


I note we have the minister here. In the absence of those UN GGE multilateral norms, that usual UN framework that governs so much—the sea, telecommunications and so many international regulations and norms—we do need to focus our efforts. Given the absence of the UN reaching resolution on what we're going to be doing on cyberspace and cyber norms, we do need to be acting very aggressively, because this is changing rapidly. So we need to very aggressively, with a sense of urgency, engage in mechanisms, in architecture, at the regional, bilateral and quadrilateral level to establish and agree on those norms, and to use existing architecture, possibly through ASEAN and APEC, through the Indian Ocean Commission, through the Pacific Island Forum—to use the existing architecture that we have. Given the urgency on this there's no need to reinvent the wheel in terms of cybersecurity architecture; so we need to use the existing multilateral regional architecture that we have to drive resolution on agreed norms.


Without that UN framework, we have a significant gap. Yes, there is a lot of discussion at the G20s and at the APECs and through the communiques that come out of those multilateral regional events. There is a lot of agreement on what should be done, but what we really need to do is agree those norms. It is vital that we get everyone singing from the same song sheet in terms of how we're going to govern and agree to our behaviours in the cybersecurity space.


It's a perfect opportunity, now that the minister has walked in, to urge him to act. He's got his ambassador there; you've got people down in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade busily working on this. Please, we need to get those norms established. Ideally it would be at that multilateral UN level, but—given that we haven't been able to achieve that, despite a lot of concerted effort over many years—I do implore the minister to see what we can do in terms of agreeing norms amongst the Five Eyes community, quadrilaterals and regionals and using the existing architecture that I mentioned before.


I was also keen to talk about this piece of legislation and the amendments because of another area that I'm concerned about, and that I have been advocating on very strongly, which is sexual violence in conflict and the prosecution of those who participate in sexual violence in conflict. It's an important issue that I have been working on with the Women, Peace and Security community—the women in that community—and the Prosecute Don't Perpetrate community, because we know that Daesh has used sexual violence as a tactic of war. Sexual violence is a war crime, and we should treat it as such. The occurrence of systematic rape is well documented in Iraq and Syria. It is a crime against humanity, it is a crime again women, and we should treat it as such.


We should be speaking about sexual violence in conflict—which is what I'm speaking about here—and sexual violence more generally, and we should be holding the perpetrators to account no matter where they are. This is why I'm a strong advocate for and a strong participant in the Prosecute Don't Perpetrate campaign—to get those foreign fighters back here and get them prosecuted under sexual-violence-in-conflict legislation and norms. Over 100 Australians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with Daesh and other extremist groups. We need to investigate and prosecute the sexual violence they've perpetrated as war crimes, as crimes against humanity, for these are all crimes under Australian domestic law. The amendments to this bill don't cover off this issue, but, in terms of providing material to the United Nations, they do cover off issues to do with the International Criminal Court. Again, I'm putting it out there that we need to prosecute those who have committed sexual violence in conflict.


It's difficult. I'm the first to admit that it's difficult—as we see from looking at the history of prosecution of sexual violence in conflict over the years, such as the rape camps that happened in the Second World War in Eastern Europe. There have been a number of instances where sexual violence has been used as a tactic of war, as a tactic of terrorism, as a tactic of genocide, and it is very, very difficult to prosecute those crimes. It requires a great deal of bravery from the witnesses. Most importantly, it's very difficult to get the evidence, particularly when you're in a conflict environment. Who collects the evidence? If a witness is brave enough to come forward, then who actually collects that evidence? Is it a soldier in the field? Is it someone who is there working on the post-conflict transition? Who collects that information? Is it a civilian working in this space in a conflict environment? That's the real challenge. Not only do we need a sense of urgency and real will to prosecute these crimes—and those are there—but getting the evidence is the real challenge. So we need to set up frameworks, systems, guidelines and procedures so that we can collect the evidence and bring these crimes to the courts.


I know that armies and defence forces around the world have been examining a range of different mechanisms to get that evidence collected. I encourage the Australian authorities on this. I know we have a very active community through the Australian Defence Force, and also, in New York, we have a very active military community which is working on the Women, Peace Security agenda. But we do need to constantly look at the mechanisms through which we can get the evidence. That's the real challenge—how to get the evidence in a conflict environment.


One of Labor's core values is a fundamental belief that everyone should have access to justice, no matter what their postcode, no matter how much their parents earn, no matter what their background, no matter what their race or religion, and that includes providing adequate support for vulnerable witnesses. This bill corrects an anomaly introduced back in 2013 and extends the current offence of identifying a child witness or vulnerable adult complainant to the identification of a child complainant. The support and protection available for victims and witnesses in future criminal proceedings, regardless of when the alleged conduct occurred, is also clarified. This is a significant step in a number of ways. If we are to tackle abhorrent crimes like human trafficking and slavery, it is essential that vulnerable witnesses, like those women who are victims of sexual violence in conflict, be given protections and support in proceedings before the courts. In its submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, Anti-Slavery Australia said:


Victims and witnesses are often reluctant to give evidence, as they or their families may have been subjected to, or threatened with violence.


Providing support and protection for vulnerable witnesses and complainants is absolutely necessary in ensuring access to justice.


The government has stated that the purpose of the bill is to:


… enhance Australia's position globally in the fight against crime, making improvements to our international crime cooperation arrangements and our ability to assist international courts and tribunals.


The amendments in this bill go some way towards enhancing Australia's position, but, as I've mentioned, there will be ongoing and emerging challenges to Australia's position in the fight against crime. We need to act, not just speak out, against those perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict. We need to not just speak out against it; we need to actually start prosecuting, if we can. We need the evidence for that, and we need the guidelines and the frameworks to be able to collect that evidence.


There is also an emerging challenge, a constant daily challenge, to enhance our cybersecurity frameworks to not only prevent but to identify and prosecute cybercriminals wherever they may be. These amendments will go some way towards harmonising Australia's domestic laws with international laws. Labor supports the amendments in this bill.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (12:01):  I rise to commend the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 to the House. Labor has a strong record in many of the areas that are covered by this bill: the fight against slavery, anti-money-laundering measures and international crime cooperation.


I want to make a point about Australia's law enforcement agencies and the excellent international reputation that they have. I commend them for their high level of skill and say that this is a great source of pride for Australia. A good example of that is the international cooperation of the AFP with law enforcement of our closest regional neighbour, Indonesia. A report by ASPI written in March 2014 called A return on investment: The future of police cooperation between Australia and Indonesia mentions some of the broader benefits of such cooperation beyond just law enforcement. It says:


The benefits of past AFP-POLRI cooperation have been felt largely in the transactional dimension of crime fighting, but the police-to-police relationship benefits other government agencies and the broader bilateral relationship too. Benefits have also accrued to the community and businesses in both countries, and the police-to-police relationship has promoted Australian and Indonesian interests in Southeast Asia.


That quote encompasses the ripple effect of cooperation in law enforcement. It doesn't just impact the transactional dimension of international crime fighting but has effects into the communities as well.


Indeed, international and transnational crime in today's environment is not only much more extensive than it has been in the past; it's also much more complex because it's more fluid. To take the case of terrorism, for example, it's not unthinkable that an attack could be planned in one country and executed in another country using funds diverted from a third country with perpetrators from fourth or fifth countries. We've had examples of that in the past with international terrorist incidents and transnational terrorist incidents. In fact, the landscape of transnational and international crime is far more challenging in today's environment than it has been in the past. That is why it's essential that we continue to ensure that our police and law enforcement agencies are able to operate in an international context in ways which are not unnecessarily impeded by legislation or by processes.


Although this bill makes some relatively technical amendments to the various Commonwealth acts, these amendments actually have the capacity to make some real differences in facilitating international cooperation in practice. The bill will assist in the investigation and prosecution of people responsible for some of the most serious crimes under international law, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The member for Canberra, who spoke before me, spoke extensively to this part of the bill.


But the bill will also further ensure that vulnerable people, particularly children, are protected by extending the current provisions to make it illegal to identify child complainants. This is especially relevant to cases involving online child exploitation where such cases often involve victims who are not witnesses in a trial—that is, victims who are children and who are classed as complainants. In addition to that, many of the victims of human trafficking and slavery fear for their safety if they assist in an investigation and this can be, and often is, a challenge to successful prosecution. So extending the protections for victims will encourage and assist in these matters as well.


This bill addresses some of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in offences relating to slavery and it expands the definition of debt bondage so that it allies more closely with slavery-like offences. Anti-Slavery International describe debt bondage, also called bonded labour or debt slavery, as the most common form of modern slavery, even though it is one of the least known. Debt bondage is when a person is forced to work to pay off a debt and is conned into working for little or no pay, with no control over their debt. The money that they earn is taken off them to repay the debt, so they have to keep working in order to pay off the money that they borrowed. They also face coercion, violence and intimidation if they try to leave.


The main amendments under this schedule of the bill also expand the list of matters considered in determining whether a victim was coerced, threatened or deceived. These measures provide further protection for victims and, importantly, make our legislation more consistent with relevant international instruments. Debt bondage is most widespread in South Asian countries. I understand that the International Labour Organization estimates a minimum of 11.7 million in forced labour in the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of whom are in debt bondage. It's most common in areas such as agriculture, brick kilns, mines and factories.


I also note that an element in this schedule in the bill relates to forced marriage. I want to speak a little bit about that, because the bill will clarify the test for victims incapable of understanding the nature and effect of a marriage ceremony. I give heed to the many women's groups doing some very extraordinary work on the ground in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and India around forced marriage. Forced marriage is particularly disturbing when it also involves a child. But I would also like to see that the test include an element to prove that a victim was incapable of understanding the effect of a marriage ceremony, and that element would, hopefully, include cases where marriage ceremonies are performed in a language that the victim doesn't understand as well as without her consent. Sadly, this is happening way too often as young girls raised in Western countries, such as Australia or the UK, are taken overseas by their parents and married off to complete strangers without their knowledge. They have no idea what's going on in a language that they lack competency in. The marriage ceremony can be performed in Arabic or Urdu. Often these young girls are raised in Australia and their first language is English. They have little command of their parents' mother tongue. They are sent back to these countries where they are married off and partake in a marriage ceremony with very little knowledge of what's happening because they don't understand the language.


I commend any of these measures and anything that we can do to make it easier for us and the international community to assist victims of forced marriage, who may be too young to understand what's going on, who may have a disability or an impairment that prevents them from understanding what's going on, or who may not understand the significance of the ceremony that they are taking part in. They might not know that it's a marriage ceremony. They might not have been told that it's a marriage ceremony. If we are going to be serious about our commitment to improving the conditions of women and girls throughout the world, which I believe we are—and I believe we have a bipartisan approach to improving those conditions for women and girls—we need this kind of legislation.


I'd like to move on and talk about the anti-money-laundering provisions of the bill, because they provide the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission with direct access to AUSTRAC information around financial intelligence. This amendment will allow the ACNC to fulfil its due diligence before registering charities and not-for-profit organisations and to monitor registered organisations, which will help them to ensure that organisations are not being used in the commission of serious crimes, including terrorism, or for money-laundering purposes.


I'd like to finish by again paying heed to the great work that our police forces do in their international efforts. As many of you know, I am the wife of a former police officer, a man who has dedicated his life to law enforcement. I'm obviously very proud of my husband and the work that he has done in law enforcement. I'm also very proud of the work that his colleagues do and, indeed, the dedication and commitment that all of our law enforcement professionals have. I've also had the privilege of seeing firsthand the work that our Federal Police do in Pakistan and in other countries internationally in three key areas. Firstly, in the area of collaboration, they broker collaboration with international law enforcement agencies to drive investigations and support bilateral or multilateral cooperation. Secondly, they cooperate with them in the area of intelligence gathering, through the collection and exchange of criminal intelligence in support of international law enforcement efforts. Thirdly, in capacity building—which I think we are particularly proud of in this country—they enhance the capacity and the capability of international law enforcement agencies to combat transnational crime. I strongly support any measures that are going to help our law enforcement agencies and our law enforcement professionals continue to conduct this valuable work unfettered and do this work to the best of their capabilities. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity) (12:13):  I thank the honourable members for their valuable contributions to this debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016, which will make significant improvements to the Commonwealth's criminal justice system. I really appreciate the comments that have just been made and those by the member for Canberra a moment ago, particularly her comments on cybersecurity, where I think we can maintain a spirit of bipartisanship in dealing with what is a very serious, significant issue for Australia and Australians. The bill will strengthen Australia's international crime cooperation arrangements to ensure that we're in the best possible position to work with international partners to combat crime both here and abroad.


The amendments in the bill will ensure that Australia can respond effectively to requests for assistance from foreign countries and international bodies in accordance with our international obligations. The amendments will assist Australia to avoid becoming a safe haven for foreign proceeds of crime and also ensure that criminals can't evade justice by moving evidence across borders or fleeing jurisdictions, and I take the former speaker's point that increasingly fluid borders are a very serious issue in dealing with criminals. The bill introduces amendments to ensure vulnerable child complainants are afforded the same protections as adult complainants when giving evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. It amends the AFP's internal drug and alcohol testing regime and integrity framework to allow the AFP to maintain the integrity of its workforce and ensure it can enforce its zero-tolerance policy regarding illicit drug-taking. Amendments will authorise the commissioner to extend the date of resignation for appointees under investigation for serious misconduct or corruption, again reinforcing the integrity of the AFP workforce. It includes amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to provide additional flexibility to departing travellers reporting movements of physical currency and improve information-sharing between Commonwealth agencies. 


The bill includes minor consequential amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act to facilitate the use of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission as an alternative name for the Australian Crime Commission. It makes amendments to the AusCheck Act to enable AusCheck to conduct and coordinate background checks on individuals in relation to declared major national events. 


This bill will strengthen Australia's criminal justice framework, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that law enforcement and justice agencies are equipped with the necessary powers to fight crime at home and abroad. It will strengthen the government's ability to detect and address serious national security and other risks in relation to large-scale national events. It will enhance the Commonwealth's anti-human-trafficking and anti-slavery regime and the protections afforded to vulnerable witnesses within our criminal justice system.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has considered the bill and made recommendations for amendments, subject to which the committee recommends the bill be passed. The government has moved amendments that will implement the committee's recommendations. We also had consideration of this bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the government notes the Human Rights Committee's view on the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Extradition Act. We are committed to ensuring that Australia operates in a manner that is consistent with Australia's international law obligations, including international human rights obligations. I'd like to thank these committees for their consideration of the bill. I'd also like to assure the House that, consistent with these reports, the bill contains appropriate measures balanced by sensible and appropriate safeguards. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity) (12:18):  I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 and ask leave of the Federation Chamber to move government amendments (1) and (2), as circulated, together.


Leave granted.




Mr TAYLOR:
  I move government amendments (1) and (2), as circulated, together:


(1)   Schedule 8, item 15, page 111 (after line 28), after subsection 40P(2), insert:


   (3)   If the regulations make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating a matter contained in a standard as referred to in subsection (2), the Commissioner must ensure that the text of the matter applied, adopted or incorporated is readily available, free of charge, to each AFP appointee.


   (4)   Subsection (3) does not apply if the text cannot be made so available without infringing copyright.


(2)   Schedule 8, item 20, page 113 (lines 3 and 4), omit the item, substitute:


20  Subsections 30A(6) and (7)


Repeal the subsections, substitute:


   (6)   If one or more notices under subsection (2) have been given to the AFP employee in relation to the notice of resignation, the Commissioner may, by written notice to the AFP employee, substitute a day as the day on which his or her resignation is to take effect.


   (7)   The Commissioner may give a maximum of 2 notices under subsection (6) to the AFP employee in relation to the notice of resignation.


   (8)   To be effective, the first notice given under subsection (6) in relation to the notice of resignation must:


   (a)   specify a day no later than 30 days after the day specified in the most recent notice given under subsection (2) in relation to the notice of resignation; and


   (b)   be given to the AFP employee before the day specified in the most recent notice given under subsection (2) in relation to the notice of resignation.


   (9)   To be effective, any second notice given under subsection (6) in relation to the notice of resignation must:


   (a)   specify a day no later than 30 days after the day specified in the first notice given under subsection (6) in relation to the notice of resignation; and


   (b)   be given to the AFP employee before the day specified in the first notice given under subsection (6) in relation to the notice of resignation.


Note:   The effect of subsections (2) to (9) is that the latest day that may be specified in a notice given under this section is the day 150 days after the day specified in the notice of resignation.


   (10)   On or before the day specified in the most recent notice given under this section in relation to the notice of resignation, the Commissioner must:


   (a)   accept the AFP employee’s notice of resignation; or


   (b)   terminate the AFP employee’s employment under section 28.


   (11)   If the Commissioner accepts the notice of resignation under paragraph (10)(a), the AFP employee’s resignation takes effect on the day on which the Commissioner communicates acceptance of the resignation to the employee.


   (12)   The Commissioner must:


   (a)   cause a review of the operation of this section to be undertaken as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this subsection; and


   (b)   give the Minister a report of the review.


These amendments are to schedule 8 of the bill, which amends the Australian Federal Police Act. The government amendments are twofold. Firstly, there are amendments to the drug-testing provisions of the bill, which reflects a request made by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Secondly, there are amendments to the deferred resignation provisions of the bill, to address a concern raised by the Australian Federal Police Association, the AFPA, and by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. 


Briefly, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee recommended the government make an amendment to require the AFP commissioner to ensure the relevant standards for alcohol and drug testing. If those standards are incorporated into the regulations, they would be available to all AFP appointees. The government has agreed to this recommendation by the Senate committee. The amendments require the commissioner to make relevant standards freely available to AFP appointees, subject to any copyright infringement. In practice, the AFP actually already makes the relevant standards available to AFP appointees through the AFP intranet. But what this will do is ensure that all persons who are bound by the standards will be able to freely and readily access the standard that must be adhered to for alcohol and drug testing.


Now to the deferred-resignation amendments: the AFPA made a submission to the committee expressing strong opposition to the original proposal to extend the period to postpone resignation. The amendment would have provided the AFP commissioner with the power to postpone resignation for another 90 days on top of the original 90, for a total of 180. But, following very productive discussions between the AFPA and the AFP, mutually suitable amendments were agreed to, to address the concerns while still achieving the desired policy outcome. Indeed, the amendments that have just been put forward provide the commissioner with the power, in addition to the current maximum deferral of 90 days, to approve an extension to defer resignation for up to 30 days, and that's permissible on two occasions, which would allow a total possible postponement of 150 days.


The amendments also provide for the review of the operation of these new deferred resignation provisions as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of their commencement. The committee recommended that amendments to the same effect be made. The government's amendments therefore address the committee's concerns as well as the AFPA's. The government amendments strengthen the bill and reflect an appropriate balance between transparency and fairness and legitimate law enforcement integrity measures.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (12:21):  On behalf of the opposition, I'll just make some brief comments on the amendments to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 that have been put forward by the government. Labor is happy to support the amendments to schedule 8 of the bill. The original provisions in schedule 8 sought to extend the period that the AFP commissioner is authorised to postpone an employee's date of resignation in cases that involve allegations of serious misconduct or corruption from 90 days to 180 days. The minister has outlined some of the discussions that took place while this bill was working its way through the legislative process. The Australian Federal Police Association, the Labor opposition and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee raised concerns about this aspect of the bill. During the briefing that was provided to us by the department we were able to suggest that the parties could perhaps work this out, rather than having a big blow-up in the parliament on this matter. It's very pleasing to see that a compromise has been reached and the government's been able to move amendments that will give effect to that compromise. It's an example—perhaps a rare one—of the legislative process working at its effective best.


The amendment proposed by the government will permit the commissioner or delegate to postpone an employee's resignation by an extra 30 days. That extension can occur only twice, making the maximum postponement of a resignation 150 days rather than the 180 days initially proposed by the government. Importantly, under these amendments any extension must be properly justified. The government has also agreed to a statutory review of these changes after five years so we can be sure that the amendments to this scheme are working properly. Labor does support these changes and the bill as a whole. They make some minor, though important, improvements to the way federal criminal law operates. Thank you.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:48):  As the shadow assistant minister for cybersecurity and defence, I welcome the proposed amendments to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The amendments will address legislative inconsistencies in areas relating to mutual assistance, proceeds of crime and extradition—all issues that will be faced with the international characteristics of the types of crime I see emerging in the cybersecurity portfolio. The bill also proposes amendments in a number of areas that Labor has a very strong track record on: international crime cooperation, support for vulnerable witnesses, slavery, forced labour and forced marriage, anti-money-laundering and federal policing.


While the amendments are welcome, there are also emerging crimes that will pose challenges to our legal frameworks, both domestically and internationally. These are in the areas of cybersecurity and also in the increased focus and increased exposure of sexual violence in conflict as a war crime under the United Nations women, peace and security agenda. The technical amendments in this bill highlight the increased prevalence of technology and its use in both the commission of crime and, on the flipside, the monitoring, surveillance and prosecution of crime. Amendments align the existing provisions under the mutual assistance act and the telecommunications interception act, authorising the sharing of information with foreign countries, with the International Criminal Court Act. The type of material that may be shared with the International Criminal Court could be stored communications, historical telecommunications data, prospective telecommunications data and surveillance assistance. As the shadow minister I welcome the changes, because cybercrime activities—in all their forms, from cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism and cyberespionage through to child pornography and exploitation, ransomware, phishing and spear phishing—in this global world, through the internet, are cross jurisdictional activities.


There is no doubt that there will need to be greater focus on what international cooperation will look like when it comes to prosecuting people and organisations for these crimes, some of which are new or emerging types of crime that present a challenge to our traditional legal procedures, precedents and frameworks. Not only will it be a telling exercise for the preparedness and responsiveness of countries, when it comes to their cybersecurity frameworks, but also for the cooperation between governments in terms of data and the compulsion to release it. While a cooperative and collaborative relationship exists between government and corporations in Australia's e-safety regime, we need to constantly look at how we can further enhance our cooperation in these areas at the international level. It will be an interesting test to see how much of these frameworks will emerge in an international environment, when it has been difficult to establish regulatory norms for cybersecurity. Fortunately, this is still the Holy Grail that we're trying to establish. We have the Tallinn manual that outlines the range of international law that applies to the cybersecurity space. The UN GGE has been unable to meet agreement on cybersecurity norms and how the norms should operate in cyberspace. Without that sort of multilateral framework, we are now faced with having to try and get those norms established at a bilateral, quadrilateral or regional level.


I note we have the minister here. In the absence of those UN GGE multilateral norms, that usual UN framework that governs so much—the sea, telecommunications and so many international regulations and norms—we do need to focus our efforts. Given the absence of the UN reaching resolution on what we're going to be doing on cyberspace and cyber norms, we do need to be acting very aggressively, because this is changing rapidly. So we need to very aggressively, with a sense of urgency, engage in mechanisms, in architecture, at the regional, bilateral and quadrilateral level to establish and agree on those norms, and to use existing architecture, possibly through ASEAN and APEC, through the Indian Ocean Commission, through the Pacific Island Forum—to use the existing architecture that we have. Given the urgency on this there's no need to reinvent the wheel in terms of cybersecurity architecture; so we need to use the existing multilateral regional architecture that we have to drive resolution on agreed norms.


Without that UN framework, we have a significant gap. Yes, there is a lot of discussion at the G20s and at the APECs and through the communiques that come out of those multilateral regional events. There is a lot of agreement on what should be done, but what we really need to do is agree those norms. It is vital that we get everyone singing from the same song sheet in terms of how we're going to govern and agree to our behaviours in the cybersecurity space.


It's a perfect opportunity, now that the minister has walked in, to urge him to act. He's got his ambassador there; you've got people down in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade busily working on this. Please, we need to get those norms established. Ideally it would be at that multilateral UN level, but—given that we haven't been able to achieve that, despite a lot of concerted effort over many years—I do implore the minister to see what we can do in terms of agreeing norms amongst the Five Eyes community, quadrilaterals and regionals and using the existing architecture that I mentioned before.


I was also keen to talk about this piece of legislation and the amendments because of another area that I'm concerned about, and that I have been advocating on very strongly, which is sexual violence in conflict and the prosecution of those who participate in sexual violence in conflict. It's an important issue that I have been working on with the Women, Peace and Security community—the women in that community—and the Prosecute Don't Perpetrate community, because we know that Daesh has used sexual violence as a tactic of war. Sexual violence is a war crime, and we should treat it as such. The occurrence of systematic rape is well documented in Iraq and Syria. It is a crime against humanity, it is a crime again women, and we should treat it as such.


We should be speaking about sexual violence in conflict—which is what I'm speaking about here—and sexual violence more generally, and we should be holding the perpetrators to account no matter where they are. This is why I'm a strong advocate for and a strong participant in the Prosecute Don't Perpetrate campaign—to get those foreign fighters back here and get them prosecuted under sexual-violence-in-conflict legislation and norms. Over 100 Australians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with Daesh and other extremist groups. We need to investigate and prosecute the sexual violence they've perpetrated as war crimes, as crimes against humanity, for these are all crimes under Australian domestic law. The amendments to this bill don't cover off this issue, but, in terms of providing material to the United Nations, they do cover off issues to do with the International Criminal Court. Again, I'm putting it out there that we need to prosecute those who have committed sexual violence in conflict.


It's difficult. I'm the first to admit that it's difficult—as we see from looking at the history of prosecution of sexual violence in conflict over the years, such as the rape camps that happened in the Second World War in Eastern Europe. There have been a number of instances where sexual violence has been used as a tactic of war, as a tactic of terrorism, as a tactic of genocide, and it is very, very difficult to prosecute those crimes. It requires a great deal of bravery from the witnesses. Most importantly, it's very difficult to get the evidence, particularly when you're in a conflict environment. Who collects the evidence? If a witness is brave enough to come forward, then who actually collects that evidence? Is it a soldier in the field? Is it someone who is there working on the post-conflict transition? Who collects that information? Is it a civilian working in this space in a conflict environment? That's the real challenge. Not only do we need a sense of urgency and real will to prosecute these crimes—and those are there—but getting the evidence is the real challenge. So we need to set up frameworks, systems, guidelines and procedures so that we can collect the evidence and bring these crimes to the courts.


I know that armies and defence forces around the world have been examining a range of different mechanisms to get that evidence collected. I encourage the Australian authorities on this. I know we have a very active community through the Australian Defence Force, and also, in New York, we have a very active military community which is working on the Women, Peace Security agenda. But we do need to constantly look at the mechanisms through which we can get the evidence. That's the real challenge—how to get the evidence in a conflict environment.


One of Labor's core values is a fundamental belief that everyone should have access to justice, no matter what their postcode, no matter how much their parents earn, no matter what their background, no matter what their race or religion, and that includes providing adequate support for vulnerable witnesses. This bill corrects an anomaly introduced back in 2013 and extends the current offence of identifying a child witness or vulnerable adult complainant to the identification of a child complainant. The support and protection available for victims and witnesses in future criminal proceedings, regardless of when the alleged conduct occurred, is also clarified. This is a significant step in a number of ways. If we are to tackle abhorrent crimes like human trafficking and slavery, it is essential that vulnerable witnesses, like those women who are victims of sexual violence in conflict, be given protections and support in proceedings before the courts. In its submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, Anti-Slavery Australia said:


Victims and witnesses are often reluctant to give evidence, as they or their families may have been subjected to, or threatened with violence.


Providing support and protection for vulnerable witnesses and complainants is absolutely necessary in ensuring access to justice.


The government has stated that the purpose of the bill is to:


… enhance Australia's position globally in the fight against crime, making improvements to our international crime cooperation arrangements and our ability to assist international courts and tribunals.


The amendments in this bill go some way towards enhancing Australia's position, but, as I've mentioned, there will be ongoing and emerging challenges to Australia's position in the fight against crime. We need to act, not just speak out, against those perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict. We need to not just speak out against it; we need to actually start prosecuting, if we can. We need the evidence for that, and we need the guidelines and the frameworks to be able to collect that evidence.


There is also an emerging challenge, a constant daily challenge, to enhance our cybersecurity frameworks to not only prevent but to identify and prosecute cybercriminals wherever they may be. These amendments will go some way towards harmonising Australia's domestic laws with international laws. Labor supports the amendments in this bill.

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (12:01):  I rise to commend the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 to the House. Labor has a strong record in many of the areas that are covered by this bill: the fight against slavery, anti-money-laundering measures and international crime cooperation.


I want to make a point about Australia's law enforcement agencies and the excellent international reputation that they have. I commend them for their high level of skill and say that this is a great source of pride for Australia. A good example of that is the international cooperation of the AFP with law enforcement of our closest regional neighbour, Indonesia. A report by ASPI written in March 2014 called A return on investment: The future of police cooperation between Australia and Indonesia mentions some of the broader benefits of such cooperation beyond just law enforcement. It says:


The benefits of past AFP-POLRI cooperation have been felt largely in the transactional dimension of crime fighting, but the police-to-police relationship benefits other government agencies and the broader bilateral relationship too. Benefits have also accrued to the community and businesses in both countries, and the police-to-police relationship has promoted Australian and Indonesian interests in Southeast Asia.


That quote encompasses the ripple effect of cooperation in law enforcement. It doesn't just impact the transactional dimension of international crime fighting but has effects into the communities as well.


Indeed, international and transnational crime in today's environment is not only much more extensive than it has been in the past; it's also much more complex because it's more fluid. To take the case of terrorism, for example, it's not unthinkable that an attack could be planned in one country and executed in another country using funds diverted from a third country with perpetrators from fourth or fifth countries. We've had examples of that in the past with international terrorist incidents and transnational terrorist incidents. In fact, the landscape of transnational and international crime is far more challenging in today's environment than it has been in the past. That is why it's essential that we continue to ensure that our police and law enforcement agencies are able to operate in an international context in ways which are not unnecessarily impeded by legislation or by processes.


Although this bill makes some relatively technical amendments to the various Commonwealth acts, these amendments actually have the capacity to make some real differences in facilitating international cooperation in practice. The bill will assist in the investigation and prosecution of people responsible for some of the most serious crimes under international law, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The member for Canberra, who spoke before me, spoke extensively to this part of the bill.


But the bill will also further ensure that vulnerable people, particularly children, are protected by extending the current provisions to make it illegal to identify child complainants. This is especially relevant to cases involving online child exploitation where such cases often involve victims who are not witnesses in a trial—that is, victims who are children and who are classed as complainants. In addition to that, many of the victims of human trafficking and slavery fear for their safety if they assist in an investigation and this can be, and often is, a challenge to successful prosecution. So extending the protections for victims will encourage and assist in these matters as well.


This bill addresses some of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in offences relating to slavery and it expands the definition of debt bondage so that it allies more closely with slavery-like offences. Anti-Slavery International describe debt bondage, also called bonded labour or debt slavery, as the most common form of modern slavery, even though it is one of the least known. Debt bondage is when a person is forced to work to pay off a debt and is conned into working for little or no pay, with no control over their debt. The money that they earn is taken off them to repay the debt, so they have to keep working in order to pay off the money that they borrowed. They also face coercion, violence and intimidation if they try to leave.


The main amendments under this schedule of the bill also expand the list of matters considered in determining whether a victim was coerced, threatened or deceived. These measures provide further protection for victims and, importantly, make our legislation more consistent with relevant international instruments. Debt bondage is most widespread in South Asian countries. I understand that the International Labour Organization estimates a minimum of 11.7 million in forced labour in the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of whom are in debt bondage. It's most common in areas such as agriculture, brick kilns, mines and factories.


I also note that an element in this schedule in the bill relates to forced marriage. I want to speak a little bit about that, because the bill will clarify the test for victims incapable of understanding the nature and effect of a marriage ceremony. I give heed to the many women's groups doing some very extraordinary work on the ground in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and India around forced marriage. Forced marriage is particularly disturbing when it also involves a child. But I would also like to see that the test include an element to prove that a victim was incapable of understanding the effect of a marriage ceremony, and that element would, hopefully, include cases where marriage ceremonies are performed in a language that the victim doesn't understand as well as without her consent. Sadly, this is happening way too often as young girls raised in Western countries, such as Australia or the UK, are taken overseas by their parents and married off to complete strangers without their knowledge. They have no idea what's going on in a language that they lack competency in. The marriage ceremony can be performed in Arabic or Urdu. Often these young girls are raised in Australia and their first language is English. They have little command of their parents' mother tongue. They are sent back to these countries where they are married off and partake in a marriage ceremony with very little knowledge of what's happening because they don't understand the language.


I commend any of these measures and anything that we can do to make it easier for us and the international community to assist victims of forced marriage, who may be too young to understand what's going on, who may have a disability or an impairment that prevents them from understanding what's going on, or who may not understand the significance of the ceremony that they are taking part in. They might not know that it's a marriage ceremony. They might not have been told that it's a marriage ceremony. If we are going to be serious about our commitment to improving the conditions of women and girls throughout the world, which I believe we are—and I believe we have a bipartisan approach to improving those conditions for women and girls—we need this kind of legislation.


I'd like to move on and talk about the anti-money-laundering provisions of the bill, because they provide the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission with direct access to AUSTRAC information around financial intelligence. This amendment will allow the ACNC to fulfil its due diligence before registering charities and not-for-profit organisations and to monitor registered organisations, which will help them to ensure that organisations are not being used in the commission of serious crimes, including terrorism, or for money-laundering purposes.


I'd like to finish by again paying heed to the great work that our police forces do in their international efforts. As many of you know, I am the wife of a former police officer, a man who has dedicated his life to law enforcement. I'm obviously very proud of my husband and the work that he has done in law enforcement. I'm also very proud of the work that his colleagues do and, indeed, the dedication and commitment that all of our law enforcement professionals have. I've also had the privilege of seeing firsthand the work that our Federal Police do in Pakistan and in other countries internationally in three key areas. Firstly, in the area of collaboration, they broker collaboration with international law enforcement agencies to drive investigations and support bilateral or multilateral cooperation. Secondly, they cooperate with them in the area of intelligence gathering, through the collection and exchange of criminal intelligence in support of international law enforcement efforts. Thirdly, in capacity building—which I think we are particularly proud of in this country—they enhance the capacity and the capability of international law enforcement agencies to combat transnational crime. I strongly support any measures that are going to help our law enforcement agencies and our law enforcement professionals continue to conduct this valuable work unfettered and do this work to the best of their capabilities. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity) (12:13):  I thank the honourable members for their valuable contributions to this debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016, which will make significant improvements to the Commonwealth's criminal justice system. I really appreciate the comments that have just been made and those by the member for Canberra a moment ago, particularly her comments on cybersecurity, where I think we can maintain a spirit of bipartisanship in dealing with what is a very serious, significant issue for Australia and Australians. The bill will strengthen Australia's international crime cooperation arrangements to ensure that we're in the best possible position to work with international partners to combat crime both here and abroad.


The amendments in the bill will ensure that Australia can respond effectively to requests for assistance from foreign countries and international bodies in accordance with our international obligations. The amendments will assist Australia to avoid becoming a safe haven for foreign proceeds of crime and also ensure that criminals can't evade justice by moving evidence across borders or fleeing jurisdictions, and I take the former speaker's point that increasingly fluid borders are a very serious issue in dealing with criminals. The bill introduces amendments to ensure vulnerable child complainants are afforded the same protections as adult complainants when giving evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. It amends the AFP's internal drug and alcohol testing regime and integrity framework to allow the AFP to maintain the integrity of its workforce and ensure it can enforce its zero-tolerance policy regarding illicit drug-taking. Amendments will authorise the commissioner to extend the date of resignation for appointees under investigation for serious misconduct or corruption, again reinforcing the integrity of the AFP workforce. It includes amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to provide additional flexibility to departing travellers reporting movements of physical currency and improve information-sharing between Commonwealth agencies. 


The bill includes minor consequential amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act to facilitate the use of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission as an alternative name for the Australian Crime Commission. It makes amendments to the AusCheck Act to enable AusCheck to conduct and coordinate background checks on individuals in relation to declared major national events. 


This bill will strengthen Australia's criminal justice framework, both domestically and internationally, ensuring that law enforcement and justice agencies are equipped with the necessary powers to fight crime at home and abroad. It will strengthen the government's ability to detect and address serious national security and other risks in relation to large-scale national events. It will enhance the Commonwealth's anti-human-trafficking and anti-slavery regime and the protections afforded to vulnerable witnesses within our criminal justice system.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has considered the bill and made recommendations for amendments, subject to which the committee recommends the bill be passed. The government has moved amendments that will implement the committee's recommendations. We also had consideration of this bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the government notes the Human Rights Committee's view on the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Extradition Act. We are committed to ensuring that Australia operates in a manner that is consistent with Australia's international law obligations, including international human rights obligations. I'd like to thank these committees for their consideration of the bill. I'd also like to assure the House that, consistent with these reports, the bill contains appropriate measures balanced by sensible and appropriate safeguards. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (12:24):  At the end of last year an important new Australian educational institution was launched. That is the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation. I was proud to be present at the launch, not only as a board member but also as the architect of the centre's program, mission and structure. The centre's mission is to instil in Australians a knowledge of and appreciation for the cultural heritage of Western civilisation, which has shaped our society. The centre hopes that with that knowledge more Australians will understand and be influenced by a tradition which has given the world liberal democracy and the rule of law and has preserved and advanced individual freedoms to speak, to worship, to associate and to choose one's own destiny. Anchored in traditions which come to us from Greece, Rome and Jerusalem, burnished in the crucible of Britain and its legacy to Australia, and adapted to our own conditions, the Western tradition has been downplayed in educational circles for the best part of 30 years. The foundation of any education in the humanities must be Western civilisation and its tradition of debate, discussion and deductive learning.


Leaving aside Indigenous history, prior to 1788 Australian history was British history. It includes the Judeo-Christian roots of the West and its pre-Christian roots in the ancient world. Knowledge of Western civilisation is not confined to history and philosophy, but includes theology, literature, music, art, architecture and the history and philosophy of science. Studying the great texts leads to an engagement with fundamental questions about what it means to be human and how one should live a good life. Both the factual content and the method of debate and discovery that underpins the pedagogy of Western civilisation are equally important. Providing Australians with knowledge of Western civilisation should lead us to better decisions being made, as Australians will develop a deeper appreciation for past debates and the universal challenges which confront leaders, decision makers and ordinary citizens. A sound grounding in Western civilisation should help students be better able to think for themselves.


It's important to remind Australians of the origin of our culture and traditions, or we are doomed to undervalue our institutions, to take them for granted without realising the important role they play in society, or to be prepared to jettison them or to repeat historic errors by making decisions without understanding their consequences. Unlike in America, Australians have never had the opportunity to study, deeply and broadly, concepts of Western civilisation. That's why the Ramsay Centre is so important.


The Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation is made possible because of the generous endowment from healthcare entrepreneur the late Paul Ramsay AO. Paul Ramsay had a clear vision for the Australia he wanted to leave for the next generation. He mixed with a wide variety of Australians in business and through other public and charitable activities. As Paul met people from government, business and the professions, he became increasingly concerned that so few of them had a full appreciation for the culture which had shaped the society they prospered in. Fewer still had a desire to protect and preserve that culture. Paul came to the view that Australia's culture needed shifting. Paul's vision was to create a new generation of leaders with a knowledge and appreciation of Western civilisation.


Personally, I'm proud to have played a very significant part in the creation of Paul's vision. In early 2014, with my background in university administration and my enthusiasm for Western civilisation, at the recommendation of Tony Clark and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Paul commissioned me to undertake a scoping study to examine what would be needed to bring about his vision for education in the Western tradition. As part of that project I met with academics, foundations and university and scholarship administrators in Australia, the US, the UK and Canada. I visited famous institutions like Columbia, Chicago and Yale, liberal arts colleges like St John's at Annapolis, and, in the Catholic tradition, Loyola and Boston College, which all had versions of programs in which undergraduate students learn about Western civilisation. It was clear there is much to be gained from similar courses in Australia and I recommended as such in my report.


The Ramsay Centre, which was launched last year, will have four major streams, Bachelor of Arts degrees in Western civilisation in collaboration with two or three Australian universities. It will support these degrees through a suite of Ramsay undergraduate scholarships and through the creation of new academic positions. It will endow a number of Ramsay postgraduate scholarships, open to graduates from a range of disciplines for study at prestigious international universities. And it will establish a program of summer schools, distinguished visiting lecturers and other events designed to promote a wider appreciation of Western civilisation.


The centre is led by Professor Simon Haines, who is the executive director and has a board of management that comprises luminaries such as John Howard, Kim Beazley and Tony Abbott. Thanks to Paul Ramsay, tomorrow's leaders will be instilled with the intellectual, cultural and spiritual formation that yesterday's leaders were fortunate enough to take for granted. I commend the Ramsay Centre to the chamber.
