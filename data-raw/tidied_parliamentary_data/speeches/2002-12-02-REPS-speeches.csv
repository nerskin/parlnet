"Jull, David, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I present the committee's report for 2001-02.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—As chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I am pleased to present the committee's first annual report to the House. The report, which has been authorised for publication by all three portfolio ministers, includes a review of the expenditure and aspects of the administration of the three agencies for the period 2001-02 and a summary of the committee's activities in its first four months of operation.
Tabling of this report is an important step forward for the committee and the process of legislative oversight of intelligence services in Australia. It marks the first time that the administration and expenditure of the three agencies have been subject to comprehensive review by the Australian parliament. It is also the first time that a committee dealing with intelligence matters has been required to report to the legislature on its own activities. Both are modest, but important, milestones.
In preparing the report, the committee considered detailed submissions from each of the agencies on their administration and expenditure. It also held a full day's hearing in camera, at which agencies were cross-examined on evidence provided to the committee, and conducted a number of informal briefings with the agencies, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and the ANAO. The report's findings reflect the committee's satisfaction that information on each of the agencies' expenditure is transparent and that the budgetary positions of the three agencies for the current financial year appear sound. Additional appropriations for each of the agencies under the 2002-03 federal budget have been earmarked for new programs and should enhance operational capacity within the Australian intelligence community.
The report includes two recommendations which are aimed at improving external oversight of the agencies: firstly, the establishment of an efficiency advisor position within the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to enhance its capacity to assess use of resources by the agencies; and, secondly, arrangements to enable DSD to provide separate audited financial statements for review by the committee. The report also contains a useful summary of the committee's activities to June 2002. These include the committee's intensive inquiry and report into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and participation by members in the international intelligence review agency conference in London in May of this year.
As the report makes clear, these are still early days for the committee and the process of agency review. Further reports will see refinements to the committee's methods and scope of investigation. The committee has already identified a number of areas for further work, such as: recruitment, training and retention of agency staff; the adequacy of contracting arrangements; and the implementation of internal audit and risk management strategies. Of course, the committee also has powers to request separate terms of review, which it may choose to pursue in the coming 12 months. In conclusion, I would like to thank my fellow members of the committee for their support and their commitment to the work of the committee, and I thank the staff for their able-bodied assistance. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—As the chair of the committee has said, this is the first annual report of the committee, which it has been required to table under section 31 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001. The report includes a review of the expenditure and aspects of the administration of the three agencies, as well as a summary of the committee's own activities in its first four months of existence. As Mr Jull noted in his tabling statement, the report is significant because it marks the first time that the finances of all three agencies have been subject to direct review and reporting by the Australian parliament. The report reflects a new standard of accountability and transparency applied to the agencies as a result of the act and a broadening of the parliament's role in the process of oversight. The report also reflects a number of challenges facing the committee in effectively performing the functions assigned to it by the act. 
The committee, and the agencies themselves, are on substantially new ground. It is our first year and many of the committee's activities have been focused on increasing members' understanding of the context in which the agencies operate. It is a set of rather difficult circumstances: we have to report on the agencies' activities but they cannot tell you anything about their operational activities. So if it all goes wrong we are not quite sure whose fault it is: theirs or ours. The committee are still in the process of developing methods of review, particularly with respect to proper assessment of the budget and expenditure of the agencies. We see that, in future, there will be a lot more consultation between us and the Audit Office in assessing the agencies' finances so that we can adopt a more in-depth approach than we have been able to in this first set of accounts.
A more fundamental challenge for the committee will be to develop an adequate understanding of the agencies' needs without all the information on the operational activities being given to us. Evidence that the committee has heard of parliamentary systems in other countries, in particular the UK, suggests that this can be achieved over time with reasonable and timely access to appropriate classified information. The chairman mentioned that he and I had visited the UK and the US earlier this year to talk to the various oversight bodies there. The committee had a meeting with the UK committee here a few months ago. In all those discussions, you become very conscious of limiting the extent to which the agencies can capture you. It is very interesting for people to come and tell you little bits of secret information, where maybe they do not tell you the whole lot and where there is the bait of: `You could participate if you become more of an agent of ours'. The issue of capture is an issue that the committee is going to have to be very careful of in the future.
What has been quite important to me and other members of the committee is that the agencies have been quite open and reasonable in their dealings with the committee. The passing of the Intelligence Services Act ensured that we brought some scrutiny to these bodies. The heads of the three agencies that the committee looks at in particular—DSD, ASIS and ASIO—are very accepting of that new transparency. A question for government in the future might be whether they bring the other defence community people into the purview of this committee.
The committee have made a couple of recommendations in the report that we hope the government will take up. At least one of those, the one about the efficiency issue, came out of the meeting that we had with the UK committee and the discussions that the member for Fadden and I had with the UK committee people in May this year. I commend the committee's report. I am sure that all my colleagues on the committee would join with me in thanking the member for Fadden for the job he has done as chairman, in thanking the committee secretariat for the work they have done and, in particular, in thanking the heads of the agencies for the cooperation they have given the committee. If this level of openness continues, I have no doubt that the committee will provide a very valuable resource for the parliament.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2002-12-02,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the significance of the credit union movement in the framework of Australia's financial services;
(2)	recognises the contribution of 200 Australian credit unions and their 3.5 million members not only to the concept of mutuality but also as an alternative source of housing and domestic finance;
(3)	notes its role in providing banking-type and lending services in country and many other areas vacated by the traditional banks;
(4)	recommends a reassessment of ASIC and APRA regulations (commensurate with the size and role of credit unions); and
(5)	requests a re-examination of taxation, franking credits and register requirements as they apply to credit unions.
Today I would like to acknowledge the exemplary service given to the community by community banking organisations and acknowledge the role they play in extending the rights of customers across Australia. Credit unions and building societies offer a valuable alternative banking option for the general public, providing a full range of financial services with the benefits of mutuality in a democratic environment. The principle of mutuality is one applauded by this government. The simple act of people helping themselves is the central ethos of the community based banking sector.
There is a distinction, however, between credit unions and community based banking. Credit unions operate under a mutual structure and are not profit- driven. Any profits go back into the institutions, as opposed to community banks, where, if payable, a dividend is returned to the shareholder. In my own electorate of Hinkler, we are lucky to have a number of outstanding community banking institutions, including the Wide Bay Capricorn Building Society, which is headquartered in Bundaberg. Wide Bay Capricorn Building Society now has more than $1.1 billion in assets, with around $800 million invested in home loans. It was also the best performing banking body in terms of returns to shareholders last year, outdoing the four major banking institutions, with its share price rising 56 per cent during 2001.
However, today I want to focus on the fundamental community financial institution: the credit union. My electorate is very lucky to have four credit unions providing financial services to residents. These are: Credit Union Australia, with branches in Gladstone and Bundaberg, which is one of the largest credit unions in Australia with assets in excess of $1.3 billion; Queensland Teachers Credit Union, with branches in Gladstone and Bundaberg; the Electricity Credit Union, with a branch in Gladstone; and the Capricornia Credit Union, with branches in Gladstone and Miriam Vale.
As a point of interest, the presence of a credit union in Miriam Vale shows the contribution these bodies have made to rural and regional Australia. Miriam Vale is one of more than 700 regional towns abandoned by the four big banks between 1993 and 2000. Without this credit union, residents would have had no face-to-face banking facility in their town, apart from limited services available at Australia Post. This is despite the fact that, according to last year's census, Miriam Vale shire is the fastest growing mainland local government area in Queensland, outstripping growth rates in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Examples such as this prove the practical commitment that credit unions have shown in `no bank' towns through the CreditCare initiative, which saw access to financial services return to nearly 60 communities nationwide. Along with the provision of banking services in smaller communities, credit unions' cooperative structures mean profits are channelled back to members and members enjoy a very high customer service standard.
In fact, research has shown that customer satisfaction rates consistently sit at around 80 per cent—the highest of all financial institutions covered by a recent study—and three-quarters of members would recommend credit unions to their families or friends. The same research shows that our four major banking institutions have less than half that level of support from their clients. So the mutuality concept for credit union members works well not only for the institution but for the wider community. Credit union representatives I have spoken to tell me that in 1992 there were almost 400 credit unions across the country. By 1999 there were 222 credit unions in Australia. These representatives squarely attributed the decline to a `never-ending barrage of government legislation'. Despite this, the popularity of credit unions is quite obvious: during the last decade, credit union membership increased by around 30 per cent, total loans grew by 47 per cent—from $12.3 billion to around $18 billion—total assets were up 164 per cent and deposits grew by 151 per cent. 
There are two nationally recognised bodies representing credit unions in Australia. The first of those is the National Credit Union Association, or NCUA, which was established in the 1960s as the Queensland state association of credit unions and has evolved to a nationally based payment and financial services provider. The second is the Credit Union Services Corporation of Australia Ltd, known as CUSCAL. These two bodies represent 196 credit unions which currently operate in Australia. At June 2002, total credit union assets stood at around $25.7 billion, which represents a growth rate of 7.5 per cent a year. Australia's credit unions enjoy a large membership base of more than 3.6 million members—the approximate equivalent of one in every five adults.
Under the new APRA regulations, all deposit-taking institutions are required to provide the same level of safety to customers. Previously, credit union members were seen to be depositing with and lending from themselves. They were recognised as not being able to make taxable income through dealings with themselves. Any income that credit unions received on loans was tax exempt. That tended to be, and still is, the bulk of their earnings. Of course, there may be odd dealings with non-members that generate profits, but these tend to be relatively small. However, under federal legislation, credit unions are companies limited by shares. Members are seen as shareholders with one vote each. Credit unions are also now taxed like companies and earn franking credits. However, being mutual entities, credit unions cannot distribute their dividends to shareholders without losing their cooperative status. They also have the problem of distributing franking credits to their members.
Credit unions fear that this could open the door to demutualisation, which is not an option for the industry now or at any time, according to those representatives I referred to. Credit unions would prefer that redeemable preference shares were an option. They would be of an equity nature rather than a debt nature, which would help credit unions adhere to APRA regulations and enable them to grow at a faster rate. This issue is of great importance to credit unions. For example, looking at the financial report of the CPS Credit Union of South Australia—one taken at random—we find that its franking credits now total $20.1 million and its membership is about 83,000. That means that about $240 per member is tied up in unusable franking credits. Of course, that figure is likely to grow unless there is a change in policy.
Under the Corporations Act, credit unions are also bound to make their membership records available to any inquirer, and these records must be provided in electronic format. Although the information gleaned from a company's register of members should not be used to contact members—unless it is relevant to their holding of shares in the company or the use or disclosure is approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—I believe this still leaves credit unions vulnerable to forms of predatory behaviour from their competitors. To some degree it is also deemed to allow intrusions into members' privacy. One would argue that credit union membership is nobody's business except for the individuals in question. I am sure the Privacy Commissioner would be concerned about this. Potential sinister actions could also arise—particularly in today's volatile international climate. (Time expired)

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—I am very happy to second the motion and endorse what the member for Hinkler so adequately dealt with in the past 10 minutes. It is not surprising, however, that he came up short in terms of time—15 or 20 minutes might have been more appropriate, because there is a significant range of issues that this motion deals with. Those issues that the member for Hinkler has just been dealing with—franking credits, taxation and the register requirements—directly relate to, one, the essential nature of credit unions and, two, their size compared to the major banks. The key point is that, in dealing with the two bills that will be coming before the House, the government will need to take into account the fact that they are dealing with a different entity. In particular, in the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 there is a question of what the test is for people being fit and proper. 
The member for Hinkler alluded to the fact that credit unions, because of their democratic nature—having democratically elected boards—are in a different position to the situation of the large banks or, indeed, community banks and that the legislation needs to fit the character and nature of the credit union movement. I am indebted to the credit union movement for having the foresight, given that they had seen I would be speaking on the bill, to provide me and, no doubt, others with background information that clarifies the situation of credit unions in Australia. In the argument they have put they make it very clear that they fully understand and accept that credit unions and banks are subject to the same legally enforceable standards on capital, liquidity and risk management and that they need the community as a whole to understand that—the fact that they are on exactly the same footing now in terms of the prudential requirements. What they say they would like to underline is:
... smaller institutions are often required to carry higher capital ratios than larger, more complex banks, increasing costs. As cooperative, member focused entities with a focus on fair costs and charges, it can be challenging to work within a framework that also seeks to regulate large banks with a focus on shareholder return.
That is a central problem that the legislation needs to deal with. It is a case of one size does not fit all here. In terms of shareholder delivery, credit unions are a particular case because the people who use them are also the shareholders. As the member for Hinkler indicated, they have expanded dramatically over the last decade in terms of the numbers of people using them, the amounts that have been deposited and the relative strength and depth of the credit union sector as a whole.
One of the key points that is made in the motion relates to what has happened in terms of banking type products not being provided in regional Australia and, as it notes at point (3), many other areas that have been vacated by the traditional banks. I can speak fairly clearly about that, coming from the very centre of the city of Sydney. The major banks have vacated suburb after suburb in the electorate of Blaxland and left some suburbs without any banking facilities whatsoever. The Bendigo Bank has not made its way into Bankstown. What has happened is that more people have gone to the Bankstown Credit Union and the Punchbowl Credit Union. The Punchbowl Credit Union has been there for more than 50 years, and the Bankstown Credit Union has been there for a similar amount of time. They have been serving the people of the area more than adequately, on an extremely fair basis, but one of the key things they have suffered from is their lack of visibility. People have tended to see them just as small organisations primarily concerned with serving people—for a number of them, people who have been in trade unions—who were putting their money into a central depositing place and then getting home loans out of it.
The credit unions have done a great deal more, but what they have not done is aggressively push their profile in the community. It is important they do that because, as service in the banking area has declined, the fact that the credit unions can provide that so adequately and well fills a space that real people in the electorate of Blaxland and elsewhere in Australia need to have filled. Credit unions are doing a fantastic job. The member for Hinkler has done exactly the right thing in bringing this motion to the House. I am happy to second it. I am happy to endorse it entirely and to endorse the fact that credit unions have done so well and will do so well for their customers.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I wish to express my appreciation to the member for Hinkler and endorse the motion he has moved and the comments he has made in the House today. Credit unions are a very important alternative source of finance for many Australians. In fact, there are 229 credit unions, and the credit union movement as a whole is more significant than three of the four leading banks. That is something that many Australians are unaware of and would wish to know, because there is a high level of concern and distrust for the high fees and charges of banks. People deserve an alternative, and credit unions are the only deposit taking alternative to the banking system. So it is important that this House and the Australian community take notice of the unique ownership of credit unions: they are owned by the customers. 
It would be terrific if banks asked every customer who came into their institutions whether they were happy, whether the banks were doing the right thing and whether they would vote for the directors and give their endorsement to the banks, because if the banks were required to react to customers in the same way the credit unions must we would see a totally different attitude in the banking system. This is a very significant difference. It is okay for APRA and ASIC and other regulatory organisations to impose on the credit unions the banking requirements that banks must fulfil, but it would be very interesting if the banks were also asked to respond in the way these mutually owned organisations need to respond in their market environment. Credit unions—and perhaps building societies—are the only alternative in many areas of Australia. They are filling the gaps in suburban Australia and in regional and rural Australia. Instead of bank closures, we have the credit union movement working with the government, rural and regional communities. Even AMP and ING, the new banking people on the block, do not have branches—you are supposed to do it all online over the Internet.
Personal finances and the housing sector are being more adequately coped with and dealt with by credit unions. They are paying attention to the broad needs of their customers far more than in the past. They have not turned themselves into banks, but they are looking at personal finances and housing requirements. They are authorised deposit taking institutions. Instead of the approach that APRA appears to adopt in some of its preferred regulatory controls—`one size fits all' was the comment by the previous speaker, Mr Hatton—the Senate inquiry into financial institutions has on perhaps three occasions identified differences between credit unions and the main deposit taking institutions that need to be noted and acted upon.
APRA and ASIC can focus on large corporations like HIH. We expect them to, and they should do a very thorough job there. They should not spend a lot of time focusing on what are well-run organisations which have limitations imposed on them by the type of structure they have. They have limits on the concentration of investment of funds, they have a focus on their non-transferable share structure and they have rules imposed on them regarding the way in which they must keep their assets. These rules have no regard to the high level and quality of security over loans, which are basically in people and in housing. They do not lend beyond 80 per cent on any house. These investments are in people and in bricks and mortar. The members of the credit union movement have a much more secure type of investment than many banks. That ought to be taken into account when we look at the regulatory process and the requirements that they fulfil certain regulations. This is an excellent amendment and, I believe, a good start for us when focusing our attention on alternatives to the banking structure.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—My electorate of Bruce in Melbourne is home to members of many credit unions, including the former Advantage Credit Union—now Australian National—as well as strong industrial credit unions such as the GMH employees' and the Woolworths/Safeway employees' credit unions. As the sixth largest deposit taking group in Australia after the big four banks and St George, credit unions are an important competitive force in Australia's financial services industry. Nationally, credit union membership has grown by 1.1 per cent from June 2000 to June 2001.
The growing importance of credit unions in the financial services industry is illustrated by a number of key figures. In the decade from 1991 to 2001, membership of credit unions grew by more than 29 per cent, total assets grew by 164 per cent and deposits grew by 151 per cent. Since 1996, the total credit union loan portfolio has grown by 47 per cent, from $12.3 billion to $18.1 billion. Credit unions continue to consolidate their position in a rapidly changing financial services marketplace. They are the main financial institutions for 12 per cent of the banking population—in line with National Australia Bank at 13 per cent and ahead of ANZ at nine per cent and Westpac at eight per cent. It is important to recognise the growing importance of credit unions to ordinary Australian consumers. For example, credit unions as a group issue the largest number of personal loans in Australia. 
With growing concern over the service provision of the banking industry, credit unions should also be congratulated on their customer service performance. According to the Credit Union Services Corporation, or CUSCAL, in a 2001 survey of customer satisfaction eight out of 10 consumers rated the service of credit unions as excellent or very good. Compare this with the recent audit of the ANZ's new customer charter which labelled the results as unsatisfactory. The ANZ Bank Chief Executive John McFarlane said, `We are just scraping in a B grade.' While the ANZ is to be encouraged in its efforts in this area, it is clear that Australia's big banks have plenty of room for improvement.
Credit unions have a strong tradition of delivering services to regional and rural communities through both a continued presence Australia wide and programs designed to bring financial services into `no bank' towns. Between 1993 and 2000, over 700 bank branches were closed in rural and remote areas. The CreditCare initiative saw financial services return to almost 60 communities across Australia. In towns such as Moe, Morwell and Yarrawonga, more than 40 per cent of the local community are members of a credit union. In Victoria, Violet Town lost its last branch when the National Australia Bank decided to close earlier this year. Northeast Credit Union surveyed the community and, on the basis of local support, opened a credit union branch.
A major issue for many Australian consumers is the fees and charges of the major banking institutions. Reserve Bank of Australia figures show that in 2001 Australians paid almost $7.1 billion in bank fees. In 1996, Australian households and businesses paid around $290 million per month in fees. In 2001, it was just under $600 million per month. According to CUSCAL, less than 30 per cent of Australia's credit union members pay any kind of transaction or account keeping fee. Their research goes on to show that nearly 75 per cent of credit union members would pay only $2.13 on average per month where fees did apply. These services and fee levels indicate that credit unions provide a valuable alternative to the traditional banks, and any examination of their operations needs to be mindful of their status as mutual organisations motivated by the needs of their members.
In relation to the specific recommendations of this motion, I would like to deal firstly with the proposal to reassess ASIC and APRA regulations. In supporting credit unions, Labor believe that ASIC and APRA must be conscious of the fact that credit unions are not banks and that the regulations must be sensitive to their smaller scale of operation. APRA recently made some adverse comments about the lending practices of credit unions, describing them as `imprudent'. While APRA followed this up with warnings to banks and other authorised deposit taking institutions, it is important that they also look at the role played by mortgage brokers, which are currently relatively unregulated.
Secondly, we would support the re-examination of taxing, franking credits and register requirements. The credit union movement currently has accumulated over one billion franking credits which they are unable to distribute. We would support a re-examination of what is a very important issue facing credit unions at this time. In relation to register requirements, concerns over the privacy of members whose details would be published on a shareholder register need to be examined—in particular, the concerns of some industry based groups such as the police and defence forces. For example, in relation to the Police Credit Union, there are obvious issues relating to the access of members to the names and addresses of other members who are police officers. Labor is sympathetic to this situation and recommends that suggestions such as the use of an independent third party as a kind of postbox for those members who are police officers are examined as part of any review. In conclusion, I encourage credit unions to continue their work both on behalf of their current members and as a viable alternative to the traditional banks.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I would like to endorse the member for Hinkler's statements and commend him on this motion. I am also pleased that the member for Bruce has kept a very close eye on my electorate of Indi and commented quite positively on the initiatives of local credit unions there. I too am very proud of these organisations that are locally owned and locally run and have tremendous support from people living within their respective towns.
After the big banks, there are over 200 Australian credit unions providing everyday banking services to Australian people. Credit unions, as previous speakers have mentioned, are accountable to 3.6 million customers in Australia. The financial services sector is no doubt crowded in numbers, with many providers battling to offer their services to the financial industry. Credit unions traditionally provide services such as savings and loans; they are not, in essence, complex structural organisations.
Unlike the banks, credit unions are not wholly subservient to the bottom line, nor are they renowned for generating the large profits that the banks have become accustomed to. They strive to capture one thing that the banks will not—a more personal approach to financial lending with their customers. A more personal relationship with people is to be welcomed, and the credit unions have successfully filled the void left by the powerful profit motives of the banks. One particular upside is that credit union members are actually recognised as registered shareholders within a credit union.
It was claimed recently that APRA had warned that risky business ventures by credit unions and building societies were jeopardising investor savings. The CEO of APRA, Graeme Thompson, then stated that Australian credit unions and building societies were sound financial institutions and generally conservative lenders. There has been a noticeable trend in the number of people borrowing from credit unions and building societies for their mortgages. Between January and May 2002, Australian banks suffered a noticeable decline in mortgage approvals. During this period, there was a 12.6 per cent rise in home loan approvals by non-bank lenders, compared to a 2.8 per cent fall in mortgage approvals by Australian banks—another example showing that consumers can vote with their feet. Since August 2001, home loan approvals by credit unions and similar non-banking entities rose by 14.5 per cent, while loan approvals by banks continued in a downward spiral, falling 9.5 per cent.
In May 2002, there were more than 52,000 home loan approvals. Over 37,000 were approved by the major banks, while the so-called small players—credit unions, building societies and super funds—approved almost 15,000 loans. This constituted record levels for non-banking lenders. The enormous gulf highlights the importance of this particular motion in recognising the importance of the credit union and non-banking sector within Australia's financial services industry. The notion captured within the credit union sector of mutuality—and mutual obligation more broadly—is another very important facet of this debate. Australians should be aware of the services that credit unions offer to Australian customers. There are alternatives to the main banks, and credit unions should be adequately recognised as alternative sources of financial services to the Australian people.
As the member for a rural and regional electorate, I have seen the withdrawal of a great number of previously essential banking services that were traditionally provided to people living in these areas. I commend this motion that effectively gives credit unions adequate recognition for their provision of services to people in rural and regional areas. In my home town of Wangaratta, we have the renowned services of the WAW Credit Union, which also provides banking services to eight other towns within Indi. We are also fortunate to have the Northeast Credit Union in Benalla, and the Yarrawonga Credit Union. All these are locally run and owned and focused on delivering services to individuals and businesses within my electorate. 
Credit unions have long been undervalued for their services and as alternative financial services providers to the banks. For a sector that represents about 3.5 million people, we could more effectively recognise the contribution of credit unions and the role that they play in providing these services, particularly in non-metropolitan areas. In recent times, customers—understandably—have been more fickle and less loyal to traditional banks. People are rightfully considering their options in a very competitive marketplace. Credit unions have proved to be worthy players in this industry. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Credit Unions</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—I too rise to support the motion by the member for Hinkler. I commend the motion and indeed the member for Blaxland, who seconded it. It is fair to say that credit unions are very important to this country. After a little research, I realised that credit unions in fact originated over 150 years ago in Europe. They have been in Australia since 1946. Just after World War II, Mr Kevin Yates introduced the first credit union to this country. So for more than 50 years Australia's credit unions have been making a major contribution to giving ordinary families access to affordable loans and better services.
Members have rattled off facts to try to paint the picture of the importance of credit unions in this country, and I would like to add to those. Firstly—this may have been mentioned but it is probably worth repeating—there are over 3½ million credit union members in Australia. One in every five adults is a member of a credit union, and there are now 190 or so credit unions. As we know, they are very strong on service values. I think the member for Bruce indicated that, even within the last 10 years, credit union membership has grown by almost 30 per cent. Unlike banks, credit unions are democratic in the way they are formed and there are mutual obligations between the members and the institution itself.
I would also like to bring to the House's attention the fact that, as a group, credit unions are the sixth largest deposit taking force in Australia, behind the big four banks and St George. As I said, credit unions have traditionally been strong in service values, and they continue to be, with research showing that eight out of 10 customers rate their services as excellent or very good. That is the highest level for all financial institutions in the country.
The other thing that is important to note—maybe the banks could learn something from this—is that credit union members are extremely loyal to their credit unions. As a demonstration of customer loyalty, up to 75 per cent of customers of credit unions are likely to recommend credit unions to other people. The same research indicates that less than 28 per cent of the four big banks' customers would be likely to recommend their bank to others. We can clearly see here that there is a strong regard for credit unions and a strong sense of loyalty from members, so they must be doing something right.
In recent years, despite the obvious challenges in competing with these giant banking institutions, credit unions have managed to survive and indeed thrive. They have not so much taken on the banks head-on, but instead have managed to create a niche for themselves in the marketplace, which has grown over time. The banks have provided the credit unions with such an opportunity. Bank branch closures, the imposition of increasingly high bank fees and the gradual shift to a more impersonal relationship, particularly where the customer is not inclined towards the use of electronic banking, have given credit unions an advantage.
I think it is fair to say that the critical issues for credit unions are whether they will continue to attract new members and whether they can continue to cope in this environment. The KPMG review of building societies and credit unions last year found that credit unions may find it increasingly difficult to compete with the larger-scale competition and the burden of increasing regulatory costs. Clearly, one of the hardest decisions for each of the remaining 190 credit unions in the country is whether they should merge. On the one hand, the merging of small institutions will increase critical mass and, as a result, help the newly amalgamated institution to provide a wider range of services, such as insurance and financial planning. On the other hand, credit unions must not become the creature they currently distinguish themselves from. In short, they must ensure that they remain democratic, are close to their members and put people before profits; but at the same time they must have the wherewithal to mix it with the big banks. This is the challenge that confronts credit unions—a challenge that, in the main, I think they will meet. It is critical for the country that they do so. (Time expired)

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—Tomorrow marks the 148th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion. On 3 December, miners from 16 different nations took up arms against a corrupt and unjust goldfields administration. After years of oppression, the battle at the Eureka Stockade led to the birth of true democracy in Australia. It was not just about taxation; it was about the right of people to have a say in how they are governed. The concerns which underlaid the discontent on the goldfields at the time are the themes which still carry potent meanings for today's Australians—issues of human rights, democracy and national identity—and it is these issues which give the Eureka rebellion its continuing historical significance. In France, it was the storming of the Bastille; in America, it was Gettysburg; and in Australia, it was the battle for the Eureka Stockade. Each represented a step in the march to liberty and a democratic government. The Eureka oath has a potent meaning today: `We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.' Today I call for the Eureka flag—the flag of the Southern Cross—to be recognised under the Flags Act as a national flag. The Eureka flag was first flown at Parliament House in 1973 and it has not flown since. Tomorrow it will fly from the Victorian and New South Wales parliaments respectively. It is time for it once again to fly from this building. Eureka belongs to all Australians. On 3 December 2004, Australia will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Eureka rebellion, and I call on all members to support this commemoration.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—Mr Speaker, I would like to add to an answer I gave earlier today to the honourable member for Lalor. 
—The minister may proceed.
—I was somewhat surprised that reference would be made to a HREOC report with which I was unfamiliar. The reason I was unfamiliar with it is that it has not been tabled in this parliament by the Attorney, but it has been the subject, I understand, of some judicious leaking, which I find somewhat curious. 
—I think the member for Griffith has a very short memory.
—In relation to obviously an effort to raise the matter to greater prominence than it deserves, let me just say that my department does fully cooperate with HREOC's investigations. It does not mean that one agrees with the conclusions that HREOC might reach. I think it is important in relation to this matter to know that, where people are detained, whether they are adults or minors, they are detained in accordance with law. That law is quite clear and it is law which I understand is largely supported on both sides of this parliament.
In relation to international instruments to which we are a party, the primary instrument that is spoken of is the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 3 provides that all actions concerning children be in their best interests as a primary consideration. The instruments also underline the importance of keeping families together. In line with this obligation, the department believes that in all but a limited number of cases where parents are required to be detained, it is more than likely to be in their best interests that they remain together with their parents. Article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the responsibilities and rights of parents. In immigration detention facilities, the role of parents as primary care givers and guardians is fully met and respected. 
In relation to the particular matters, it was certainly judged at all times that it was in the best interests of the child concerned in this report initially that he remain with his family in detention. That was a consideration that was looked at. In mid-2001, it was determined that it was in the best interests of the young boy that he be removed into foster care. That decision was based upon medical advice and advice of the state department on welfare issues, and it was made with the agreement of the boy's father and stepmother. 
In relation to HREOC's findings that the department did not take all appropriate measures to prevent the child from witnessing acts of self-harm and other violent situations, the fact is that there has not been evidence that the boy witnessed acts of self-harm as claimed. In fact, I recall the matter well, because some of the incidents that were described as incidents that he recalled were not incidents of that character that took place in the detention centre at the time he was there. I do not accept that medical treatment provided to the boy was in any way inadequate. He has always been provided with timely access to appropriate medical care on every occasion it was thought necessary. In relation to HREOC's recommendation that compensation be paid and an apology be made, when the basis upon which the recommendations are made are not accepted, then obviously the issues of compensation and apology do not arise.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises that youth suicide is becoming an increasing cause of death amongst young people with youth suicide figures in 2000 at 2,363 with 1,860 of those males;
(2)	recognises that the youth suicide rates for males and indigenous people, particularly in rural areas, are amongst the highest in the western world and that males are three times more likely to complete a suicide attempt;
(3)	recognises that admissions to hospitals for intentional self-injury are close to 10 times as common as fatalities for suicide, with males more likely to take far more drastic suicide methods; 
(4)	recognises there is a role for families, education, role models and health workers in identifying and supporting young people at risk of depression and self-harm;
(5)	notes The Sydney Morning Herald 7 February 2002 article regarding government alarm on suicides rates with the Minister for Youth Affairs stating that “Australia is losing the war against youth suicide and needs a fresh approach.”; and
(6)	calls on the Government to implement further measures to lower the rate of juvenile depression and youth suicide.
I thank the parliament for the opportunity to discuss this difficult and challenging matter of juvenile depression and youth suicide. As a parent it is an issue that I feel strongly about, and as a politician I feel it is my responsibility to say something about youth suicide because as policy and decision makers we have the capacity and the responsibility to do something about it.
Depression is a leading cause of ill health amongst young Australians, with juvenile depression often cited as a major contributing factor in suicide attempts. It is the third largest killer of young Australians, and in the last 30 years it has been on a steady increase, with a worrying 300 per cent increase in the suicide rate of young men. The World Health Organisation's Global burden of disease study predicts that by 2020 depression will be the second leading cause of death and disease worldwide. This is a worrying prognosis given the current trends here in Australia.
World Health Organisation comparative figures for youth suicide and self-inflicted injury have Australia second only to New Zealand amongst OECD countries. Australia has a rate of 23.1 per 100,000 for males and 6.1 per 100,000 people for females. Coming from a southern European background, I noted that some of the lowest rates of youth suicide are in southern European nations. Comparing some of these figures with our own rates for male and female youth suicides, we see that, for males and females respectively, the figures are: in Portugal, 3.7 and 0.8; in Italy, 7.3 and 1.6; in Greece, 5.6 and 0.8; and, finally, in France, 12.8 and 4.2. Those figures are, arguably, attributable to the nature of the family in those societies, with strong family ties and the power and value of the extended family providing support structures and alternative avenues of communication for youth generally but in particular for those at risk.
From the mid-nineties, the state and federal governments legislated for programs to alleviate this crisis. Recognition of this issue has now permeated all levels of our community, from the government down to the grassroots. Today, organisations from the Scouts to Rotary and other non-government organisations such as Here for Life are doing their bit to help in the fight against depression and youth suicide. In fact, a few weeks ago I met up with Andrew Kay and Terry Stuart from the Here for Life organisation, which deals daily with youth depression and suicide. I can tell you that these people are doing a tremendous job in their extensive daily contact with youth at risk.
There are some experts and professionals who believe that bringing youth suicide into the public arena runs the risk of drawing too much attention to it—glamorising it, perhaps—or giving kids ideas and encouraging copycat syndrome, or just causing a general desensitisation to the issue. I understand the basis of these concerns, but I believe that to not place this serious issue in the public arena runs the risk of closing off precious avenues of communication with our young people, because in this fight against youth suicide communication is vital. We need to speak to our children and educate them about depression and distress, no matter how difficult or morbid the issue may seem to us.
A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study from the United States shows that where these education awareness programs are in place youth suicide has dropped. The centre for adolescent research also encourages discussion in classrooms on mental health and wellbeing issues along with the discussion of youth suicide. I understand that about 85 per cent of schools in America have youth suicide programs built into the curriculum. This is an example we need to seriously consider for Australian schools—within the context of general health, depression, bullying and other issues—because schools and the peer group are a key to tackling this issue. 
It is important that we discuss these issues today because young people want us to, as attested by a recent Mission Australia survey which showed that depression is a high preoccupation amongst our young people. They certainly want to talk about it. In the same way as we concentrate on teaching children to read and write in their early years, so too do we, as they enter the challenging years of adolescence, need to teach them life skills—in particular, how to deal with adversity. Twenty years ago sex education was considered radical and controversial, with fears that if we talked about sex in schools then kids would have sex and girls would get pregnant. Experience has shown the contrary to be true. It is the same with suicide: we need to acknowledge it is an issue and deal with it at all levels—in particular, in schools.
More importantly, if we do address depression and anxiety, we know that recovery is possible. Evidence suggests this. Over the past three years youth suicide as a cause of death amongst 15- to 24-year-olds has dropped. This is a figure that the Here for Life organisation attributes to increased awareness and to education programs. It is these programs that need further expansion, but we need a whole-of-government approach at both the state and the national levels to tackle this issue and save our young people from depression and self-harm.
Statistics will never carry the pain felt by victims and families of young people lost to depression and suicide, but they do assist us to see through the fog of popular misconceptions relating to mental health and youth depression. Statistics prevent us from being lulled into false sense of security. One misconception is that most young people who commit or attempt suicide are clinically diagnosed with a mental illness with visible signs. Only one-quarter of those young people who take their life are actually said to be suffering from a diagnosed mental illness; the other three-quarters are considered normal young people.
Another fact is that 95 per cent of all youth suicide victims do display telltale signs: they leave a note, make comments to peers or family or begin to give away their possessions. How many parents who have lost their children utter the devastating words, `I did not know' or, `If only we knew'? Youth suicide in satellite and regional centres continues to increase. Some outer suburban and regional centres are considered hot spots, in particular for bullying and depression amongst young residents. The Dianella Community Health Service in Broadmeadows in my own electorate deals with such hot spots, where school bullying, isolation and depression form a potent mix in growing suburbs such as Sunbury and Craigieburn on Melbourne's outer edge.
Depression is not a new concept—it is part of human nature—but its increase is a concern. Similarly, youth suicide is also not new and is a part of life, albeit a destructive one. To believe otherwise is to be naive. You would be surprised how many kids consider suicide when they are feeling rejected or angry with the world and, because young people do not always understand the finality of death, they play out their fantasies. All it takes is a split second and it could all be over, sadly, without them ever really meaning to go that far.
Indigenous suicide rates in 15- to 24-year-olds in Australia are amongst the worst in the world. The rate of male and female youth suicides amongst our Indigenous community is 108 and 18 per 100,000 for male and females respectively. The same rate amongst young people in the general population is 27 for males and 6 for females per 100,000. A disturbing story told to me recently referred to a problem in the Tiwi Islands, where cages are placed around power poles to combat young males attempting suicide as a form of emotional blackmail to win over a girl's affections or in similar circumstances. Males are seemingly unable to deal with relationships in a healthy manner and are vulnerable to significant self-esteem problems.
As a result, some Here for Life programs target males in particular. Their Life's a Ball program brings professional sporting heroes into the classrooms. It uses young male sporting heroes to guide boys into healthy relationships and to improve their self-esteem. It is an innovative way to reach out to young men in order to teach them better life skills. In fact, it is almost a preventative cutting edge. There is a strong view, however, that the mix of government funding support is wrong and that funding is too top-heavy, focusing too much on research and academic surveys rather than on more practical and effective on-the-ground support for young people. We need to review these funding priorities to ensure money is put where it can help the most. 
Our children rely on us. The decisions we make will determine how they develop their talents, their dreams and their aspirations. Therefore, let us not turn a deaf ear to their fears and concerns. Instead, let us ask ourselves some fundamental questions about young people today. What do young people aspire to today? Do they view the world as their oyster? Do they feel that they can do anything because they are young and have their entire life ahead of them? Are they coping with the fast-changing society around them?
Today's approach in this parliament to the issue of juvenile depression and youth suicide is an opportunity to show the public that both sides of politics can work together to connect the dots. This leads me to my final point: an overall approach by government must involve the issue of youth suicide being considered across all portfolios, not just the current youth affairs portfolio. When we decide our health, education, family, recreational, social welfare and even industrial relations and immigration policy objectives and initiatives, we should be conscious of how those policies, budgets and programs will impact on the hopes, the aspirations and the opportunities we give to our young people. They are after all—and we say this often—our most precious resource, and we need to treat them with greater care and give them a greater priority than I believe we are doing at the present moment.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—First of all, I would like to correct an error in part (1) of the member for Calwell's motion. In 2000, 338 young people took their own lives, not 2,363. By making this correction, I am not by any means suggesting that the true figure is not very serious indeed, simply that we must not exaggerate just to get a point across. The youth suicide statistics speak for themselves. They do not need to be beaten up to cause community outrage and concern. From my area of Townsville and Thuringowa, I certainly know exactly the problem related to youth suicide. It was only last Friday that I was speaking to one of our prominent funeral directors, who outlined in very clear and concise terms the difficulty that he sees each week and each year and the effect that it has on those of the family who are left behind.
The statistics from 2000 are the most recent statistics we have and, in that year, as I have mentioned, 338 young people took their own life. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds in Australia, behind motor vehicle accidents. This figure was 6.9 per cent of the total suicide figure of 2,363, representing approximately 12.5 deaths per 100,000 in this age group. This is slightly higher than the overall number of deaths from suicide per capita, which was just a little lower, at 12.2 per 100,000, but—and this is wonderful news—it is a decrease from a peak of 510 in 1997. These figures do not indicate that youth suicides are spiralling out of control, as some people would have us believe. What they do indicate, however, is that we are facing a very grave challenge to ensure that these figures continue to remain on the downward trend.
I am not going to dwell on statistics here today, but there are some useful statistics that provide an overview of the situation Australia finds itself in with regard to suicide. Young men are three times more likely to complete suicide than young women. Over the past decade, six times as many young men from rural and remote regions have completed suicide, as have young women from the same areas. Indigenous people are more likely to suicide than non-Indigenous people. Eighty-six per cent of suicides in Indigenous communities are male. I certainly know that from my own experience, having the deed of grant in trust island, Palm Island, in Halifax Bay, in my electorate. Fortunately, as with the national trend, the number of suicides on Palm Island has been considerably reduced. 
The overwhelming theme of these statistics is that our young men, who are at the greatest risk of suicide, should be considered—something that the federal government is well aware of and is actively seeking to address. The statistic that really hits home for me is that for every suicide death there are 40 to 50 suicide attempts. That means that for those 338 young people who took their own lives in 2000 almost another 20,000 attempted to do so. I am not trying to sensationalise these figures or sensationalise suicide—far from it. By the same token, I am not suggesting that the figures are continuing to worsen—they are not. I am simply highlighting the precipice we are teetering on where youth suicide is concerned. I acknowledge the challenge we face, and so does the federal government. A lot of hard work, a lot of heartache and a lot of determination from families, friends, health workers and governments has led to a steady decrease in the number of youth suicides in Australia. As I have already stated, in 2000, 338 young Australians took their lives. That was 42 less than the year before and 172 less than the highest figure of 510 in 1997. We are still a long way from winning the battle, but perhaps this suggests that we are beginning to get on the front foot.
As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs stated in his speech at the National Conference of Suicide Prevention in June this year, `one suicide is one suicide too many'. The federal government will not rest until the battle is won. Another thing I would like to draw from the minister's address at the conference, and something I have mentioned here, is the importance of not sensationalising suicide and suicide statistics. While we need to raise the profile of suicide prevention, we have to make sure we raise the profile of the reality of suicide rather than the sensation of suicide. We have to walk a fine line between presenting the community with the facts and realities of suicide to help them combat it and beating the facts out of proportion so as to ensure it gets the attention it requires or deserves.
Having a child commit suicide is a devastating event for parents and other family members. Compounding this grief is the taboo still associated with suicide and the sense of shame, guilt or blame that so many families feel. This self-recrimination by parents, siblings or friends can continue indefinitely after a suicide, and prevents the normal healing process taking place. At a time when family members should be coming together to share their grief, they are being torn further apart with feelings of guilt, shame and hurt. The only way to prevent this is to teach our young that suicide is not the answer to their problems and that support is only ever a question away. They have to know that there is always someone who will talk to them to help them find solutions to their problems. Whether it be a family member, a friend, a youth worker or a counselling telephone line, someone is always there.
One of the things I have learnt from talking to local community groups and churches is that the feeling that suicide should not be talked about is a direct causal factor in not only the suicides themselves but also the confusion and self-recrimination felt by family members who have lost a loved one. We have to remove this reluctance to discuss suicide. One of the biggest myths about suicide is that talking about suicide will lead to suicide. That was a point made by the member for Calwell. It is patently untrue. Indeed, it would appear to be quite the opposite. One of the most effective ways to prevent a suicide is to get the person contemplating taking their life to talk about what they are going through and why they feel life is no longer worth living.
In Townsville, Lifeline receives about 700 calls a month—65 per cent are from females, 23 per cent are from males and in the remaining 10 per cent there has been no determination of the sex of the caller. These percentages are almost the direct reverse of the percentages of males and females who commit suicide. I find that interesting. Based on the 2000 figures, approximately 78 per cent of young people who commit suicide are male and 22 per cent are female. I think it is fair to draw the conclusion from this that the reluctance of young men to ask for help or to discuss their problems is a big factor in the fact that they are four times more likely than young women to complete a suicide attempt. This is something we need to combat if we are going to make further inroads into reducing youth suicide. Young people, men especially, need to feel that it is okay to talk to someone about their feelings; that it is okay to turn to someone for support. That person does not have to be a parent. It can be a friend, a teacher or a youth worker—basically, anyone they feel comfortable with. 
The federal government has spent a great deal of time with stakeholders in formulating its suicide prevention strategies to ensure that they take into account not just the need to show young people that suicide is not an option but the need to educate them, their parents and their families on how to deal with depression, how to communicate effectively and how to deal with issues such as substance abuse. Last Friday, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, announced another $550,000 for 12 projects as part of the federal government's $66.4 million National Suicide Prevention Strategy. The strategy grew out of the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, and I was very pleased to see that result.
The Youth Roundtable has also been working closely with the federal government and providing highly valuable insights into the issues facing young Australians. In the short moment I have left to me, I would like to conclude with a quote from a Youth Roundtable member's executive summary. Rebecca Ebert states:
... youth suicide cannot be solved by just one strategy or my passion alone. It needs to gain strength from not only community initiatives and support, but also political endorsement.
Let me assure you, Rebecca, that this government does endorse youth suicide prevention strategies, and it does recognise that one strategy alone will not be sufficient. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Youth Suicide</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—Being a young person in Australia today can be pretty tough. Tragically, for some, it is unbearable. Most young people are forced to confront increasingly complex issues, such as unemployment, illicit drug taking, parental and peer pressure, the pressures of achieving excellence in education on a daily basis and the unrelenting dilemmas associated with sexuality and the difficulty in establishing one's identity. Many young people feel unable or ill-equipped to deal with these constant pressures. Tragically, as a consequence, they become desperate enough to take their own life. According to the conservative figures of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 41,000 Australians died from suicide between 1979 and 1998.
Tragically, approximately 50 Tasmanians commit suicide each year and between 15 and 20 come from the north-west coast. The majority of individuals committing suicide are young males aged between 18 and 30. Whilst young females in Tasmania are far more likely to contemplate suicide, young males are four times more likely to actually take their own life. According to a comprehensive study conducted in 1996 by a Hellyer College senior secondary student Kelly Farrow, a study which received nationwide interest and publicity, 53 per cent of Tasmanian youths know a friend or family member who has attempted suicide whilst 30 per cent know a friend or family member who completed suicide. Of the 3,900 youths surveyed, 51 per cent of females and 48 per cent of males had contemplated suicide. In addition, it is estimated that one in five individuals in Tasmania suffers from depression each year. These figures clearly indicate that depression and suicide are major health problems in Australia and in my home state of Tasmania.
Traditionally, measures implemented by the Commonwealth to reduce youth depression and suicide have been largely crisis driven rather than preventative, and it is prevention that needs more attention. In treating the effects of depression and suicidal thoughts as a complex amalgam of causes and effects which requires a holistic approach to tackling it, we have certainly come a long way. Treatment for depression was once considered solely in physical terms. Depression was considered the consequence of too much blood within the body and was treated by removing this so-called `excess' blood, generally with leeches, as parodied in the Blackadder episode `Bells'. 
Sadly, not only are the effects of depression and suicidal thoughts traumatic for the individual but they are also both confusing and exhausting for the family. Families often feel helpless bystanders to their loved one's illness. Following a completed suicide, the family are exposed to many conflicting emotions—bewilderment, guilt, anger and resentment are the most common. More funds are needed to increase the information available to families about depression. Families in particular need to be educated about the behaviours associated with, and the emotions experienced by, an individual suffering from depression. Likewise, support for families should be made more available in the battle for prevention. They, too, need to know they are not alone in their concerns, their heartache and their endeavours.
The role of schools is also very important in reducing youth depression and suicide. Young people spend easily half their young life at school, which makes it an essential target area. The Commonwealth should concentrate more funds and programs on establishing learning packages about mental health issues—helping to educate schools and their learning communities on the special needs of those suffering from depression and other mental disorders. If people in the school community are fully informed of the seriousness of depression and enlightened as to the warning signs of the illness, they will be able to comfort and support a depressed individual through these difficult times. Depression is an illness, not a stigma.
There are a number of government initiatives in place that have played a positive role in informing our society about youth depression and suicide. National Youth Week is valuable in promoting the important role that Australian youth play in our country, but the fact that we have a specific focus week probably reflects more on our neglect of youth in general rather than on our capacity for valuing youth. Non-profit organisations such as Here for Life, Lifeline and Kids Helpline also play a crucial role in providing ongoing support to depressed and suicidal youth. So too will the On the Spot program, with funding of $200,000 over the next three years to combat the problem of youth suicide in my electorate. Education and information is the key to preventing youth suicide. I would like to thank my young staffer Eliza Young for her invaluable contribution to my appreciation and understanding of this important issue.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I rise to support the motion presented by the member for Calwell and thank her for her thoughtful work in crafting it and presenting this important problem to the parliament. Youth suicide is an issue which unfortunately has personal significance and relevance to me. A very close family friend took his own life some years ago. It was not evident; the signs were not altogether clear. It is something that has left the family with great pain and with scars that have yet to heal—and may never heal. Yet, from my own personal experience, I know this was a very strong family. The causes are not always evident, the triggers are not always obvious, but in every case it is a tragedy. So I think that there are three important things to examine: firstly, the trends; secondly, some of the causes; and thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the responses.
The trend we face in Australia is genuinely disturbing. If youth suicide refers to the occurrence of suicide amongst people between the ages of 12 and 24, what we find is that the suicide rate in Australia has increased dramatically. Between 1979 and 1997 the suicide rate for males aged between 12 and 24 rose by 71 per cent. In 1999 there were 2,495 recorded cases of suicide, of which approximately 80 per cent were male. Although this figure dropped marginally, to 2,363 in 2000, it remains a problem of stunning impact on our young people. These figures may in fact be lower than the reality because in many cases it is difficult to establish if death was intentional or unintentional, most particularly in cases of motor accidents involving a single driver where there was no restraining device. We see in particular that suicide in rural areas and amongst Indigenous communities and amongst those who are unemployed is a significant problem far beyond even that faced in Australia more generally. 
What are the causes? We find that suicide is driven at two different levels. First, there is the personal crisis or the short-term trigger, whether this be school based, relationship based or law based. Secondly, this often comes against the background of larger risk factors or longer-term predispositions. In particular, these include issues such as childhood adversity, social disadvantage or psychiatric illness.
As the member for Calwell mentioned, although an overwhelming link between mental illness and suicide does not exist, there is clearly a relationship. When we look at that and see the relationship between unemployment and social disadvantage as being a major trigger in the cause of suicide, particularly amongst males and particularly within the rural area, there is obviously a clear pattern; and, as there is a clear pattern, it is possible to identify some of the responses we can take. So how do we prevent suicide?
In the 1999-2000 federal budget, approximately $48 million was committed for a National Suicide Prevention Strategy, the theme of which is twofold: firstly, that every life counts; and, secondly, that we seek to save each individual. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy includes, firstly, targeting the community in general through work force education and through training—because bullying is one of the things that leads to low self esteem and loss of self worth and it goes to the question which is raised; and, secondly, acknowledging that it is critical to highlight and target high-risk groups and to identify those behaviours. So there is a $48 million program; it is a start. It has helped with the delivery of over 2½ thousand training programs, it has helped with the Reach Out program and it has helped to boost rural and regional youth counselling services. But there is no easy answer. Ultimately, it is about identification of risk factors; it is about intervention following triggers, as we see them; and, above all else, it is about helping develop a sense of self worth.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—First of all, it is a pleasure to speak on the issue raised in the motion presented by the member for Calwell. Mental illness and its aftermath and youth suicide are two of the few remaining subjects existing within this community that are taboo. At the outset I commend the member for Calwell for raising this issue. It is a heartbreaking issue. I am sure that many of us here and around the country have experienced the after-effects of youth suicide. It is something like a stone being thrown hard into a pond, with its ripples continuing for a number of years—across family members and those who knew the person who committed suicide. A large degree of guilt is associated with it as well, particularly for those who are closest to the person who has successfully committed—if you can `successfully' commit—suicide. There have been recent examples of suicide among people I have known, and guilt is a very large part of the survivors'—for want of a better term—experience. Consequently, it touches lives across our nation every day. As elected representatives, we have a responsibility to tackle this problem head-on and to raise this issue in and with the community and to amplify it.
I would like to talk about the action that is needed to address youth suicide. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of paragraph (6) of the motion that has been put forward by the member for Calwell, which:
calls on the Government to implement further measures to lower the rate of juvenile depression and youth suicide.
I would also briefly like to outline the services that are already in place and the roles that they play in identifying young people at risk, with a particular emphasis on an innovative service that is being offered in my electorate of Holt.
When young people intentionally harm themselves we, as a society, have let them down, because it can be prevented. Mental health problems are attributed to 90 per cent of all suicides, and one of those problems is depression. Each week, on average, 10 young people in Australia will take their own lives and many more will try. These statistics are drawn from the age category of 15- to 24-year-olds. Regardless of the spin that is put on them, these statistics are a national tragedy. Despite a decrease in suicide since 1997, with injury being listed as the leading cause of mortality for this age group, intentional self harm is still the second leading cause of death, with car accidents being the first. 
It is clear from paragraphs (2) and (3) of this motion that mortality rates for young males caused by self harm are a great deal higher than for females— four times higher, according to the most recent statistics for the year 2000. Males from the lower socioeconomic group die at a rate of 1.7 per cent more than those in the higher socioeconomic group. The horrifying situation is exemplified by the statistic that one in five deaths in the age group of 25- to 34-year-olds is suicide. I believe that, as a society, we urgently need to address the following issues which will help combat youth suicide and ultimately save lives. We need to actively promote and resource the mental health services in our communities that currently exist for young people, particularly those provided by non-government organisations which offer fantastic services at a very low cost at the grassroots of the community, at the coalface—services that can assist and identify at risk young people and help break down the problems, particularly lack of awareness, lack of diagnosis and lack of treatment.
As I said—I need to emphasise this—these services need to be promoted; they cannot just be hidden behind the so-called shame that is associated with mental illness. Our youth need to know that help is out there. We desperately need to destigmatise depression and mental health issues in our communities and our schools. We need to educate Australia about mental health as a matter of absolute urgency, because its cost is just too great to blithely ignore. We need a greater amount of research into youth suicide. Currently, there is no or very little research that exists which examines suicide rates amongst young people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. In particular, though, promotion and extra resourcing also needs to occur for services that exist to help young people in housing, legal aid, employment, education and health at a community level. It is not good enough just to expect Centrelink to do this.
I am running out of time but, before I do, I must state that in Holt the community is fortunate enough to have a Visy Cares centre, which is located in Clow Street, Dandenong. The centre provides a broad range of services for young people and it has about 24,000 contacts per year. This service that is being offered is a great one. The manager of the Visy Cares centre, Dave Glazebrook, has informed me that, to his knowledge, since the centre's inception five years ago, not one young person who has contacted the centre for assistance has taken their own life.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I am pleased to be able to support the motion moved by the member for Calwell and to make a number of points in speaking to it. First of all, Australia is not No. 1 for its rate of youth suicide. Although our rate is far too high, we are not top of the rankings, as is sometimes said. Secondly, the youth suicide rate is falling and has been since 1997. Thirdly, the National Suicide Prevention Strategy is well based on current research on the prevention of harm to and the treatment of those at risk.
Since we have discussed some of the aspects that might assist, it might help the House to talk a little about some of the things that are already part of the national strategy. The role of families is recognised, and resources are given to recognise early warning signs for mental health problems, to access professional help and to support children and young people with a mental health program. There is a school program called MindMatters, which is focused on prevention and early intervention in school and offers a mental health promotion resource for teachers and the like who each day are in contact with young people at risk. There is also a FamilyMatters program, which again deals with mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention, in conjunction with the school program.
Over the last 40 years, as we have seen a fall in the rate of suicide amongst older adults and a dramatic fall in deaths from motor vehicle accidents, we have seen a large rise in the rate of youth suicide amongst young males. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death amongst young Australians—second only to motor vehicle accidents. The rate of suicide amongst Australian males aged 15 to 24 has increased 3½ times between 1964 and 1997. Over the same period, the rate for females rose only 1.4 times the 1964 rate. As I mentioned, it is often said that we have the highest rate in the world. In fact, a 1996 UNICEF study examining youth suicide rates in 32 countries ranked Australia as having the ninth highest rate of male youth suicide, behind Eastern European countries and some developed countries, such as Finland, New Zealand and Norway. In 1996, the WHO ranked Australia 13th for male youth suicide. 
Youth suicide increased up to 1997, but since then youth suicide has declined significantly in terms of both the number of suicides and the rate of suicide. Since 1997 there has been a 35 per cent fall in suicide amongst the 15- to 24-year-old age group. Disaggregated figures since 1998 show that rural areas have a higher rate of suicide. Some ABS data have shown that the rate is 50 per cent higher in rural areas than in metropolitan areas. The ABS has also found that the suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is 1.6 times the rate for non-Indigenous Australians and that suicide rate amongst Aboriginal males aged 15 to 19 is four times higher than for non-Aboriginal people.
There is some recent research on this rise. In a paper published in 2000 in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, Lynskey, Degenhardt and Hall found that societal and other changes may be responsible for the rise in youth suicide since the 1960s. They also concluded that this cohort would not be at increased risk of suicide throughout life. Over this time frame, there has been a rise in psychosocial disorders such as substance use disorders, affective disorders and antisocial behaviour. However, they cautioned against attributing the increased suicide rate to a rise in psychosocial disorders alone. Their conclusion was that, to reduce youth suicide, we need to focus on identifying and treating psychiatric illness and improving the effects of disrupted and dysfunctional parenting. As members of the House will know, mood disorders are eminently treatable.
There is some recent research on risk factors. Annette Beautrais has also published a paper in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. She examined risk factors, and she found them to include social and family risk factors such as parental separation, mental health factors such as affective disorders, substance use, antisocial behaviour, stressful life events such as interpersonal losses and conflict, and individual vulnerability—those with certain personality characteristics. The article concluded by suggesting that suicidal behaviours in young people are frequently, although not invariably, the end point of adverse life sequences in which multiple risk factors combine to encourage the development of suicidal behaviour.
Prevention should focus on improved public understanding of mental health issues, education programs for those who work with youth, the provision of adequate specialised mental health services for young people, follow-up and treatment of those at high risk, and development of general mental health programs.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—Youth suicide, intentional self-harm and depression have continued unabated in this country for the last 25 years. Young males commit suicide at four times the rate of females; young females are admitted to children's and women's hospitals in this country suffering from anxiety, depression and self-harm at five times the rate of males. You have to have different solutions for boys and different solutions for girls. The Sydney Morning Herald of 7 February this year, as was referred to in the motion by the member for Calwell, calls for a fresh approach. I do not care what you call it but an honest approach would be a beginning. Honesty on children and youth—in government, in public service, in business, in unions and in religious and ethnic organisations—would be a start. 
In the late 1970s in Australia, dramatic change occurred in the way children and young people were portrayed and represented in our community. Whilst it is true that great changes were also occurring in wider society at every level, our children and our young people paid the highest price. It is important to remember that a civilised country cares for its old and its young. Significant change occurred in many areas, but in this five-minute speech I have time to talk about only three: resource allocation, advocacy for children and young people, and connectedness—or the lack of connectedness—by the wider community with all the groups dealing with children and young people.
In 1979, in my state of South Australia and nationally and internationally the continued expansion of funding for children and young people which had occurred since 1950 stopped and went into reverse. It was the year unemployment began to become the entrenched scourge it still is today. It was the year that funds began to escape from public education at primary and junior secondary levels. The year 1979 was when state and federal governments, in a small way at first, greatly expanded funding to the business sector and the privileged classes in our society. It was the year in which there began the decline of children's and young people's share of the gross domestic product, which in all the figures that are given is the only figure that gives you an honest comparison and validity.
The 10 years from 1979 are the decade which marks the beginning of the increasing power of the philosophically ignorant and alien economists in treasuries and financial institutions in our nation and government. They saw the rise of the sophisticated criminal classes who, by greed and incompetence, destroyed state banks and demutualised public companies like NRMA, AMP, Colonial Mutual Life and so on; the questionable distribution of assets which had been gathered over some 150 years; and the wrecking of such modern companies and icons as Ansett and HIH. All this occurred when state and federal governments never had so much money. 
The Howard federal government is the highest taxing government in the nation's history, yet we allow reductions in funding for primary and junior secondary schools in real terms when we are dealing with alarming levels of literacy and numeracy, and social and health dysfunction. Successful and well-adjusted children and youth do not suicide, nor are they as prone to depression and self harm. The money is there but the will is not. Where have all the advocates for children and youth gone? Who are the champions at the political, institutional and community level? They have gone missing. Who could name a politician, a bureaucrat, an academic or a business, union or religious leader who has successfully advocated for all our children and youth, particularly the vulnerable, those at risk and the most needy? That is not to say eminent people have not tried; of course they have. They have just failed, and children and youth know it. That is the real problem: they know it all too well.
This brings me to the third aspect of what I want to address in this chamber today: the failure to connect all the groups who should be advocating for children and youth rather than simply speaking for their own self-indulgence and their own expansionism or diminution, irrespective of the consequences for individuals, families and the nation. Governments are handing out money to the already privileged; businesses with no social responsibility are managed at the whim of the financial markets; unions are too interested in propaganda and social engineering; religious and ethnic organisations are knowingly taking public money away from the most needy and saying nothing about it—the replacement of the public good with the private good. The balance is out of kilter. We know it, and the kids know it.
Leadership is an oft confused concept, particularly in the current climate of spin, image and self-indulgence. But this nation needs leaders as it never has before. The irony is that, at the very time leadership is required, those most able to lead are simply put off by the tawdry, shallow character assassinations occurring to public figures in this country and internationally almost on a daily basis. If we are serious about halting the increasing trend in youth suicide, self harm and induced depression, we had better find some real leaders because the money is there.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—As we have heard, suicide, particularly youth suicide, is a very serious problem that has perplexed many affluent societies—Western countries in particular—in the last several decades, as the number of young people dying from episodes of self harm soars. How we wish this was as simple as the member for Port Adelaide made it out to be. Unfortunately, depression and the results of depression—suicide—do not discriminate. People who suicide come from all walks of life. Many of them are very successful young people in our community, and parents and communities are completely puzzled and perplexed as to why they should want to take their own lives. Of course, there are many reasons for that.
In 1996-97 the number of people, particularly young males, taking their own lives in Australia was alarmingly high. The Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, took a leading role in establishing the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. As the then Minister for Family Services, I was tasked by the Prime Minister to establish that national program. Arm in arm with the National Youth Suicide Prevention Program was the national Youth Homeless Taskforce, also initiated by the Prime Minister and also part of my portfolio responsibilities. We know from established data that homeless people are at risk and that young people who are not living with their family and who have a communication problem with their parents carry a twofold risk of suicide. But there are many causes of suicide within our community.
The programs initiated by the Prime Minister were also financially supported by the government, and the government has recently committed further funding of $40 million over the next four years to continue youth suicide prevention programs. In 1997 I announced funding of about $48 million not only to go indirectly to support youth suicide prevention programs but also to support other family based programs to try to deal with this growing problem.
The Youth Homeless Taskforce had the primary objective of reuniting young people with their families. If that was not possible, assistance was given to ensure that young homeless people received coordinated assistance with health, housing, education and job opportunities. The National Youth Suicide Prevention program took a whole of community focus and sought the cooperation of everyone in the community. Some of the approaches aimed at improving awareness and training among health professionals in particular, as they are the first point of contact for help for many young people contemplating self harm. A reduction in suicides did appear to result, as the figures for males aged 15 to 24 went from 25 and 31 respectively in 1996-97 to 23 and 19 respectively in 1999-2000. However, I speak to this motion because I believe that, without continued focus on this community problem, the number of young people dying due to self harm will continue to be unacceptably high.
I was impressed by the attention this issue received from the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable participants. In her executive summary on youth suicide, Rebecca Ebert advocated a youth help page: one page at the beginning of every phone book listing help service phone numbers for issues from youth suicide and mental health to life options and transport. An executive summary by Adrian Pattra, another participant, suggested a practical life skills program to complement the current MindMatters program, which my colleague spoke about earlier today. Adrian Pattra suggested that the program would fulfil the criteria of interaction, relevance and information and would be based on the trial of his company, Little Leaps of Logic.
Young people are very capable of analysing the problems of youth and making recommendations that can work, as has been demonstrated by the work of the young people participating in the Prime Minister's Youth Roundtable. What we now need is the political will to ensure that youth suicide programs are given priority and continue to work, to reduce the appallingly high deaths from self harm and to alert the community to the fact that this issue and the senseless loss of young lives is a problem that belongs to all of us. As a community we need to be reminded of the real values and priorities in life and to pause occasionally to inquire what is going on in the lives and minds of young people within our sphere of influence. The prevention of the needless deaths of our young people must continue to be a national priority.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—I would like to congratulate the member for Calwell for bringing this very important motion to this parliament. It is very appropriate that youth suicide should be discussed in this House because it is an issue of such magnitude affecting so many Australians and their families. Youth suicide is an epidemic that is attacking young Australians from all economic and social backgrounds. Unfortunately, to date the Howard government—for that matter, all governments and social institutions—have failed to implement initiatives to stem this tragedy, a tragedy that is taking the lives of so many young Australians, particularly young men and Indigenous Australians.
Suicide is a very sad and complex issue. Research shows that when a person takes their life they do so because they feel helpless and do not believe their situation will ever change. It is a response to intolerable pain. Isn't it sad that we have so many young people feeling such intolerable pain that they are prepared to take their own lives?
Suicide involves a complex set of interacting factors. There are biological factors such as chemical imbalances; emotional factors, which relate to sadness, stress, anxiety, guilt and coming to terms with sexuality; and social factors, which deal with acceptance and the feeling that people must be accepted by their peers, not be seen to be different and not be labelled as crazy. It is all about ensuring that their self-esteem is maintained. When that is affected and when people feel they are not part of their peer group is, problems arise. Mental illness contributes to suicide, as does substance abuse and the fact that young people are more likely to take risks than other groups in our society.
The government's adherence to the cult of the individual and the promotion of competition I believe have added to the pressure that has been put upon young people. There is a feeling that exists in this society that success is all that counts: if you are not successful, you are a failure and therefore you are useless. And if you are useless what hope have you got for the future? I believe that, unless this is addressed at the core and young people see that there is more to being a success than being the best at this or the best at that—they have such enormous pressures placed on them—we will not be looking at some of the issues that are causing this epidemic in our society.
Suicide impacts more on young men—four times more on young men than on young women. Young women are five times more likely to inflict harm upon themselves. I believe there is more suicide among young men because there is greater pressure on them to perform than there is on young women. I chased around trying to find statistics of youth suicides within my local area. I found that on the Central Coast there were 39 per 100,000 males between the age of 15 and 24, and 14 young women per 100,000 who committed suicide in 2000. In the Hunter, there were 34 young men per 100,000 and three young women per 100,000 who committed suicide in 2000. These are young people whose lives are cut short and who had so much to offer our society.
There is a lack of preventative programs. The main area that you get information is through help lines. I had a young work experience student in my office last week. She spent 10 hours ringing organisations. She had difficulty finding any sort of information. Her comment to me was, `If I had a knife or a gun and was about to kill myself, I would do it because I have become so frustrated with being unable to access the information.'
It is time for the government to act. As a nation we cannot allow this epidemic to continue. The youth of Australia is our future. Every time a young person takes his or her life we lose the opportunity to benefit and gain from their contribution to our nation. As a society we are a poorer society. Unless this government and all governments act to stop this epidemic, we as a country will be poorer.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-12-02,"—Comprehensive data available since 1986 indicates that males living in our rural areas have a consistently higher rate of suicide than their urban counterparts. More detailed data suggests that there is also significant variation among rural districts, with remote settlements of fewer than 4,000 people being most affected. 
I represent a rural and regional electorate. All of the Riverina is affected by drought. Events such as this can have a terrible toll on people of all ages, especially many farming families and many small business families. Some of those families can simply see no way out. It does impact on everybody in the family situation. It is not only the drought that has a toll on farmers and small businesses and those in rural communities but the fact that life in regional Australia has many challenges. Some young people living in rural and regional Australia may also see that there is little future, little future for their whole community and indeed for themselves.
The fact that young men are much more likely to complete suicide than young women may in some way be attributed to the increase in our young ladies relocating from rural and regional areas to metropolitan centres. Perhaps their statistics are not counted or perhaps it is because this makes the social life of a young male in a rural area very difficult to endure. They perhaps can see no future and have no ability to meet and attract a partner. They seem to be at a loss as to how they can go about this.
Nobody should have to feel so much pain and loss that they see the only way out is to end their life. It has been interesting to listen to the contributions in this debate this afternoon. Some have taken the time to put blame on governments and many areas; some have taken the time to appeal for some understanding of depression and suicide. I guess it is very difficult for somebody looking to find an answer through a path of depression. They would find that very difficult to access, as the member for Shortland said.
It should not be acceptable that anyone should see that the only way out is to end their life. It should not be acceptable for a parent, a sibling or a friend to have to deal with the hurt of losing a loved one through suicide. Statistics available from Here for Life, an organisation which works to save many young lives and raise awareness about suicide and ways in which to prevent it, reveal that 10 young Australians will kill themselves this week alone—that is a horrific figure—and as many as 90 per cent of these people will give a warning of their intent to commit suicide.
In 1998, suicide was the second leading cause of death for 15- to 25-year-olds and now youth suicides are beginning to be at their lowest rate for a decade. This provides a glimmer of hope. In 2000, only one male aged between 15 to 24 years committed suicide in the Greater Murray area, which largely covers my electorate. One female also in this age group committed suicide. But in 1997, the number of males aged between 15 to 24 years in the Greater Murray Area Health Service who ended their lives was recorded at eight. The decreasing suicide figures stand in proud testament to the success of the work for Suicide Prevention Australia. The government has committed $48 million over five years to the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. To all the stakeholders involved in suicide prevention, to have some decrease in the number of these horrific events has been an enormous feat.
It is a sad day when a suicide prevention line such as operates in Griffith is a burgeoning business with demand far outstripping supply. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that we are aware of all the possible areas of assistance that are available, like the beyondblue web site. I urge you to enter the world of depression by visiting this site where you will see many stories, such as Hannah's. Hannah indicates that she was diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression. She indicated that her teacher, her family and her schools assisted her to come through the physically and mentally debilitating illness that she faced. She said that all she wanted was not to be sick any more. (Time expired)

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—Tomorrow marks the anniversary of the declaration of the poll in Newcastle that formalised my election to this parliament. One year has passed and now I can reflect on what being a member of the House of Representatives entails and exactly what the realities are in representing the people of Newcastle and the federal Labor Party. To represent the people of Newcastle has been both a pleasure and a challenge and I hope to do it for a lot longer. Newcastle has demanded strong representation from its new federal representative and rightly expects this member to be vocal, visible and accessible. It is a diverse electorate and all portfolio areas and all age groups in our changing city are represented. My constituents also experience a wide range of economic wealth. For example, 40,000 people who are health cardholders in my electorate are on low to moderate incomes. In Newcastle, the take-up of disability support pension is the second highest in the country, a legacy from our industrial past and a reflection of our status as the regional capital and centre for health and support services. The value of new harbourside properties in our revitalised CBD has now approached the million dollar mark. Newcastle's needs and interests will continue to be very diverse indeed.
In the past year, over 4,000 people have sought help from my office on a wide range of issues arising from their dealings with Commonwealth departments. It has been an amazing involvement and those people have, I hope, all been assisted in some way. A professional and dedicated staff supported by a very willing band of volunteers makes it possible to provide such extensive assistance. I thank all those people.
It has also been a pleasure to have attended over 200 functions and events and to have directly met with over 200 individuals and organisations regarding their problems, needs, successes or the ventures that they believe in. This has given me a great deal of insight into and understanding of the social and economic fabric of our city. Fortunately, in Newcastle community is what we do best. I am proud that my experiences have confirmed for me over this year that Newcastle is a city that supports collective success, cooperative partnerships and positive networking, with an organised army of community organisations and volunteers all working to ensure the community of Newcastle prospers.
Throughout this year, I have also been proud and amazed at the number of times Newcastle has emerged as an example of best practice during presentations to parliamentary committees of which I am a member. This has been particularly evident in the science and innovation committee's inquiry into research and development in Australia. Many submissions and contributors have noted the advanced nature of industry clustering in Newcastle. They acknowledge the success of our genuine commitment to skill sharing and knowledge transfers, as well as our outstanding partnerships with research centres and our university. The strong foundation laid in Newcastle for training, particularly in all fields of engineering and the sciences, has been both praised and lamented amongst warnings and predictions of a crisis in skill shortages facing Australia's manufacturing industry. Similarly, the inquiry into wireless broadband found Newcastle leading in the regional provision of broadband services with a thriving and competitive information technology industry emerging.
The quest for employment was well aired in Newcastle this year at the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the Job Network system. I will continue to pursue employment issues in parliament and these will be further developed at a job summit to be held in Newcastle next week. Although employment and economic figures show a local trend of growth, many mature age unemployed and unskilled youth continue to face a very uncertain employment future in Newcastle and the Hunter region. Local solutions appropriate to our region supported by cooperation between local, state and national governments would certainly assist. The Newcastle public hearings into veterans' entitlements also reflected the honesty of Novocastrians, who are always diligent in looking after the needs of those who have served this country. 
This year has also highlighted for me that this is indeed a time for government. Although I anticipated that legislation in parliament would deal with items that were important to my region and important to the nation, I perhaps did not predict that issues would also arise this year that had major implications for all of humanity—issues of human cloning, stem cell research, war and terrorism and, in particular, the outrage of the events in Bali that caused such tragic loss of life, grief and pain to so many Australians. This is a time for strong, stable, intelligent and informed government, intent on uniting the people of our nation and willing to contribute positively to unify all peoples in our Asia-Pacific region.
Issues of what constitutes life, issues of what constitutes quality of life and the issue of the survival of human life have been debated in this House this year, reinforcing that in Australia we need a government that builds on the characteristics that best distinguish mankind. This is vital as we prepare to again consider this nation's role in securing peace in our world. Unfortunately, it seems that, for some nations, war is seen as the only way to secure peace. History suggests that that is not the path to follow. Apparently war in Iraq creeps inevitably closer. There are 12,000 US troops already in Kuwait, with 50,000 troops presently in the Gulf. Four or five aircraft carriers will be in the Gulf in the new year, and weapons of war—not mass destruction—flood into Iraq at the present time via Europe and Syria in preparation for impending war. With the continuing and ever escalating conflict between Israel and Palestine spreading its tentacles into other countries and killing innocent bystanders, one wonders why Australia would not leave these regions to sort out their own problems—problems, unfortunately, in many cases fed by greed, self-interest, exploitation and disregard for human rights.
Events since September 11, such as the flood of refugees and displaced people all around the world, the tragic loss of life from the outrage in Bali and the threat of regional terrorism, reinforce that this is a time for convincing the Australian people to have faith in themselves as a strong and resourceful people, as people of great intellect, skill and compassion, and as people of fairness and decency who possess community and national pride based on equity, tolerance and compassion. It is also a time to secure this nation and its future, and for me that means electing a Labor government in the future. While I reflect that it is time for these directions, it is also time today, on the 13th anniversary of the Hon. Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia, to pay homage to a great man who truly led for all the men and women of Australia. Thank you, Gough, for three decades of inspiration.
As a new member, I remain proud to be a member of the federal Labor opposition. I believe that the Labor Party has a vision for this nation and that one day it will again gain government to lead this nation on behalf of all the men, women and children of Australia, with policies that show a way forward for a strong, secure and fair Australia. A genuine approach to border security and community safety—including a coastguard; a home affairs portfolio; a more humane approach to detention centres and asylum seekers—will become the task of a future Labor government. Other policies which will provide a legacy for the future generations of the 21st century include a better deal for education and health services, a fairer but less burdensome taxation regime, a more interventionist industry policy, a population policy that incorporates regional strategies, a new simplified structure of superannuation, significant reform of family payments including paid maternity leave, a national research strategy, a Kyoto based model for environmental sustainability, a system of tax credits targeted at low- and middle-income earners that acknowledges equity issues and promotes and rewards aspirations, the building of a skills rich and innovative nation able to respond to the changing world and its demands, and genuine support for regional development. 
Only a Labor government will integrate economic and social policy, with an economic and social wealth creation agenda that value adds and builds wealth into all the activities of the nation. Australia needs a Labor government that will pursue an economic agenda that promotes productivity, investment, innovation and nation building. Such a Labor government would balance market forces with a strategic national agenda, supporting a market that is both well regulated and strategically supported. Such a Labor government would also pursue a social agenda that rewards success but acknowledges the disadvantage of some to achieve the goals of success that everyone shares no matter their personal circumstances or their chosen place of residence. The right to a good education, good health services, gainful employment and some security in all phases of life—youth, family raising and ageing—are aspirations we all share.
In my first year I have had confirmed for me my pride in the people of Newcastle and I have gained a deeper understanding and respect for their economic and social activities. I remain convinced that Australia needs and deserves a quality of government that does not exist at this time. I remain a proud member of the Labor opposition and am even more determined to be a part of a Labor government after the next election. It has been a pleasure to represent Newcastle and to be a member of this parliament.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Newcastle Electorate</title>,Grievance Debate,9,1
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the report entitled Report 392—Annual report for 2001-2002.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I thank the House. I take pleasure in tabling the JCPAA's annual report 392 for 2001-02. The committee had a very productive year last year, despite the break between parliaments. Toward the end of the 39th Parliament the committee experienced an unprecedented period of disharmony, leading to the tabling of three dissenting reports. There had been a total of only three such dissents in its 89-year history. Happily, the 40th Parliament in the 90th year of the committee has seen a return to a spirit of constructive cooperation with attempts to achieve shared outcomes.  
Major inquires completed during the financial year include report 384, Review of Coastwatch, an extensive examination of the Coastwatch organisation in the context of the challenges currently facing it. The report contained 14 recommendations, including some with resource intensive implications for the government. All of those recommendations were accepted in the government's response, which was tabled on 19 September 2002.
Report 386, Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997, was a timely examination of the operation of the legislation after three years. It was the final review of the suite of financial framework legislation, including the Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, undertaken by the committee in the previous parliament. In report 386 the committee's overall finding was that the Auditor-General Act provides an effective framework for the ANAO to carry out its functions. However, recommendations in the former proposed amendments to the act, which will enhance the power of the Auditor-General to carry out his responsibilities effectively, were accepted by the government in its response tabled on 19 September 2002. 
In addition to the major inquires tabled during the last financial year, the committee reviewed all Auditor-General's reports tabled during 2000-01. The reports reviewed dealt with a wide range of subject matter, including aspects of the Department of Defence administration and contract management in areas such as fraud control, Defence Force Reserves, Defence estate management and the amphibious transport ship project. The handling of outsourced service delivery by Centrelink was the subject of two reviews and there was also a review of the implementation of the outsourcing of IT services across the whole of government.
With respect to this range of matters generally, the committee found that contract management and the oversight of large and complex outsourcing programs continued to provide serious challenges to the Commonwealth public sector. I am nevertheless pleased to be able to report to parliament that most of the committee's recommendations on both the major inquiry reports and the administrative recommendations contained in reviews of the Auditor-General's reports continue to be accepted. This is in itself the most telling indicator of the committee's continued effectiveness in scrutinising executive government.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to. 
I would like to make some short comments on the amendments that have been moved in the Senate to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Labor's proposal to retain early discharge but make it available after two years makes no sense. It could hardly be described as `early' discharge. Labor has provided no arguments explaining why early discharge should be available after two years. The amendment does not address the problems the bill is seeking to address. As the government has said on previous occasions when this bill has been considered, the current qualifying criteria are not working. They are not an adequate test of whether the bankruptcy arose from misfortune rather than misdeed and the current regime has produced discriminatory results. For this reason, the government does not accept this amendment. 
The government does not support an amendment to repeal section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides an offence for rash and hazardous gambling prior to bankruptcy. Problem gambling is a serious issue and affects many people. These are not the people at whom this offence is directed. The government has decided to retain this offence for the small number of cases in which a person has, prior to becoming bankrupt, lost money in a calculated way which ignores the interests of his or her creditors. In practice, very few people are prosecuted for this offence. The bankrupt will only be guilty of an offence under that section if the gambling was rash and hazardous and materially contributed to his or her insolvency. It is necessary to establish in relation to each instance of gambling that it was both rash and hazardous. The courts have approached this offence on the basis that, although all gambling is of its nature hazardous, not all gambling is rash. This refers to conduct which a person can be expected to anticipate seriously risks insolvency. This is unlikely to be the case in relation to problem gambling which constitutes an illness. Therefore, Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia would attempt to prosecute someone only where the gambling is criminal in nature.
It is inappropriate to include amendments to part 10 of the act in this bill. I have recently announced a comprehensive review of part 10. ITSA and the Attorney-General's Department released an issues paper on 9 October and during November they have been conducting focus groups in each state. Labor's amendments have been developed with no consultation and are not based on any real evidence that there is a problem. They also make the system more complex for people who use part 10 arrangements. The government's review will determine whether any problems exist, the extent of these problems and, in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, the best solutions to these problems. ITSA and the Attorney-General's Department will report to the government on the findings of the review early next year. If the review finds that legislative changes are necessary, the government will introduce those changes as soon as possible.
Labor's amendment to subsection 265(8) is misconceived. That subsection makes it an offence for a debtor to contract a debt greater than $500 in the two years prior to bankruptcy where the debtor has no reasonable prospect of being able to repay it. The bill proposes to remove the $500 threshold. This is to correct an anomaly in the current law which allows an insolvent debtor to contract a large number of debts, each of which is less than $500, and not be liable to prosecution. It is not aimed at debtors who fail to pay one or two small bills such as utilities or groceries, which the prosecutor is unlikely to decide to prosecute. The amendment would exclude `necessary personal or household expenses' from the scope of the offence and the amendment is unnecessary.
It is inappropriate in the context of a bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act to consider amendments to the Corporations Act. The corporations agreement with the states requires the approval of the Ministerial Council on Corporations before the Corporations Act is amended. The ministerial council has not considered these amendments. The Corporations Act already provides substantial protection against asset stripping to defeat creditors. It provides that holding companies can be liable to debts incurred by their subsidiaries while insolvent. This places sensible and workable restrictions on the liability of companies for the debts of their subsidiaries. Consequently, this amendment is not appropriate and the government does not accept it. (Extension of time granted)
The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 contains important measures to address the perception that bankruptcy has become too easy and to encourage more debtors to consider seriously the alternatives to bankruptcy. The measures contained in the bill have broad support amongst stakeholders in the bankruptcy industry. The bill was first introduced in 2001, and industry has been waiting for these changes since then. I call on the opposition to support the bill as originally introduced to the parliament so that these important measures can be implemented without further delay.",REPS,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—The opposition will support the government's motion to facilitate the passage of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. We recognised at the outset that the bulk of the legislation is appropriate and necessary, and for that reason we facilitated debate in the Main Committee. It is disappointing, however, that the government has not heeded criticisms that the opposition has made of the bill. Essentially those criticisms are in two categories. We thought it was necessary to introduce provisions to alleviate the harsher consequences of the bill for low income bankrupts and, at the other end of the spectrum, we thought it was necessary to address the abuse of the Bankruptcy Act by high income individuals intent on avoiding tax. In the media in recent months we have seen a number of examples of that occurring.
The Attorney addressed some of the issues, but I would like to place on the record the essential points of the amendments moved by the opposition. Firstly, we proposed retaining the early discharge mechanism in the Bankruptcy Act and, to establish a midway point between the government's abolition of the mechanism and the currently specified six months, we proposed a period of two years. We understood that that had been considered within the Attorney-General's Department as an option. We believe that would have facilitated those on low incomes to achieve a clean slate in circumstances where their indebtedness had resulted from misfortune as opposed to deliberate or reckless expenditure.
We also proposed that a person could not be prosecuted under section 265(8) of the Bankruptcy Act for incurring reasonable or necessary personal or household expenses. The government, as the Attorney indicated, proposes to abolish the $500 cap. We believe that the abolition of that cap should certainly not be implemented. We note the Attorney referred to the discretion of the prosecutors; however, we believe these things are too important when they affect the basic—literally, when it is down to this level—ability of the very poor to survive in terms of, for example, paying a rental bond or paying for orthodontic treatment on their kid's teeth. We believe they should not be the subject of penal sanction if the expenses are of the nature of a necessary personal or household expense.
We also proposed repealing section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act, which we believe—on advice from organisations involved in the treatment of chronic gambling—has the potential to retrospectively criminalise problem gambling; indeed, on our advice, actually may result in an impediment to people coming forward to admit that they have a gambling habit in circumstances where, as a result of them incurring gambling debts, they could be faced with imprisonment. We also proposed strengthening the protections contained in part 10 of the Bankruptcy Act. Our proposal would have strengthened the protections against abuse by high income individuals intent on defrauding the Australian Taxation Office. We welcome the fact that, in response to the opposition's concerns about the abuse of part 10, the Attorney-General has asked the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia to review that part of the Bankruptcy Act, and we welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to that review.
In the main, however, it is regrettable that the government has failed to acknowledge the inequities in its approach to reforming bankruptcy laws at the lower end of the scale, particularly with respect to the incurring of a debt of $500 for necessary household and personal expenditure and with respect to problem gambling and, at the other end of the scale, with respect to failing to address abuses by high income earners. We feel that was a misjudgment. (Extension of time granted) As I indicated previously, there are however measures in the bill that the opposition supports—and indeed has supported from the outset—and for that reason we will not oppose the passage of the bill. I should indicate, however, that we will monitor—to the best of our abilities and with the assistance of organisations involved in assisting, in particular, the very poor—the impact of these changes on low to middle income earners who struggle under this government's policies, including the impact of the indirect taxation system with the goods and services tax. We will revisit these issues when the information becomes available and, if necessary, move appropriate amendments.

That the amendments be agreed to.
There has been considerable activity on the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 over the last few weeks. In the course of debate in the House, reference was made to negotiations with the opposition about further possible amendments to the bill. Those negotiations dealt with the issue of providing for some involvement by the intergovernmental committee of ministers in the decision to authorise the use of the Australian Crime Commission's coercive powers. I want to place on record the government's appreciation for the cooperation of the opposition in engaging in constructive negotiations and, in particular, the positive role played by the member for Banks in his capacity as the shadow justice minister. I am pleased to advise that the negotiations were successful.
The compromise reached with the opposition is that the board will be able to authorise the use of coercive powers, but the intergovernmental committee will have the power to revoke that decision. Put another way, the IGC will have the power to veto authorisation decisions of the board. The solution provides for an enhanced role for the IGC but permits the board to authorise the use of coercive powers, with those decisions taking effect immediately. The government introduced amendments in the Senate to give effect to this compromise, and those amendments were supported by Labor. The government also agreed to two further amendments proposed by the Democrats. These amendments will remove limitations on the information that may be requested by the Commonwealth minister to the chair of the ACC board. This will ensure that the minister has access to sufficient information to determine whether sensitive information should be disclosed to the IGC of the ACC and the parliamentary joint committee of the ACC. 
These amendments in no way detract from the primary purposes of the bill. Passage through this House will ensure that the Australian Crime Commission will be able to commence on 1 January 2003. The ACC will build effective national law enforcement operations in partnerships with state and territory police forces. It will provide a better basis for the coordination of national criminal intelligence and the targeting of organised crime. It will establish national criminal intelligence priorities, undertake criminal intelligence collection and analysis and investigate criminal activity of national significance. It will retain the coercive powers currently available to the National Crime Authority and be able to proactively collect and analyse information about organised crime networks and their key figures. It will have a streamlined reference process to determine priorities and the circumstances in which coercive powers can be used. It will have better linkages with national security intelligence and complement other law enforcement agencies in cooperative national law enforcement arrangements. In short, it will be Australia's premier organised crime fighting body, well equipped to deal with the law enforcement challenges facing Australia in the 21st century. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—From the very outset of this debate, I highlighted that the model proposed by the government in its Australian CrimeCommission Establishment Bill 2002 raised fundamental points of principle for the Labor Party. Labor is serious about fighting crime, but Labor is also serious about upholding important principles of responsibility and accountability within our parliamentary system of government. That is why we sought amendments to this bill designed to support the principles that informed the establishment and operation of the National Crime Authority in the first place.
A defining feature of the NCA is that it holds coercive powers similar to those of a royal commission. These are the powers to obtain documents and other evidence and to summons a person to appear at a hearing to give evidence under oath. As it now stands, these coercive powers can be exercised only in very defined circumstances and with ultimate accountability resting with the intergovernmental committee made up of the various ministers. At the time the NCA was set up, there was extensive debate about the nature of these coercive powers and recognition of the fact that no government would allow them to be solely in the hands of a police force or bureaucrats. That is why the architects of the NCA devised the references system whereby the ministerial-level IGC refers matters to the NCA for investigation. Under the new model proposed for the ACC, the board—and remember it is made up of police commissioners and bureaucrats—will not only determine priorities for the organisation but also have the power to `press the green button' on the use of the coercive powers. The board can also approve the use of the powers for the purpose of intelligence gathering, a move away from the investigative focus of the NCA.
Overall, the new model is a major departure from the current regime, where special powers may only be exercised after a matter has been referred to the NCA by the intergovernmental committee. Labor's objective in seeking amendments to this bill was to ensure ministerial accountability under our system of responsible government. The amendments moved by the government during the last sitting week of the Senate go some distance towards achieving that objective. The government's amendments effectively give the ministerial-level intergovernmental committee a power of veto over a decision of the board to authorise the use of the special or coercive powers of the new Australian Crime Commission. It approaches the issue of ministerial accountability via the route of a power of veto rather than via a power of approval. This is certainly a significant improvement on the original model, which would have given the board an unfettered power to approve the use of coercive powers. Indeed, the original model even allowed a subcommittee of the board to authorise the use of the coercive powers—a situation that was reversed by an earlier package of government amendments in this House. The improved model for the new ACC means that the ministerial-level IGC must be given a copy of the board's determination to authorise the use of the coercive powers. 
The intergovernmental committee may then request further information about the board's determination. Armed with that information, the ministers have 30 days in which to make a decision about whether to overturn the board's determination. Five members of the IGC, plus the Commonwealth Minister for Justice and Customs, are needed to overturn the board's decision. The overall effect of the amendments is to reinstate the principle of ministerial accountability into the process for the authorisation of the special powers that will be held by the new Australian Crime Commission. 
On the basis that these amendments achieve Labor's stated objective of ensuring an appropriate level of ministerial accountability and responsibility, Labor supports the amended bill. That is the way it should be. With important legislation like this, it is important to have a proper parliamentary process—proper scrutiny by parliamentary committees and dialogue between the government, the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate—and, where possible, to reach consensus. That is what has happened here. We have an amended bill that now has, I think it is fair to say, the support of the whole of the parliament. I am pleased that the government also took on board non-contentious proposals that were put forward by the Democrats. (Extension of time granted) We do not want a situation where there is seen to be a government and opposition conspiracy, to the exclusion of other players in the Senate. It is important that other players, like the Democrats, are able to contribute, as they have here, and I am pleased that the government has picked up those amendments.
In the middle of this week there is going to be some contentious legislation debated in the Senate. I urge the government to continue the dialogue with all parties in the Senate and to look closely at the Senate committee report on that matter, which I understand will come out tomorrow. Again, where there is amended legislation to go through this parliament in terms of ASIO's powers, it is in the national interest that the legislation has the broad support of both sides of parliament. It would be unwise for battlelines to be drawn, but the government needs to appreciate that there are certain fundamental principles that we on this side of the House will continue to fight for. That is why I am pleased that, in relation to the ministerial accountability question, we did come up with a model that, whilst it is not my preferred model and it is a departure from what is currently in existence, is acceptable. We as a parliament should take our role seriously in relation to these special powers. That is why it is important, in relation to the bill which is yet to be debated in the other place, that the dialogue continues with all the major players.
I want to commend this Attorney-General. During the time that he has been in the parliament he has seen the value of parliamentary committees and, when he was in opposition, he saw the value of continuing dialogue. He knows that the kinds of processes that have been undertaken with this bill and with the ASIO bill can actually improve the outcome. The process is that you get experts from the community who contribute, through the parliamentary committees, their expertise; and we as a parliament would be very foolish not to take on board their suggestions. That is what has happened. I have had the opportunity of reading the transcripts of the Senate committee on the ASIO bill, and I was able to be present during the Sydney hearings last week. I was very impressed, and I was also impressed with ASIO's response and acceptance of some aspects that were put to them by the committee.  
I do commend this process to the House. It has worked, and I commend it to the whole of the parliament. I think it sends the right signal. What I would not have liked to have seen in terms of the new ACC is either side of the House digging in, so that the new body could not go forward confident that the government and the alternative government support its existence. With respect to the ASIO bill, whatever amendments might come through the Senate, I think it is very important in the current climate that both sides of the House are supportive of the end product that comes out of the Senate. If there are certain people who think it might be good politics to try to wedge the Labor Party on the issue and to hold a particular line, then I do not believe that is in the national interest. The Labor Party have shown with this bill, with all security bills and with all terrorism bills that have come before the House—indeed, we have shown with the intelligence services bill pre-September 11—that we are ready, willing and able to support legislation in the national interest, but there are certain fundamental principles that we are not prepared to go beyond. 
I am pleased to be able to stand in the House this evening to support this bill. I think the process has provided an amended bill that we can all support. Hopefully, when the review that has been factored into the bill comes up in a couple of years time, there is not much that will have to be rejigged.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,16,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—The opposition opposes the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. It is bad policy. It is bad health policy and it is bad economics. The second reading amendment that I am happy to have circulated in my name reflects the basis of the opposition's opposition to the measure. It states that the House should reject this bill for the following reasons. Firstly, it will increase the cost of essential medicines by nearly 30 per cent, hitting the sickest and poorest in our society. Secondly, Australian pensioners and concession cardholders will go without almost five million prescriptions, and Australian families will also go without almost half a million prescriptions, as a result of the proposed increase. Thirdly, by depriving sick and elderly Australians of the medicines they need, there will be an increased need for greater medical intervention in public hospitals and nursing homes, at even greater cost to taxpayers. Fourthly, there are other more effective means by which the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could be assured—means which would put appropriate responsibility on the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession rather than on those least able to bear the burden, and means on which the government has been silent since the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. Fifthly, the true rationale for the bill is to restore the budget bottom line and it has nothing to do with the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or with genuine health outcomes for Australians. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will formally move this amendment, and I look forward to my colleague the member for Rankin seconding it. 
The measure, as members would be aware, is a government budget measure which has previously been rejected by the parliament. To remind members and the community of the effect of the measure, the effect would be to increase the copayment, insofar as pensioners and concession cardholders are concerned, for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $3.60 to $4.60. For families under financial pressure, it would increase from $22.40 to $28.60—an increase of almost 30 per cent. When the measure was introduced the day after budget day, the Treasurer said that people should not be concerned because it was just a dollar. What we have shown since that point in the cycle is that, while the Treasurer might think it is just a dollar, we know that over a million pensioners and concession cardholders will reach the safety net, and for them it will be an increase of $52 per year. We know that 300,000 Australian families will also meet the maximum and go to the safety net, and for them it will be an extra $190 per year. So the sickest and the poorest and the families under financial pressure are the ones who will be hit. 
We have also shown—during Senate estimates and through the course of question time—that, on the day the government reintroduced this measure and presented it to the House, I released and put to the Treasurer at question time the government's own calculations, which show that essentially after four years this measure would have no effect—so much for this being a long-term sustain-ability measure. But more importantly, on the government's own calculations, based on the advice of the Department of Health and Ageing, the effect of this measure would be that five million pensioner and concession cardholder scripts would not be taken up over a four-year period and half a million scripts from families, particularly families under financial pressure, would not be taken up over a four-year period. There is only one consequence of that. It might take five days, five weeks, five months or five years, but the pensioners and the families under financial pressure not taking up those scripts would find themselves at some point in the cycle in our public hospital systems, presumably in emergency departments, seeking medical attention and requiring a far greater medical intervention at a far greater cost.
This measure has never been about health. It has never been about trying to secure a better health outcome for the nation or a better health outcome for Australians and their families; it has always simply been about the Treasurer's and the Prime Minister's budget bottom line. Everyone will remember how in the run-up to the last election the government splurged its budget surplus—anywhere up to $14 billion was splurged—in a desperate bid to get itself re-elected. When it came to this budget, facing a deficit, the government had to find some easy money, and there is no easier money to find than by whacking the sickest and poorest in our community. When you look at the government's justification in part for this measure, the government said that in the financial year 2000-01, in the run-up to the last election, there was a 20 per cent increase in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The average annual increase for the cost of the scheme over the last decade and a half has been in the order of 11, 12 or 13 per cent. The most recent calculations and figures that we gleaned from the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, from the final budget outlook and from industry figures show that the growth in the cost to the taxpayer of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme over the financial year 2001-02 has been in that traditional order—in the order of 10, 11 or 12 per cent. 
When you look at what caused the exponential increase in the run-up to last year's election—the 20 per cent increase in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the truth is that it was all the government's own work. The government listed Celebrex, the anti-arthritis drug. The government listed Zyban, the antitobacco drug. The government changed, as a consequence of the introduction of the GST, the wholesale sales tax collection arrangements and, as we have already shown in the course of Senate estimates, that has cost the government over a four-year period, on the government's own admission, anywhere in the order of $225 million. The government also increased the array of people for whom a Commonwealth health concession card would become available. So in the run-up— 
—Are you suggesting that shouldn't happen?
—I am suggesting that, in the run-up to the last election, the increase in the cost to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was all the government's own work. The opposition in the run-up to the last election asked the government, `Are you concerned about the cost, for example, of Celebrex?' The government said, through former Minister Wooldridge—well known for house and email fame—`You don't need to worry about the cost of Celebrex, because the fact that it is costing money means consumers are benefiting.' That was the government's argument in the run-up to the last election: `Don't worry about the cost of the PBS because the consumer is benefiting.' That is a classic case of one story before the election and another story after.
What did we see after the election? We saw the Treasurer and the Prime Minister fronting up in the budget and saying, `There is a terrible problem with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. There was a 20 per cent increase last year.' What they will not tell the parliament and what they will not tell the community is that it was all their own work—including Celebrex and Zyban, changing the wholesale sales tax arrangement and increasing the number of concession cardholders. That was all their own work, and they said, `The fact that it is costing money means the consumer is benefiting.' After the election, all the government want to do is thug pensioners and families under financial pressure with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of their essential medicines. We all remember how the government said, `We can't apply the GST to essential medicines, as that would be a 10 per cent increase.' After the election, they have come up with a 30 per cent increase—that is, three times the GST amount—and want to thug pensioners, concession cardholders and families under financial pressure with that increase.
On the government's own admission, through the detailed calculations of the Department of Health and Ageing and the basis upon which the government proceeded, it will cost a million concession cardholders and pensioners an extra $52 a year and it will cost 300,000 Australian families an extra $190 a year. Also, five million pensioner and concession cardholder scripts will not be taken out over a four-year period and half a million scripts for Australian families under financial pressure will not be taken out either. The only consequence of that is greater, more expensive medical interventions at greater individual cost, at greater individual loss and at greater expense to the state and Commonwealth taxpayer down the track when people get treatment in the emergency departments of public hospitals.
When you look at that average annual increase of the PBS, a legitimate question can be raised. We have had for 50 years a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has served the nation well. Is it sustainable for another 50 years with that average annual increase? For 50 years, we have had a decent Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which has had three competing but valid public policy objectives: firstly, to provide the latest and best drugs to Australians at affordable prices for them; secondly, to provide those drugs at affordable prices and affordable rates to the taxpayer; and, thirdly, to ensure the ongoing presence of a viable pharmaceutical research and manufacturing industry in Australia. We have had those three for 50 years in a scheme conceived of by Chifley and implemented by Page and Menzies. It has served us well for 50 years. Is it possible to have a sustainable scheme for the next 50 years? The answer is that of course it is. But you do not hit the sickest, the poorest and the elderly with a 30 per cent increase and try to somehow pretend that that is a long-term, sustainable measure. It has nothing to do with a long-term, sustainable measure and everything to do with trying to catch up a budget deficit. This budget measure, in accordance with the budget papers, will save for the government $1.2 billion over a four-year period.  
The budget also contained a range of other measures which genuinely go to long-term sustainability and, as a consequence, those long-term, sustainable measures have been and are supported by the opposition. Those measures included increasing the use of generic drugs where appropriate, stopping pharmaceutical fraud, improving the listing process for new medicines, providing better information and guidance for prescribing doctors and increasing the focus on evidence based medicines. They are all long-term measures which go to the sustainability and viability of the scheme. They are all measures which, as the second reading amendment says:
... put appropriate responsibility on the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession rather than on those least able to bear the burden ...
They go to long-term viability, and that is why they have been supported.
In his budget reply on the Thursday night of budget week, the Leader of the Opposition stood at the dispatch box and said, `We support those measures, but what about a few others?' He put out to the parliament—and to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—further examples of long-term, viable measures which went to sustainability. Firstly, he suggested an increased focus on the cost and prescribing patterns of new drugs in their first year on the PBS. This was deliberately aimed at the Celebrex and, to a lesser extent, Zyban problem we saw, where you had an enormous uptake initially and then a plateauing out. There has never previously been an effort on the part of the guardians of the scheme to look at sharp uptakes in the first instance. That was one further long-term measure which went to sustainability.
Secondly, he suggested the inclusion of the full cost of the medicine on the label so that consumers are aware of the cost. Of course it is important that the community—the consumers—understand the contribution they and, more importantly in some respects, the taxpayer are making. Putting the price of the pharmaceutical on the label is one very effective way of effecting that, and other jurisdictions have gone down that road. For example, some of the Canadian provinces do that. Thirdly, he suggested tighter controls on direct to consumer advertising and greater scrutiny of industry marketing. Again, those are two measures which go to the way in which the pharmaceutical industry conducts itself. The Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply on 16 May 2002 challenged the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to cost those measures. The government said their measures in the budget—the ones I referred to earlier, which we do support and which do go to long-term viability and sustainability—have been costed at a saving of $800 million over four years.
So far, what has been the response to this? Deafening silence. The government are happy to thug pensioners and Australian families under financial pressure with an increase in cost of three times the amount of the GST—that is, 30 per cent—for their essential medicines but will not apply themselves to genuine measures which go to long-term sustainability. Of course there is a challenge. There is a challenge for the government, there is a challenge for the Commonwealth and there is a challenge for the parliament, but it is a challenge this government will not take up. This government try to pretend that somehow whacking pensioners and struggling families is a long-term sustainability measure, and it is not. It is just an easy way to try to rescue a budget deficit. On the government department's own admission—their own calculations—the effect of this measure will essentially cease after four years.
So much for all the cover that the Treasurer tries to get when he stands up in this place and says, `It's terrible. It's shocking. We've got this Intergenerational Report, which we tabled with the budget, which says that by 2017 we're going to have a problem because Commonwealth receipts will be exceeded by Commonwealth expenditure, and by 2042 we might have a structural problem. So do we have a solution for you! Because we might have an expenditure versus revenue crossover in 2017, and because by 2042 we might have a structural problem, we're going to whack pensioners, concession cardholders and struggling families with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of their essential medicines to stop them taking out their scripts, so that we get some respite over a four-year period and rescue our deficit.' No-one should be fooled by this ruse, this trick, this device. 
The Intergenerational Report told the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the government no more and no less than what the Commission of Audit told the government in 1996. The government came to office in March 1996, set up the Commission of Audit and the Commission of Audit reported to the government. Part of the commission's report said that we would have a problem with the ageing of our population and that we needed to adjust public policy over a period of time to address that problem. What response did we see from the government? We saw the same response in 1996. It increased the copayment for pensioners, concession cardholders and families under financial pressure. It gave them no compensation for the increase in the copayment. Whenever Labor increased or introduced a copayment, it gave pensioners and concession cardholders more than adequate compensation. When you add the increase in the copayment that the government effected through the 1996 budget to these proposed increases, it is a 70 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines for pensioners, concession cardholders and fami-lies under financial pressure—and not one cent of compensation.
There is nothing new in the Intergene-rational Report. There is nothing in the report that the government did not know about in the financial year 1996-97, courtesy of the Commission of Audit, and nothing that the government did not know from any number of studies, including the OECD report on the ageing of Australia's population. Other than when the government increased the copayment in the 1996 budget—which went through this parliament, from memory, in October-November 1996—when did you ever hear the Treasurer or the Prime Minister talk about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Did you hear them talking about it in the parliament in 1998, 1999, 2000 or 2001? Never. You have never seen them come to the dispatch box and heard them say, `We have a problem with the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.' Now we hear the Treasurer and, in the other place, the minister for health, saying, `Last financial year the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cost us $4.2 billion and it's not sustainable.' Some members might recall that a couple of months ago I stood up and put to the Treasurer a quote from former health minister Wooldridge in 2001 when he said, `The cost of the scheme is $4.2 billion and it is sustainable.'
—That was before the election.
—Before the election it was sustainable: `Before the election, the fact that we're spending money means that consumers are benefiting; after the election, we'll do anything and say anything to rescue the budget bottom line.'
If you look at this issue objectively and if you listen to what people in the health industry are saying, you will find any number of organisations—whether it is the AMA, the divisions of general practice, the Catholic Health Association or the Australian Healthcare Association—saying the same thing across the board. Every association out there that is interested and involved in public or private health and in the health care of the nation is, to a man and a woman, mantra-chanting a chorus to the government: `Don't go down this road.' This is a short-term measure. It might help rescue the budget bottom line. It will not do anything to advance the health outcomes of the nation. It will not do anything to advance the health outcomes of individuals. It will not do anything other than, further down the track, see people ending up in the emergency departments of public hospitals because they have not been taking out their scripts. They will end up with a more difficult health problem requiring greater medical intervention at greater expense to the taxpayer.
How do we know this? We know this because, whether it is a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayment or a copayment that a non bulk-billing doctor requires, it is invariably the case that those people who are least able to afford it are also those people most at risk of chronic illness or serious disease. If you are on a fixed income, a low income or if you are pensioner—we know that pensioners might be at greater risk of chronic illness or serious disease than most other classes of Australians because of their age—what does the government do? It imposes a measure affecting those people who are least able to afford it; those people who are most at risk of a chronic illness or a serious disease and who, therefore, are most in need of either the primary care that a GP can give by way of bulk-billing or the preventative care, through pharmaceuticals and advice, that a general practitioner can provide. 
Commonsense tells you that if you sensibly spend some money on pharmaceuticals now, it might actually save you some money down the track. On one occasion in the other place it was put to the minister for health that an American study had shown that a dollar spent on pharmaceuticals when it was needed saved that American jurisdiction $4 down the track. The minister for health derided that study. When I became the shadow minister for health, I called for the various research and clinical studies which would enable me to mount a scientific, best-evidence argument as to why sensible spending on pharmaceuticals might save money down the track. The truth is that there is a paucity, if not a complete absence, of that material. One of the weaknesses we have in Australia is that we have never done the hard work to enable us to persuade Treasury and Finance officers and Treasurers and ministers for finance that spending money on pharmaceuticals now is not just a spend, it is an investment. We constantly get from the government the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; we never get from the government the benefit. There is never an attempt to try and ascertain what the benefit might be.
For example, the government will tell us what the cost of Lipitor is, but there is no cost-benefit analysis to tell us how many middle-aged, overweight men with cholesterol problems are no longer fronting up to the cardiovascular wards of our public hospitals requiring urgent interventions. What we know anecdotally from a range of cardiovascular wards around the country is that those sorts of incidents seem to be on the decline. So instead of simply looking at the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in isolation, why can't we take a more enlightened view—a view which is consistent with the idea of preventative health care and the idea that an investment now will give you a better long-term return—and sit down and say, `Wouldn't it be more sensible if we worked out that what we spend on Lipitor now might actually save us money down the track, and what we spend on Tritace now might save us money down the track because fewer people will be having strokes'? This sort of sensible approach does not come into the government's calculations. Why is that? Because the government is not actually interested in the long-term sustainability of the scheme. This measure has nothing to do with long-term sustainability; it has everything to do with simply rescuing the budget bottom line.
In the course of the first round of this bill through the parliament, the Treasurer was up here waxing lyrical, saying, `Shocking. Terrible. Terrible Senate. Terrible Labor Party. We simply won't be in a position to list any more drugs until this measure goes through.' But what have we found? We found the Prime Minister jumping up on the Alan Jones show announcing in advance of government consideration that Gleevec would go on the scheme. Funny that. The Prime Minister cops a bit of flack from Alan Jones on his radio show and in the TV editorials about Gleevec and then, despite all the alleged financial problems, Gleevec is listed.
In the last couple of weeks, we have seen the government make announcements about a range of other drugs: Singulair, which is a chewable tablet for asthma; Avandia, which is a type 2 diabetes drug; and Spiriva, which treats chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—all of these were listed. They were all listed because they had gone through the process and also because, as we saw in the course of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the final budget outlook papers delivered earlier this year, the exponential increase in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the run-up to the election has now abated from its 20 per cent back to the average annual increase. So far as we are concerned, we are in the marketplace for sitting down and saying, `Let's have a sensible look at the sustainability of the scheme in the long term. Let's make sure that we put in place long-term measures which go to the conduct and activity of the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession, which go to evidence based medicines and which go to a proper assessment of the cost of the scheme and also the benefits of the scheme.' 
This is a classic instance of a government telling the Australian people one story before the election and a different story after. It is a classic illustration of a government trying to trick the community into thinking that a crass, grab for cash is somehow a long-term public policy measure when it is nothing of the sort. The truth is that this government is too scared and does not have the public policy wit to embrace long-term sustainable measures which would go to the viability of the scheme in the long term. I formally move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House rejects this bill for the following reasons:
(1)	it will increase by nearly 30% the cost of essential medicines, hitting the sickest and poorest in our society;
(2)	Australian pensioners and concession cardholders will go without almost five million prescriptions, and Australian families will also go without almost half a million prescriptions as a result of the proposed increase;
(3)	by depriving sick and elderly Australians of the medicines they need, there will be an increased need for greater medical interventions in public hospitals and nursing homes at even greater cost to taxpayers;
(4)	there are other, more effective, means by which the long term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could be assured, means which would put appropriate responsibility on the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession rather than on those least able to bear the burden, and on which the Government has been silent since the Leader of the Opposition's Budget reply; and
(5)	the true rationale for the bill is to restore the budget bottom line and has nothing to do with the long term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or with genuine health outcomes for Australians”.
As I indicated at the outset, the opposition opposes this legislation and, as on the previous occasion, we will also oppose this measure in the Senate. I hope the Senate, either in the last quarter of this year or in the first quarter of next year, dispatches it to the same place it dispatched the bill on the first occasion.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I am very pleased to be able to speak this evening on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The reason I decided to speak on this bill this evening—because it is not something I would normally speak on—is that I wished to address the cant and hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party on these measures. It is the most opportunistic behaviour I have seen from an opposition, but it is the hallmark of their leadership, and it is the hallmark of their behaviour under the current leader of the Australian Labor Party, Simon Crean.
The member for Perth is generally quite a decent sort of fellow, but for him to talk about hypocrisy and about one thing being said before the election and another thing after the election just shows that the Labor Party has no shame. We only have to mention the border protection measures. Before the election, my opponent in the seat of Canning used to go on the radio with me and say, `We are with the government on border protection measures. There is not a cigarette paper difference between our policy and theirs.' What have we seen since the election? We have seen a total departure from that view. We have the member for Fremantle saying that she is ashamed and she cannot be a part of it. Harry Quick and other members of the Australian Labor Party are walking away from it in droves.
The member for Perth said that we told the Australian people one thing before the election and another thing after. But let us have a look at what happened today with the Labor Party's policy shift on the one-third rebate for private health insurance. `We're right with you,' they said before the election. After the election and as late as March this year, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin, came out and said, `We're with you on private health insurance. We're with you all the way. We're not going to change.' What have they done today because they are under pressure and are rudderless at a leadership level? They have decided to try to reinvent themselves on a few issues, and one of those issues is the one-third rebate. The people of Australia really want that rebate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, before the measure came in, Australians used to come to us and ask, `Why can't we have it like we used to in days gone by, where you could actually have a tax concession on private health insurance?' That is why I joined HBF, for example, in Western Australia. We joined it because we knew that we would get something back. There was an incentive for us. Yet, what are the Australian Labor Party doing? They want to take that away from the Australian people. We know that the pharmaceutical benefits measures from the budget are designed to address the burgeoning blow-out in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the PBS. That scheme has blown out from $1.23 billion in 1991-92 to $4.83 billion in 2001-02, an almost fourfold increase. If anybody thinks that is sustainable well into the future, they are living in la-la land. 
When Hillary Clinton was in Australia with Bill Clinton some years ago, she met with Michael Wooldridge, the then health minister, to find out how we were able to run a dual health system in this country—a system that addresses not only the poor and those who are unable to be part of the private health sector but also those who can afford to pay—and she was mystified. We have a Rolls Royce health system in this country that is the envy of the world, and it is the envy of the world because it is well managed. But what do the opposition want? Rather than see the system continue, they would see it collapse and fall in a screaming heap, to the cost of the people of Australia, enabling them somehow to get a political advantage out of it all. It is a disgrace for which they need to be exposed and, hopefully, that is what the reintroduction of this bill will do. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I can assure you that the Australian people are not stupid. They know that you cannot sustain a system like this that, in 10 years, has blown out four times its weight.
The shadow health spokesman, the member for Perth, talks about this being `just a measure to try and prop up the budget'. Again we are faced with the cant and hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party, which ran deficits for all those years previously. We came out in the last budget and said that there was going to be a deficit, even though we have not yet had one—and why? Because we are running the Australian economy as one of the great economies of the world. As I have said, the people of Australia are not stupid. They know who runs a decent economy in this country. They know that, if the Labor Party were to get in office again, we would be back in hock the way we were before. The member for Perth has a most unusual approach to this measure: the more you spend, the more you save. That is very good if you are an avid shopper who goes into Woolies and finds there is a big `for sale' sign—a third of the price off, and so on. In they race: `The more we spend, the more we save.' The only trouble is that they run out of money. It is an absolutely bizarre sort of approach to the whole measure.
We do know that this concerns only a small copayment and that this small copayment has been designed as a measure to at least help keep running this huge and growing facility—a facility which eventually will cost more than the running of the entire health system. As reported in the Intergenerational Report, eventually the PBS will cost more than the running of the Australian health system. But, no, that does not really matter to the Labor Party. They go off saying, `You are'—to use what I think were the words of the member for Perth—`thugging the sickest and the poorest.'
The emotional and emotive language used by the opposition to try and gain some political advantage in this debate is disgraceful. I am sure that the majority of clear-thinking Australians will see right through such language, because the sickest and the poorest are looked after by this government in the best possible way. We know that, after 52 scripts, concession cardholders and pensioners get their medicines free. We know that it is the same with the copayment in connection with the threshold for general patient safety. The fact is that we are asking for a rise from $3.60 to $4.60 for concessional patients and from $22.40 to $28.60 for general patients. At the end of the day, as I have said, if they use up all those scripts to the end of the year, a dollar a week is seen by most clear-minded people as being a reasonable contribution. 
As we have said, one reason for our needing the copayment is to help keep pace with the huge cost blow-out; but, secondly, there have been abuses of the PBS scheme. Some time ago in my electorate it was recounted to me that, on the death of a family member, an individual went to their pharmacy and said, `Look, we've got a heap of my departed father's left-over medicines; we're a bit worried about them all lying around the house and think they should be handed in.' The pharmacist said, `Look, we'll send the young girl down there with a couple of bags to pick up the left-over medicines and we'll dispose of them in the way we should.' The individual said, `Don't send a couple of bags; you're going to need a ute.' They had been hoarding these medicines. In fact, one reason for some people hoarding them is that, after buying 52, they know they can get them free. So they absolutely stockpile them but, all of a sudden, the doctor changes their medicine and they have to start stockpiling another one. We know that many people on a variety of treatments take a huge number of pills and medicines and, ultimately, they can stockpile a huge amount—and this is one of the abuses.
I am not saying that stockpiling is terribly widespread, but fraud is. That is one of the reasons why identification became part of going to a chemist when getting medicines under a concessional arrangement. People were going into any pharmacy and just saying, `Oh, yes, I'm a concessional patient,' without having to show any ID, and were getting these medicines for concessional prices. We were told that, because Australia has such a marvellous antibiotic regime, a lot of these medicines were being sent to families overseas where the same sorts of regimes were not in place. So we are talking about what appeared to be large-scale fraud and malpractice amongst people who were involved with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and a copayment does have the effect of slowing this sort of thing down.
A lot of people also do not seem to appreciate that over half of the medicines available are under the threshold. For example, I am not a severe asthmatic but I do use a Ventolin inhaler, which costs about $10. Thousands of people around Australia buy thousands of these Ventolin inhalers or other forms of asthmatic drugs on a daily basis. Such an inhaler costs around $10, which is well and truly part of the scheme. None of these people will be hit or touched; in fact, they will not be affected at all. But this will address some of the expensive and high-cost drugs.
The opposition spokesman, the member for Perth, also wanted to say that there is no compensation for these measures. Let us just remember that 10 years ago, when the Labor Party was running this scheme—with the support of the government, rather than the opportunistic way the opposition is carrying on now—the copayment was 20 per cent. No-one disputes that—it was 20 per cent as part of the scheme. Today it has eroded to 15 per cent. That needs to be repeated. Anyone tuning in needs to know that the Labor Party, when it was in government, was quite happy to charge 20 per cent, with our support. Yet when we ask for the same treatment, those opposite say, `No, you're going to hit the sickest and the poorest.' What happened to the sickest and the poorest when they were charging 20 per cent? It is all relative, isn't it? It is all proportional. The people out there in radio land listening to this have to understand that the cant and hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this measure show no bounds. Ultimately, as I said, it would rather burn the whole system down and try to gain some sort of political benefit out of it failing.  
I have a caravan I take around to some of the isolated towns in the electorate; we sit down and everyone walks up and has their say. Recently, there was an interesting case where a person with a concession card came up and wanted to talk to me about the drug Caverject, which is a penile injection. He had run out of scripts. Apparently, there is a limit of five scripts unless the doctor sees a very good reason why you should continue to have Caverject. This man was blaming the Prime Minister. He was blaming the Prime Minister because he could not get his penile injections any longer and wanted to know why he could not have Viagra under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
We would all like assistance in different areas every now and again, but can you afford to have widespread distribution of Viagra at $70 a script? As this gentleman pointed out to me, there are only four pills in a Viagra set; they do not go a long way. If you have to pay for it, $70 is a lot of money. At the end of the day, yes, we would all like some of this assistance—well, not all of us! Some of us would like some of this sort of assistance. At the end of the day we are not all entitled to the luxuries that drugs bring us. I could go on and mention other cases. The same gentleman also said, `This rotten Johnny Howard, he's taken away all the cholesterol drugs, you know. I'm going to die early because your Prime Minister has taken away my ability to live a longer life because I can't get hold of these cholesterol drugs.'
—But he's going to die happy, by the sound of it.
—I missed that, but it was obviously funny because the assistant clerk thinks it is good.
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for Canning will return to the substance of the debate. 
—The substance of the debate. We could probably return to the previous one. Getting back to the cholesterol drugs, he was accusing the Prime Minister because he could not get access to these. I thought this was strange. I am not on top of everything in relation to drugs; I thought I would ring the minister's office and find out whether this is true—whether all these drugs have been knocked off in terms of access on concession. It was not true. There are five cholesterol inhibitor drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that could apply to that gentleman. He was amazed. He said, `Why didn't my doctor tell me?' I don't know why. He was trying to accuse the doctor of not telling him the truth. 
There are many myths floating out there about what you are entitled to under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and what you are not entitled to. It is quite bizarre. At the end of the day, if he could not have used any one of those generic drugs which are on the scheme—the five cholesterol drugs that he could have had access to—his doctor then could prescribe him a drug. If he could not have anything else and all else failed, his doctor would prescribe him a drug which would suit him and help him with his health. This is one of the greatest schemes; this is one of the greatest measures that the Australian public want. They want it to continue, but it will not continue without the support of the Labor Party.
I am running out of time. I got a little sidetracked there for a while. In the last six months, the additions to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme have cost $148 million. That is because of the new drugs coming on. I seek leave to table the list of new drugs which have come onto the scheme in the last 12 months, just to demonstrate what they are—because I cannot pronounce all their pharmaceutical names or chemical names—and the cost of them.
Leave granted.
—I know that you are enjoying it, so I am sure you will enjoy the reading. Thank you. The fact is that the TGA evaluates an enormous number of drugs. As well as the drugs that the TGA has identified, I seek leave to table a list of the drugs that the TGA has recommended for approval but the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has not yet suggested should be on the list.
Leave granted. 
—We know that something like 90 drugs a year are put forward by the TGA for approval. I want to let you know the approval rate that this government has taken on over the last number of years. In 1997 the number of drugs included on the PBS was 38; in 1998, 45; in 1999, 37; in 2000, 34; in 2001, 34; and in 2002, 31. In fact, over the last six years there have been 219 new drugs—
—Oh, that's how many boats arrived before the Tampa.
—I heard the interjection of the member and yes, I appreciated every one of those votes. Thank you very much; we were very glad of them. It is very important to understand the blow-out in the cost of some of these measures. Without going through each drug individually, I can say what we know about some of the most expensive drugs on the list today. For something like Lipex for the treatment of high cholesterol, which I talked about previously, the average price is $60. At the moment concession cardholders pay $3.60 or $22, and the cost is increasing by $1 or $6. I could go through the whole list, but I am not going to do that because we are just about out of time.
The final thing I want to say on this measure is that this government is responsible in terms of what it is endeavouring to achieve. It does not share the `the more you spend the more you save' mentality of the Labor Party. It is not an opportunistic party that wants to destroy a scheme just to prove a political point in conjunction with a rogue Senate. This government wants to provide the best system to the Australian people. It is a Rolls Royce system that is the envy of the world. There is only one way it can be destroyed. This is a time when we are spending money on the war on terror and when we have a drought in this country. These things mean we need to be financially responsible. We need the help of the Australian Labor Party to see that we are financially responsible, and their reaction is: `No. Because we can get some political gain out of it, we will oppose you all the way.' Bring on the double dissolution.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—They are certainly fighting words by the member for Canning. It surprises me that the government is interested in fighting a double dissolution election on increasing the price of essential medicines. Obviously, the member for Canning does not speak to people in his electorate, as I do. The member for Canning presented a couple of pieces of misinformation to the House, and I am sure the House would like me to clear those up for them. I will start with Caverject. Caverject, the penile injection the previous member was discussing, is a very old treatment that is being used by men throughout Australia. It was previously on the PBS. I have a constituent who contracted mumps at a very young age, and he has been using Caverject for 40 years. Caverject has only recently been removed from the PBS, simply because Viagra was listed. So, whilst the member for Canning thought this was a joke, to some people it has a very real impact on their lives.
I think the government introduced good legislation when it made it essential for people to present their Medicare card when they received medicine. But it is false to say that people who had concession cards were fraudulently obtaining medicines for people who did not have concession cards and that people were pretending they had concession cards when there was no necessity to prove that they had one. Previously, if a person said that they were entitled to medication at a concession rate, they had to show their concession card. That has always been the way. The change was to make it essential for everybody to have their Medicare card number listed with the pharmacy that provided them with medication. That was very good on a number of grounds: it stopped doctor shopping and it stopped abuse of the system. I think the government is to be commended for that. Unfortunately, the government is not to be commended for this legislation.
I find it astonishing that we are back here debating the Howard government's proposal to increase the price of essential medicines for all Australians. This is exactly the same legislation that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 June this year and subsequently defeated in the Senate on 20 June. If ever there were an example of a mean-spirited government, the Howard government is it. 
When the government came to power in 1996, the cost of prescriptions for non-concession cardholders was $16.80. If it is successful in getting this legislation through the Senate—though I feel certain that the senators will hold fast to their resolution not to pass the legislation—the cost of medication will go up to $28.60. That is up $6.20 from its current level. For pensioners there will be a $1 increase for every script they get up to 52 scripts. That means that the cost of scripts will be $4.60. The government says there will be no cost once people reach the safety net. That is not true for all medications. There are some medications for which, even when you meet that safety net mark, you still incur a cost.
The difference between what this government has done in the area of increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals and what the Labor Party did when in government is that the Labor Party compensated pensioners and low-income earners. This government does not care about pensioners and low-income earners; this government only cares about its friends at the big end of town. This government does not think twice when it comes to hitting families and it does not think twice when it comes to hitting pensioners who cannot afford it. This government believes that, if you work hard, you have money and therefore you can afford to pay. This government believes that those people who do not have money obviously do not work hard and do not deserve to have the essential medications that are delivered to them under this scheme. This government has gone out of its way to make it harder for families, pensioners and low-income earners.
As I have moved around my electorate and spoken to people, I have spoken to many people with young families and they are really frightened about the consequences of this bill getting through the parliament. They are very fearful about whether they will be able to treat their children when they become ill. I know when my children were younger one would get sick and the other two would get sick as well. I would have three children ill at the one time. In those days I did not have a lot of extra money and, if I had had to pay $28.60 every time one of my children became ill, I would not have been able to afford it. I would have had to think which child was the sickest. The consequences could be that your children get sicker and that you juggle the medications. This is what families in my electorate are telling me. Families are telling me that they are very frightened by the prospect of this coming in and of them being unable to afford to buy the essential medication that their sick children need.
I have had numerous pensioners come to my office and tell me what this legislation will mean to them. I talked to one pensioner who takes 18 different tablets a day, another who takes nine and another who takes 14. Each of them is worried about the prospect of having to pay more for their medication. I was also talking to a women who takes 15 different types of medication a day. She finds it very difficult to make ends meet as it is. She was so upset about the prospect she asked me if I had a petition I could give her so she could take it with her and get all her friends to sign it. They had been talking about it and they were truly worried about the impact that this would have.
This government has really attacked our health care system. It supports a system, I believe, that is two-tiered. One tier is a Rolls Royce system, where if you have money you can get the best of health care, be it the best medications or the best treatment for any illness or disease you may have. This can be seen by the government's failure to support bulk-billing and universal health care within Australia. It is a government that would rather pour money into the health insurance industry than ensure that people within Australia can get the basic health care that they need. It is a government that is prepared to force people to sit for hours in public hospitals and to transfer the cost of basic health care to the states rather than ensuring that everybody in Australia can have good quality health care. It is a government that is asking the Australian people to pay, pay, pay—that is, unless you are the friends of the government; if you are the friends of the government then the treatment is very different. 
I now turn to the Intergenerational Report. It has been quoted a great deal in this debate. The members on the government side referred to the Intergenerational Report as identifying the increase in the price of pharmaceuticals as the main problem that is going to cause the collapse of the health system in Australia. I read the Intergenerational Report a little differently. I read the Intergenerational Report and I see a lot of other things in it that are leading to increases in the cost of health care.
I see that the Intergenerational Report identifies that the ageing of our population is one of the costs, the fact that we are living a lot longer. But when you look at the breakdown in health costs, one of the things that has had the most substantial impact on the cost of health care is the changes in technology and the cost of delivering health care services. It is not the cost of medication but it is those technological changes that have had such an enormous impact on the cost of health care. These are cutting edge changes, changes that have saved the lives of many people—just as having access to medication has.
I turn to the impact this can have on people's lives. If people are unable to afford to pay for medication, it will lead to a problem with compliance. A person goes along to a doctor and the doctor develops a health care plan for them. These days doctors are even compensated financially for developing special plans for people who suffer from diabetes and numerous other diseases. These plans are drawn up in consultation with their patients, and the government pays doctors a fee for doing this and monitoring the progress of their patients.
If a person is faced with the choice of not being able to afford their daily living expenses or going without their medication—maybe for a week; maybe for a month—because they have a big electricity bill, the gas bill has come in or the telephone bill has come in, maybe they will stop taking their medication. You do not always notice when you stop taking medication the impact that it is having on your health. It is only when you get further down the track that you are able to feel the impact of that. It will lead to people self medicating; it will lead to people taking one medication one month, another medication the next. This in itself can lead to an increase in the cost of health care in this country.
The positive aspects of medication are that, for every $1 spent on medication, $4 is saved later. Taking medication—as opposed to people not taking medication and later becoming seriously ill—reduces the cost to society and to the government. I spent some time looking at the cost of surgery that people end up needing if they do not take medication to lower their cholesterol or control their blood pressure. The basic cost for operations such as a coronary artery bypass is $1,619.60. Put that together with hospitalisation, other associated costs and the ongoing treatment for people who have had coronary artery bypasses and there is a whole series of different costings up to $2,000 for different operations. People have different types of bypasses. Taking medication is saving our community a lot of primary health care costs. The other area is people who have suffered strokes because they had high blood pressure and choose not to take medication. Once again, there are enormous costs associated with rehabilitation and that person possibly requiring ongoing care in a low or high care facility. My husband comes from a family with a history of very high cholesterol and quite an ordinary record when it comes to coronary illness. He was detected early as having problems with cholesterol and high blood pressure. He is a very healthy and active man and has been on medication. Both his blood pressure and cholesterol are at the level they should be—as with thousands of Australians.
The success of the PBS scheme in Australia has been phenomenal. It has had the support of governments of all persuasions. It is only this government which is seeking to destroy and distort it. When we are talking about the PBS and some of the ways that the government has sought to change it, we only need to look at the actions of the previous health minister. He moved to change the composition of the pharmaceutical board and appointed Pat Clear, the director of FuCell Pty Ltd, who had a long history in the pharmaceutical industry. The same minister intervened with the recommendation of the previous board to have Celebrex and Zyban listed—drugs that have blown the budget. Also, this government extended the health care card to many thousands of people in the community, including self-funded retirees and people who earn up to $50,000 a year. This has also had a significant impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and increased the costs of providing essential medicines to people in the community. 
To say it is essential to increase the price of medicine is not telling the Australian people the truth. This government has extended the scheme. It has interfered with the operation of the pharmaceutical board. It has placed its friends on the board. It has sought to distort the whole process. The minister stands up in this place and says, `Unless we increase the price of medication for ordinary Australian people, the system is going to collapse.' Not only that, but it has been blackmailing people suffering from illnesses, saying, `Unless the opposition agrees to pass our legislation, we won't be listing other new medicines.' This has been shown to be blackmail because the government has already listed a couple of the medications they said they would not list such as the new treatment for diabetes.
I turn to a survey of some 2,500 which I conducted in my electorate. The survey looked at a number of health care needs and issues that were important to the people of the Shortland electorate. One of the questions I asked was whether the people of Shortland felt that the price of pharmaceuticals should be increased. Overwhelmingly, the people gave me the message: no, they should not. My message to the government is: you have to listen to the people of Australia. You take them with you. You listen to what they have to say. On this piece of legislation, they are not saying, `Bring on the double dissolution,' as the previous speaker said; they are saying, `We want the cost of our basic essential pharmaceuticals contained. We want to be able to get medicines when we need them.'

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] provides for the budget measures which relate to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It provides for the copayment for concessional cardholders to be increased from $3.60 to $4.60. Extra prescriptions for concessional cardholders will be free after 52 scripts. For general patients and their families, the copayment will rise from $22.40 to $28.60 and the safety net will apply after 31 scripts. After the safety net is reached, families and general patients will pay the concessional rate of $4.60 for additional scripts. This is the same legislation that was introduced as part of the budget. It was debated in the House in June and was subsequently defeated in the Senate.
Part of the government's health policy in 1996 was to retain Medicare. This was reiterated in 1998 and 2001. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the three pillars of Medicare. We on this side encourage the opposition to take a long-term view. The Intergenerational Report in this year's budget was part of that. In order to take a long-term view of what we expect from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme it is worth having a look to see where the PBS came from. The PBS began life on 1 June 1948. It was originally designed to provide lifesaving and disease preventing drugs from the British Pharmacopoeia to pensioners and others. Today it is a much broader scheme which subsidises medications at an affordable price for all Australians. In 1949, 139 lifesaving and disease preventing drugs were provided free of charge to the whole community. Today, there is something like 593 drugs available in 1,461 forms and strengths and marketed as 2,500 brands. There are restrictions on 785 items and 286 items require an authority. They are May 2002 figures. In 1953 the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee was established. This committee plays the important role of deciding which medications will go onto the PBS. In 1960, a patient contribution of five shillings was introduced to provide some control on volumes and expenditure. 
I have heard some of the opposition debate, but I am not sure what they are talking about. There has been a copayment associated with the PBS since 1960—originally five shillings. At that time, the scheme was a $43 million scheme. By 1969 it had grown to $100 million. By 1975 it had grown to $211 million. In the early 1990s, it was $1.2 billion and now it is over $4 billion. The patient contribution, or copayment, for pensioners of $2.50 was introduced in 1990 by Brian Howe. Today, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a very good scheme. It provides pharmaceuticals at a very reasonable price. Prices are much higher in the United States—162 per cent higher—and they are 48 per cent to 51 per cent higher in other English speaking countries like the UK and Canada. They are also higher in Sweden. We have similar prices to countries like France, Spain and New Zealand. We spend eight to nine per cent of our health expenditure on pharmaceuticals, and this is more than comparable countries like Canada, Denmark, Switzerland and the United States.
The PBS is the fastest growing area of health expenditure in Australia. Over the last decade it has grown on average by 14 per cent. In 1991-92 the PBS cost $1.16 billion. By 2001-02 it is estimated to cost $4.197 billion. The Intergenerational Report estimates that it will increase fivefold as a percentage of GDP over the next 40 years—that was using a conservative estimate of growth; more conservative than the growth we have had—and it will cost $59 billion in today's money. The projection is for the PBS to grow from 0.6 per cent of GDP to 3.4 per cent of GDP. The IGR also predicted that Commonwealth expenditure on health would rise from four per cent to eight per cent of GDP over the next 40 years. This of course includes the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the funding that we provide for the state government run public hospitals—we provided at least 40 per cent of the funding of those hospitals—the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance and other areas such as medical research and public health.
The Intergenerational Report analysis of Commonwealth health spending shows that most of the recent growth in health spending has been due to non-demographic growth—that is, real, per person, age adjusted compound growth. From 1984-85 to 2000-01, 2.1 per cent of the 3.8 per cent per annum growth was due to non-demographic growth. From 1989-90 to 2000-01, 3.2 per cent of the 4.9 per cent growth was due to non-demographic growth. That means that we have seen growth speeding up over the last decade, and it is real growth. A large portion of that is due to technological change. Over the past decade Commonwealth health spending has increased faster than total national spending. The Commonwealth's share of health spending grew from 42 per cent in 1989-90 to 48 per cent in 1999-2000, whereas the state share over the same period fell from 26 per cent to 23 per cent and the private sector share fell from 31 per cent to 28 per cent. Real non-demographic growth in Commonwealth spending on public hospitals has grown at about 1.6 per cent. The Medicare Benefits Schedule has been growing at two per cent per annum, but the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been growing at an average of 6.1 per cent per annum for 20 years.
Drivers of the growth in the PBS include the ageing of the population, but this plays only a limited role. This factor is much smaller than the cost of new technologies, the increasing use of services and increasing consumer demand and expectations. Another cost driver in the PBS is the addition of newer generation pharmaceuticals to the scheme. For example, Zyban costs on average $249 to the PBS. Since its listing in February 2001 to the end of 2001, it cost the Commonwealth government $82 million. Celebrex, from its listing in August 2000 to December 2001, cost $217 million. Since 1996, the Howard government has added new items to the PBS on the recommendations of the PBAC, and these have had a gross cost of more than $1½ billion.
Other cost drivers include the growth of preventative medicines; for example, statins, which now cost $580 million. Many of the top 10 drugs in cost on the PBS are statins. In 2001 there was a budget measure to educate general practitioners about the better prescribing of statins, because it is important to look at serum cholesterol, lipid profiles, family histories, the existence of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes and whether someone has actually had a heart attack before prescribing cholesterol lowering agents. There are algorithms that take into account all of these risk factors and are able to tell you at what serum cholesterol level it is appropriate to prescribe a statin. Statins are not going to be beneficial for everyone. Another driver is the improved detection of illnesses, such as depression, high blood pressure and high cholesterol and asthma and increased community awareness of newer and more effective drugs. There has also been cost-shifting by the states onto the Commonwealth; for example, through limited drugs on discharge, privatisation of outpatients and so on. There has also been an increase in the number of people in the concessional category. They are the most prolific users of the PBS and receive about 80 per cent of the benefit from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Another cost driver is the prescription of inappropriate drugs for conditions; for example, antibiotics. It is estimated that $100 million a year is spent on conditions for which antibiotics are not effective. 
The opposition oppose the rise in the copayment. They would seek other measures which would help sustainability of the PBS. That is rubbish, because cost containment measures already exist: obviously, patient copayments are already there; there is a brand premium policy; there is the therapeutic group premium policy; there are price-volume agreements; there are quality incentives for prescribing pharmaceuticals; there is a national prescribing service; there is improved monitoring of entitlements to the PBS, excluding, for example, temporary residence; and there is also a simple price control measure through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority.
Clearly, in order to provide timely access to newer generation pharmaceuticals, the PBS will need reform. The Commonwealth parliament needs to take decisions now to ensure the sustainability of the PBS in the future. Government contributions to the PBS have been increasing at a higher rate—13½ per cent—than the patient copayment—12.4 per cent. As a result, whereas in 1991-92 when Brian Howe was the minister for health the patient copayment was around 20 per cent, it had declined to around 15 per cent in 2000-01. These budget measures, which are opposed by Labor, the Greens and the Democrats, will increase the copayment to approximately 20 per cent. That is fair. That means that overall, as a group, patients will be covering 20 per cent of the cost of these medications and the Commonwealth government will be paying the remaining 80 per cent. It is still a very generous scheme.
The Democrats in a press release have argued that the changes in the copayment will shift costs onto the state governments. This assumes that essential medicines will not be prescribed as a result of this measure. I regard this assumption as false. This assumption also ignores the cost-shifting which has been occurring from the state governments to the Commonwealth government through decreased prescribing for outpatients in hospital pharmacies. Many of the suggestions which the Democrats have made, sensible suggestions such as price-volume agreements and prescribing practices, are already part of the cost control measures of the PBS.
The impact of this legislation needs to be considered for different groups and different medications. Firstly, for a concessional cardholder, the copayment will increase from $3.60 to $4.60. As I said before, 80 per cent of the contribution to the PBS is spent on concession cardholders. These concession cardholders will be able to access the new generation of cholesterol lowering drugs—or statins—which cost around $60, for $4.60; they will be able to access the new generation of antiarthritics, such as Celebrex and Vioxx, which cost between $36 and $45, for just $4.60; and they will be able to access newer blood pressure lowering agents, which cost $25 to $30, for just $4.60. The average concessional cardholder fills just 19 scripts per year. This legislation will result in an extra $19 for the concessional cardholder over the year, or about $1.50 a month.
For high use patients, the safety net will be there after 52 scripts a year, after which all medications are free. Concession card patients also receive a pharmaceutical allowance of $2.90 per week or $150.80 per year, which covers the first 32 scripts. So a high use person will be paying for another 20 scripts. The average person on 19 scripts will be more than covered by the pharmaceutical allowance. 
For general patients, the copayment will increase from $22.60 to $28.40. However, many mediations already cost less than $22.60, so there will be no change in the price for this category of patient. Many common medications which families are going to use, such as Ventolin for asthma, Rantidine or Zantac for peptic ulcer, Noten or Tenormin for high blood pressure and antibiotics such as Amoxycillin, Cephalexin and Diaformin or Diabex for diabetes, have an average price of less than $20, so there will no impact from this legislation—that is, there will be no price change for general patients and families who are not concessional cardholders. Twenty per cent of medications, including many commonly prescribed ones such as those I have just listed, are priced below the current general copayment. General patients will be able to receive the cholesterol lowering drugs, which cost about $60, and Omeprazole or Losec for peptic ulcer, which have an average price $64, at a subsidised rate of $28.60. After 31 scripts, the general patient will be caught by the safety net and will then pay the concessional copayment of $4.60.
It is also important to look at the place of expensive medications on the PBS. The average price of Olanzapine or Zyprexa for schizophrenia is $219 on the PBS; bupropion—better known as Zyban—for nicotine addiction is $249; human insulin for diabetes is $189. These are all available to concessional cardholders for $4.60 and to the general patient for $28.60. These medications are heavily subsidised by the government, and that is a good thing, but we do need to have some fairness so that this scheme can continue in the future, and I think 20 per cent is a reasonable contribution for patients to make. Zoladex, which is used in treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer, has an average price to the government of $726 yet will be available to concessional cardholders for $4.60 and to general patients for $28.60 if this legislation is passed. 
This legislation is expected to save the government $1.1 billion over the next four years. It is expected that there will be some reduction in the rate of growth of prescription volumes. Without some sort of price signal to control demand, the PBS will continue to grow exponentially. In the future, as we map the human genome, we will have the ability to target medicines at a genetic level as opposed to a molecular level, and it is important that we take steps now so that the PBS will be sustainable well into the future. ",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—I rise to speak wholeheartedly against this very poor piece of public policy, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Once again, we see this government, as it has done time and time again, attempting to patch up leakages in revenue by grabbing money back from those who are least able to afford it. The fact is that the impact of this bill will be greatest on the least well-off in the community: the ill, the disabled, the elderly and the frail—the people I represent. I ask the members sitting on the government side: does this government really care? I can answer for them. This legislation says, `Of course not.'
The proposed amendments to the National Health Act 1953 would see the general patient copayment increase from $22.40 to $28.60 and the concessional patient copayment increase from $3.60 to $4.60. In percentage terms, this is an increase in the general copayment of 27.7 per cent and in the concessional copayment of 27.8 per cent. Considering that the government claims that expenditure on the PBS has increased by 14 per cent annually over the last decade, this increase is double that. And do not think that this government is going to have only a one-off increase. If this legislation is implemented, I believe it will attempt—year in and year out—to increase the co-payments.
The government estimates that, based on 2001-02 figures, these changes will result in savings of $1.1 billion dollars, or about 6.2 per cent, over the next four years. This may sound wonderful for the bottom line, but the social impact could be devastating. The Department of Health and Ageing claims that, in the first 12 months of these increases, 2.8 per cent of pensioner and concession scripts and 1.4 per cent of general scripts will not be filled, because people will not be able to afford them. This would see a reduction of approximately 5.5 million prescriptions. This is a dreadful situation. We will see people having to choose between essential medicines—effectively having to decide between taking blood pressure medication or heart tablets. That is a preposterous situation in a society that is supposed to be caring for its less fortunate members in the 21st century. 
Pensioners and concession cardholders would be out of pocket an additional $52 per year; for 300,000 families who reach the safety net, this would see an extra $190 per year in medical expenses taken from their already stretched and limited incomes. Financially, this is an immense burden on those people, but I do not believe this government cares. It sees itself prattling on to its mates in the financial markets: `Aren't we wonderful! We've cut a billion dollars in expenditure.' Its sycophants will claim how financially responsible they are and will say that maintaining a tight fiscal policy should be the prime goal. I could go on all day with all the jargon that the economic professionals go on with. But they are too smart by half. This measure will cost in many ways in the long run. It will mean the government will have to increase expenditure in other parts of the health portfolio. It will mean an increased strain on our already overstretched public hospital systems around the country. If the government—and the Treasurer in particular—had an ounce of humanity, it would reconsider the implications of this decision.
I am sure all members have received a letter from the Cancer Council New South Wales expressing their deep reservations about this legislation. Added to this letter was a joint statement from health and consumer groups which provides some insightful suggestions on improving the PBS. I suggest the government takes the time to consider this statement and engage with the professionals who know how the system works and would undoubtedly be quite willing to assist government in drafting a policy that is socially conscious but also cost effective. That is the difference between Labor and the government. We can actually formulate policies that encapsulate our goal of creating a fair and equitable society without sending the country broke. We did that for 13 years, despite the rubbish and misinformation that you hear from the other side of the House. 
The Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech replying to the budget that Labor will support measures that attempt to prevent the misuse of the PBS through controlling instances of fraud, tightening administrative measures which focus on the cost and prescribing patterns of new drugs in their first year on the PBS, tightening controls on consumer advertising and providing greater scrutiny of industry marketing. These are the areas that the government should be focusing on; it should not be focusing on imposing costs on the consumers who have the least capacity to cope. But that is how this government works. Smokescreens are put up all over the place by the government to hide their increasingly shoddy treatment of the less well-off. 
As we on this side of the House have said, the PBS can be reformed, but that would mean putting pressure on the providers and the prescribers to mend their ways. It would appear that it is from this end that changes have to be made. But the government are fearful of offending the pharmaceutical companies. As is typical, this government will quite willingly provide `welfare' to the big end of town whilst imposing tougher conditions on the less well-off in the community. 
In their joint statement regarding access to prescription medicines and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Cancer Council of New South Wales and their co-signatories—the Arthritis Foundation of Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, or ACOSS, the Australian Consumers Association, the Breast Cancer Action Group NSW, Cancer Voices NSW, Carers NSW, Chronic Illness Alliance NSW, Chronic Illness Alliance Victoria, Council of Social Service of NSW, Cystic Fibrosis Australia, the Epilepsy Association, Epilepsy Australia Ltd, the Hepatitis C Council of NSW, the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the NSW Palliative Care Association and the People with Disabilities (NSW) Inc.—have suggested similar reforms to those that we on this side of the House have continued to propose. These are groups representing a vast spectrum of the medical community and their patients. The Cancer Council states that the government should focus not on increasing costs for consumers but on other reforms, which include: 
... better monitoring of prescribing patterns of general practitioners, the introduction of standard processes in relation to surveillance of drugs after listing on the PBS, a greater level of research on drug utilisation, amendments to the Act to allow greater transparency of, and stakeholder participation in, the process of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the development of mechanisms to enable broader and more active consumer input into the processes and decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
The government does not have the intellectual ability to be able to grasp the concept that, if there are problems with the PBS, a range of solutions must be found. Increasing copayments and raising the safety net are only pieces of the patchwork. The concerns expressed by the Cancer Council will still be there. However, with the penny pinchers in this government, you can rest assured that their solution will always contain raising revenue from the battlers. 
This is the history of this government. It has cut billions of dollars from vital government services since 1996. After more than six years in office, this government has already cut emergency dental programs for poor and elderly Australians, introduced up-front fees for nursing homes, put extra fees on HACC and has previously raised the cost of pharmaceuticals. So, as I said earlier, the history is there. It will raise the co-payments every time it thinks it needs to raise more taxes. The PBS has been a part of social policy in this country for 50 years. Governments of both persuasions in the past have accepted that it is essential to provide all Australians with the medication they require. If these medicines are available then this will provide cost savings in other health related areas, particularly, as I stated earlier, in lower levels of hospitalisation. I am not denying that the costs of running the PBS are high. A program that spends over $4 billion annually is a costly scheme but, unlike the doom and gloom of the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report, the PBS is sustainable if the government tackles the most costly areas.
The Cancer Council of New South Wales has suggested that prescribing patterns should have better monitoring. It seems the practice at the moment is for practitioners to prescribe newer and more expensive drugs. For example, two of the most common drugs in recent years have been Celebrex, which has been prescribed to arthritis sufferers and costs on average $46.92 per script, and Zyban, the antismoking drug that costs $249.51 per script. Both have been vigorously promoted by their respective pharmaceutical companies. Celebrex, in particular, has been a favourite of practitioners. The estimated cost of listing Celebrex on the PBS was originally thought to be $40 million for its first year. However, the actual cost was four times that amount. It cost $160 million in the first year it was prescribed. Celebrex has also been prescribed for non-arthritic conditions, which has assisted in escalating its cost. I would imagine that there are a number of other drugs that have been used in the same way. It is these patterns of prescribing that groups like the Cancer Council believe should be reformed. For it appears, just in the case of Celebrex, that the prescribing practices of practitioners and the vigorous marketing by the pharmaceutical company have substantially increased the costs to the taxpayer.
I would like to illustrate my strong support for the ongoing sustainability of the PBS by mentioning the story of a constituent of mine who I have known for nearly 40 years and whose name I will not mention so as to maintain her confidentiality, but the ministers know of her. About six years ago my constituent was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. After nearly four years of treatment, which saw the medication used becoming less and less effective, she was referred to another doctor who was conducting trials of a new drug called STI571, commonly known as Glivac. After being accepted for the trial, her condition improved significantly. The problem was that, once the trial was finished, further purchases of the drug were going to cost her and her husband around $50,000 per year—$50,000 to keep her alive. This person is a pensioner and has absolutely no chance of funding the cost of her own accord. 
After representations, I received a reply from the government that Glivac had been recommended for subsidy for the treatment of some forms of chronic myeloid leukaemia, but that the PBAC had not recommended treatment in the chronic phase. The minister at the time believed that my constituent was too old to receive this treatment. I found it an absolute outrage that Dr Wooldridge considered a woman who had not yet reached 70 to be too old for this treatment. We persisted in our efforts to get the government to reconsider its decision, and I am now pleased to announce that recently she has entered into remission—that is, two years later she is still alive and has now gone into remission. This fine woman would have been beaten by the ravages of this horrible condition if it were not for the scheme. She now, hopefully, can live a happy and fulfilling life and contribute, as she has done for many years, to the community and her family. She is but one example of a person who has worked—but is not wealthy—and for whom the government and the community should be willing and able to assist her by making life as comfortable as possible when hard times hit through illness.
However, the Howard government, as in a number of other public policy areas, are willing to subsidise the big end of town and the affluent in our society. They consistently provide their spin on how life is so difficult for those in the upper middle classes but show what I believe is an utter contempt for those at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, the people I have proudly represented in over 30 years of public life. We on this side of the House will continue to oppose this inequitable and nasty piece of public policy. You would think a sense of shame or common decency would restrain this government in their plan to introduce higher charges for medicine, but we know the history of the government. For as long as they can get away with it, they will continue to attack the battlers. This is not a good piece of legislation and I am sure that, if members on the government side gave due consideration to the long-term ramifications of what it means to their communities and to the people they represent, they too would agree it should not be allowed to pass in this House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2002-12-02,"—I address my comments to those in the parliament building and to all those around the country who are listening to this debate on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], and I ask those who are listening to listen a little more carefully to what I have to say. I start from the point that the Howard government established a reputation for doing the hard things that are necessary for our country, for standing up for good public policy, for not just doing the easy things but for addressing the difficult issues and coming through. There are people who do not like the government for that, but they respect the government because we have a go. This debate has degenerated into speeches on what is good public policy from one side as opposed to speeches articulated by the opposition that use the words `the big end of town', `class distinction' and `thugging pensioners'. You hear that sort of debate. Those who are listening have to understand that there is a clear distinction between the government's position and the opposition's position.
It is easy, if you want to, to simplistically say, `The cost of medicine shouldn't go up,' or to ask, `How are pensioners going to afford the increase that is proposed?' It is a little more difficult to think through the issue and to understand why the government is making some hard decisions and asking the people of Australia to understand why these things are necessary. I would like to address those particular issues. I ask people to filter out the opportunistic rhetoric of the Australian Labor Party and to listen to the facts and the logic of the debate. I would like to start with the amendments that have been moved by the opposition. The preamble to the amendments before the House reads: 
... the House rejects this bill for the following reasons:
The first reason is:
... it will increase by nearly 30% the cost of essential medicines, hitting the sickest and poorest in our society ...
I ask you to listen to that again:
... it will increase by nearly 30% the cost of essential medicines, hitting the sickest and poorest in our society ...
If you were a pensioner and you heard just that without hearing any explanation, you would be scared witless. That is what the opposition are doing. The fact is that it is absolutely and plainly wrong. Where do they get the 30 per cent from? They get it from our asking pensioners to pay about an extra dollar per script, with a maximum of $52 extra a year. What they do not look at is the average number of medicines prescribed for a pensioner. When you work out all of that, the actual increase is only about one per cent on average; it is next to nothing. That plain fact shows you that you cannot believe what the opposition say.
I saw a constituent—and everybody in this place talks about their constituents—a couple of weeks ago at the RSL war veterans home. She was angry that the government had the temerity to suggest that we put up her prescription by $1. She did not understand that it was capped at $52, nor did she understand that the medicine she was getting was worth about $150,000 a year to the taxpayers of Australia. She did not understand that. Once I explained that to her, she said, `I'm sorry for being angry when you came to see me. I now understand what the position is.' 
The second point the opposition puts forward is:
... Australian pensioners and concession cardholders will go without almost five million prescriptions, and Australian families will also go without almost half a million prescriptions as a result of the proposed increase ...
They will go without nothing. It is a disgrace that the Labor Party should put that forward. Why would they go without anything? For pensioners, this government introduced the automatic indexation of pensions—which has been highly successful and highly appreciated by the less well-off in our community—and here we are asking them to pay a maximum of $52 a year for up to $150,000 worth of medicines. If a pensioner cannot pay an extra $1 a prescription, there is something wrong. Indeed, my mum is a pensioner and she saves money on the pension. She does very well; she certainly has no qualms about it. I believe it is entirely reasonable, for the reasons I am going to come up with shortly, to ask pensioners to pay an additional $1.
The third point in the opposition's amendment says:
by depriving sick and elderly Australians of the medicines they need, there will be an increased need for greater medical interventions ...
Let me tell you who is going to deprive pensioners of the medicines they need: the Australian Labor Party by voting down this legislation. Why is that? The answer is of course that, if the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is unsustainable, the government cannot afford to put new medicines on the scheme—new medicines that pensioners need—and they will become unavailable. It is the Australian Labor Party that will deprive sick and elderly Australians of medicines they should be entitled to. I say to the Australian Labor Party: pass this legislation. Give the government and the country the ability to fund the provision of the new, modern medicines that every day become available.
There is a sting in the tail here: if the Labor Party do not pass this legislation—they have indicated that they do not intend to, and they seem pretty gleeful about that—the big end of town to which they refer will be able to afford to buy these new medicines and pay full price; they will have access to them. But what about the sick and the elderly in our community? The Australian Labor Party will deny them access to the latest medicines available. I think that is disgraceful.
The fourth point the opposition put forward is:
there are other, more effective, means by which the long term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could be assured, ... 
I have heard the Labor Party suggestions in this regard. They are tinkering at the edges; they are not addressing the particular fiscal issues we need to address. With the increase in the PBS running at around $700 million a year, year on year, you cannot tinker at the edges. A hallmark of the Howard government has been financial responsibility, and it is financially irresponsible of the Australian Labor Party to suggest that the country can afford a PBS that goes on increasing $700 million a year, year on year.
Previous speakers from the Labor Party in this debate have said this is all about the budget bottom line. Of course it is. That is what the Labor Party do not seem to understand and they certainly did not in the last five years they were in government. Why is it about the budget bottom line? The single most important thing that any government in any country in the world can do is run a healthy economy and a surplus budget, because that is the single most important thing that helps low-income earners, the elderly and the sick. It is the ability of the government to provide for people who cannot provide for themselves. Without running a strong fiscal program and without running a budget bottom line that runs in surplus, you cannot continue. The Labor Party think you can just by racking up debt, but that will come back to haunt you at some stage in the future. As everyone who owns a home knows, the quicker you pay off your home the better off you are. The Labor Party have the opposite view: the more you borrow the better off you are. That can only last for a few years and then it will all implode.
The government do not resile from wanting to make sure that the budget bottom line is important. We are careful about what we do. We are fiscally responsible. We do do the hard things. I think that if you talk to the sick and the elderly in the country you will find they would prefer that the government operate that way. I hear arguments along the lines, `If you've got money, you can get a Rolls Royce health care scheme.' I think the member for Shortland said that. Again there is this class distinction business. It is sickening to hear that as an excuse for a logical debate in the Australian parliament. The member for Shortland does not understand that a considerable number of pensioners have private health insurance. The Australian Labor Party do not seem to understand how those pensioners will react if the Australian Labor Party try to take the 30 per cent health rebate off them. You do not have to be operating at the top end of town to enjoy private health insurance. I speak to many pensioners who jealously guard their ability to stay in private health insurance. The member for Shortland also mentioned a pensioner to whom she has spoken who is taking 18 pills a day and who is frightened. The member for Shortland, if she were a responsible member of this parliament, would have pointed out that the government's measure is capped, that the pensioner need pay no more than $52 in a whole year and after that all of the medicines are free. If this pensioner is taking 18 pills a day, just imagine what that is costing the Commonwealth of Australia and how many scripts will be dispensed over a year. It is very good value to make sure that that particular pensioner can continue to receive the very best of the PBS by just paying an extra dollar a script.
The member for Prospect also spoke in this debate—again, there was this class distinction bit—and she said, `The government is off to its mates in the financial sector and ain't we wonderful.' I say to the member for Prospect that the Howard government is very proud that it runs the best performing economy in the OECD. It has underpinned the success of this country over the last several years; it has underpinned the success of the state governments, which is a bizarre result but the parliament knows what I am talking about.
—I see. You're claiming credit for the Victorian result.
—I am, and very proudly so. People understand how the costs of health and medicines are rising. People understand that, and they are not going to be fooled by the scare campaign of the Australian Labor Party. They know that somebody has to pay and it is the taxpayer. At the end of the day, the taxpayer pays. They understand that money does not grow on trees and that, if you run yourself into debt, you do not do well for the country. You have to be a bit responsible about these things when you are in government. John Howard and the government, as I have said earlier, have had the guts to take the hard decisions and go to the Australian people and say, `We know you mightn't like it, but it's got to be done in the interests of our country and in the interests of our kids. We want this to continue to be a great country, not a country that is burdened down by crippling debt.' Yet the Labor Party calls this a mean-spirited government. Here we are, looking after the nation, and in the Labor Party's terminology that is mean-spirited. I plead guilty to being mean-spirited. I want to make sure the nation is looked after first and foremost. But this measure is also about looking after the sick and the elderly in this country—and what better objective to have than that—and it is about the budget bottom line. 
A number of pensioners struggle. Labor complains about $52. I understand that can be difficult. It is difficult for pensioners who do not own their own home. There is a moral in the story there, I guess, for those who are coming through the system. The Labor Party complains about $52 extra for a pensioner who might be getting $150,000 worth of medicine, but how will the pensioner feel if the Labor Party takes their private health insurance rebate off them and whacks them with a bill of $600? How does the pensioner feel about this claim that somehow or other the public hospital system will suffer greater cost if this measure goes through? If the Labor Party's measure to knock off the private health insurance rebate goes through, I can tell you that the public hospital system is going to have an even greater cost. I just do not understand that philosophy.
The member for Perth amazingly said that one of the causes of the problem is that the government listed Celebrex and Zyban on the PBS. He was kind of arguing that we should not have listed them. So I ask all the arthritis sufferers out there: how do you feel about the fact that the Labor Party thinks Celebrex should not have been listed? How about the people who have successfully used Zyban to give up smoking and have potentially saved the health system money? The member for Perth said that this was a problem and we should not have listed them. Then of course he went on with his famous line—which you would expect from the Australian Labor Party—that the government wants to thug pensioners. We can have a debate where the Australian Labor Party uses emotive terms like `thugging pensioners', `the top end of town', `the sick and the elderly', `the poorest in our society' and whatever else, or we can have an intelligent debate based on the merits of the particular bill before the parliament. I am confident that those who listen to the logic and the merits of the argument that the government is putting will understand that this bill is in the interests of our country. This bill is in the interests of the sickest and the poorest in our community. It is in the interests of the pensioners of Australia because, without it, they are going to be denied the very medicines that might be needed to keep them alive in years to come. I certainly support the bill.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] says so much about the character of the Howard government, and indeed the speech from the member for Herbert says so much about him—that is, this government has not got a clue what a dollar is worth to someone on a low income. It has not got a clue how it is vandalising Medicare to the point where there are whole groups of people in the community who can no longer afford to go to the doctor and who in fact are delaying doing so, and where whole groups of people in the community are paying so much more for their health care that it is having a very substantial impact on their living standards. The fact is that the higher prices for essential medicines contained in this bill are part and parcel of a wider financial pressure that this government is imposing on low-and middle-income Australians.
The member for Herbert really was arguing against himself. We heard what a brilliant economy we had. We heard how well things were going. We know we have the highest tax take in our history. We know the GST is producing rivers of gold. But the only people who are going to suffer from this bill are people on low and middle incomes who have to pay more for their essential medicines, who have to delay going to the doctor, who have out-of-pocket health care costs which are savaging their living standards and costing their capacity to buy the essentials of life, like food and education for their children. So what we have here is that the highest taxing government in our history—which assured us there would be plenty of money for the essentials of public services, health and education—has suddenly turned around and decided to impose very significant additional costs on people for their essential medicines. This says so much about the character of the Howard government and so much about the member for Herbert as well. They cannot appreciate how much $1, $4 or $5 may mean in the budget of someone on a low or middle income. What we get from this government is higher prices, higher taxes and more expensive services. This is particularly the case when it comes to health services, hurting many hundreds of thousands of Australians. 
The government by its contribution tonight has highlighted once again that it does not walk in the same shopping aisles as average Australians; indeed, it certainly does not visit the same surgeries. The government simply does not have a clue about what is happening at the supermarket or the surgery, nor does it care that its assault on affordable health care is eroding the Australian ethos of a fair go. Essential to the Australian ethos of a fair go is affordable health care, because it brings real security to individuals and the nation—just as much as security armies or fighter planes do.
This bill is an attack on families and an assault on older Australians. It seeks to increase the general patient copayment from $22.40 to $28.60. It seeks to increase the concessional copayment from $3.60 to $4.60. It will also increase the general patient safety net threshold by nearly $200 and the concessional patient safety net threshold by more than $50. The Treasurer, Peter Costello, wants average families and older Australians struggling on low fixed incomes to pay more for essential health care. Essentially, the government wants to turn Medicare inside out. It wants Medicare to cease being a universal health system and become a user-pays system. It wants to refashion the health care system in Australia along American lines. In America, families are under financial pressure and the elderly miss out.
I have been getting this feedback continuously from my electorate and from areas in north Brisbane. I will quote from one letter I have received recently from Denise in Kedron. She states:
While my husband can pay for our visits to a doctor, I have friends who cannot afford visits. For 9 months last year my husband was out of work and we just did not go to the doctor, even for the flu etc. Just too expensive.
Under the proposals in this bill, the government's savings are based on the sorts of savings being produced by people not attending to their health care. The Department of Health and Ageing has estimated that, if Peter Costello's price hikes for prescriptions in this bill are passed by this parliament, there will be 5½ million fewer prescriptions filled each year—5½ million prescriptions unfilled because Australians cannot afford the cost. Families and older Australians will go and, indeed, are going without essential medicines. Labor will not support this kind of cost cutting.
Of course, this is not the first time the Howard government has tried to slug pensioners and families more over the chemist counter. The 1996-97 budget also increased PBS copayments. Pensioners, in particular, felt the pinch with the price of each script filled jumping almost 20 per cent, from $2.70 to $3.20. The hike also broke the nexus that existed between the PBS copayment and the pharmaceutical allowance, which previously saw the copayment fully compensated for by the government. For pensioners this was the same as a pension cut. And there was more. The GST increased the price of many over-the-counter medicines by 10 per cent. Also, with the introduction of the GST, the pharmaceutical allowance was subject to the same clawback that occurred with the pension. So the four per cent pharmaceutical allowance increase was cut by two per cent. To add insult to injury, and despite a pledge from the government that the GST would not impact on prescription medicines, the copayment increased by six per cent in January 2001, due to its link to the CPI. So pensioners wore a 10 per cent hike in over-the-counter medicines, and a six per cent hike in prescription medicines, with only a two per cent increase in the pharmaceutical allowance. 
What do these cumulative hikes add up to? Since 1996, the price of prescription medicines for pensioners has increased at a rate of 4½ times—I will say that again: 4½ times—that of the pharmaceutical allowance designed to compensate those people. And there is more. Since 1996, over 60 medicines have been de-listed from the PBS. Among those medicines were treatments for skin conditions, anti-inflammatory medicines and nasal sprays. Pensioners and families now meet the full cost of those medicines. Combined with the copayment hikes, the typical pensioner is now paying over $140 a year more for essential medicines. All that is before the hikes contained in this bill we are debating now come into force, if we are unfortunate enough for them to be passed. On top of this, we have the decline in bulk-billing. Even before pensioners and families get to the pharmacy, they have to see their doctor. As the Howard government tightens the screws, pensioners and families are copping it coming and going.
The truth is that the Howard government is determined to destroy our world-class health system—a system that is underpinned by the PBS and Medicare. The bulk-billing crisis in the waiting rooms of doctors' surgeries nationwide is hitting Australians hard. Just as young families are particularly reliant on Medicare, so are older Australians. Having worked hard and paid taxes all their lives, they know that, even with a lower retirement income, good quality health care is not beyond their means—well, not until it is got to by Peter Costello and John Howard, who are trying to change all that. You have to look no further than the decline in bulk-billing. In my electorate of Lilley, the rate of bulk-billing has dropped eight per cent in two years. This equates to approximately 2,000 doctor visits per week where patients are now being hit with up-front payments. Nearly one in three visits to the doctor in my electorate is no longer bulk-billed and the patient is hit with up-front fees.
One of my constituents who has diabetes and is from Taigum wrote to me the other day saying:
... my biggest concern is for my family who are unable to go to our doctor because we don't have the cash on hand to pay for the visit.
Another constituent from the same suburb told me that, as a result of the drop in bulk-billing:
Both my husband and myself have delayed a visit to the Doctors because of the cost involved.
This decline in bulk-billing sees many older Australians seeking treatment in public and emergency hospital departments. Recently a constituent from Zillmere wrote to me saying:
It's unfair that people have to line up in the hospital for hours & given ... service by overtired staff because going to the doctors is too expensive. Good medical care is a right, not a luxury. That's the way it should be. We are not a Third World country.
Unfortunately, through measures like this, we are rapidly heading in that direction.
During the time the Howard government has been in office, bulk-billing by GPs has declined by 10 per cent, while the average cost of seeing a doctor who does not bulk-bill has increased by more than 50 per cent to $12.57 per visit. Bulk-billing is a central part of Medicare and it continues to enjoy the overwhelming support of individual Australians and their families. The problem is that the decline in bulk-billing threatens the very principle of Medicare itself. Right now some Australians are still able to access bulk-billing by shopping around—although that is getting harder—but only if they are prepared for the inconvenience of travelling to a bulk-billing practice beyond their immediate local area.
Many others are affected by not having access to local Medicare offices. Recently I was on Bribie Island, a retirement area north of Brisbane, where I received a petition from over 1,000 locals, led by Alice and Ron Donovan, asking for a local Medicare office. The hardworking locals who put this petition together made these points. They said to me that, because there is no Medicare office, if they are unlucky enough not to have a bulk-billing doctor—which is increasingly the experience—they have to go to the local pharmacy and apply for their rebate. It then takes four days for the rebate to be deposited into their account. If they want to get their rebate from a Medicare office, they have to travel via public transport for over half a day to receive it. Many of them are in the unfortunate position of not being able to go to a doctor because they simply cannot afford the out-of-pocket expenses involved. Even if they can afford those expenses on the day, they are not in a position to immediately retrieve their rebate because of the distance to the nearest Medicare office, and that therefore deters them from making visits to a doctor. 
The truth is that there are many Australians now who have to choose between their health and their bank balance, if they have one. Many of these people are now putting their health in danger because they cannot access bulk-billing. Or, because there is no Medicare office, they cannot access a rebate and therefore are not able to go to the doctor. And in many cases—in many of these areas—that is before you get to the problem where doctors are simply closing their books and refusing to admit new patients. Unless the trend in bulk-billing is turned around, many of these people will simply be locked out of the medical system. A constituent of mine from Nundah sums it up best when she says, `Keeping good health is getting to be totally unaffordable.' These are her circumstances. She wrote:
As a sole parent with a young son, even though I am working full time, we are still on a fixed limited income. Private health takes a big lump out and I have just recently had x rays done on my son's foot and the gap was about $35. Keeping good health is getting to be totally unaffordable.
That is from someone with private health insurance. These are the pressures from the health system on low- and middle-income Australians.
As I have already said, older Australians have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives. They deserve respect and support in their old age. For many, retirement was a reward, but increasingly, with many of these pressures, for some it is getting more difficult. During its time in office, the Howard government has been steadily trying to strip from older Australians the basics they need for a modest but comfortable retirement. The introduction of the GST directly undercut the buying power of the aged pension. For starters, the March 2001 government decision to claw back half the pension increase it gave to pensioners when it introduced the GST was a devastating blow. That amounted to $7.90 per fortnight for a single or $13.20 for a couple. That is just one example of the fine print conditions that apply: `You'll all be compensated for the GST; don't read the conditions.' Suddenly, a few months later, it is all whipped away. That is before you get to the promise that was made about the $1,000 bonus, which was supposed to have been paid to the whole lot of them; four in 10 over 60 received nothing. These are the people who have paid more for gas and electricity and have had their living standards eroded, because the impact of the GST and other price rises on the basics on which they spend money has been proportionally higher than the average increase in the CPI. These are the people who have been caught in a vicious cost squeeze.
My own local Pricewatch survey has revealed how the cost of even basic items has risen far in excess of the general increase in the price of goods and services. My Pricewatch team has analysed milk and bread price trends, and the results show that the price of staples are increasing at double the CPI. The survey examines the cost of a litre of full cream milk and two national brands of plain white sliced bread. Over the period of the Pricewatch survey, full cream milk rose from an average of $1.17 a litre in January 1999 to $1.49 in September 2002, an increase of 27 per cent—one we can thank the National Party for. A 650-gram loaf of Tiptop Sunblest bread rose 25 per cent from $2.12 in January 1999 to $2.65 in September this year. A 700-gram loaf of sliced Buttercup Wonder White bread rose 26 per cent from $2.33 in February 2000 to $2.94 in the September Pricewatch survey. Since that time, it has risen another 8c a loaf at Coles and Woolworths. Bread and milk have gone through the roof. Their increases are far in excess of those of the CPI and far in excess of any of the sorts of increases that have been offered and that have supposedly been put there to protect low-income people in our community. 
It is easy to see why older Australians on fixed incomes are feeling as though they are going backwards—let alone families on fixed incomes with a couple of children or incomes made modest by the cost of bringing up their children. When bread, milk and other staples in life are rising at that rate, the changes have a savage impact on the living standards of Australians. The CPI is used in part to determine how much wages and pensions should increase. But if the price of staples like bread and milk are increasing at a faster rate than the CPI, many of these people are falling behind.
The same applies to low-income self-funded retirees. Low interest rates might be good for those purchasing a home, but they can reduce the income of retirees. Brian Rowell of Mount Gravatt in my home city of Brisbane wrote to me two weeks ago, and I want to repeat some of what he had to say. He said:
As self-funded retirees, we hear with dismay that interest rates are unlikely to rise before the year 2004. Interest on (dwindling) capital and a plummeting stock market now are the only streams of income left to us.
This modest income is further eroded by insidious price increases at the local supermarket that appear to bear no relationship to that fiction called the Consumer Price Index.
Age, not to say weariness, leaves us optionless. Self motivation must have got us where we are today but now we can no longer `stiffen the sinews', already plagued with arthritis, nor can we summon up the blood to go prospecting for work or work harder, as mindlessly recommended by our well-heeled, cynical leadership with their fatuous exhortations—
such as we get from the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table. Brian Rowell continues:
Now we are in `No Man's Land' and defenceless against the few national corporate marauders dominating the market place and plundering our pockets with their open licence ... or so it seems. 
There is something of the `Alice in Wonderland' attitude about the current indifference meted out today by authority who look benignly down upon the jungle playground where tooth and claw tactics are allowed to rule the day. Look at Banks, Supermarkets, et al. 
If it has been said that a civilisation is judged by the care it takes of its poor, then ours is sorely indicted.
Mr Rowell has been monitoring the price of household grocery items in his suburb and claims the average cost of each of the items in his supermarket trolley has increased by an average of 26 per cent since January 2000.
Recently I met with the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales, who presented me with a petition which I shall present to this House next Monday. They are rightly concerned about the inability of the age pension to keep pace with the cost of living. They want the rate of the age pension to reflect the true cost of living. Next week I will be presenting to the parliament their petition for a rethink of the pension formula. It calls for an increase in the rate of the age pension to meet the costs of essentials like bread, milk and electricity, but does not take into account the savage assault the Minister for Ageing is mounting through the withdrawal of bulk-billing and the increase in the cost of essential medicines. I believe we need to go back to basics, rethink the way we measure the cost of living and see how this is impacting on many low-income Australians.
It is clear from the spending patterns of older Australians, and those of many single Australians and families as well, that the overall inflation rate does not show just how hard life is for them. They are consuming more basic goods, which are rising faster than the average. This is not reflected in the official figures. Through its attack on Medicare, its attempt to ratchet up the cost of medicines and its taxing away the modest incomes of older Australians the Howard government is undercutting their livelihood. What is so mean about this government is the fact that, after years of backbreaking toil, Australians who expect to be treated with respect and dignity in their retirement are simply copping it in the neck through these increases in essential medicines, at the supermarket through the increase in the price of so many of those basics and generally through the fact that they now bear a much larger proportion of the tax burden in this community than they did before the introduction of the GST. The Howard government mouths rhetoric about being in touch with ordinary people, but the truth when you look at it is that this government does not defend the battlers, it simply creates them. ",REPS,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS—BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2002-12-02,"—I rise in the House tonight to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is a very important bill and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. As I go around my electorate I talk to many people. I have asked them what sort of pharmaceutical benefits scheme they want. Do they want a scheme that is going to meet their needs well into the future? Do they want a scheme that is going to be sustainable? Do they want a scheme that is going to make the latest drugs available? Or do they want a scheme that is going to collapse? People invariably say that they want a sustainable scheme that is going to deliver the latest in drugs. They want a scheme that is going to meet their needs. This bill aims to ensure the sustainability of our Pharmaceut-ical Benefits Scheme, a great scheme that is the envy of many countries around the world.
Why do we need the scheme to be sustainable? The reasons are obvious to us on the government side, but perhaps members opposite have some difficulty with fiscal responsibility. It is easy to provide services with no reference to cost. If you can spend like there is no tomorrow, you can do just about anything. But the results are obvious. We have seen them in government before; we have seen them with high inflation and high interest rates. Who is most affected when interest rates are rushing away and inflation is high? Certainly the most needy members of our community are the ones most affected, not the top end of town that members opposite are so keen to knock. They are not the ones who are affected greatly; it is the people who are most needy in our community. That is why this government wants to preserve our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and have a scheme that is sustainable, but we have to do it with responsible government and within cost parameters that ensure we can continue to provide the sorts of services people want.
When you look at the figures you see why it is so important that the scheme be reformed. If you look at the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—some $4.8 billion in 2001-02—you see that it is a very large item of government expenditure, and one that needs to be considered very carefully. You have to consider not only the gross amount of that figure but also the fact that that $4.8 billion represented a 13.6 per cent increase on the previous year—and the problem is not just this year. Over the past decade the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has increased by an average of about 14 per cent per annum. Anyone with any knowledge of maths would know that with a compounding rate of 14 per cent it will not take long before the scheme is running wildly out of control. That is why this government has taken the difficult but measured decision to implement measures that are going to reform the scheme and preserve its ability to provide those pharmaceuticals into the future.
The Intergenerational Report showed that by 2042 the number of people over the age of 65 will have doubled and the number of people over the age of 85 will have quadrupled. I see the Minister for Ageing sitting at the table and I am pleased to say that senior members of our community know that their interests are in good hands with the Minister for Ageing: he is very caring and very compassionate about our aged people. By 2042 the cost of health care is set to double. These are pretty staggering figures. How much is the PBS going to cost in 2040? It is going to cost around $60 billion, so it is time we put measures in place to ensure we have the sustainability we are looking for. I am sure members opposite are happy to go along in some sort of airy-fairy land, let the costs run out of control and let the budget run into deficit. They will be selling off more assets and still be running a deficit. They have form in those areas, but we are after responsible reform that ensures we can meet community needs. We want to make sure we get quality new drugs—those expensive drugs—when they are available so that people have the very best in medical care. 
Under the current scheme, concession cardholders pay $3.60 per script and general patients pay $22.60 per script. That is in spite of the huge cost of medications. Glivec costs over $6,000 per script; Taxol, a cancer drug, costs $2,350 a script; Betaferon for multiple sclerosis costs $1,175 a script; and Zoladex for prostate cancer costs $1,150 per script. These vast costs are met by our very fine scheme; yet how much do we ask of the concession cardholder who may need Glivec at over $6,000 a script? We ask for $3.60. I have to say that, if the taxpayers of this country are willing to pay over $6,000 to improve an individual's quality of life, I think it only fair and reasonable that we ask that individual for an additional $1 to assist the taxpayer in meeting their needs and providing them with a better quality of life. I think it is a totally reasonable proposition and I think most reasonable people on the street would agree.
As I go around my electorate and tell people about the subsidy that the government is providing to people out there—the costs of drugs that are being provided at very modest cost—people say, `Why hasn't this been pointed out to me before?' It is because the members opposite want to hide the huge subsidies that this government, through the PBS, is giving. People are unaware of the vast cost of these drugs. When you explain to them that the government is paying $2,350 for Taxol, for instance, and patients are being required to pay $3.60 now and one more dollar under our scheme, they agree; they think that is totally reasonable. The member for Herbert quite rightly pointed that out earlier. It is a totally reasonable measure and one that this House should support. I am disappointed that the members opposite have not joined with us in ensuring the sustainability of this scheme.
What is going to happen under the scheme? We are asking for an additional $1 per script from concession cardholders and an additional $6.20 per script from general patients, increasing the amount they have to pay to $28.60. You would have to agree that even $28.60 for a drug that costs taxpayers in excess of $6,000 is totally reasonable.
Another thing that is not mentioned is that, under our changes to the scheme, many drugs do not increase in price. Members opposite only make a big deal about the ones that do, but the fact is that the price of a great many drugs under our scheme does not change. Under the proposed changes, the price of those drugs will remain the same. For example, the price of Ventolin before the changes to the PBS is $13. How much will it be after the changes to the PBS? Not $18, not $15, but $13. It is completely unchanged. Feldene currently costs $14. How much will it cost after the changes? Still $14; no change. But members opposite do not want to let anyone know that. They just want to continue this scare campaign, scaring the elderly and scaring the sick into thinking that they will not be able to afford quality pharmaceuticals under the scheme.
We are not abandoning the sick; we are not abandoning the poor. We have included a safety net, a very reasonable safety net. Once concession cardholders have had 52 prescriptions per year they do not have to pay any more for their pharmaceuticals. Once general patients have had 31 scripts, further prescriptions are available at the concessional rate of $4.60. These measures are very well thought out. They aim to balance the needs of the community with the sustainability of the scheme. It makes economic sense.
Let us look at a range of other drugs. The average cost of a prescription of Lipex is about $60.86. How much is that costing the government every year? Some $251 million. Lipex is a drug for high cholesterol. Lipitor costs $59.71 for a prescription. The cost to the government was around $250 million in the year ending 31 December 2001. There are many of these drugs and the costs are staggering. This government has taken the responsible position of putting in measures that bring this scheme under control. Celebrex is a popular arthritis drug. It costs $46.92 per script; the cost to the government is $142 million. Zyban, the anti-smoking drug for nicotine addiction, costs $249.51 a script. How much does a concession cardholder have to pay for this drug under our revised changes? Only $4.60. What is that costing the taxpayer per year? Around $82 million. These figures are quite staggering.  
These measures are absolutely vital. I am totally committed to these proposed changes. The government is committed to these changes. It is just unfortunate that members opposite, instead of joining with us in ensuring sustainability, are engaging in some cheap point scoring. We have had a lecture by the member for Lilley on the price of bread and the price of full cream milk. While he felt he was enlightening us, the real issues are ensuring the sustainability of the scheme and ensuring that people have access to the very latest in medicines.
I will list a couple more. Zoloft, an antidepressant drug, costs $38.88 a script and costs the taxpayer $64 million. Human insulin for the treatment of diabetes costs $189.19 a script and costs the taxpayer $75 million. I think most Australians would agree that it is totally reasonable that the government assist people in meeting their needs with these drugs. But the government firmly believes that, while it is prepared to do that, it has to slightly increase the contribution by those people in receipt of those drugs.
In conclusion, this is a very important bill. It is important when you look at it in terms of the Intergenerational Report. The growth in our aged population means that the demand for medical services is likely to increase. We have to begin now to take the steps to ensure that the cost of the PBS does not blow out to $60 billion, as the Intergenerational Report said it will if no measures are taken. We do not want to bury our heads in the sand like members opposite and just ignore things. I noticed the member for Prospect had a range of issues but there was no actual quantification of the savings that they might make. We cannot have a number of airy-fairy notions; we need to look very carefully at what needs to be done from a cost perspective to keep this scheme affordable and to keep the drugs flowing to the people who very dearly need them.
I totally support the bill. It is one that shows that we are a responsible government. We are fiscally responsible; we are also very caring for those who are most needy in the community, the sick and the poor. We are making sure that they have the very best care. We do not want to see the system collapse. We do not want to see the budget blow out, as members opposite would do. They might be able to provide a PBS but it would be at the cost of high inflation and high interest rates. They would see the budget deficit running out of control and, as I think the Treasurer said some time back, they would be selling off the house and still increasing the mortgage.
This is a very important bill and it is totally responsible. I think the government should be commended on it. I know that the Minister for Ageing totally supports the bill. With his very fine grasp of the portfolio of ageing he is aware of the need for these drugs to be provided at reasonable cost throughout the community. Members opposite are foolish in that they cannot see the need for this reform while the government can. I commend this bill to the House and am looking forward to members opposite supporting the passage of this bill so that we can ensure that the delivery of quality medications to the people who most need them is maintained.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-12-02,"—This evening, I would like to speak about an important event which is unfolding in my electorate of Calwell. A few weeks ago I wrote to the mayor of the city of Hume, which falls within my electorate of Calwell, proposing that we bid for the acquisition of Melbourne's Centenary of Federation Arch. A subsequent Hume City Council meeting approved a motion by Councillor Gary Jungwirth proposing that Hume indeed bid for the federation arch, which is looking for a permanent home as its temporary position on Melbourne's St Kilda Road is about to come to an end. 
It has now become a bit of a contentious issue amongst residents with many expressing disapproval for the council's bid on the basis that they are deeply concerned about the costs associated with removing and reassembling the structure if Hume were to become its permanent new home. The council has estimated that it may cost up to $200,000. Naturally, residents are right to feel concerned. I support the council's bid for the federation arch but only on the basis that ratepayers' money is not used to foot the bill. I also believe that the council has a similar view and they will attempt to raise the money from other sources, such as corporate sponsorship and donations.
—They will tempt West Heidelberg!
—Indeed, there is quite a bit of competition for a $200,000 bill. For those who have not seen the Centenary of Federation Arch, it is a visually stunning piece of art, innovative in design, which has straddled Melbourne's Princes Bridge—right in the heart of our arts precinct—as a commemoration of our Federation and continues a fine tradition of arches in this country. Centenary of Federation arches were constructed across the country to help celebrate the Federation of the Australian Commonwealth. The idea that arches were to be the symbol of our federation is based on the fact that arches were a popular form of architecture at the beginning of the 20th century, which was of course around the time of the birth of our nation.
Melbourne City Council is seeking proposals from towns or organisations interested in inheriting the 30-tonne structure. It is a controversial structure, akin to another controversial Melbourne icon, colloquially known as the `Yellow Peril'. Given the city of Melbourne wants to relocate the arch, it must also bear some responsibility towards the costs of moving and reconstructing it. It is a bit cute for the city of Melbourne to take an economic rationalist view of the future of the arch by calling for competitive tendering when in fact the arch was donated to Melbourne City Council in the first place. The council has had the benefit of the arch and should now, together with its corporate partners, bear the cost of relocating it. It may have to give this proposal some serious thinking because the estimated costs of removal will serve as a deterrent for those councils who are interested in offering it a new home.
Tattersall, who described the arch as `a gift to the people of Australia', donated the $500,000 for Melbourne's Centenary of Federation Arch. Its design was based on images of 1901 arches and reflects the diversity of cultures working together in our first century. It featured lighting that ran from dusk to dawn to highlight the construction of coloured metal rods with semitransparent cloth covering it. This arch is probably the most innovative arch the world has ever seen, even though some people describe it as a gargantuan game of pick up sticks. It is affectionately known as `pick up sticks' in Melbourne. The city of Hume is big and appropriate enough for the Centenary of Federation Arch. I am pleased that the idea has received support from a majority of our councillors. I would like to reassure our ratepayers that not one cent of their money will be used for the relocation costs if Hume is successful in its bid.
As the member for the area, I come into regular contact with local residents who are committed to preserving and enhancing our area's historical sites and values. The acquisition of the Centenary of Federation Arch would enhance the history of the area. The area bordered by the city of Hume is an important part of the nation's pre and post Federation history, ranging from the Kulin nation of Aboriginal people's history in the area, the exploration of European explorers Hume and Hovell, and John Fawkner's development of the region to the use of local land, known as the Maygar Barracks, for military purposes in World Wars I and II.
There are numerous open spaces in the municipality which would be suitable for the structure. Naturally, there will be people who will find the idea peculiar or even shocking, but I am sure that in due time they will warm to the proposal. Bold structures such as the arch will give the city of Hume a much needed boost of constructive controversy, but more importantly will put Broadmeadows on the map as a city that can be a serious part of Melbourne's cultural and artistic life. We are, after all, the gateway to the city of Melbourne. Tullamarine airport is at the centre of our city and we are a perfect home for this extraordinary piece of art and history.
