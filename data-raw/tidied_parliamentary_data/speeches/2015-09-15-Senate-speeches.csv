Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:32):  I am pleased to inform the Senate that Labor supports the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015, and we will facilitate its passage through the Senate today. We support this bill because this bill facilitates Australia joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Labor has said consistently that Australia should join this bank. We were saying this consistently way before the government. While the cabinet was in meltdown—while the foreign minister, Ms Bishop, was arguing with the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, and while the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, was dithering about whether to join this bank—the opposition was saying very clearly that it was an easy decision: Australia must join. Australia should join this bank because it is the right thing to do. Australia should join this bank because China has shown leadership in setting up this bank and the rest of the world should join.


But the government dithered; the government could not make its mind up. The foreign minister said we should not join for reasons known only to herself. The Treasurer, to give him credit, knew that we should join, but he could not carry the day in cabinet. On the other hand the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and our shadow minister for foreign affairs, Ms Plibersek; and our shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, were of one mind immediately—this was an easy decision. This is a great opportunity for Australia. It is a good opportunity for the world to come together to deal with the infrastructure gap in Asia and to work together on the development of Asia. But, no, while the Labor Party was lending bipartisan support to this from last October the government could not make up its mind. 


As I have said, Labor is supporting this bill and is facilitating its speedy passage through the Senate today. I note that we have already agreed to exempt this bill from the cut-off order to enable it to be considered in this sitting week. Further, we have facilitated debate immediately following the presentation of the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. This report was completed following a public hearing with officials from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade just last night. Senators will be forgiven if they have missed this hearing, but I assure everyone that it did occur. Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, was present as was Senator Edwards and Senator Dastyari.


The Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry received two submissions, one from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and one from Stephen Howes and Robin Davies from the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University. The public hearing provided an opportunity for senators to seek clarification on a number of matters from the government. These issues included matters relating to our membership; the governance of the bank and concerns raised by Australia; the Australian shareholding; accountability; the immunities and privileges that extend, as set out in section 8 of this bill; operational policies; and the ratification process. Questions remain about a number of these matters, particularly around some of the rhetoric that has been used in public debate on the bank by government ministers. Other issues requiring further amplification relate to the capital provided to the bank, how the board of directors will operate, Australia's constituency and whether any funds can be included as official development assistance in the future—these are all matters to watch.


In light of Labor's cooperative approach to this bill, I do seek an undertaking from the minister that demonstrates a similarly cooperative approach from the government. At the hearing last night, a number of matters were taken on notice. Whilst it was disappointing that questions could not be answered, including many simple questions seeking clarification of comments by, for example, the Minister for Trade and Investment that were already on the public record we understand that sometimes it is not always possible for the officials at the table to answer questions where they require an explanation from the minister concerned. The opposition seeks an undertaking from the minister, which I hope he will be able to give in his concluding remarks, that answers to questions taken on notice at last night's hearing will be provided in a fulsome and timely way.


The opposition could have opposed the exemption of this bill from the cut-off and sought to delay consideration of this bill until the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report had been fully considered and answers to questions on notice received, but that is not the approach we are taking. We support this bill and Australia's involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and want us to be able to take up our seat at the table as soon as possible.


I look forward to the minister being able to give a commitment to the Senate, today, that this additional material will be provided in accordance with the deadline set by the committee. Then all senators and the Australian people will be able to fully understand the nature of Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the attitude of the government to some of the issues that have been raised by its own ministers. Labor has proceeded in good faith in its approach to this bill and expects the same courtesy from the government.


It was interesting to see, in the second reading speech in the other place, the Treasurer boast: 'On 29 June this year I gave effect to the government's commitment to join the AIIB by being the first person in the world to sign the bank's Articles of Agreement in the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing. My signature was followed by those representatives of 49 other countries.' 


He was boasting that Australia was first. Mr Hockey was the first to sign because Australia comes first alphabetically. That is why his signature was first. It is nothing for him to boast about. We could have been one of the first countries to join the bank when China invited the rest of the world to join. We could have been a leader. Instead, under this government, we are followers. We had to wait for other countries to join—then we decided to join. We joined after the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Korea, Germany, France, Italy, India and Singapore. All of these countries showed leadership.


Australia could have been in at the ground floor. It could have been in, working with these other countries, setting the bank up. But, no, we had to wait and see what other countries, like the United Kingdom, did. I thought we had stopped letting the United Kingdom make Australian foreign-policy decisions about 70 years ago. We know this government is dysfunctional but its dysfunction impacts on policy. Here, we have cabinet dysfunction impacting on policy and Australia missing a golden opportunity to come in at the ground floor and join this very important bank.


The Australian Infrastructure Investment Bank will fulfil a very important role. There is a significant gap in infrastructure around the Asian region. Around $8 trillion over the next decade is the widely agreed figure, which is a figure the opposition agrees with. The bank represents an opportunity for countries of the world to come together and pool funds and to provide authorised capital so that the bank can facilitate infrastructure investment. We will have a very substantial shareholding of about US$3.7 billion and I note that the second-biggest shareholding in the bank is India, about US$8.3 billion and a share of 7½ per cent. Our shareholding is substantial, as is appropriate. This is not a matter that will be reflected in budget figures, but it is an appropriate shareholding for us to have a very significant economy in the Asia-Pacific region.


We certainly support Australia's involvement and will facilitate, in every sense possible, Australia being as involved as possible, because we should be. But we should have shown much greater leadership than we did. We should have shown the leadership of a nation that understands the opportunities of Asia. There has been a lot said about China, in recent weeks, in this parliament and in public debate. There has been a lot of lecturing going on from those opposite about China and how we need to work better with China. 


We are not going to take any lectures from a government that for months got this strategic decision on China so wrong. It is a government that could not make a simple decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They have the gall to come in here, the Senate, and the other place and lecture the Labor Party about how to do business with China when you have the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, consistently saying—since last October—this is a no-brainer; this is an easy decision. If Labor were in government we would have signed up straightaway, because it is an opportunity to take. Those opposite need to understand the strategic error they have made—in waiting for other countries to show leadership and sending a signal to China that we do not care about their development. 


The position of the opposition is that we should be joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is the position we adopted last October and the one to which the government were dragged kicking and screaming. The government showed a lack of interest and foresight in not being able to make the decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is the sort of economic leadership we are seeing from this government.


China did not need to create this multilateral institution. China could have said, 'We are developing a bank and we are going to invest in ourselves.' But China made the decision to work in partnership with the rest of the world and invite other nations—not just Asian nations but nations from the rest of the world, such as the United Kingdom, France and others—into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is a good thing. Countries from the rest of the world have noted and supported this development. Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, France, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are joining this particular bank, as they should. We welcome their participation. But it would have been a whole lot better if this government had shown more leadership and realised the opportunities available, from joining the bank, rather than dithering for months and missing the opportunity to invest in infrastructure in the Asia region.


We all know about the opportunities of living on the edge of the world's fastest-growing region. We know about the burgeoning middle-class in Asia. We know about the increased demand for protein and for Australia's agricultural goods, in particular. We know about the opportunities in services, financial services and others, being exported to Asia. We know we have the skills and the capacity, in Australia, to export so many more services. Australia's financial services are highly respected and highly developed. The fourth-largest pool of funds under management in the world is in Australia, but we do not manage the funds of Asia.


Around five per cent of funds under management in Australia come from overseas. We could be doing so much better. Australia could be the financial services hub, but it would take complete engagement with the Asian economy to be so. It is not possible to reach that sort of engagement when the cabinet cannot even decide to join an important multilateral institution such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This government is so dysfunctional that it spent months arguing about whether to take up a golden opportunity to participate in a new multilateral institution.


This is not to say that other institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank or the World Bank, are not worthy of continued engagement. They have different tasks at hand, as does the International Monetary Fund. They have different tasks to conduct. But the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank fills a gap—it fills a hole. It is right and proper that the fastest-growing region in the world has its own institution devoted to infrastructure investment. It is right and proper that we, such an important economy in the Asia-Pacific region, be involved and a member.


So of course the Labor Party will give wholehearted support to this bill, as we did in the other place, but we take the opportunity to point out that these are opportunities presented to Australia last year which the government was dragged, kicking and screaming, to embrace. We are not going to have the Treasurer boasting that he was the first person in the world to sign the articles of agreement, although Labor does recognise that he was not allowed to pursue and progress signing up to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank due to the conflicting attitudes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the former Prime Minister. The Treasurer was not able to deliver what he knew was in our best interest.


We have heard a lot of words about how we need to have better conditions and better governance. That is just an excuse—and a dishonest one, at that—for months of inaction. The government have not progressed changes to the governance. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. What they have done is buy time, and they have been shown to be lacking in leadership. They have allowed other countries with much less to do with Asia than us to join before us. The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy all signed up before Australia. They all indicated their support before Australia. When these institutions are being developed, the early days are very important. People who are members early are able to influence the development of the institution. Australia lost that opportunity. We lost that opportunity on the watch of the Treasurer. It was not his fault but the fault of his Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister and the rest of the cabinet, who showed a singular lack of leadership on this matter. So let us not have any lectures from members opposite in their remarks which will follow about Asia and China and the importance of the Chinese economic relationship, because they have completely mismanaged this matter. They missed the opportunity for us to join this bank as an early adopter. The government completely got it wrong.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-09-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:47):  Perhaps Senator Brown is aware of the history of this bank and why it took so long. The US government for a number of years lobbied very hard for a lot of people in the region, including us, not to sign onto this bank. Senator Brown is right when she says the UK was the first to break ranks and do so, and after that we saw a steady trickle of people signing on, including us.


I want to, firstly, raise the issue that infrastructure in this country is also very important. We believe that there is a significant pipeline of projects in Australia that should be financed, especially at a time of record low interest rates. One of the ex-leaders of the opposition, Professor Hewson, has been very outspoken, as has Saul Eslake, a fellow Tasmanian, on the one-off historic opportunity to finance infrastructure in Australia. I just want to get on the record that, when the consultation process around the national interest analysis was conducted on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, you will see in attachment 1, the attachment on consultation:


Between 6 and 13 July 2015, Treasury sought views from state and territory governments on the AIIB Articles—


the AIIB being the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It outlines in two pages that the various governments of New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia welcomed potential investment from this bank in major infrastructure projects—for example, across New South Wales. So there was an expectation that perhaps this bank would be financing infrastructure projects in Australia, but if you read the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which goes into a bit of detail on the national interest analysis, it says: 'Although no projects have been identified in Australia, the NIA advises that the bank is likely to focus its efforts in developing countries with signiﬁcant infrastructure gaps. It is, therefore, unlikely that Australia will be a recipient of bank funding for a major infrastructure project.'


On its own, the fact that Australia needs infrastructure and this bank is unlikely to finance any in Australia is not a reason to knock it back, but I do make the point that there are a backlog of projects in this country. Saul Eslake said to a recent select committee inquiry, which I am part of, that the Australian government could spend up to $50 billion on infrastructure projects in this country under current arrangements without impacting its AAA credit rating. So let us be clear: there is no doubt that there is a need for infrastructure spending in our region and, on one level, we have a very strong feeling that Australia should be part of that, but we do need infrastructure spending in this country and it is something that the government said it would prioritise. In fact, I think our recently departed Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, said he would be an 'infrastructure Prime Minister'. As I have discovered through the select committee, that has been another broken promise. Whether because of fiscal constraints or other issues, it has not happened. So, while we are talking about infrastructure, let us not forget that Australia needs more infrastructure spending and it has a unique opportunity at this point in time.


Moving to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank itself, the concept is a good one—the idea of Australia playing a role and having a leadership role and influence over a large infrastructure investment bank in the region that has very significant Chinese buy-in is a good one. I note that one of my economic heroes, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winner, has been very outspoken in supporting this bank and the concept of this bank in the region. He has been very critical of the US government for not supporting this bank, saying, 'You're stuck in the old ways through the World Bank. This is what the Asian region needs and the US should be playing a leadership role in this.' It is very useful to point out that Professor Stiglitz has been a supporter of this bank.


As was reflected in Labor's contribution, the Greens have some very specific concerns around what has not been addressed in the scanty information that we have seen to date. I might start by talking a little bit about environmental and social policy. I note that Senator Milne, prior to leaving the Senate, got it on record—and Adam Bandt, the Greens member for Melbourne, has expressed similar concerns—that we need to see what environmental and social policies the bank will pursue or, at least, what conditions or requirements are going to be put in place for an investment bank. We have seen investment in some socially and environmentally destructive infrastructure in the Asian region such as building dams in Sarawak displacing rural communities and ruining the environment. These are the kinds of things that we want to see avoided. So it makes sense to have some very clear-cut guidelines in place.


I have a number of questions for the government. I wish I had been able to get to the JSCOT meeting yesterday so I could have asked the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others the questions directly—I was in here debating the amendments to a bill for small business. I will ask some questions during the committee stage. In particular, what is the government's intention in relation to the development of policies in regard to environmental and social impacts? Does the government intend to try to influence the development of the policy of the bank? Is it even clear if the government can influence that?


Going back to the national interest analysis, at page 29 and 39 it says that 'the NIA advises that Australia is negotiating to lead a constituency of regional members which would, as a group, be able to secure a seat on the board of directors. If successful, this position should allow Australia to enforce decisions made by the bank.' I would have thought that, before we signed up to this, we would have had a guarantee that we would be able to influence decisions of the bank and that we had secured a seat on the board. If you go to page 4 of the national interest statement, it makes this look a little more certain than the analysis that was given to us by JSCOT. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty there. Australia, as yet, has not secured a seat on the board. I would have thought that that would be a pre-requisite for us before putting billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money into an infrastructure bank in the region.


I also note that the UN sustainable development goals are due to be agreed to at a meeting in New York on 22 September 2015. Does the government intend to apply the principles of the UN sustainable development goals in influencing the policies of the bank? That is a perfectly reasonable question to ask given all the work group that has gone into developing those sustainable goals. That is also very unclear.


In terms of the clause allowing any of the members of the bank or any of the shareholders to withdraw by giving six months notice, has the government established any triggers for potential withdrawal from the bank? In other words, will there be mandatory triggers that would lead to withdrawal of our support for the bank such as the breach of environmental or social conditions? And would the government withdraw from the bank if it was found to have breached one of its own policy objectives? It is hard to answer that because we do not have those policy objectives yet. This is the problem: the concept sounds great but there is no detail on the ground. This is something the Greens believe it is very important for us to get more information on.


In relation to the immunity clauses set out for the infrastructure bank, what oversight will employees of the bank be subject to? What mechanisms are available to prosecute employees of the bank for any potential misconduct? Do the immunity provisions in relation to the conduct of employees relate to bribery? What standards will be upheld at the bank? Once again, there are some precedents that we could use from the World Bank and other organisations but it is not spelled out clearly.


You need only look online at the corruption index for countries in our region to know that there is significant corruption in terms of business dealings in these areas. If we are looking at financing private projects, particularly if there is co-financing of public private projects in this area, then corruption is going to be an issue on the table. Unfortunately, that is the lie of the land. So these things should be spelled out in a lot more detail.


I think it is unusual that the enabling legislation for Australia participating in and providing promissory notes for this infrastructure bank actually lays out that 'each country has to guarantee immunity with respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity, except where the bank waives the immunity, and shall enjoy the inviolability of all their official papers, documents and records'. This has been noted by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. The committee, therefore, remains concerned about the proposed approach and the limited information readily available as to the detail of the intended immunities and privileges. That is another significant area of uncertainty when we are being asked to support enabling legislation that puts billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money into an Asian infrastructure bank without us having even seen how the employees of this bank are going to be scrutinised, audited and, potentially, prosecuted for any breach of law. In fact, what is law when it comes to a bank that is operating across various jurisdictions? These are more questions that need to be addressed.


And what about the strategy of the bank? There is no doubt that there must be a huge pipeline of potential infrastructure projects in Asia. Are we talking about brownfields projects or are we talking about greenfields projects, which, by their nature, are of much higher risk? That is also unclear. Is there an expected or benchmarked rate of return on investment that the bank is seeking? How do we actually define and measure the social return on projects in the region in terms of what they bring to local communities? What projects will be selected on the basis of their benefits to the communities they are in or the basis of return to investors? Have any particular projects been identified? Is there even a pipeline for projects? I would be very interested to see the kinds of projects that this bank would be investing in—primarily because I am interested in getting more investment financing in Australia for infrastructure because we do have a backlog of projects here and I would like to see what is on offer in these regions. Of course, that ties in very closely with potential conditions around social and environmental factors. And then there is governance. Who is in the constituency of countries which, according to the national interest analysis, Australia is expected to lead? As the fifth largest investor, shouldn't we assure ourselves a place on the board before signing?


Coming back to what I said earlier, why is it that we are planning to ratify the articles of the bank and provide financing as the fifth biggest shareholder when, as yet, we have not actually locked in a position on the board? I like the idea of us being able to influence infrastructure spending in the region in areas like renewable energy. I think there is enormous opportunity for Australian know-how and innovation in technology development, as there is in agricultural technology, to be employed across the region. It would be beneficial to Australia businesses. Of course, it would be beneficial to the environment, which is critically important. It is something that we can actually say we have some expertise on. If we have a leadership role and the ability to influence these kinds of things, that would be a positive for Australia. But it is not locked in. There is no certainty around that.


My last set of questions relate to aid. What impact will Australia's participation in the bank have on Australia's aid budget and activities? How close are aid activities going to be to the commercial activities of an infrastructure bank? I do not know the answer to the question of whether we even provide aid for infrastructure projects. It comes back to the earlier question: are we dealing with greenfields projects or brownfields projects? Are we dealing with assets that have already been set up and somehow been securitised or monetised and the bank is providing the financing for maintenance? What are we talking about here? I would like to see a lot more information around that.


How will Australia's participation in the bank align with our aid objectives? This government has been brutal in the last two years with the aid budget. Aid has been an ATM—an automatic teller machine—for other things in this country. I would hate to see this capitalisation from the Australian taxpayer of an Asia infrastructure bank being used as a smokescreen for reducing our aid budget further or not taking our aid responsibilities further. I am worried about this because it is something the government has introduced. It has looked at aid for private businesses—aid for business swaps. The remaining deputy leader of this country, Ms Bishop, has raised this issue in foreign affairs—that is, swapping aid for private business. Of course, that has a whole range of potential ethical and moral considerations to be taken into account as well. I am not sure if these commercial activities will displace current aid. That is something the Greens would like to know a lot more about.


Here is a scenario: we have an option to withdraw from this bank, giving six months notice. There may be some financial implications to that, but every investor in this bank has an option to withdraw. Under what conditions would Australia potentially withdraw? Should we set an automatic set of triggers for withdrawal if those conditions are reached? This seems like a reasonable approach to risk management to me. Those conditions may relate to governance—the loss of influence on the board. Those conditions may relate to something entirely different, like corruption or illegality in relation to those immunity provisions that we talked about earlier. They may relate to a breach of a very clear set of environmental or social guidelines on ethical investing. I think ethical investing is being taken seriously around the world now. Even a lot of private funds invest along ethical guidelines. Should we consider building in, through legislation, a mandatory code for potential triggers to withdraw from the bank? If we sign up to this, if we give everyone the benefit of the doubt and give the concept the benefit of the doubt in our region without the information that we need to make a good decision, shouldn't we at least put a fail-safe device in place whereby, if it does not meet our environmental, social and ethical standards and other overlays, Australia will withdraw from this project? There may be a range of other things we could include in that, but that is something the Greens would like to consider in the committee of the whole.


To wrap up, the strategy is a good one. There is a whole broader geopolitical overlay to this bank that raises the idea that the yuan, the Chinese currency, could end up becoming a replacement for the US currency as an international reserve currency. This is certainly going to see increased Chinese hegemony across the region. While we are involved in that, it is not necessarily a bad thing. It could actually be a good thing. We have seen the US oppose countries signing with this bank for its own political reasons. We have seen some very good, well-respected Nobel laureates come out and say, 'Actually, this is the kind of thing the US government should be promoting.' The US should be behind these projects because they will have the ability to raise living standards and increase environmental advocacy—a whole range of positive things—across the Asian region. There is a huge amount of infrastructure there that could be financed.


While that concept is good and the Greens support it, I would like to say that without the necessary information that we need, including information addressing the direct concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, we are taking this as a matter of blind faith—an article of faith. The Greens would like the Senate to consider what amendments we may be able to make to at least put triggers in place for withdrawal should conditions not be met. I think that is the only way we can actually back-test this without having that information up-front to provide some protections in line with our ethical and environmental considerations, and other factors. So, yes, I am looking forward to getting more information, as is Labor, very shortly.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion add, ""but the Senate:


(a) urges the Government to use its diplomatic influence to secure standards for labour rights, environmental preservation and the protection of local communities that face displacement from large projects; and


(b) calls on the Government to withdraw if policies addressing environmental and social impacts required by Article 13 of the 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Articles of Agreements' are breached.""

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:06):  I too rise to speak this afternoon on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 and the role it will play in the future of our international relations in the region. I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson will be able to make another contribution and talk to those amendments. Having been involved in the hearing last night—albeit somewhat distracted, as I was—I know that quite a lot of information did come out on the involvement of other countries. I particularly look forward to listening to his contribution with regard to his two proposed amendments. Other than that, given the tone and nature of the two contributions—by Senator Brown and Senator Whish-Wilson—it would seem that this is something that we all in this chamber feel that Australia should embrace, with some tweaking that may follow, perhaps, and something that we should look forward to.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 provides authority and an appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to this body and entity to be known as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the AIIB. The bank is an international finance institution proposed by the Chinese government to assist in funding major infrastructure projects throughout Asia. This bank will boost economic growth, it will create jobs and it will promote trade in our region by financing much-needed infrastructure investment. As we are all aware, Asia is on our doorstep. It is a burgeoning region in terms of its different economies, whether Indonesia and Central Asia or indeed the China-Japan-Korea region. The bank will provide the economic opportunities for Australian firms and help our commodity exports in accessing markets through the development of infrastructure—for example, our coal exports. It may also be for the development of financial infrastructure or indeed the services that Australia can provide and the critical up-front investment that often is hard to raise locally. Its intended capital base of US$100 billion will help address Asia-specific acute infrastructure needs, and it is estimated at $8 trillion this decade. That is a massive amount of capital to find. As you know, when economies are in growth, they are voracious consumers of cash.


Following the completion of all necessary ratification processes, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the AIIB's depository. That will be in China. Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on the latter of the date of lodgement and the day on which the bank is established. The commencement provisions set out in the bill will address the situation of the bill having received royal assent and the bank not yet having been established. On becoming a member of the bank, Australia will be obligated to pay for Australia's shareholding. Payments that Australia must make for subscriptions of shares of the capital stock of the bank is authorised by section 5 and section 7; that same section authorises the consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the purposes of purchasing Australia's share subscription. So, Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion, or approximately A$4.6 billion, based on the exchange rate on 22 May 2015. That will comprise US$738.3 million, or approximately A$932 million, in prepaid capital. The remaining US$2.9 billion, or approximately A$3.7 billion, will be callable capital which is a contingent liability against the Commonwealth. In other words, when called upon it is payable.


Section 6 of the act will authorise the Treasurer, as the responsible minister, to make promissory notes and issue them to the bank in accordance with the standard terms outlined in subsection (2)—namely, that the promissory notes will be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable to the bank at par value upon demand. Section 5 also enables these promissory notes to be drawn down. Promissory notes are financial instruments that are frequently used as part of a process to discharge the government's obligation to international financial institutions, such as multilateral development banks. They provide both parties with more control of encashments but can still be considered by the MDBs as an asset. Section 8 enables regulations to be made to extend certain privileges that Australia is obligated to provide to the bank and its personnel under chapter IX, articles 50 and 51. The articles provide slightly different obligations to those of other international organisations, such as exemptions from taxation on expenses relating to immigration of experts and consultants performing missions or services to the bank.


How will Australia benefit from being involved in this bank? The key benefit to Australia of becoming a member of the bank is improved infrastructure throughout the Asian region, which will provide great opportunity for Australian trade and businesses. Australia's prosperity and economic growth is tied closely with the region. Not only does greater infrastructure investment mean greater demand for Australian commodities such as metals and coal, as I mentioned earlier; greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets will create new opportunities for Australian companies. The bank also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy along with up to 55 other member countries. Those countries include Korea, the UK, Germany and France, to name but a few.


The bank will have an open procurement model, meaning companies from any country, not just from member countries, can bid for contracts. Australia, as a member of this bank, will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to Australian companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so they will be well positioned to make strong bids for contracts from this bank. The infrastructure bank is not precluded by the articles of agreement from making investments in Australia. However, we expect that this bank will initially focus on infrastructure in developing countries in the Asian region, where it will be able to play a more important role in encouraging private sector funding and financing of infrastructure. 


The bank will have an initial authorised capital of US$100 billion, with around US$20 billion paid in—that is, a promise of $80 billion, which is callable at any time, and US$20 billion in the bank when it is founded. Founding members will make contributions in proportion to their economic size. In addition to Australia's approximately $932 million paid-in contribution to the bank, Australia will be responsible for about US$3.7 billion in callable capital, which will only be drawn if the bank cannot meet its liabilities from within existing resources. There is a fair bit of latitude in that business model because this bank will be searching the Asian region for projects, and, obviously, other third-party bankers will be interested in those projects as well. 


One of the other motives for investing in the AIIB is the benefit to Australia's economy from the improved infrastructure in the Asian region. Joining the bank will promote stronger linkages between Australia and our neighbours, driving economic growth and generating benefits for Australian trade and businesses. The bank will work closely with the private sector and provide opportunities for business to bid for contracts with the bank. The bank will drive economic growth in our region, which will mean that there will be more demand from our region. This will create opportunities for Australia and for Australian businesses. Australia's decision to join this bank—and there appears to be fairly universal agreement to do that—will enable it to have a seat at the table as a director. It will have a say in key investment decisions. In addition, no one country will control the bank, with major decisions requiring a supermajority. 


I would like to talk a little about the open procurement process which Australian companies will be able to participate in. We will continue to work with China and other members to establish an institution that is effective, accountable and transparent and complements the work of other institutions. Senator Whish-Wilson talked about those kinds of governance issues which will be paramount for the board when working in those regions with different cultures and different expectations of how companies run. That will be something the board of the bank will have to keep a close eye on to ensure that all the projects that are undertaken meet the necessary governance criteria that we expect in our country and that we expect in the bank as well.


I would like to talk about the endorsements we have received from Australian industry. Several industry groups and companies have publicly expressed their views on Australia's membership of the bank, including the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, Industry Super Australia and Fortescue Metals, to name just a few. In their public comments, dated 24 June, these organisations welcomed the government's decision to join the bank, and I feel sure that they are also welcoming the opposition and crossbench support that has been indicated here this afternoon. The chair of Industry Super Australia, Peter Collins, said:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


… … …


The activities of the AIIB will not only provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export the funds’ know how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects.


… … …


The resources of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will increase scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long term, productive assets in the region. 


Australia, like Asia, is dealing with the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population. To meet this challenge it is vital we better match the long term investment horizon of retirement savings to strengthen our economic capital base, while simultaneously producing superior risk-adjusted performance returns on retirement savings. 


Peter Collins concluded with:


It's a win-win.


Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said:


The Business Council of Australia (BCA) welcomes the government's decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as a founding member.


As a founding member, Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of this body and the decisions it will make to finance projects that address Asia's infrastructure gaps.


Australian companies will benefit from opportunities to participate in developing and building new AIIB financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade in the region.


Infrastructure investment in Asia is essential to sustaining economic growth, and the AIIB's promise of an additional $100 billion will be important to meeting these infrastructure needs.


That is what the Business Council of Australia says. We can see a theme emerging here. This involvement with this bank, this money and this investment will create an entity which Australian businesses, companies and joint ventures can get involved with. It is just another opportunity to export our skills. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox said:


Ai Group welcomes Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We have argued for some time that the AIIB's objective of financing infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region will foster greater trade and economic development in the region of Australia's closest and most important economic partners. 


Given our national ambitions to be more thoroughly engaged in the Asian region, it makes clear sense for Australia to become a founding member of the AIIB and to work to ensure its success.


So, again, a strong and ringing endorsement of our participation as a founding member of what this bank has set out to achieve. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek MP, released a statement on 24 June on behalf of the opposition, welcoming the government's decision to join this bank. 


As I mentioned before, there is an estimated infrastructure financing gap of US$8 trillion in the Asian region this decade, and this bank will be part of the solution to close the gap. Joining this bank presents Australia with opportunities to work with our neighbours and our largest trading partner to drive economic growth and jobs. Working closely with the private sector, the bank paves the way for Australian businesses to take advantage of the growth in infrastructure in our region. 


In the seconds that I have remaining, I have a couple of comments on last night's hearing. The Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were able to advise at the hearing that Australia had recommended a number of governance strengthening mechanisms in August and was provided with the information, and it is part of the report.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:26):  I too rise to speak on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. It is with great pleasure that I am able to make a contribution to the debate on this particular bill. It is also even more delightful to know that we have reasonably universal support for the benefits that such a bank is going to bring to our country.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 basically sets out the authority and the appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to the bank. This will facilitate Australia's membership of the bank. Following completion of all the necessary ratification processes and the like, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the bank's depository in China, and Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on either the date of the lodgement or the day on which the bank is actually established. On becoming a member of the bank, Australia will be obligated to pay for Australia's shareholding. I understand Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion, which probably adds up to about A$4.5 billion on current exchange rates. So it is obviously a very substantial contribution on Australia's behalf. We have to realise that that contribution is going to have amazing and ongoing impacts for Australia. 


We only have to look at what is happening in the Asian region as we speak. The Asian region is projected to account for half of the global population growth that we are going to see over the next 35 years. It is already the world's most populous continent, but it is projected that another billion people will be resident in the Asian continent by 2050. It is not just the increase in the number of people in Asia that is of significance to Australia as one of the residents of this particular region; the changing affluence in Asia means that we have a shift towards greater expenditure and a more western diet—particularly with increases in protein, which they are looking to gain through things like meat and dairy rather than plants. So the opportunity for Australia in the Asian area over the next 35 years is massive, and our involvement in the Asian bank obviously gives us a greater level of access to take advantage of these opportunities that are presented on our doorstep. 


The key benefit of Australia becoming a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is improved infrastructure throughout the Asian region, which will provide great opportunities for all of our trade and businesses in Australia. Australia's prosperity and economic growth are closely tied to the region. Not only does greater infrastructure investment mean greater demand for Australia's commodities, such as metals, but it also means greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets will create new opportunities that currently do not exist for Australian companies. The AIIB also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our latest trading partners in the region and the largest economies, along with the other 55 member countries of the bank. It is interesting that this particular opportunity has come to our doorstep so soon after the trade agreements that we have entered into since coming into government with our near and very important economic neighbours of China, Korea and Japan.


Obviously there has been a lot of talk in recent times about the ChAFTA, but the overwhelming majority of Australians believe that the opportunities that ChAFTA provides for Australia are going to be of great benefit to this country. Let us remember that China is already Australia's largest trading partner. It buys almost one-third of all Australian exports, so one-third of Australian exports go into one country, which is a massive amount—it was valued at nearly $98 billion in 2014. It is also good to remember that it is our top overseas market for agriculture, research and services exports, and Chinese investment in Australia has been growing strongly in recent years. It is believed to have reached in excess of $65 billion in 2014. ChAFTA builds on Australia's largest successful commercial relationship with China, and by securing markets and providing Australians with even better access to China across a range of our key business interests, including goods and services and investment. The trade and investment opportunities with China will be a central key to the prosperity of Australia because, as I have probably said ad nauseam in this place, Australia is an exporting nation and we are not going to get rich selling to ourselves, so the importance of the kinds of agreements that we have put in place since coming into government in 2013 are absolutely essential because the prosperity of Australia is going to be driven by the prosperity of our export market opportunities.


It is not just China; we have other agreements, particularly the two that I have already referred to—the Japan and Korea agreements. Once again, the economic partnership that we have established with Japan—Japan has been a very sophisticated market for Australian exports for a very long time, and in some areas it is our biggest market. We have had a long-standing and very complementary relationship and economic partnership with Japan. It is also our second largest trading partner and the fourth largest source of foreign investment into Australia, so the economic partnership agreement that we entered into earlier this year is of major importance to Australia, particularly some of our export markets, which come from—and I know that certainly for my home in the Riverland in South Australia the Japanese market is a massive market for our citrus and it has been not just a very large market but also a very profitable market for Australian citrus growers over a very long time. It is also a big market for our beef, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Back; wine, which is another huge export commodity from South Australia; dairy; and seafood. This particular market, the Chinese market and, indeed, the Korean market are very important for our farmers and our agricultural producers across Australia. Given that Australia has a reputation as being one of the cleanest, greenest and finest producers of good quality, safe, clean food these particular agreements are very important. The fact that we have these agreements is very important, and overlaying that is this very important piece of legislation that will facilitate Australia's membership and involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. I think it is very timely that they should coincide.


It is also really important to understand the opportunities that will be provided for Australian companies to bid for the projects that will be invested in by this particular bank. One of the things that is very exciting is the opportunity for an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country, not just member countries, will have the opportunity to participate in bidding for contracts. But, as a member of the AIIB, Australia will benefit from having a working, up-to-date knowledge of what is going on, the projects that are afoot and the opportunities that we are able to make available to Australian companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so I think Australia is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that are provided by this new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


While the AIIB is not precluded by its articles of agreement from investing in Australian projects, it is my understanding that initially the focus of the bank's investment in infrastructure will be in developing countries, particularly in the Asian region, where it will be able to play an important role in encouraging private sector funding and financing of infrastructure so that the opportunities that are able to be capitalised on in these particular areas can be realised.


Australia's contribution to the bank, as I said, will initially be that Australia will put in approximately $932 million paid in contribution to the bank, but we will also be responsible for about $3.7 billion in capital, which will only be drawn on if the bank cannot meet its liabilities within existing resources. I suppose the question is: why is Australia making a decision to commit $932 million—cold, hard dollars—to the AIIB instead of funding other priorities, because there has been much debate in this place about the limited resources that are available to the Australian government for investment or for expenditure on any government project, no matter what it might be. The decision by the government to make the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank a priority for the allocation of resources is something that has obviously been very, very carefully and strategically considered.


We believe that Australia's economy will benefit from improved infrastructure in the Asian region. Joining the AIIB with them will promote stronger linkages between Australia and our neighbours. It will drive economic growth and it will generate benefits for Australians in the area of trade and business. And, as I said, being an exporting nation, if we continue to concentrate on the activities that happen only within our shores then our opportunities for the growth and expansion of our economy will be extremely limited. So, I think the forward thinking of the current government in seeing the opportunities that this particular infrastructure bank is able to provide for Australia—Australia's businesses, Australia's economy and Australia's future—represents a very strategic decision and one that has been very wisely made.


Also, there is no doubt that the AIIB will work closely with the private sector to deliver these infrastructure projects. Given that Australian businesses are considered to be world leaders in many of the areas of infrastructure delivery, the opportunity is there for Australian businesses on the ground, not just the benefits of the infrastructure once it has been provided but there are opportunities in the build phase of the infrastructure for Australian companies. That also needs to be considered in realising the net value to Australia, the net economic benefit and the net economic opportunity, of its involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


Consistent with the treatment of Australia's contributions to other international financial institutions, Australia has paid in capital. It will be treated as an investment. Therefore, it does not come at a cost to other government spending and will not directly add to the budget deficit, which is very important for Australia's books, to make sure that we keep our credit ratings where they need to be, sensibly treating capital as an investment.


But you do not just need to take my word for the benefits that this opportunity is going to provide for Australia. A number of people have come out publicly in support of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. And I think it is very important that we seriously take into account some of the comments that have been made by important heads of Australian industry and industry groups. They are the ones who represent the very people who will be the beneficiaries of this particular project. But we must also reinstate, reinforce every time, that if we have businesses that are going well in this country, these businesses employ people, and the most important bottom line is to ensure that the majority of Australians—that every Australian we can possibly can get into the workforce—has an ongoing job. That is probably the most important thing that any government can achieve.


But we as a government believe that the best way of facilitating people getting jobs is making sure that the jobs exist in the first place. You cannot create jobs out of thin air; hence we believe that investment in these long-term productive activities is much more important. It comes back to the old saying that if you want to feed a man for a day you give him a fish but if you want to feed him for life you give him a fishing rod. I think that is very important with these sorts of projects, these sorts of strategic investments by government. What we are seeking to do is provide the fishing rod to Australian industry so that we are actually able as a country to feed our people in the longer term and make sure they have jobs, have a standard of living to which I think all Australians aspire. And we certainly do not want to see our standard of living slipping backwards the way it has done over the past few years. It is these sorts of investments into the future and the future prosperity and economic opportunity that will make sure that Australia retains or regains its position as an economic powerhouse that is able to deliver for all citizens of Australia.


But, as I said, do not just take my word for it. There are a number of industry leaders who have been very public on the record about their support for this opportunity. As an example, the chair of Industry Super Australia, Peter Collins, said:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


He also said:


The activities of the AIIB will not only provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export super funds' know how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects.


And:


The resources of the AIIB will increase scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long term, productive assets in the region.


So, obviously the head of one of Australia's large industry super funds has seen the opportunity for his particular funds and resources that he has available for investment in these sorts of projects and that they really give him the opportunity to generate the economic growth that he needs to in order to provide the outputs that need to occur at the end of the investment in a superannuation scheme.


The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, equally made some very positive remarks about the opportunities that the infrastructure bank provides for Australia:


The Business Council of Australia (BCA) welcomes the government’s decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as a founding member.


As a founding member, Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of this body and the decisions it will make to finance projects that address Asia’s infrastructure gaps.


Australian companies will benefit from opportunities to participate in developing and building new AIIB financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade in the region.


Ms Westacott obviously has taken the view that the opportunities are not just in the development or the build component of the opportunities that this bank provides but also in the increased trade and investment opportunities for Australia in the region.


Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox was equally full of praise for the bank:


Ai Group welcomes Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  We have argued for some time that the AIIB's objective of financing infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region will foster greater trade and economic development in the region of Australia's closest and most important economic partners.


Given our national ambitions to be more thoroughly engaged in the Asian region, it makes clear sense for Australia to become a founding member of the AIIB and to work to ensure its success.


Mr Willox makes a very good point in terms of the strategic overall policy of this government in acknowledging and recognising the opportunity that Asia provides for Australia. So often we hear the rhetoric whereby governments say that they are going to do things—'We are going to be the food bowl of Asia'; 'We are going to feed the world'; 'Agriculture is going to be one of the mainstays of our economy.' So often we hear the rhetoric, but often the policies that sit behind that rhetoric do not deliver the outcomes of the policy.


If you have look at a broad range of the activities that have occurred under the government that I am a member of—this current coalition government—many of the things that we have sought to put in place since coming into government have been the policy implementation and real actions behind the rhetoric that we have heard for such a very long time. The free trade arrangements that we have put in place with Korea and Japan—and hopefully we will see the nonsense in relation to the ChAFTA arrangements resolved very shortly when the opposition realises that focusing on one particular component of that agreement is completely silly in comparison with the massive economic benefits that we can deliver to our country from signing it. When you look at the agricultural white paper that we have seen in recent times and, on top of that, this particular bill today—the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015—that seeks to provide the opportunity, the authority and the appropriations for Australia's involvement in what I think is a very important initiative and a fantastic opportunity—the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank—which will enable many Australian businesses, over a very long period of time, to realise the series of opportunities that would not otherwise be available to them in the largest and most quickly growing economy in the world.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-09-15,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:47):  I rise to oppose the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. The main purpose of this bill is to facilitate Australia becoming a founding and substantial financial member of the Australian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The title of this bank and legislation is fundamentally misleading. It is not Asia that has established this bank; it is China. China announced its intention to establish the bank in October 2013 and is driving this project. If China had chosen not to project its economic power into Asia and the South Pacific through the establishment of this bank, this debate would not be happening today in our parliament. Up-front, if we are to be honest, it should be called the 'China and Other Countries Infrastructure Investment Bank', not the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


There are many reasons not to agree to this legislation, but before I detail the most common found in our media I would like to make this point: this financial organisation will be controlled and heavily influenced by the communist government of China. The Parliamentary Library report states:


To illustrate the disparity in voting power, China, the largest AIIB shareholder will have 297,804 Share Votes while the Maldives will have just 72 Share Votes.


A weighted voting system ensures decision-making reflects the relative size of a country’s capital contribution. However, it potentially creates a longer-term challenge because of the need to ensure the distribution of power within the organisation keeps pace with shifts in relative economic power. In multilateral organisations, representation and voice can be strongly linked to perceptions of legitimacy and effectiveness.


As China will have over a quarter of the votes, under the AIIB’s Articles of Agreement it will have an effective veto over issues requiring a ‘super majority’, defined as 75 per cent of votes and two-thirds of all member countries. The types of issues requiring a super majority include selecting the President, increasing the capital stock of the AIIB and changing the size and composition of the Board of Directors. However, this is not without precedent. The United States is the only country to have a veto over major governance decisions at the IMF and World Bank.


No serious financial expert or commentator will ever say you can trust any financial figures that emerge from the government of China. Because of a lack of transparency and basic integrity, all financial figures and reports that are created by the Chinese government are viewed by every free-world Western economy and every Australian peak body representing Australian business as suspect and to be taken with a grain of salt. Just like the Chinese free trade agreement, we are making the mistake of entering into a deal with an organisation that is not like any private sector entity in the Western world—because it is not a private sector entity with the same rigorous, trustworthy reporting mechanisms.


This bank will be an arm of the Chinese communist government just like its military, whose purpose will be to protect, expand and spread the influence of communist, not democratic, culture. The influence of the Chinese government is being felt in this parliament today through at least $5.5 million in political donations from people linked to the Chinese government, so it is little wonder that there will be little or no resistance to this legislation which the Australian bankers are all supporting. The Australian banking industry is another group of people who have considerable influence in this parliament due to the amount of political donations they give to political parties and the people who have come from the banking industry and now occupy high positions of authority in our political system.


It is not just me who has expressed grave concerns about the establishment of the 'China and Other Countries Bank' and participation in it. Some very respected people and sources have raised serious concerns, which the Australian government is now ignoring by entering into this deal. From Huey Fern Tay, the ABC journalist based in Beijing:


China is the biggest shareholder at 30%, Australia is 6th largest with 4.9% voting power—putting us at a great disadvantage.


And:


Japan and US refuse to join—why? Well the AIIB doubles up on the World Bank and Asia Development Bank. There are still doubts surrounding the AIIB's transparency and governance standards, even though Australia waited for those to be improved before joining.


ABC business reporter Stephen Letts writes that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is:


… self-serving as China hopes the AIIB will be a better way to deploy its massive foreign exchange reserves, which are earning almost nothing in the US Treasury bonds.


From The Economistwe read:


… China will use the new bank to expand its influence at the expense of America and Japan, Asia's established powers. China's decision to fund a new multilateral bank rather than give more to existing ones reflects its exasperation with the glacial pace of global economic governance reform.


Yun Sun, writing in The Diplomat, has said that China has capital share of 30 per cent and voting rights of 26.06 per cent and:


… will have veto power on issues that require a supermajority vote, such as the board, the president, the capital, as well as the major operational and financial policies. Retention of a veto reflects China's determination to retain control on key aspects of the bank.


Most Australians will remember the surprise visit of a flotilla of three Chinese warships which sailed past our territorial waters and Christmas Island in February 2014 on a military exercise that included combat simulations. The media report of the incident said:


Never before has a Chinese naval drill come so close to Australia.


   …   …   …


This month's exercise took the theory a good step closer to reality, bringing China's bold ambitions virtually to Australia's doorstep. In doing so, it has crystallised the challenge facing our military planners in preparing for a very different world.


On the subject of China's military might, I think of its recent parade. While our military planners are preparing for a very different world because of the rapid increase in Chinese military might and the willingness of the Chinese government to use that might, it appears that the Liberal and National Party leaders and members of this parliament, with their calls to rush into a free trade agreement with China and this legislation, have not prepared for a very different world. Australia's purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars of sophisticated military hardware—F35 fighter jets and submarines—is because of the very real military threat the Chinese communist government poses to our nation and our allies. This is a simple statement of fact not, as some would have you believe, a xenophobic rant.


Most Australians would be shocked to learn of the size of the donations to our major political parties by people who have links—most likely strong links—to the Chinese communist government. Especially in the light of the approval of the Chinese government state owned Shenhua mine, the question must be asked and answered: what political influence does this money—$5.5 million—buy?


This government wants the Australian people to rush into both a banking deal and trade deal with a country which recently put on a parade which The Economist magazine described as: 'a show of military muscle in Beijing to upset Asian neighbours'. Indeed, so aggressive was the display of Chinese military might this year that every western government chose not to send their leaders to a ceremony whose primary purpose was to celebrate victory over the imperialist Japanese forces and fascism. This was a conflict on mainland China in World War II which killed 35 million Chinese and tied up 600,000 Japanese troops, a feat of resistance by the Chinese people which most likely prevented the invasion of Australia.


This government has had a very mixed approached to China. Our previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, boycotted China's most important cultural event in six years because of fears about China's military aggression and expansionism, while his party urges this Senate to support legislation like the China free trade agreement which undermines our nation's sovereignty—and I refer to the investor-state dispute settlement provisions which allow the Chinese government to sue our government if we pass legislation thought this house which the Chinese believe harms their commercial interests.


The government's own figures reveal that Chinese investment in Australia in the last 10 years has increased—without a China infrastructure bank or a free trade deal—by a factor of 10. It has risen from $3 billion to $32 billion. The average Australian would like to know where the Chinese money has been spent. How many Australian jobs have been created and where are they? Before we enter into this deal and others there needs to be more comprehensive community discussion that engages ordinary Australians, not just the elite, from both sides of the political divide.


Media reports indicate that the American President has stopped using a famous hotel chain because of espionage fears after the hotel chain was bought by people linked to the Chinese government. Are we going to call the American President xenophobic because his administration is taking precautions and is vigilant about Chinese espionage and other forms of cultural and industrial attacks on western values of democracy and liberty? In the national interests of Australia I oppose this legislation and course of action. There are better ways of conducting business with China which respect our democratic values and our rule of law and guard our children's liberty and freedoms.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-09-15,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:32):  I am pleased to inform the Senate that Labor supports the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015, and we will facilitate its passage through the Senate today. We support this bill because this bill facilitates Australia joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Labor has said consistently that Australia should join this bank. We were saying this consistently way before the government. While the cabinet was in meltdown—while the foreign minister, Ms Bishop, was arguing with the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, and while the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, was dithering about whether to join this bank—the opposition was saying very clearly that it was an easy decision: Australia must join. Australia should join this bank because it is the right thing to do. Australia should join this bank because China has shown leadership in setting up this bank and the rest of the world should join.


But the government dithered; the government could not make its mind up. The foreign minister said we should not join for reasons known only to herself. The Treasurer, to give him credit, knew that we should join, but he could not carry the day in cabinet. On the other hand the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and our shadow minister for foreign affairs, Ms Plibersek; and our shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, were of one mind immediately—this was an easy decision. This is a great opportunity for Australia. It is a good opportunity for the world to come together to deal with the infrastructure gap in Asia and to work together on the development of Asia. But, no, while the Labor Party was lending bipartisan support to this from last October the government could not make up its mind. 


As I have said, Labor is supporting this bill and is facilitating its speedy passage through the Senate today. I note that we have already agreed to exempt this bill from the cut-off order to enable it to be considered in this sitting week. Further, we have facilitated debate immediately following the presentation of the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. This report was completed following a public hearing with officials from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade just last night. Senators will be forgiven if they have missed this hearing, but I assure everyone that it did occur. Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, was present as was Senator Edwards and Senator Dastyari.


The Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry received two submissions, one from Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and one from Stephen Howes and Robin Davies from the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University. The public hearing provided an opportunity for senators to seek clarification on a number of matters from the government. These issues included matters relating to our membership; the governance of the bank and concerns raised by Australia; the Australian shareholding; accountability; the immunities and privileges that extend, as set out in section 8 of this bill; operational policies; and the ratification process. Questions remain about a number of these matters, particularly around some of the rhetoric that has been used in public debate on the bank by government ministers. Other issues requiring further amplification relate to the capital provided to the bank, how the board of directors will operate, Australia's constituency and whether any funds can be included as official development assistance in the future—these are all matters to watch.


In light of Labor's cooperative approach to this bill, I do seek an undertaking from the minister that demonstrates a similarly cooperative approach from the government. At the hearing last night, a number of matters were taken on notice. Whilst it was disappointing that questions could not be answered, including many simple questions seeking clarification of comments by, for example, the Minister for Trade and Investment that were already on the public record we understand that sometimes it is not always possible for the officials at the table to answer questions where they require an explanation from the minister concerned. The opposition seeks an undertaking from the minister, which I hope he will be able to give in his concluding remarks, that answers to questions taken on notice at last night's hearing will be provided in a fulsome and timely way.


The opposition could have opposed the exemption of this bill from the cut-off and sought to delay consideration of this bill until the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report had been fully considered and answers to questions on notice received, but that is not the approach we are taking. We support this bill and Australia's involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and want us to be able to take up our seat at the table as soon as possible.


I look forward to the minister being able to give a commitment to the Senate, today, that this additional material will be provided in accordance with the deadline set by the committee. Then all senators and the Australian people will be able to fully understand the nature of Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the attitude of the government to some of the issues that have been raised by its own ministers. Labor has proceeded in good faith in its approach to this bill and expects the same courtesy from the government.


It was interesting to see, in the second reading speech in the other place, the Treasurer boast: 'On 29 June this year I gave effect to the government's commitment to join the AIIB by being the first person in the world to sign the bank's Articles of Agreement in the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing. My signature was followed by those representatives of 49 other countries.' 


He was boasting that Australia was first. Mr Hockey was the first to sign because Australia comes first alphabetically. That is why his signature was first. It is nothing for him to boast about. We could have been one of the first countries to join the bank when China invited the rest of the world to join. We could have been a leader. Instead, under this government, we are followers. We had to wait for other countries to join—then we decided to join. We joined after the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Korea, Germany, France, Italy, India and Singapore. All of these countries showed leadership.


Australia could have been in at the ground floor. It could have been in, working with these other countries, setting the bank up. But, no, we had to wait and see what other countries, like the United Kingdom, did. I thought we had stopped letting the United Kingdom make Australian foreign-policy decisions about 70 years ago. We know this government is dysfunctional but its dysfunction impacts on policy. Here, we have cabinet dysfunction impacting on policy and Australia missing a golden opportunity to come in at the ground floor and join this very important bank.


The Australian Infrastructure Investment Bank will fulfil a very important role. There is a significant gap in infrastructure around the Asian region. Around $8 trillion over the next decade is the widely agreed figure, which is a figure the opposition agrees with. The bank represents an opportunity for countries of the world to come together and pool funds and to provide authorised capital so that the bank can facilitate infrastructure investment. We will have a very substantial shareholding of about US$3.7 billion and I note that the second-biggest shareholding in the bank is India, about US$8.3 billion and a share of 7½ per cent. Our shareholding is substantial, as is appropriate. This is not a matter that will be reflected in budget figures, but it is an appropriate shareholding for us to have a very significant economy in the Asia-Pacific region.


We certainly support Australia's involvement and will facilitate, in every sense possible, Australia being as involved as possible, because we should be. But we should have shown much greater leadership than we did. We should have shown the leadership of a nation that understands the opportunities of Asia. There has been a lot said about China, in recent weeks, in this parliament and in public debate. There has been a lot of lecturing going on from those opposite about China and how we need to work better with China. 


We are not going to take any lectures from a government that for months got this strategic decision on China so wrong. It is a government that could not make a simple decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They have the gall to come in here, the Senate, and the other place and lecture the Labor Party about how to do business with China when you have the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, consistently saying—since last October—this is a no-brainer; this is an easy decision. If Labor were in government we would have signed up straightaway, because it is an opportunity to take. Those opposite need to understand the strategic error they have made—in waiting for other countries to show leadership and sending a signal to China that we do not care about their development. 


The position of the opposition is that we should be joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is the position we adopted last October and the one to which the government were dragged kicking and screaming. The government showed a lack of interest and foresight in not being able to make the decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is the sort of economic leadership we are seeing from this government.


China did not need to create this multilateral institution. China could have said, 'We are developing a bank and we are going to invest in ourselves.' But China made the decision to work in partnership with the rest of the world and invite other nations—not just Asian nations but nations from the rest of the world, such as the United Kingdom, France and others—into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is a good thing. Countries from the rest of the world have noted and supported this development. Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, France, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are joining this particular bank, as they should. We welcome their participation. But it would have been a whole lot better if this government had shown more leadership and realised the opportunities available, from joining the bank, rather than dithering for months and missing the opportunity to invest in infrastructure in the Asia region.


We all know about the opportunities of living on the edge of the world's fastest-growing region. We know about the burgeoning middle-class in Asia. We know about the increased demand for protein and for Australia's agricultural goods, in particular. We know about the opportunities in services, financial services and others, being exported to Asia. We know we have the skills and the capacity, in Australia, to export so many more services. Australia's financial services are highly respected and highly developed. The fourth-largest pool of funds under management in the world is in Australia, but we do not manage the funds of Asia.


Around five per cent of funds under management in Australia come from overseas. We could be doing so much better. Australia could be the financial services hub, but it would take complete engagement with the Asian economy to be so. It is not possible to reach that sort of engagement when the cabinet cannot even decide to join an important multilateral institution such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This government is so dysfunctional that it spent months arguing about whether to take up a golden opportunity to participate in a new multilateral institution.


This is not to say that other institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank or the World Bank, are not worthy of continued engagement. They have different tasks at hand, as does the International Monetary Fund. They have different tasks to conduct. But the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank fills a gap—it fills a hole. It is right and proper that the fastest-growing region in the world has its own institution devoted to infrastructure investment. It is right and proper that we, such an important economy in the Asia-Pacific region, be involved and a member.


So of course the Labor Party will give wholehearted support to this bill, as we did in the other place, but we take the opportunity to point out that these are opportunities presented to Australia last year which the government was dragged, kicking and screaming, to embrace. We are not going to have the Treasurer boasting that he was the first person in the world to sign the articles of agreement, although Labor does recognise that he was not allowed to pursue and progress signing up to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank due to the conflicting attitudes of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the former Prime Minister. The Treasurer was not able to deliver what he knew was in our best interest.


We have heard a lot of words about how we need to have better conditions and better governance. That is just an excuse—and a dishonest one, at that—for months of inaction. The government have not progressed changes to the governance. To suggest otherwise is just wrong. What they have done is buy time, and they have been shown to be lacking in leadership. They have allowed other countries with much less to do with Asia than us to join before us. The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy all signed up before Australia. They all indicated their support before Australia. When these institutions are being developed, the early days are very important. People who are members early are able to influence the development of the institution. Australia lost that opportunity. We lost that opportunity on the watch of the Treasurer. It was not his fault but the fault of his Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister and the rest of the cabinet, who showed a singular lack of leadership on this matter. So let us not have any lectures from members opposite in their remarks which will follow about Asia and China and the importance of the Chinese economic relationship, because they have completely mismanaged this matter. They missed the opportunity for us to join this bank as an early adopter. The government completely got it wrong.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2,speech
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-09-15,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:47):  Perhaps Senator Brown is aware of the history of this bank and why it took so long. The US government for a number of years lobbied very hard for a lot of people in the region, including us, not to sign onto this bank. Senator Brown is right when she says the UK was the first to break ranks and do so, and after that we saw a steady trickle of people signing on, including us.


I want to, firstly, raise the issue that infrastructure in this country is also very important. We believe that there is a significant pipeline of projects in Australia that should be financed, especially at a time of record low interest rates. One of the ex-leaders of the opposition, Professor Hewson, has been very outspoken, as has Saul Eslake, a fellow Tasmanian, on the one-off historic opportunity to finance infrastructure in Australia. I just want to get on the record that, when the consultation process around the national interest analysis was conducted on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, you will see in attachment 1, the attachment on consultation:


Between 6 and 13 July 2015, Treasury sought views from state and territory governments on the AIIB Articles—


the AIIB being the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It outlines in two pages that the various governments of New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia welcomed potential investment from this bank in major infrastructure projects—for example, across New South Wales. So there was an expectation that perhaps this bank would be financing infrastructure projects in Australia, but if you read the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which goes into a bit of detail on the national interest analysis, it says: 'Although no projects have been identified in Australia, the NIA advises that the bank is likely to focus its efforts in developing countries with signiﬁcant infrastructure gaps. It is, therefore, unlikely that Australia will be a recipient of bank funding for a major infrastructure project.'


On its own, the fact that Australia needs infrastructure and this bank is unlikely to finance any in Australia is not a reason to knock it back, but I do make the point that there are a backlog of projects in this country. Saul Eslake said to a recent select committee inquiry, which I am part of, that the Australian government could spend up to $50 billion on infrastructure projects in this country under current arrangements without impacting its AAA credit rating. So let us be clear: there is no doubt that there is a need for infrastructure spending in our region and, on one level, we have a very strong feeling that Australia should be part of that, but we do need infrastructure spending in this country and it is something that the government said it would prioritise. In fact, I think our recently departed Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, said he would be an 'infrastructure Prime Minister'. As I have discovered through the select committee, that has been another broken promise. Whether because of fiscal constraints or other issues, it has not happened. So, while we are talking about infrastructure, let us not forget that Australia needs more infrastructure spending and it has a unique opportunity at this point in time.


Moving to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank itself, the concept is a good one—the idea of Australia playing a role and having a leadership role and influence over a large infrastructure investment bank in the region that has very significant Chinese buy-in is a good one. I note that one of my economic heroes, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winner, has been very outspoken in supporting this bank and the concept of this bank in the region. He has been very critical of the US government for not supporting this bank, saying, 'You're stuck in the old ways through the World Bank. This is what the Asian region needs and the US should be playing a leadership role in this.' It is very useful to point out that Professor Stiglitz has been a supporter of this bank.


As was reflected in Labor's contribution, the Greens have some very specific concerns around what has not been addressed in the scanty information that we have seen to date. I might start by talking a little bit about environmental and social policy. I note that Senator Milne, prior to leaving the Senate, got it on record—and Adam Bandt, the Greens member for Melbourne, has expressed similar concerns—that we need to see what environmental and social policies the bank will pursue or, at least, what conditions or requirements are going to be put in place for an investment bank. We have seen investment in some socially and environmentally destructive infrastructure in the Asian region such as building dams in Sarawak displacing rural communities and ruining the environment. These are the kinds of things that we want to see avoided. So it makes sense to have some very clear-cut guidelines in place.


I have a number of questions for the government. I wish I had been able to get to the JSCOT meeting yesterday so I could have asked the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others the questions directly—I was in here debating the amendments to a bill for small business. I will ask some questions during the committee stage. In particular, what is the government's intention in relation to the development of policies in regard to environmental and social impacts? Does the government intend to try to influence the development of the policy of the bank? Is it even clear if the government can influence that?


Going back to the national interest analysis, at page 29 and 39 it says that 'the NIA advises that Australia is negotiating to lead a constituency of regional members which would, as a group, be able to secure a seat on the board of directors. If successful, this position should allow Australia to enforce decisions made by the bank.' I would have thought that, before we signed up to this, we would have had a guarantee that we would be able to influence decisions of the bank and that we had secured a seat on the board. If you go to page 4 of the national interest statement, it makes this look a little more certain than the analysis that was given to us by JSCOT. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty there. Australia, as yet, has not secured a seat on the board. I would have thought that that would be a pre-requisite for us before putting billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money into an infrastructure bank in the region.


I also note that the UN sustainable development goals are due to be agreed to at a meeting in New York on 22 September 2015. Does the government intend to apply the principles of the UN sustainable development goals in influencing the policies of the bank? That is a perfectly reasonable question to ask given all the work group that has gone into developing those sustainable goals. That is also very unclear.


In terms of the clause allowing any of the members of the bank or any of the shareholders to withdraw by giving six months notice, has the government established any triggers for potential withdrawal from the bank? In other words, will there be mandatory triggers that would lead to withdrawal of our support for the bank such as the breach of environmental or social conditions? And would the government withdraw from the bank if it was found to have breached one of its own policy objectives? It is hard to answer that because we do not have those policy objectives yet. This is the problem: the concept sounds great but there is no detail on the ground. This is something the Greens believe it is very important for us to get more information on.


In relation to the immunity clauses set out for the infrastructure bank, what oversight will employees of the bank be subject to? What mechanisms are available to prosecute employees of the bank for any potential misconduct? Do the immunity provisions in relation to the conduct of employees relate to bribery? What standards will be upheld at the bank? Once again, there are some precedents that we could use from the World Bank and other organisations but it is not spelled out clearly.


You need only look online at the corruption index for countries in our region to know that there is significant corruption in terms of business dealings in these areas. If we are looking at financing private projects, particularly if there is co-financing of public private projects in this area, then corruption is going to be an issue on the table. Unfortunately, that is the lie of the land. So these things should be spelled out in a lot more detail.


I think it is unusual that the enabling legislation for Australia participating in and providing promissory notes for this infrastructure bank actually lays out that 'each country has to guarantee immunity with respect to acts performed by them in their official capacity, except where the bank waives the immunity, and shall enjoy the inviolability of all their official papers, documents and records'. This has been noted by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. The committee, therefore, remains concerned about the proposed approach and the limited information readily available as to the detail of the intended immunities and privileges. That is another significant area of uncertainty when we are being asked to support enabling legislation that puts billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money into an Asian infrastructure bank without us having even seen how the employees of this bank are going to be scrutinised, audited and, potentially, prosecuted for any breach of law. In fact, what is law when it comes to a bank that is operating across various jurisdictions? These are more questions that need to be addressed.


And what about the strategy of the bank? There is no doubt that there must be a huge pipeline of potential infrastructure projects in Asia. Are we talking about brownfields projects or are we talking about greenfields projects, which, by their nature, are of much higher risk? That is also unclear. Is there an expected or benchmarked rate of return on investment that the bank is seeking? How do we actually define and measure the social return on projects in the region in terms of what they bring to local communities? What projects will be selected on the basis of their benefits to the communities they are in or the basis of return to investors? Have any particular projects been identified? Is there even a pipeline for projects? I would be very interested to see the kinds of projects that this bank would be investing in—primarily because I am interested in getting more investment financing in Australia for infrastructure because we do have a backlog of projects here and I would like to see what is on offer in these regions. Of course, that ties in very closely with potential conditions around social and environmental factors. And then there is governance. Who is in the constituency of countries which, according to the national interest analysis, Australia is expected to lead? As the fifth largest investor, shouldn't we assure ourselves a place on the board before signing?


Coming back to what I said earlier, why is it that we are planning to ratify the articles of the bank and provide financing as the fifth biggest shareholder when, as yet, we have not actually locked in a position on the board? I like the idea of us being able to influence infrastructure spending in the region in areas like renewable energy. I think there is enormous opportunity for Australian know-how and innovation in technology development, as there is in agricultural technology, to be employed across the region. It would be beneficial to Australia businesses. Of course, it would be beneficial to the environment, which is critically important. It is something that we can actually say we have some expertise on. If we have a leadership role and the ability to influence these kinds of things, that would be a positive for Australia. But it is not locked in. There is no certainty around that.


My last set of questions relate to aid. What impact will Australia's participation in the bank have on Australia's aid budget and activities? How close are aid activities going to be to the commercial activities of an infrastructure bank? I do not know the answer to the question of whether we even provide aid for infrastructure projects. It comes back to the earlier question: are we dealing with greenfields projects or brownfields projects? Are we dealing with assets that have already been set up and somehow been securitised or monetised and the bank is providing the financing for maintenance? What are we talking about here? I would like to see a lot more information around that.


How will Australia's participation in the bank align with our aid objectives? This government has been brutal in the last two years with the aid budget. Aid has been an ATM—an automatic teller machine—for other things in this country. I would hate to see this capitalisation from the Australian taxpayer of an Asia infrastructure bank being used as a smokescreen for reducing our aid budget further or not taking our aid responsibilities further. I am worried about this because it is something the government has introduced. It has looked at aid for private businesses—aid for business swaps. The remaining deputy leader of this country, Ms Bishop, has raised this issue in foreign affairs—that is, swapping aid for private business. Of course, that has a whole range of potential ethical and moral considerations to be taken into account as well. I am not sure if these commercial activities will displace current aid. That is something the Greens would like to know a lot more about.


Here is a scenario: we have an option to withdraw from this bank, giving six months notice. There may be some financial implications to that, but every investor in this bank has an option to withdraw. Under what conditions would Australia potentially withdraw? Should we set an automatic set of triggers for withdrawal if those conditions are reached? This seems like a reasonable approach to risk management to me. Those conditions may relate to governance—the loss of influence on the board. Those conditions may relate to something entirely different, like corruption or illegality in relation to those immunity provisions that we talked about earlier. They may relate to a breach of a very clear set of environmental or social guidelines on ethical investing. I think ethical investing is being taken seriously around the world now. Even a lot of private funds invest along ethical guidelines. Should we consider building in, through legislation, a mandatory code for potential triggers to withdraw from the bank? If we sign up to this, if we give everyone the benefit of the doubt and give the concept the benefit of the doubt in our region without the information that we need to make a good decision, shouldn't we at least put a fail-safe device in place whereby, if it does not meet our environmental, social and ethical standards and other overlays, Australia will withdraw from this project? There may be a range of other things we could include in that, but that is something the Greens would like to consider in the committee of the whole.


To wrap up, the strategy is a good one. There is a whole broader geopolitical overlay to this bank that raises the idea that the yuan, the Chinese currency, could end up becoming a replacement for the US currency as an international reserve currency. This is certainly going to see increased Chinese hegemony across the region. While we are involved in that, it is not necessarily a bad thing. It could actually be a good thing. We have seen the US oppose countries signing with this bank for its own political reasons. We have seen some very good, well-respected Nobel laureates come out and say, 'Actually, this is the kind of thing the US government should be promoting.' The US should be behind these projects because they will have the ability to raise living standards and increase environmental advocacy—a whole range of positive things—across the Asian region. There is a huge amount of infrastructure there that could be financed.


While that concept is good and the Greens support it, I would like to say that without the necessary information that we need, including information addressing the direct concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, we are taking this as a matter of blind faith—an article of faith. The Greens would like the Senate to consider what amendments we may be able to make to at least put triggers in place for withdrawal should conditions not be met. I think that is the only way we can actually back-test this without having that information up-front to provide some protections in line with our ethical and environmental considerations, and other factors. So, yes, I am looking forward to getting more information, as is Labor, very shortly.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion add, ""but the Senate:


(a) urges the Government to use its diplomatic influence to secure standards for labour rights, environmental preservation and the protection of local communities that face displacement from large projects; and


(b) calls on the Government to withdraw if policies addressing environmental and social impacts required by Article 13 of the 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Articles of Agreements' are breached.""

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:06):  I too rise to speak this afternoon on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 and the role it will play in the future of our international relations in the region. I am sure Senator Whish-Wilson will be able to make another contribution and talk to those amendments. Having been involved in the hearing last night—albeit somewhat distracted, as I was—I know that quite a lot of information did come out on the involvement of other countries. I particularly look forward to listening to his contribution with regard to his two proposed amendments. Other than that, given the tone and nature of the two contributions—by Senator Brown and Senator Whish-Wilson—it would seem that this is something that we all in this chamber feel that Australia should embrace, with some tweaking that may follow, perhaps, and something that we should look forward to.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 provides authority and an appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to this body and entity to be known as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the AIIB. The bank is an international finance institution proposed by the Chinese government to assist in funding major infrastructure projects throughout Asia. This bank will boost economic growth, it will create jobs and it will promote trade in our region by financing much-needed infrastructure investment. As we are all aware, Asia is on our doorstep. It is a burgeoning region in terms of its different economies, whether Indonesia and Central Asia or indeed the China-Japan-Korea region. The bank will provide the economic opportunities for Australian firms and help our commodity exports in accessing markets through the development of infrastructure—for example, our coal exports. It may also be for the development of financial infrastructure or indeed the services that Australia can provide and the critical up-front investment that often is hard to raise locally. Its intended capital base of US$100 billion will help address Asia-specific acute infrastructure needs, and it is estimated at $8 trillion this decade. That is a massive amount of capital to find. As you know, when economies are in growth, they are voracious consumers of cash.


Following the completion of all necessary ratification processes, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the AIIB's depository. That will be in China. Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on the latter of the date of lodgement and the day on which the bank is established. The commencement provisions set out in the bill will address the situation of the bill having received royal assent and the bank not yet having been established. On becoming a member of the bank, Australia will be obligated to pay for Australia's shareholding. Payments that Australia must make for subscriptions of shares of the capital stock of the bank is authorised by section 5 and section 7; that same section authorises the consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the purposes of purchasing Australia's share subscription. So, Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion, or approximately A$4.6 billion, based on the exchange rate on 22 May 2015. That will comprise US$738.3 million, or approximately A$932 million, in prepaid capital. The remaining US$2.9 billion, or approximately A$3.7 billion, will be callable capital which is a contingent liability against the Commonwealth. In other words, when called upon it is payable.


Section 6 of the act will authorise the Treasurer, as the responsible minister, to make promissory notes and issue them to the bank in accordance with the standard terms outlined in subsection (2)—namely, that the promissory notes will be non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing and payable to the bank at par value upon demand. Section 5 also enables these promissory notes to be drawn down. Promissory notes are financial instruments that are frequently used as part of a process to discharge the government's obligation to international financial institutions, such as multilateral development banks. They provide both parties with more control of encashments but can still be considered by the MDBs as an asset. Section 8 enables regulations to be made to extend certain privileges that Australia is obligated to provide to the bank and its personnel under chapter IX, articles 50 and 51. The articles provide slightly different obligations to those of other international organisations, such as exemptions from taxation on expenses relating to immigration of experts and consultants performing missions or services to the bank.


How will Australia benefit from being involved in this bank? The key benefit to Australia of becoming a member of the bank is improved infrastructure throughout the Asian region, which will provide great opportunity for Australian trade and businesses. Australia's prosperity and economic growth is tied closely with the region. Not only does greater infrastructure investment mean greater demand for Australian commodities such as metals and coal, as I mentioned earlier; greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets will create new opportunities for Australian companies. The bank also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy along with up to 55 other member countries. Those countries include Korea, the UK, Germany and France, to name but a few.


The bank will have an open procurement model, meaning companies from any country, not just from member countries, can bid for contracts. Australia, as a member of this bank, will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to Australian companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so they will be well positioned to make strong bids for contracts from this bank. The infrastructure bank is not precluded by the articles of agreement from making investments in Australia. However, we expect that this bank will initially focus on infrastructure in developing countries in the Asian region, where it will be able to play a more important role in encouraging private sector funding and financing of infrastructure. 


The bank will have an initial authorised capital of US$100 billion, with around US$20 billion paid in—that is, a promise of $80 billion, which is callable at any time, and US$20 billion in the bank when it is founded. Founding members will make contributions in proportion to their economic size. In addition to Australia's approximately $932 million paid-in contribution to the bank, Australia will be responsible for about US$3.7 billion in callable capital, which will only be drawn if the bank cannot meet its liabilities from within existing resources. There is a fair bit of latitude in that business model because this bank will be searching the Asian region for projects, and, obviously, other third-party bankers will be interested in those projects as well. 


One of the other motives for investing in the AIIB is the benefit to Australia's economy from the improved infrastructure in the Asian region. Joining the bank will promote stronger linkages between Australia and our neighbours, driving economic growth and generating benefits for Australian trade and businesses. The bank will work closely with the private sector and provide opportunities for business to bid for contracts with the bank. The bank will drive economic growth in our region, which will mean that there will be more demand from our region. This will create opportunities for Australia and for Australian businesses. Australia's decision to join this bank—and there appears to be fairly universal agreement to do that—will enable it to have a seat at the table as a director. It will have a say in key investment decisions. In addition, no one country will control the bank, with major decisions requiring a supermajority. 


I would like to talk a little about the open procurement process which Australian companies will be able to participate in. We will continue to work with China and other members to establish an institution that is effective, accountable and transparent and complements the work of other institutions. Senator Whish-Wilson talked about those kinds of governance issues which will be paramount for the board when working in those regions with different cultures and different expectations of how companies run. That will be something the board of the bank will have to keep a close eye on to ensure that all the projects that are undertaken meet the necessary governance criteria that we expect in our country and that we expect in the bank as well.


I would like to talk about the endorsements we have received from Australian industry. Several industry groups and companies have publicly expressed their views on Australia's membership of the bank, including the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, Industry Super Australia and Fortescue Metals, to name just a few. In their public comments, dated 24 June, these organisations welcomed the government's decision to join the bank, and I feel sure that they are also welcoming the opposition and crossbench support that has been indicated here this afternoon. The chair of Industry Super Australia, Peter Collins, said:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


… … …


The activities of the AIIB will not only provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export the funds’ know how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects.


… … …


The resources of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will increase scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long term, productive assets in the region. 


Australia, like Asia, is dealing with the challenges of a shrinking workforce and an ageing population. To meet this challenge it is vital we better match the long term investment horizon of retirement savings to strengthen our economic capital base, while simultaneously producing superior risk-adjusted performance returns on retirement savings. 


Peter Collins concluded with:


It's a win-win.


Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said:


The Business Council of Australia (BCA) welcomes the government's decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as a founding member.


As a founding member, Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of this body and the decisions it will make to finance projects that address Asia's infrastructure gaps.


Australian companies will benefit from opportunities to participate in developing and building new AIIB financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade in the region.


Infrastructure investment in Asia is essential to sustaining economic growth, and the AIIB's promise of an additional $100 billion will be important to meeting these infrastructure needs.


That is what the Business Council of Australia says. We can see a theme emerging here. This involvement with this bank, this money and this investment will create an entity which Australian businesses, companies and joint ventures can get involved with. It is just another opportunity to export our skills. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox said:


Ai Group welcomes Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We have argued for some time that the AIIB's objective of financing infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region will foster greater trade and economic development in the region of Australia's closest and most important economic partners. 


Given our national ambitions to be more thoroughly engaged in the Asian region, it makes clear sense for Australia to become a founding member of the AIIB and to work to ensure its success.


So, again, a strong and ringing endorsement of our participation as a founding member of what this bank has set out to achieve. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek MP, released a statement on 24 June on behalf of the opposition, welcoming the government's decision to join this bank. 


As I mentioned before, there is an estimated infrastructure financing gap of US$8 trillion in the Asian region this decade, and this bank will be part of the solution to close the gap. Joining this bank presents Australia with opportunities to work with our neighbours and our largest trading partner to drive economic growth and jobs. Working closely with the private sector, the bank paves the way for Australian businesses to take advantage of the growth in infrastructure in our region. 


In the seconds that I have remaining, I have a couple of comments on last night's hearing. The Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were able to advise at the hearing that Australia had recommended a number of governance strengthening mechanisms in August and was provided with the information, and it is part of the report.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:26):  I too rise to speak on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. It is with great pleasure that I am able to make a contribution to the debate on this particular bill. It is also even more delightful to know that we have reasonably universal support for the benefits that such a bank is going to bring to our country.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 basically sets out the authority and the appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to the bank. This will facilitate Australia's membership of the bank. Following completion of all the necessary ratification processes and the like, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the bank's depository in China, and Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on either the date of the lodgement or the day on which the bank is actually established. On becoming a member of the bank, Australia will be obligated to pay for Australia's shareholding. I understand Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion, which probably adds up to about A$4.5 billion on current exchange rates. So it is obviously a very substantial contribution on Australia's behalf. We have to realise that that contribution is going to have amazing and ongoing impacts for Australia. 


We only have to look at what is happening in the Asian region as we speak. The Asian region is projected to account for half of the global population growth that we are going to see over the next 35 years. It is already the world's most populous continent, but it is projected that another billion people will be resident in the Asian continent by 2050. It is not just the increase in the number of people in Asia that is of significance to Australia as one of the residents of this particular region; the changing affluence in Asia means that we have a shift towards greater expenditure and a more western diet—particularly with increases in protein, which they are looking to gain through things like meat and dairy rather than plants. So the opportunity for Australia in the Asian area over the next 35 years is massive, and our involvement in the Asian bank obviously gives us a greater level of access to take advantage of these opportunities that are presented on our doorstep. 


The key benefit of Australia becoming a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is improved infrastructure throughout the Asian region, which will provide great opportunities for all of our trade and businesses in Australia. Australia's prosperity and economic growth are closely tied to the region. Not only does greater infrastructure investment mean greater demand for Australia's commodities, such as metals, but it also means greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets will create new opportunities that currently do not exist for Australian companies. The AIIB also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our latest trading partners in the region and the largest economies, along with the other 55 member countries of the bank. It is interesting that this particular opportunity has come to our doorstep so soon after the trade agreements that we have entered into since coming into government with our near and very important economic neighbours of China, Korea and Japan.


Obviously there has been a lot of talk in recent times about the ChAFTA, but the overwhelming majority of Australians believe that the opportunities that ChAFTA provides for Australia are going to be of great benefit to this country. Let us remember that China is already Australia's largest trading partner. It buys almost one-third of all Australian exports, so one-third of Australian exports go into one country, which is a massive amount—it was valued at nearly $98 billion in 2014. It is also good to remember that it is our top overseas market for agriculture, research and services exports, and Chinese investment in Australia has been growing strongly in recent years. It is believed to have reached in excess of $65 billion in 2014. ChAFTA builds on Australia's largest successful commercial relationship with China, and by securing markets and providing Australians with even better access to China across a range of our key business interests, including goods and services and investment. The trade and investment opportunities with China will be a central key to the prosperity of Australia because, as I have probably said ad nauseam in this place, Australia is an exporting nation and we are not going to get rich selling to ourselves, so the importance of the kinds of agreements that we have put in place since coming into government in 2013 are absolutely essential because the prosperity of Australia is going to be driven by the prosperity of our export market opportunities.


It is not just China; we have other agreements, particularly the two that I have already referred to—the Japan and Korea agreements. Once again, the economic partnership that we have established with Japan—Japan has been a very sophisticated market for Australian exports for a very long time, and in some areas it is our biggest market. We have had a long-standing and very complementary relationship and economic partnership with Japan. It is also our second largest trading partner and the fourth largest source of foreign investment into Australia, so the economic partnership agreement that we entered into earlier this year is of major importance to Australia, particularly some of our export markets, which come from—and I know that certainly for my home in the Riverland in South Australia the Japanese market is a massive market for our citrus and it has been not just a very large market but also a very profitable market for Australian citrus growers over a very long time. It is also a big market for our beef, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Back; wine, which is another huge export commodity from South Australia; dairy; and seafood. This particular market, the Chinese market and, indeed, the Korean market are very important for our farmers and our agricultural producers across Australia. Given that Australia has a reputation as being one of the cleanest, greenest and finest producers of good quality, safe, clean food these particular agreements are very important. The fact that we have these agreements is very important, and overlaying that is this very important piece of legislation that will facilitate Australia's membership and involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. I think it is very timely that they should coincide.


It is also really important to understand the opportunities that will be provided for Australian companies to bid for the projects that will be invested in by this particular bank. One of the things that is very exciting is the opportunity for an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country, not just member countries, will have the opportunity to participate in bidding for contracts. But, as a member of the AIIB, Australia will benefit from having a working, up-to-date knowledge of what is going on, the projects that are afoot and the opportunities that we are able to make available to Australian companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so I think Australia is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that are provided by this new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


While the AIIB is not precluded by its articles of agreement from investing in Australian projects, it is my understanding that initially the focus of the bank's investment in infrastructure will be in developing countries, particularly in the Asian region, where it will be able to play an important role in encouraging private sector funding and financing of infrastructure so that the opportunities that are able to be capitalised on in these particular areas can be realised.


Australia's contribution to the bank, as I said, will initially be that Australia will put in approximately $932 million paid in contribution to the bank, but we will also be responsible for about $3.7 billion in capital, which will only be drawn on if the bank cannot meet its liabilities within existing resources. I suppose the question is: why is Australia making a decision to commit $932 million—cold, hard dollars—to the AIIB instead of funding other priorities, because there has been much debate in this place about the limited resources that are available to the Australian government for investment or for expenditure on any government project, no matter what it might be. The decision by the government to make the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank a priority for the allocation of resources is something that has obviously been very, very carefully and strategically considered.


We believe that Australia's economy will benefit from improved infrastructure in the Asian region. Joining the AIIB with them will promote stronger linkages between Australia and our neighbours. It will drive economic growth and it will generate benefits for Australians in the area of trade and business. And, as I said, being an exporting nation, if we continue to concentrate on the activities that happen only within our shores then our opportunities for the growth and expansion of our economy will be extremely limited. So, I think the forward thinking of the current government in seeing the opportunities that this particular infrastructure bank is able to provide for Australia—Australia's businesses, Australia's economy and Australia's future—represents a very strategic decision and one that has been very wisely made.


Also, there is no doubt that the AIIB will work closely with the private sector to deliver these infrastructure projects. Given that Australian businesses are considered to be world leaders in many of the areas of infrastructure delivery, the opportunity is there for Australian businesses on the ground, not just the benefits of the infrastructure once it has been provided but there are opportunities in the build phase of the infrastructure for Australian companies. That also needs to be considered in realising the net value to Australia, the net economic benefit and the net economic opportunity, of its involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


Consistent with the treatment of Australia's contributions to other international financial institutions, Australia has paid in capital. It will be treated as an investment. Therefore, it does not come at a cost to other government spending and will not directly add to the budget deficit, which is very important for Australia's books, to make sure that we keep our credit ratings where they need to be, sensibly treating capital as an investment.


But you do not just need to take my word for the benefits that this opportunity is going to provide for Australia. A number of people have come out publicly in support of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. And I think it is very important that we seriously take into account some of the comments that have been made by important heads of Australian industry and industry groups. They are the ones who represent the very people who will be the beneficiaries of this particular project. But we must also reinstate, reinforce every time, that if we have businesses that are going well in this country, these businesses employ people, and the most important bottom line is to ensure that the majority of Australians—that every Australian we can possibly can get into the workforce—has an ongoing job. That is probably the most important thing that any government can achieve.


But we as a government believe that the best way of facilitating people getting jobs is making sure that the jobs exist in the first place. You cannot create jobs out of thin air; hence we believe that investment in these long-term productive activities is much more important. It comes back to the old saying that if you want to feed a man for a day you give him a fish but if you want to feed him for life you give him a fishing rod. I think that is very important with these sorts of projects, these sorts of strategic investments by government. What we are seeking to do is provide the fishing rod to Australian industry so that we are actually able as a country to feed our people in the longer term and make sure they have jobs, have a standard of living to which I think all Australians aspire. And we certainly do not want to see our standard of living slipping backwards the way it has done over the past few years. It is these sorts of investments into the future and the future prosperity and economic opportunity that will make sure that Australia retains or regains its position as an economic powerhouse that is able to deliver for all citizens of Australia.


But, as I said, do not just take my word for it. There are a number of industry leaders who have been very public on the record about their support for this opportunity. As an example, the chair of Industry Super Australia, Peter Collins, said:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


He also said:


The activities of the AIIB will not only provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export super funds' know how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects.


And:


The resources of the AIIB will increase scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long term, productive assets in the region.


So, obviously the head of one of Australia's large industry super funds has seen the opportunity for his particular funds and resources that he has available for investment in these sorts of projects and that they really give him the opportunity to generate the economic growth that he needs to in order to provide the outputs that need to occur at the end of the investment in a superannuation scheme.


The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, equally made some very positive remarks about the opportunities that the infrastructure bank provides for Australia:


The Business Council of Australia (BCA) welcomes the government’s decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as a founding member.


As a founding member, Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of this body and the decisions it will make to finance projects that address Asia’s infrastructure gaps.


Australian companies will benefit from opportunities to participate in developing and building new AIIB financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade in the region.


Ms Westacott obviously has taken the view that the opportunities are not just in the development or the build component of the opportunities that this bank provides but also in the increased trade and investment opportunities for Australia in the region.


Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox was equally full of praise for the bank:


Ai Group welcomes Australia's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  We have argued for some time that the AIIB's objective of financing infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region will foster greater trade and economic development in the region of Australia's closest and most important economic partners.


Given our national ambitions to be more thoroughly engaged in the Asian region, it makes clear sense for Australia to become a founding member of the AIIB and to work to ensure its success.


Mr Willox makes a very good point in terms of the strategic overall policy of this government in acknowledging and recognising the opportunity that Asia provides for Australia. So often we hear the rhetoric whereby governments say that they are going to do things—'We are going to be the food bowl of Asia'; 'We are going to feed the world'; 'Agriculture is going to be one of the mainstays of our economy.' So often we hear the rhetoric, but often the policies that sit behind that rhetoric do not deliver the outcomes of the policy.


If you have look at a broad range of the activities that have occurred under the government that I am a member of—this current coalition government—many of the things that we have sought to put in place since coming into government have been the policy implementation and real actions behind the rhetoric that we have heard for such a very long time. The free trade arrangements that we have put in place with Korea and Japan—and hopefully we will see the nonsense in relation to the ChAFTA arrangements resolved very shortly when the opposition realises that focusing on one particular component of that agreement is completely silly in comparison with the massive economic benefits that we can deliver to our country from signing it. When you look at the agricultural white paper that we have seen in recent times and, on top of that, this particular bill today—the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015—that seeks to provide the opportunity, the authority and the appropriations for Australia's involvement in what I think is a very important initiative and a fantastic opportunity—the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank—which will enable many Australian businesses, over a very long period of time, to realise the series of opportunities that would not otherwise be available to them in the largest and most quickly growing economy in the world.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-09-15,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (13:47):  I rise to oppose the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. The main purpose of this bill is to facilitate Australia becoming a founding and substantial financial member of the Australian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The title of this bank and legislation is fundamentally misleading. It is not Asia that has established this bank; it is China. China announced its intention to establish the bank in October 2013 and is driving this project. If China had chosen not to project its economic power into Asia and the South Pacific through the establishment of this bank, this debate would not be happening today in our parliament. Up-front, if we are to be honest, it should be called the 'China and Other Countries Infrastructure Investment Bank', not the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


There are many reasons not to agree to this legislation, but before I detail the most common found in our media I would like to make this point: this financial organisation will be controlled and heavily influenced by the communist government of China. The Parliamentary Library report states:


To illustrate the disparity in voting power, China, the largest AIIB shareholder will have 297,804 Share Votes while the Maldives will have just 72 Share Votes.


A weighted voting system ensures decision-making reflects the relative size of a country’s capital contribution. However, it potentially creates a longer-term challenge because of the need to ensure the distribution of power within the organisation keeps pace with shifts in relative economic power. In multilateral organisations, representation and voice can be strongly linked to perceptions of legitimacy and effectiveness.


As China will have over a quarter of the votes, under the AIIB’s Articles of Agreement it will have an effective veto over issues requiring a ‘super majority’, defined as 75 per cent of votes and two-thirds of all member countries. The types of issues requiring a super majority include selecting the President, increasing the capital stock of the AIIB and changing the size and composition of the Board of Directors. However, this is not without precedent. The United States is the only country to have a veto over major governance decisions at the IMF and World Bank.


No serious financial expert or commentator will ever say you can trust any financial figures that emerge from the government of China. Because of a lack of transparency and basic integrity, all financial figures and reports that are created by the Chinese government are viewed by every free-world Western economy and every Australian peak body representing Australian business as suspect and to be taken with a grain of salt. Just like the Chinese free trade agreement, we are making the mistake of entering into a deal with an organisation that is not like any private sector entity in the Western world—because it is not a private sector entity with the same rigorous, trustworthy reporting mechanisms.


This bank will be an arm of the Chinese communist government just like its military, whose purpose will be to protect, expand and spread the influence of communist, not democratic, culture. The influence of the Chinese government is being felt in this parliament today through at least $5.5 million in political donations from people linked to the Chinese government, so it is little wonder that there will be little or no resistance to this legislation which the Australian bankers are all supporting. The Australian banking industry is another group of people who have considerable influence in this parliament due to the amount of political donations they give to political parties and the people who have come from the banking industry and now occupy high positions of authority in our political system.


It is not just me who has expressed grave concerns about the establishment of the 'China and Other Countries Bank' and participation in it. Some very respected people and sources have raised serious concerns, which the Australian government is now ignoring by entering into this deal. From Huey Fern Tay, the ABC journalist based in Beijing:


China is the biggest shareholder at 30%, Australia is 6th largest with 4.9% voting power—putting us at a great disadvantage.


And:


Japan and US refuse to join—why? Well the AIIB doubles up on the World Bank and Asia Development Bank. There are still doubts surrounding the AIIB's transparency and governance standards, even though Australia waited for those to be improved before joining.


ABC business reporter Stephen Letts writes that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is:


… self-serving as China hopes the AIIB will be a better way to deploy its massive foreign exchange reserves, which are earning almost nothing in the US Treasury bonds.


From The Economistwe read:


… China will use the new bank to expand its influence at the expense of America and Japan, Asia's established powers. China's decision to fund a new multilateral bank rather than give more to existing ones reflects its exasperation with the glacial pace of global economic governance reform.


Yun Sun, writing in The Diplomat, has said that China has capital share of 30 per cent and voting rights of 26.06 per cent and:


… will have veto power on issues that require a supermajority vote, such as the board, the president, the capital, as well as the major operational and financial policies. Retention of a veto reflects China's determination to retain control on key aspects of the bank.


Most Australians will remember the surprise visit of a flotilla of three Chinese warships which sailed past our territorial waters and Christmas Island in February 2014 on a military exercise that included combat simulations. The media report of the incident said:


Never before has a Chinese naval drill come so close to Australia.


   …   …   …


This month's exercise took the theory a good step closer to reality, bringing China's bold ambitions virtually to Australia's doorstep. In doing so, it has crystallised the challenge facing our military planners in preparing for a very different world.


On the subject of China's military might, I think of its recent parade. While our military planners are preparing for a very different world because of the rapid increase in Chinese military might and the willingness of the Chinese government to use that might, it appears that the Liberal and National Party leaders and members of this parliament, with their calls to rush into a free trade agreement with China and this legislation, have not prepared for a very different world. Australia's purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars of sophisticated military hardware—F35 fighter jets and submarines—is because of the very real military threat the Chinese communist government poses to our nation and our allies. This is a simple statement of fact not, as some would have you believe, a xenophobic rant.


Most Australians would be shocked to learn of the size of the donations to our major political parties by people who have links—most likely strong links—to the Chinese communist government. Especially in the light of the approval of the Chinese government state owned Shenhua mine, the question must be asked and answered: what political influence does this money—$5.5 million—buy?


This government wants the Australian people to rush into both a banking deal and trade deal with a country which recently put on a parade which The Economist magazine described as: 'a show of military muscle in Beijing to upset Asian neighbours'. Indeed, so aggressive was the display of Chinese military might this year that every western government chose not to send their leaders to a ceremony whose primary purpose was to celebrate victory over the imperialist Japanese forces and fascism. This was a conflict on mainland China in World War II which killed 35 million Chinese and tied up 600,000 Japanese troops, a feat of resistance by the Chinese people which most likely prevented the invasion of Australia.


This government has had a very mixed approached to China. Our previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, boycotted China's most important cultural event in six years because of fears about China's military aggression and expansionism, while his party urges this Senate to support legislation like the China free trade agreement which undermines our nation's sovereignty—and I refer to the investor-state dispute settlement provisions which allow the Chinese government to sue our government if we pass legislation thought this house which the Chinese believe harms their commercial interests.


The government's own figures reveal that Chinese investment in Australia in the last 10 years has increased—without a China infrastructure bank or a free trade deal—by a factor of 10. It has risen from $3 billion to $32 billion. The average Australian would like to know where the Chinese money has been spent. How many Australian jobs have been created and where are they? Before we enter into this deal and others there needs to be more comprehensive community discussion that engages ordinary Australians, not just the elite, from both sides of the political divide.


Media reports indicate that the American President has stopped using a famous hotel chain because of espionage fears after the hotel chain was bought by people linked to the Chinese government. Are we going to call the American President xenophobic because his administration is taking precautions and is vigilant about Chinese espionage and other forms of cultural and industrial attacks on western values of democracy and liberty? In the national interests of Australia I oppose this legislation and course of action. There are better ways of conducting business with China which respect our democratic values and our rule of law and guard our children's liberty and freedoms.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


There is an old saying, but a true saying when it comes to the coalition: the more things change, the more they stay the same. We have had exactly the same rhetoric, the same spin, the same nonsense paraded before this Senate today that we have had for the last two years of dysfunctional, incompetent government from the coalition. Changing the leader made no change. The same rhetoric, the same three-word slogans that the new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, was saying would disappear all got a run again today in question time. This is a government that is an absolute rabble. This is a government that has got no concept and no understanding of the economic necessities of this country. This is a government that had an opportunity to stand up and say what it would do to move this economy and this society forward, and what did we get? We got the same old spin—same old, same old from the same old tired, incompetent, dysfunctional government that parades around as a so-called government in this country.


We know they are split up the middle. There is another old saying: if you cannot govern yourself, you cannot govern the country. This lot cannot govern themselves—absolutely no chance. You saw the vote last night, tipping out Prime Minister Abbott, who was the great hero of the coalition, the great hero that brought them to government. It was only last week they were standing up there, one after the other, defending the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and running the same three-word slogans that the former Prime Minister ran every day. They cannot change it. It is in the DNA of this government to attack pensioners, to attack those on welfare, to attack working people in this country—that is what the DNA of this lot is.


They have got no understanding of how ordinary families battle every day to put food on their tables, buy their kids' schoolbooks, buy their kids their school uniforms. This is because predominantly they think about privilege when they think about this society. They think about the big end of town. They think about how they are going to cuddle up to Rupert Murdoch in this country, and they have now got a leader who actually comes from that end of town, who is a rich individual with absolutely no idea what it is like to battle in this country. Why else would he have supported every attack on working people in this country that was in that first budget? Why would he support attacking pensioners, attacking the youth of this country who are battling to get a job? Why did he say that he back every aspect of what was the worst budget this country has ever seen? What he says—I do not often agree with Malcolm Turnbull, but he did say that the government had not been successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. You do not provide economic leadership by attacking the poorest and most vulnerable people in the country. Malcolm Turnbull is backing—sorry, the Prime Minister is backing that in, and that is what he is going to continue to do.


We had Senator Cormann here, in the same robotic splurge of argument that we get every day, trying to defend this position, but Senator Cormann, according to the Prime Minister, was a failure in his position, an absolute failure. The best we can do for this country is get rid of this government, not change the leader. (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  We may have had a change in the prime ministership of our country, but we clearly have not had a change in the shallowness, the short-sightedness of Labor senators here. I might just add, Senator Cameron, that I think there was only one person who lost sleep last night in this country, and that was Bill Shorten. That would have been Bill Shorten, because even though the coalition may have had a change of leader, we did not have a change of ambition. Our ambition is to make sure that the Australian Labor Party stays out of government.


It is a bit disappointing that Senator Cameron could not even find the good grace to reflect positively on what were some significant achievements of the coalition government under the stewardship of Tony Abbott. In my contribution this afternoon I might just reflect on what Mr John Howard had to say about Mr Abbott's contribution towards stewarding this nation for two years in difficult times. One of the most notable achievements of Mr Abbott in his period of prime ministership was the way that he dealt convincingly with the issue of border protection. I think it is just worth reminding this chamber and Labor senators what it was that Mr Abbott inherited when he became Prime Minister.


We know that under the previous government 50,000—it is easy to forget the magnitude of the number—asylum seekers arrived on over 800 boats. Policies under the previous Labor government led to 1,100 deaths—not injuries but deaths—and what we saw were a thousand children in detention centres, and John Howard is absolutely right when he reflected on that this afternoon. For all his great stewardship of this country over 11 years, John Howard's concession was that even he had not thought it would be possible to correct that—and, of course, Mr Abbott did. Mr Abbott and the coalition government did that, and Mr Howard went on to say that, in his mind, that was one of the most outstanding achievements of the Abbott led government over the previous two years. 


It is true that these are interesting times politically. It is absolutely correct that the electorate has an increasing expectation of parliamentarians, an increasing expectation of the governments it elects. But it is also beholden on each of us to reflect on what some of those other achievements are. I am disappointed in Senator Cameron—and it will be interesting to hear the contributions of other Labor senators this afternoon—not even having the good grace to reflect on what were remarkable achievements that are recognised in the community as being important and sizeable achievements and achievements that have reflected the priorities of ordinary Australian voters and families over the last two years. Those achievements include the abolition of the mining tax, a tax which hit particularly hard in my home state of Western Australia, the abolition of the carbon tax, which has ordinary households an average of about $550 better off because that it has gone. So there has been the abolition of the carbon tax, the abolition of the mining tax, the protection of Australia's borders and—importantly, of course—reducing that significant loss at sea. Then there are the 335,000 new jobs—jobs for ordinary Australians that were created under the tenure of Mr Abbott.


The challenge is actually not on the coalition today. The challenge is on the Australian Labor Party and its senators in this place to think about how they will change. How will they change to make sure that Australia and this parliament get the best possible benefit they can from the new leadership that will be shown by Mr Turnbull. These are important but challenging times for our country, with an ageing population and the increasing industrialisation and development of our Asian neighbours. The world is becoming more competitive and we cannot afford to rest. We must stay vigilant, and I am confident that under the leadership of the new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, this country will go from strength to strength. (Time expired)

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:11):  I rise to take note of questions asked by the opposition today, and I will start my comments where Senator Smith finished his. I must say it is a fair stretch, given the last 24 hours, to stand with a straight face and argue that it is the Labor Party that should change—that the Labor Party should change what it is doing in response to the tearing down of a Prime Minister that we just saw played out in real-time on TV over the last 20 or so hours.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You should have been around six years ago. It happened twice.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator GALLAGHER:
  The Prime Minister started the assault on Tony Abbott yesterday with a very clear attack on the economic leadership of the government as it was. In fact, I think his own language was:


It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need.


He went on to say:


We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities.


This was a clear attack on the economic team of the government, which includes Senator Cormann and the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, in that they had failed to sell the message. But when you look at the message they were trying to sell, anyone would have difficulty with it. Unemployment has increased from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent. For the first time in 20 years over 800,000 Australian are out of work. Confidence is at an all-time low. New taxes and charges are being implemented and people are paying more. The deficit has doubled in the last 12 months. So, not that I stand here in defence of Mr Hockey or Minister Cormann, but it is a pretty tough message to sell because the results of the economic leadership, if you could call it that, have not been great.


But now we have open warfare within the Liberal Party. We have got division and disunity and we saw it on show in question time today with senators slumped in their seats, still looking a bit shell-shocked over what has happened in the last 24 hours. Senator Abetz was doing a good audition to maintain his position as leader in the Senate by holding the team together during these very difficult times. But what we do know is that whilst you can change a leader pretty easily—as it seems—it is a much harder process to deal with the disunity and division that is on show.


Anyone who knows how numbers fall will know that 55-44 is not a ringing endorsement of either Tony Abbott or Malcolm Turnbull. It really sets a challenge ahead for the new Prime Minister as to how he is going to manage what is a deeply divided and dysfunctional team. It will be very difficult for a Liberal like Prime Minister Turnbull, who has made very clear statements in relation to big issues facing this country like climate change; like the republic, an issue close to my heart; and like marriage equality, an issue that many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians care deeply about. They are things he has made very clear statements about, and people will expect him to deliver on those statements; but how can he when he is in charge of a very split team with a lot of conservatives within it who will be very unhappy with any progress made in any of those areas.


We know that the budgets that led to the problems facing the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, and the previous Prime Minister, Tony Abbott—the cuts, the unfairness of those budgets, the attacks on families, the attacks on workers, the cuts to state and territory run services like health and education—were all decisions taken around the cabinet table. As much as people would like to distance themselves from those decisions now that they have proven to be as unpopular as they are, we know—and I certainly know from putting budgets together—that to finalise a budget you need the agreement of the cabinet, and Prime Minister Turnbull was sitting at that cabinet table. He was not only sitting there but also agreeing to the budget and then going out and implementing it. No matter how hard he tries now—you can change the leader but changing the direction of the government is going to be a much harder job. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:16):  The motion before the chamber is that the Senate take note of the answers given to questions asked by members of the Australian Labor Party. That is very difficult to do, because all of the questions were so juvenile, irrelevant and lacking any policy content that it makes it hard to debate on the questions asked.


This is from a party riven by factional enmities and full of, to quote Senator Cameron, lobotomised 'zombies', controlled and answerable to no-one except the criminals who are part of unions like the Health Services Union and the CFMEU. That is who the Australian Labor Party are directed by and answerable to. The CFMEU—thank heavens for the royal commission into trade unions—we know comprises many people who could not be described as anything but criminals. They are represented in this chamber by none other than the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, a former employee of the CFMEU and a person who proved herself to be the worst environment minister we have had for many years, the worst finance minister we have had for many years and now the worst shadow trade minister that the country has ever seen.


This government is the same government that was elected on 13 September 2013 with a number of policies which we have implemented and continue to implement—policies like border protection and stopping people drowning at sea, abolition of the carbon tax, and creation of new jobs. In August alone, 17,000 new jobs were created by this government. The union royal commission has been set up as promised. Again, this government is proceeding with its policy, which it promised before the last election, to retain the definition of marriage for the term of this election and to provide that we will go to the Australian people for a decision on that in the next term of parliament. Those policies stand. That is what we were elected to do and we will continue to do. The new leader, Mr Turnbull, confirmed that last night.


With the Liberal and National parties Australians know what they are getting. They know that when our parties go to the election and promise certain things we will do them, no matter how hard the Labor Party and their allies in the Greens political party will try to put forward some other proposals. We are not like the Labor Party. We do not go to an election promising that there will be no carbon tax and then immediately following the election bring in exactly that. We will continue on the policy we took to the last election, and that will play out in Paris this year. This is a government which keeps its promises. This is a government which has set a path and which will continue on that path. Although the leadership has changed, the policies of the parties remain and the new leader has made that very clear.


By contrast, you have a group of people opposite run by the trade union movement. As I often say here, if the trade union movement were anywhere representative of Australia, it might give the Australian Labor Party some credibility. But I emphasise that, according to Bureau of Statistics figures, the union movement represent 12 per cent of workers in the private sector—that is, 88 per cent of all workers in the private sector choose not to join the union. The way the unions carry on, and the way their representatives in this chamber carry on, you can well understand why most hardworking Australian workers choose not to join a union. It is because they see the unions for the criminals and thugs that the royal commission has exposed them as and for the rabble that you see in this chamber opposite. (Time expired)

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:21):  In commencing my contribution, I take up a point made by Senator Smith when he called upon the opposition to express some gracious response to the changes in leadership that have occurred overnight. From my own perspective, I commiserate with Mr Abbott over the way he has been treated overnight and I wish him the best in his future endeavours. I also congratulate Mr Turnbull on his election to the leadership of the Liberal Party. For the sake of the people of Australia, I hope that he is able to discharge the duties that he has now been entrusted with. It is incumbent on us to say, however, that whilst we might reflect personally on Mr Abbott's demise, one certainly cannot consider his period in office as Prime Minister as anything other than a disaster for our country. I certainly believe that there has been a lot of economic vandalism perpetrated in that period of time. 


With Mr Abbott's statement this morning—I will come to Senator Abetz's responses to my question in due course—I think it is important to note that he spoke about the white-anting that had occurred during his period of leadership, about the febrile media culture that rewarded treachery and about conniving and dishonour. He also made reference to 'the assassin's knife'. So this government has clearly now gone from exhibiting chaos and dysfunction down to a new level of division and chaos which I think does not bode well for our country.


Today I asked Senator Abetz whether the Prime Minister agreed with the coalition's Direct Action Plan or whether it was an 'environmental fig leaf', to use Mr Turnbull's terms, and 'a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale.' In his response, Senator Abetz confirmed that the Prime Minister will be supporting the plan which the government is taking to Paris. I think that confirms that Mr Turnbull is a person who will say anything and do anything in order to obtain political power. I think it is important that the Australian people look at Mr Turnbull's public statements, given he aspires to the top job in the land, in respect of this issue of climate change. He has previously said that he would not lead a party that was not as committed to action on climate change as he is. This is a Liberal politician who has previously expressed in writing, in December 2009, some home truths about the farce that the coalition's policy, or lack of policy, on climate change had descended into. He acknowledged that one cannot cut emissions without a cost. He said:


To replace dirty coal fired power stations with cleaner gas fired ones, or renewables like wind let alone nuclear power or even coal fired power with carbon capture and storage is all going to cost money.


To get farmers to change the way they manage their land, or plant trees and vegetation all costs money.


Somebody has to pay.


So any suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott—


I do not want to quote the specific term that Mr Turnbull used, because I fear it is unparliamentary, but he certainly described Mr Abbott's position on this matter in fairly explicit terms. 


So we have a Prime Minister who, regrettably, is a person who cannot be taken on his record. He is a person who will say anything and do anything in order to obtain high political office. It should not be forgotten that Mr Turnbull sat around the cabinet table that delivered the toxic first budget of this government. (Time expired)

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (15:30):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CASH:
  Let me be absolutely clear, there is a pay gap that exists between women and men in Australia and it is unacceptable. We acknowledge the huge pay difference between male and female sports people that currently exists. It profoundly affects a woman's life in many different ways, including her long-term economic security and it makes her more vulnerable to poverty and homelessness later in life. It is also reflected in the gender disparity in superannuation, with women retiring with only 65 per cent of the superannuation that men retire on. This means that a woman has to work 15 more years than a man to retire with the same income as a man. Things need to change. The national women's soccer team, the Matildas, have been a sporting institution since 1978 and have represented Australia with class, integrity and professionalism. The Matildas, along with the Diamonds, the Opals and the Southern Stars, for example, are brilliant role models for our girls and they are leaders in our communities. 


In relation to the notice of motion, whilst we do support its intent, we must remember that individual employment arrangements are matters for employers and their employees. Any allegations of illegal work practices should be referred to the Fair Work Ombudsman.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-09-15,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:44):  I do think it is worth acknowledging, as other senators have done today, the contribution of the former Prime Minister, Mr Tony Abbott. He is certainly not someone who I have agreed with on many things—or anything, to be honest—but you have to understand and appreciate that there is a very personal element to these kinds of events. Sometimes in politics we forget that we are dealing with real people and real consequences. Again, while he is not someone who, on a policy level, I would necessarily agree with, I do want to acknowledge that there are people in this place who have contributed their lives to public policy. It may not be public policy that we all share and it may not be public policy that we all agree with, but in doing so those people do it in the way that they believe is best and in the national interest.


When we are talking about the economic path, plan and direction of this government, I think we really have a government with no plan for jobs and no plan for growth, and with no business confidence being built. There is no plan for emerging industry. What we have seen is a government that has been relying on slogans over substance and a complete and utter lack of economic leadership.


These are not simply words and language being used by me; this is the description that was used by the now Prime Minister of Australia about the economic performance of those opposite. The former Prime Minister, John Howard, said of Mr Turnbull a few hours ago:


… he has the capacity to explain economic concepts very clearly and very lucidly, and that, as he indicated yesterday, will be a very important part of the skill-set he brings to his new responsibilities.


What is that a demonstration of? It is a demonstration of the fact that this is a government that has failed on the economic front. But they have misunderstood what they have actually failed on. The problem has not just been how the message has been delivered; the problem is the product. The problem is what they are trying to sell. The problem is what they are trying to perpetrate against the Australian population.


What has been the common theme between these two governments—between this Abbott government and this new Turnbull government? It is that those right at the top have not necessarily changed. Sure, there might be one small change between who the Prime Minister is and who is not, but on all the other key economic positions there still has not been a change. And most damaging of all, we still have the same deputy leader driving the same economic policy—the same deputy leader who is now onto her fourth leader. I appreciate that these are difficult things for people to participate in. I appreciate that these are not easy times. And I appreciate that people come to it with different perspectives. What I have never appreciated in politics is rank acts of disloyalty. And I will leave the judgement of disloyalty on that front for others to make.


But this is about their failure in the economy, on how this has been treated and on the role that the deputy leader and foreign minister—and a key member of cabinet—has had in these economic decisions. This morning I said that if the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party ever ran for the leadership there is a song that I think would be her campaign song. I said it would be Destiny's Child's Survivor—a song I know that you are very familiar with, Mr President. But that sparked some other interest. Some other people put their own views forward. Rob Walter told me that I was wrong, that in fact it would be a song by the group called Survivor—Eye of the Tiger. Robert Gunner told me that in fact it would be MC Hammer's Can't Touch This. Tanya Plibersek, from the other place—the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party—chimed in and told me it would be Gloria Gaynor's, I Will Survive. Jordan Jansen told me it would be the Bee Gees' Stayin' Alive. Teo, who I affectionately refer to as 'Teo from Oz' as it is his Twitter handle, told me it would be Britney Spears', Oops, I Did It Again. But then there was Samantha Ajardi, who brilliantly—and I think she was right on this—said that it would be Bob Marley's I Shot the Sheriff. Let's be clear here:


I shot the sheriff


But I didn't shoot no deputy.


The problem with all of these references is that they are from the seventies, eighties and early nineties. I just do not think they are really relevant to the debate we are having as a nation now. But I will tell you who is relevant: Taylor Swift. And in Taylor Swift's poetic, beautiful and—I think—touching song, Blank Space, which really is a modern soliloquy on the Liberal Party, she says—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  I am quoting a poet here. I notice that other senators are laughing; I just do not think they are treating this with the respect that it deserves:


Magic, madness, heaven, sin


Saw you there and I thought oh my god


Look at that face, you look like my next mistake


…   …   …


New money, suit and tie


I can read you like a magazine


Ain't it funny rumors fly


And I know you heard about me


…   …   …


So it's gonna be forever


Or it's gonna go down in flames


You can tell me when it's over


If the high was worth the pain


What we have here is a government in crisis, a dysfunctional government and a government that has completely fallen apart. What have they done? What is the decision they have made? They are prepared to throw anything or anyone overboard simply to protect their own political hides. They think the problem has been in the delivery of the message, but, frankly, the problem is in the message itself.


I noticed in question time today that Senator Ronaldson had a bit of a Freudian slip. I think he was trying to say that he was really worried about 'xenophobia', but he actually said he was worried about the 'xenophonic' attitudes of the Australian public. That is a new word: it means when there are one or more Nick Xenophons in the same place at the same time. I know that something, certainly at the South Australian level, has really frightened the Liberal Party. But, frankly, this is a government that is in crisis and is out of control. (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:51):  I thank Senator Moore—she is a gift that just keeps giving. I saw this today:


The Coalition Government’s failure to provide the economic leadership our nation needs.


My first message to Senator Moore, of course, is about the absolute disdain with which Senator Dastyari treated this question. Before he leaves the chamber, if Senator Dastyari wants to talk about deputy leaders and foreign ministers he need go no further than Ms Gillard. One thing all of the leaders of our party know is that the deputy, Ms Bishop, was never there with a knife in her hand—do not worry about shooting sheriffs, it is that knife in the back—with every single solitary leader of this side or the other side looking to see whether the deputy was going to put the knife straight in. It is not the opportunity today to speak about public sector people in New York, but I will speak to Senator Dastyari and I will share with him the information that came to me from senior officials in our mission at the UN, and they will compare the performance of Ms Bishop with that of Messrs Rudd and Bob Carr—you would not have raised that comparison, Senator Dastyari.


I am delighted to speak about the performance of our government because it enables me to start with what the last crowd in government, the Labor Party, did. Of course they had inherited no net debt; they had a $20 billion surplus and they had $45 billion in the bank. There is an old saying in Western Australia: 'If you want to lose a surplus, vote in a Labor government.' And do not think that over six years they did not perform. The people of Canning will remember this on Saturday. What did they do with the $20 billion surplus in six years? They turned it into a $220 billion deficit. What did they do with the no net debt? They raced it towards $670 billion of debt. People in the gallery need to know that this country is borrowing $1 billion a month to pay the interest—not to repay the debt. Do colleagues know how much that is? It is two new primary schools a day. It is a new teaching hospital. The new teaching hospital in Perth, the children's hospital, is worth two months of interest on the debt. That is what this mob left us with. When Senator Moore invites me to comment on the failure of the economic leadership of our government, I say to her, 'Thank you very, very much.' Even in their last year Labor produced 11 estimates in 2013-14, eight of which they said were going to produce a surplus. We know the results of that. In government, just by way of comparison, the coalition's MYEFO estimate in 2014-15 was a $47 billion deficit. The budget estimate was $49.9 billion. What did it come down at? It came down at $48.5 billion. How close, how accurate—how excellent is that economic management?


Let me turn to the economic performance of this government. Already in two years the budget is $68 billion bigger. We have spent $50 billion repairing the budget. Is that economic failure? In two years there have been 313,000 new jobs, 440 a day, and half of them are for women. Compare that with the last three years of Labor—not 440 new jobs a day but 44—10 per cent of the coalition's performance. Some economic failure! It gets even better. In the eight months of this year, there have been 167,000 new jobs. That is 700 new jobs a day, seven days a week—outperforming the US, the UK, Canada and every other G7 country. Job advertisements are 16 per cent up from when we took over from Labor; retail sales are nine per cent higher; exports are 11½ per cent higher. Do I need to keep going on about the economic failure of the coalition government? I intend to. I intend to bury this issue. Dwelling starts have increased—and we know what new residential dwellings do. They create jobs in the construction industry. You would not believe it, would you? Residential dwelling starts are now 23 per cent higher than when we came into government two years ago—33½ thousand new dwellings. Multiply that by four, and that is the number of people in new homes—better than the absolute high point under the Labor government. One million construction workers are benefiting from this, a lot of them in the seat of Canning. Bankruptcies are at a 20-year low—15 per cent lower. Those opposite do not like this because they have to sit and listen to it—it is the fact. Investment in the services sector rose by 12 per cent last financial year, and the story gets even better. Last week Dun and Bradstreet said:


… we're seeing robust levels of optimism against all sectors in the Australian business community. 


It is a shame for Labor in opposition to have to suffer this when we inherited what we did from them. In 2014 a record 223,000 new companies registered. Iron ore exports out Port Hedland were at a record level last month—34 million times, better than a million times a day. 


What has the Labor Party done to assist us in this whole process? We remember the $5 billion of budget savings that Labor themselves announced prior to the last election that they were going to bring in with our support. What happened to that when it came into this chamber? They opposed it—they stood on the hose. That is what we are seeing with the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Gough Whitlam was their great hero, and fortunately for Gough he lived long enough to find a Prime Minister worse than himself, in Ms Gillard, but when he went to China, the first opposition leader, he was lauded by the opposition side. This is an interesting story; Senator Bullock might know it but apparently when Gough met Mao Tse-tung he was introduced as the Leader of the Opposition and Mao reportedly turned to a translator and said 'What's opposition?'. Whitlam should quite rightly be accorded credit for his work in establishing the relationship with China, and yet we see today in this place and in the other place, with poor leadership from Mr Shorten and Senator Wong, this opposition standing in the way of hundreds of thousands of opportunities. We will lose $600 million if we do not ratify this agreement by the end of this year, and another $600 million three weeks later. This is what the Labor Party is doing.


Senator Moore refers to economic leadership for our nation. Let me go through that topic in a little more detail. This is how the coalition government is delivering more jobs, stronger growth and a better economy in Australia at a time when, around the world, Asia and Europe are absolutely suffering. Yet see what Australia is doing: $5.5 billion in the last budget in the new Growing Jobs and Small Business package, which is already kick-starting economic growth, better outcomes and employment in the engine room of our economy. The Labor Party do not know about the engine room of the economy called small business; they think it is all either government employment or big business, who they can try to dominate. It is small business, where we have that $5.5 billion.


Again, in the small business sector, we see $3.25 billion in tax cuts for small business and $1.75 billion in accelerated depreciation measures, encouraging small business to start up and expand. Do you know what they do when they start up and expand? Senator Ruston knows—they employ people. And if those employees work well they get permanent employment and so the whole thing grows.


The next thing we want to look at is $6.8 billion in jobactive, the new employment services system, helping people get jobs which they will be able to sustain over time. Then we have a record $50 billion for infrastructure. Senator Dastyari was courteous to give some accolades to Mr Abbott. Certainly he will be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister, because he has invested that $50 billion in infrastructure for the 21st century. 


I conclude my contribution with the three free trade agreements that Labor could not get anywhere near. Since 2007, when New Zealand negotiated a free trade agreement with China, their trade has gone up by a factor of five. It has quintupled. In that time, ours has doubled. If anybody wants to know the value of the free trade agreement with China to this country's economy, it is two against five. That is where the potential lies. The other side had better get on board.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:01):  I rise to speak on the coalition's failure to provide the economic leadership that our nation needs. Certainly there is no greater proof of that than the last two years. On behalf of the Greens, may I say that we are thrilled to see the back of the former Prime Minister. I am personally thrilled to see the back of the nastiness, the small-mindedness, and the lack of vision and long-term planning. The new leadership is an opportunity for the coalition to reset. I hope that we will see some policy change. Australia is crying out for policy change. It would be incredibly depressing if we saw no policy change but just a different talking head. This is a real test for the government and for the new leader. 


If there is to be genuine economic progress, clearly the biggest challenge, which the entire globe is facing, is how we tackle climate change. Of course it is an enormous environmental issue. Of course it is an enormous social and justice issue; but it is also an economic issue. It is the biggest economic issue of our time. There were some encouraging words said by the now Prime Minister yesterday. But then, when he was pressed on whether there would be any policy changes on climate change, I was very disheartened to hear the now Prime Minister say that he endorsed the climate policies of the former Abbott regime. Not only that, his deputy then chimed in and said they endorsed the targets that have been announced to take to Paris. 


What a missed opportunity! I urge the government to reconsider. There is a genuine opportunity to create prosperity while we tackle this enormous threat to our very way of life, not to mention the life-support systems and the things that we hold dear. This is an enormous opportunity. The job creation potential in clean energy is so exciting. We saw that under the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, if it had not been slashed—sadly, both the parties ganged up to do that—there would have been $14½ billion of investment in large-scale renewables by 2020. How absolutely exciting. That is the future, and it could have been ours. Instead, we saw the target slashed from 41,000 to 33,000 gigawatt hours. That represented a loss of 6,000 future jobs.


It is very interesting to hear the focus on economic prosperity, because we know that until last night we have heard the lies, frankly, of big fossil fuel companies trotted out in this place like gospel—particularly in Queensland, where I am from. The initial promise by Adani, the Indian coal company, was that they would generate 10,000 jobs from their Carmichael coalmine. Under scrutiny they back-pedalled enormously and said, 'Actually, it is only 1,464—sorry, we got carried away there.' Yet we have still seen members of the frontbench in this place trot out that discredited and incorrect jobs figure. 


Opening up coalmines in the Galilee Basin, including that Adani mine, is absolutely the wrong way to go. We should not be tipping $5 billion into a slush fund for fossil fuel infrastructure, which Adani is now seeking to access. We should not be going down that path. If we do not tackle global warming, then we see a real threat to the Great Barrier Reef and to our agricultural sectors. While we are in this economics frame, those two are enormous employers and enormous generators of prosperity. The reef employs more than 60,000 people and brings in more than $6 billion every year to our bottom line. If we look after that beautiful place, which is an absolute paradise and truly magical, we can bring that prosperity and those jobs in every year. That could be a sustainable prospect for us in Queensland and for the nation. 


Likewise, if we safeguard our agricultural sector, help them transition to more sustainable farming methods, as they already wish to do and some are already doing, and genuinely tackle the impact that global warming will have on food production, rather than pockmarking farms with coal seam gas wells or turning them into enormous open-cut coalmines, we can safeguard those jobs as well. 


We really need to start getting some long-term perspective onto these questions of where our future economic prosperity lies. We know it is not in last-century thinking. It is not in the big mines and the big old infrastructure items. It is in the exciting new areas of clean energy, innovation, science, and research and development of technology, and in our services sector and ecotourism. These are the green and prosperous economies of the future, which we know will provide employment and sustained income to our bottom line.


I hope we see moves in that direction. I think the Australian community is desperate to see a move in that direction. That is why it was very disappointing to hear the Prime Minister last night already ruling out changing the climate change policies of the Abbott government. He has no doubt had to bring an awful lot of climate sceptics along with him in order to ascend to the leadership, but I urge the Prime Minister to seriously base his policies on science. I urge all members in this place to restore the centrality of science to decision making, particularly as it pertains to climate change—which is intricately linked to our economic prosperity—and to realise that the momentum is on globally.


The transition towards a low-carbon economy is not some fringe, crazy notion as the leader of government business in the Senate would have us believe every time he howls us down when the Greens ask a question about climate change. It is actually fringe to not be making that transition. Look at the rest of the world. That transition is on; it is happening. And every day Australia is getting further and further behind—when we have some of the best clean energy resources in the world. We have some of the world's best sunshine, yet we have a government that is hamstringing the CEFC from investing in rooftop solar—or in wind, for that matter, because a bunch of people are awfully concerned about the health impacts of wind, of which there are none, and forget about the health impacts of coalmining, which are well known and actually documented by real scientists. I hope we see a diminution of the influence of the fossil fuels sector on both of the big parties. I am an eternal optimist. It remains to be seen whether anything will change. It needs to change. We cannot just have the same old, tired, failed policies with a slightly better salesperson at the helm.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-09-15,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:08):  Today is Mr Turnbull's first day as Prime Minister. It has been marked by the release of a NATSEM-Anglicare report that serves to demonstrate that the Liberal Party has yet again promoted another out-of-touch leader. This research for Anglicare Australia focuses on the changes in living standards for a broad range of family types in Australia up to 2014. It is almost like two worlds colliding. They could not be more different and they could not be more stark. One of the first points the report makes is that the gap between the rich—that is, Mr Turnbull—and the poor, those on low incomes and benefits, has only grown under his predecessor and shows no signs of slowing down. Our egalitarian culture and our fair go for all are now well and truly under attack by this LNP government.


The NATSEM-Anglicare report states very clearly that life will get harder for those on low incomes. For hundreds of thousands of Australians, their decline in living standards is a direct result of the proposed cuts to pensions and family tax benefits supported 100 per cent by Mr Turnbull. For wage earners it is the very low growth in wages supported by Mr Turnbull and his government. The report predicts flat growth over the next 10 years, along with a very low GDP. Income growth is slow, and last year members of the then Abbott government applauded that. But of course that affects what people have to spend. Whereas in the past wages growth has been about four to five per cent, it is now around two to three per cent. This is only marginally above inflation—not enough to enable individuals, couples or families to get ahead.


Earlier this year, in an arrogant attack on his own Public Service, Senator Abetz accused public servants of living in a 'pay rise paradise' and wrongly claimed that the Public Service had received wage increases far above those in the private sector. His economic leadership—or, rather, no economic leadership—failed to acknowledge that the ABS statistics, the real truth, and not Abbott's 'never let the truth get in the way of a story' rhetoric shows clearly that there is not very much difference between the public and private sectors on wage increases. In the decade between 2004 and 2014, private sector total wage growth was 42.5 per cent. In the same period the broader public sector wage growth was 45.9 per cent—hardly the pay rise paradise that Senator Abetz was trying to invent. The LNP government has failed its Public Service. There has been a high 'no' vote on the unfair Abetz enterprise bargaining deal, and levels of industrial action not seen in many years are now happening right across the public sector.


The LNP government, no matter who the leader is, has failed to provide any economic leadership. It has record unemployment and very high youth unemployment, particularly in the seat of Canning, where youth unemployment is at an alarming 14.6 per cent, with no plan to change that. Since the coalition government's first budget was handed down in May 2014, economic growth has slowed. The annual growth rate has declined from three per cent in the March quarter of 2014 to two per cent in the June quarter of 2015. Australian incomes are down right across the board, not just in the public sector. Living standards have fallen, and Australians' disposable income is down 1.8 per cent in real terms. Consumer confidence is down. Again, that has gone down since the coalition came into government. That is based on the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index. Wages growth has slumped. Apparently the LNP government thinks it is a good thing that wages growth has slumped. But of course it is not a good thing, because there is less money in the economy. Unemployment is up at record levels. It never had a six in front of it when Labor were in government, not even at the height of the global financial crisis. What a disgrace. Unemployment is well and truly up. Those opposite will talk about the jobs they have created. But what are those jobs? They are part time, casual and low paid, mainly occupied by women. That means those people need continued support from a government that is hell-bent on making sure that that support is not there—that wants to pull the rug away from families and from single parents struggling to survive under its harsh budget.


What is Mr Turnbull's response to that? We know he backed in both budgets of the LNP government. He backed them in 100 per cent. Today he has backed in the old-fashioned view of marriage equality to waste millions of taxpayers' dollars holding a vote that is not necessary, and he is sticking to an old-fashioned, outdated climate change policy. The coalition have well and truly bungled the economy, and it will not change under the leadership of Mr Turnbull.


All over this nation Australians have been hurt by the failed economic leadership of this government—formerly the Abbott government and now the Turnbull government. What is Mr Turnbull's approach? He just seems to think he needs to communicate better. The voters of Canning and, indeed, all voters across the country deserve better than that. But Mr Turnbull will not change. He will continue to back in, as he has done in the past, the harsh, unfair policies of the LNP government. The people of Canning know that—and, thankfully, they get to vote this Saturday.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:15):  The voters of Canning and, indeed, all Australians understand the failure of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government to provide the economic leadership our nation needed six years ago. The voters in Canning—where I campaigned with Mr Randall during his very first attempt at the seat, which he was successful at—and, indeed, all Australians should look at the Australian economy. 


Let's have a look at shipbuilding. The Labor government was in power for six years and did not do one thing to establish any forward trajectory for building the new ships that the Australian Navy desperately need. Let's look at the manufacturing industry. All of the problems of the Holden, Toyota and Ford motor vehicle companies occurred in the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. The problems for those motor car companies did not start the day Labor lost the election; they were a result of inaction by the Labor Party, and Senator Carr in particular, over the previous six years.


Let's go to agriculture and look at the Labor government's record there. The Labor Party are never supporters of agricultural industries. There was Senator Ludwig's decision to stop the live cattle export trade and the destruction that that brought to a once vibrant industry. That cost jobs, homes and properties. Let's have a look at financial management. Under the last year of the Howard government there was $60 billion in the nation's piggy bank in credit. At the end of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, there was nothing left of the $60 billion of credit, only a debt approaching $700 billion that was costing Australia $1 million a day in interest to foreign lenders.


Let's have a look at tourism. Under Labor there was no interest in the Barrier Reef and in supporting the tourism jobs there. All they did was tax and scare away any investment in the tourism industry. In the trade area, which is so essential to Australia's future, the Labor government tried and tried for six years. I do not think they could have tried very hard, because they achieved absolutely zero, zilch, nothing. In the two years of the coalition government there have been three trade agreements with our biggest trading partners—Japan, Korea and China. That is a wonderful effort that will create jobs.


I heard the previous speaker talk about climate change. Remember that Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of all global emissions. What did the Labor Party do? It shut down jobs in manufacturing and mining and exported jobs overseas so Australia could reduce its emissions of carbon by five per cent—five per cent of 1.2 per cent! Gee, that is going to save the world from climate change, isn't it? It was an absolutely ridiculous, ludicrous and nonsensical hoax on the Australian people. A number of jobs that used to be held by Australians were exported overseas in that crazy period of the carbon tax and the mining tax.


Mining, one of the most important job creators, particularly up in the north of Australia, was discouraged by the Labor Party with a mining tax! That tax just sent investment out of Australia to South Africa, South America and even some places that would make you wonder why anyone would dare to go to there. But the mining companies found it safer investing in Africa and South America than in Australia. Why? It was because of the Labor government's retrospective, unexplained and unheralded attacks on mining. That is the Labor government's record of economic leadership.


I will go through those things again to show what good economic leadership can do, starting with shipbuilding. What did the Abbott government do about shipbuilding? We announced contracts for Australian workers. That happened after six years of nothing by Labor. In manufacturing, we got rid of the carbon tax. We brought some sense to the renewable energy target so that Australians can feel confident that their jobs will be there tomorrow, particularly in the cement and aluminium industries, which, had Labor stayed in power, would have continued to be exported overseas because of Labor's crazy policies.


I have mentioned what Labor did with agriculture. By contrast, the coalition government has put out an agriculture white paper on the heels of a white paper on northern Australian development which encourage and support agriculture and show all Australians, but particularly farmers, that we are their friends and that we want to help. The Labor Party and their allies in the Greens would have had you believe that the Barrier Reef was ruined. I regret to say, Senator Waters, in a most un-Australian way, toured the world telling everybody not to go to the Barrier Reef because it was destroyed and damaged, a complete pack of lies—




Senator Waters:
  Acting Deputy President O'Neill, I raise a point of order. Just to clarify: it was actually government ministers that toured the world. I did not tour the world. I can do my job from Queensland to protect the reef.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Clearly, there is not a point of order. I always get these frivolous points of order when I expose to those who might be listening to this debate the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens political party and the way that they—and Senator Waters in particular—set out to destroy the Barrier Reef and Queensland's wonderful tourism industry. As Senator Waters or anyone would know if they ever bothered to go to the Barrier Reef, it is still one of the seven natural wonders of the world. It is something that should be talked up not talked down as Senator Waters and her mates in the Greens political party do.


In trade, Labor could do nothing. I have mentioned that the coalition has three new trade agreements—two confirmed and a third one with China on exactly the same terms and conditions as to employment as others. Suddenly, the Labor Party are opposed to that. Senator Wong, as shadow trade minister, should hang her head in shame. This is an absolute disgrace, and I cannot help thinking that it is the Labor Party returning to their old White Australia roots. Remember the old White Australia policy promoted by the Labor Party? If you did not have white skin, you could not get a job in Australia. Now it seems to me—




Senator Moore:
  What did the Liberal Party do about it?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That was the Labor Party policy, wasn't it? 




Senator Moore:
  What did the Liberal Party do about it?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Was it the Labor Party policy? Who introduced that? Was it Arthur Calwell who made some comments about that? I will debate that with you—



Senator Moore interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Senator Macdonald, I ask you to make your remarks through the chair please. And Senator—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would appreciate if you could protect me from these vicious interjections by Senator Moore trying to shout me down in exposing the truth that the White Australia policy was Labor's. In fact, it was Mr Menzies who got rid of that vile policy. The way the Labor Party are going on in this xenophobic way with the China free trade agreement, you would think that some in the party want to return to the 'good old' White Australia policy days. You would almost think that, for some reason, they are anti-Asian or anti-Chinese. There is no fact in their argument. Clearly, the China free trade agreement will create jobs for Australians and wealth for Australians. 


All through the coalition government, the approach is to good financial management that does not leave Australia like Greece. Australia has to pay off the debts that it runs up, but the Labor Party have no plan for that. We will do that. At the same time, we will continue to create new jobs, like the 17,000 jobs alone that were created just in August of this year. We will continue to encourage exports, encourage productivity in Australia and get Australia moving. One of the ways that we will do that, of course, is to bring a crooked union movement to account, and the royal commission is doing that. The Abbott and Turnbull governments have everything to be proud of in their economic management, unlike the Labor Party.

"Bullock, Sen Joseph",ALP,2015-09-15,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (16:26):  The mission of the Australian Labor Party is to defend and advance economic opportunity for the working people of this country and for their families. This is the economic leadership that our nation needs. 


Today, Australia is entering a new period of leadership under a new Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and we are entitled to ask what this leadership holds for working people. There are some important indicators of the substance of this leadership—rather than merely the style—which are worthy of drawing to the attention of the Australian people. Firstly, we have the perspective of our Treasurer, Mr Hockey, which he offered just yesterday. Before commenting on the outrageous disloyalty of some, he said, and I quote,


Mr Turnbull made a number of claims about economic leadership that are completely unfounded. He has never said to me or to the cabinet that we are heading in the wrong economic direction. 


So there it is from the Treasurer himself. Mr Turnbull has consistently endorsed the economic direction set out by Mr Hockey. He has endorsed the cuts to health. He has endorsed the cuts to education. He has endorsed the cuts to the ABC and SBS. He has endorsed all of the government's broken promises—the cuts to the dementia and severe behaviours supplement, the increased tax on petrol, the $100,000 university degrees and the attempts to further impoverish pensioners by cutting their indexation arrangements. All of the horrendous measures proposed by Mr Hockey in the government's 2014 budget, along with all of those measures which have been carried over into the 2015 budget, bear the Turnbull stamp of approval. 


So that is Mr Turnbull's past and his present, but what of his future? What is the guiding philosophy which will set the tone of his impending leadership of the nation? Helpfully, Mr Turnbull set out his philosophy in his victory speech last night, when he said words that will, hopefully, haunt him throughout the remaining few months of his purloined prime ministership. He said:


It will be a thoroughly Liberal Government committed to freedom, the individual and the market.


This is the Turnbull philosophy: a world of individuals freely striving alone against market forces, a world of individuals needing to be agile and to be more and more competitive to survive the buffeting of market forces, and a Darwinian world of self-interest and self-service in which only the fittest survive.


Mr Turnbull understands self-interest. As former Liberal Premier of Victoria Mr Kennett said yesterday of Mr Turnbull's challenge: 'It's about self-interest. It's not about community.' There, in a nutshell, is the difference between the economic leadership offered by the elitist Mr Turnbull and that which will be provided by a Shorten Labor government. Labor does not see a dog-eat-dog world of individuals in which the fittest survive. Labor sees the individual as a member of a family, as a member of the community and as a member of society. Labor seeks opportunities for people, for families and for society. Labor's vision is a big, broad, generous vision: leadership to take us forward as a society, not to advance one at the expense of another; economic leadership for the nation, not just for the few, the privileged, the winners—the people who believe that $100 million entitles you to the prime ministership.


Labor supports free trade while protecting Australian jobs. Labor wants to open the doors of educational opportunity, providing affordable training for the jobs of the future. Labor stands for fair taxation, recognising capacity to pay, not regressive arrangements favouring the rich, like increasing the GST to fund tax cuts for the wealthy while failing to close loopholes offering tax avoidance opportunities to multinational corporations. Labor stands for a fair day's pay with appropriate penalty rates for work at unsociable hours and for the right of unions to negotiate collectively for their members. Labor stands for a healthcare system accessible through Medicare, not through your credit card. Labor is prepared to meet the challenges of protecting our environment, not shy away from it. Labor stands for a modern communication system, not one cobbled together with copper wires. Labor stands for the many, not for the few; for the family, for society, not for the individual and the unrestrained market. Labor provides economic leadership for the whole nation, not just for Point Piper. As has been observed elsewhere, when choosing a model for leadership, 'We're all in this together' trumps 'You're on your own'. In closing, I trust the Australian community will come to respond to Mr Turnbull in the same way that Mr Kennett did yesterday when he said, 'I will never, ever, ever vote for Malcolm Turnbull', and then added, to avoid doubt, 'Ever.'

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:31):  The really lucky thing for Jeff Kennett, who is 'never, ever, ever, ever going to the vote for Malcolm Turnbull', is that unless he moves into the seat of Wentworth he is never going to have to.


It seems somewhat ironic that the matter of public importance that has been put on the Notice Paper by the Labor Party today is in relation to economic management. There is a certain irony in us being lectured by the Labor Party about economic leadership. I listened to Senator Bullock's contribution with great interest. I have a lot of respect for Senator Bullock's opinions and views on many things, and much of what he said I thought probably made an awful lot of sense. The only problem was that when his side were in government I do not think they delivered many of the things that Senator Bullock has just aspired for the Labor Party; they do not hold true. So while it was a fabulous ideological speech, I am not necessarily sure there was any substance in the delivery of it whatsoever. To be lectured by the Labor Party, a party that promised surplus after surplus after surplus after surplus and recorded nothing but deficit after deficit after debt after debt after deficit, does strike me as being rather extraordinary. It seems that the minute the coalition were elected to parliament and the Labor Party were removed to the opposition benches, they immediately forgot everything that they had done and have spent this whole time criticising us for things that we have done, even though much of the activity in the economic space during their watch had been nothing short of complete and utter abject disaster.


Many of the behaviours and actions of those opposite, following the election of the coalition government, were somewhat more mischievous than just sitting there throwing bricks at us. They actually stood in the way of approximately $5 billion worth of their own budget savings, savings that they had already put on the record prior to the election that they were intending to implement in order to deal with the issues of the debt and deficit, problems that I think the entire Australian public would be in no doubt whatsoever about—that is, that we have a problem with debt and deficit. To then come into this place and deny the incoming coalition government the opportunity to realise the savings that they had already put on the public record prior to the election was quite extraordinary.


Another thing I found extraordinary is the situation we have at the moment with ChAFTA. There is absolutely no doubt, as I said this morning and as I have probably said a thousand times since I arrived in this place, that Australia is an exporting nation. We are never going to get rich selling to ourselves, because we do not have the population or the capacity to sustain a population that will allow us to continue to sell to ourselves. So the most important thing that we can do in an economic management sense is to make sure that we develop our export markets so that Australian businesses can prosper in their manufacturing, in their production, and can sell overseas, because unless businesses in Australia are prosperous, there will be no jobs.


I acknowledge that the most important thing that we can do in Australia is to make sure that every Australian has a job. Most particularly it would be nice to think that every Australian could have a job that they liked, a job that was going to give them the economic prosperity, the lifestyle and the standard of living that all of us aspire to have. That is the bottom line, but we cannot deliver that unless we give the prosperity and the economic ability for growth and prosperity to businesses. To be standing in the way of the China free trade agreement, our largest trading partner in the world, is an absolute disgrace. To then come into this place today and criticise us about economic leadership—the economic leadership shown by those opposite was some of the worst that this country has ever seen. I probably would not trust the Labor Party to run a chook raffle when it came to economic management.


The track record of this government has been very good. There is certainly no doubt, and I do not think anybody in this place, no matter who they are, would not agree that we can always do better in the economic space, but what I would ask those opposite is to please allow us the opportunity to do better in this economic space. Allow us to implement the policies that we went to the Australian public with in 2013. Allow us to be able to give businesses incentives so that they can create the jobs and so that those jobs can go to the people who we all agree are the reason we actually govern this country. The coalition government has got a good track record. I agree we could have a better track record. I can say, for one, that I am very keen to work with this government to make sure that we increase the economic prosperity of this country.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (16:36):  We have heard a lot from the latest Prime Minister during the last 24 hours about economic leadership, but we have not heard a lot about what that phrase actually means. Australians are familiar with the opposite of economic leadership, of course, because that is what we have suffered for the last two years. Economic leadership is not a treasurer who spooks markets by releasing a press release every time he has had a thought bubble because he is not prepared to work up proper policy proposals. Economic leadership is not a prime minister or indeed a former prime minister who is so disengaged from the economy that he thinks a grocery code of conduct is an acceptable response to the challenge of the European debt crisis earlier this year. Economic leadership is not a communications minister, or a former communications minister, who claims to be interested in the opportunities presented by technology but who guts the NBN to ensure that Australian businesses have to face the challenges of the future using the technologies of the past. Economic leadership is not a small business minister who leaves the business community in a state of suspense about whether anti-competitive changes to competition law will or will not be enacted. Economic leadership is not a social services minister who lets youth unemployment climb to 19.1 per cent—the highest rate in 16 years—and then decides that the proper policy response is to punish young people by forcing them to live on nothing while they apply for the Newstart allowance. Economic leadership is not a government that is asleep at the helm whilst 781,000 Australians are out of work—a 13-year high—when GDP growth has contracted to just two per cent, when the budget deficit doubled in the last 12 months, and when consumer sentiment has slumped 15 per cent since the coalition came to office.


What does economic leadership look like? The government has a responsibility to create policy settings that enable businesses to grow and to create prosperity for the nation. But it needs to do this in a responsible and evidence-driven way that is clear and is communicated to all. That is the only way to avoid the capital strike that some commentators say is confronting our economy. That is a bare minimum of competent governance. But economic leadership requires much, much more.


The business community is not a single entity. It has marquee companies that benefit from existing regulations, and technological disrupters who want to change the status quo. It has price makers and price takers. It has importers and exporters. Economic leadership is about balancing those competing interests in a way that is fair. It is about investing in research and development so that we can provide Australian businesses and workers with the tools they need to be competitive in the future. Can we expect this from a man who supported $100,000 university degrees? Can we expect it from a man who was happy with the coalition government ripping millions of dollars from higher education and from science and research?


The economy consists of more than just business, as Senator Bullock has pointed out. It includes us as employees and as consumers. Economic leadership requires the benefits of growth and the fruits of prosperity to be distributed fairly. Can we expect this from a man who unhesitatingly endorsed a GP tax and cuts to hospitals and schools? Economic leadership may require decisions that cut across your political interests. It may require you to raise taxes on highly profitable companies that have the clout to run media campaigns. It may require you to cut benefits to wealthy people in your electorate. Can we expect this from a man whose own colleagues accuse him of having put himself first throughout his career? Can we expect principled decisions from a man who declared former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's climate policies to be 'bull', and now shows no inclination to change them once in power?


When the latest Prime Minister is called upon to show economic leadership, the loudest voices in his ears are going to be the voices of those who have the most to lose—the men who have a silver spoon firmly in their mouths. The question is: can we trust this man to make decisions for all Australians? Can we trust him to show economic leadership? History says no.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting of the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015 will ensure that the release of information by the Commissioner of Taxation under the income tax public disclosure laws does not jeopardise the privacy, personal security and market environments of Australian owned private companies.


The Government is committed to combatting tax avoidance and we are implementing well-considered and balanced measures.


As G20 President in 2014, Australia led the global response to tax avoidance by multinational companies and ensured that it remained at the top of the international agenda. Under Australia's leadership, the first of the G20/OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations were delivered last year. 


The Budget continued the Government's strong international leadership by actioning the 2014 G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations on Country-by-Country reporting, anti-hybrid rules, harmful tax practices, and treaty abuse rules.


Australia will implement the OECD's Country-by-Country reporting from 1 January 2016. We are one of the first countries to commit to implementing it.


Country-by-Country reporting to tax administrations will require large multinationals to report annually for each jurisdiction in which they do business the amount of revenue, profit, income tax and economic activity. For the first time tax administrations will get a global picture of multinationals' operations. This is a significant step in improving transparency for tax administrations. 


The Government has asked the Board of Tax to commence consultation on the implementation of the OECD's anti-hybrid rules.


Australia has no harmful tax practices, but the ATO has already commenced exchanging information with other tax administrations on preferential tax regimes. This will help the ATO identify secret tax deals provided to multinationals by other countries that may contribute tax avoidance in Australia.


On treaty abuse, the Government is acting now to incorporate the OECD's recommendations into Australia's treaty practice, so that multinationals do not exploit treaties to avoid tax.


The Government is also going further and faster than these BEPS recommendations. 


The Government released exposure draft legislation for the new Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law to stop multinationals artificially avoiding a taxable presence in Australia and force them to pay tax in Australia on profits from economic activities undertaken here. The legislation will be introduced shortly.


The Government will also double penalties for large companies that use tax avoidance and profit shifting schemes. 


We will close the tax loophole that currently means digital products and services imported by consumers are not subject to GST. Foreign providers will now be required to charge GST in the same way as domestic providers.


The Government has asked the Board of Taxation to work with businesses to develop a voluntary code for greater disclosure by companies of their tax information. I expect that the Board of Taxation will look at ways to provide more information to help inform the public about companies' tax information.


The Budget also announced that Australia will sign a multilateral international agreement to enable Common Reporting Standard information to be exchanged between tax administrations. This agreement was signed on the third of June.


The Common Reporting Standard will combat tax evasion by exposing taxpayers with hidden offshore investments. 


The Government has committed to implementing the Common Reporting Standard from 2017 and signing the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement is a further step towards implementation. 


These are all well-considered and balanced measures.


Labor's income tax public disclosure laws require the Commissioner of Taxation to publish the name and the Australian Business Number, total income, taxable income and tax payable of companies with total income of $100 million or more. 


In Opposition we opposed Labor's legislation because it got the balance wrong. 


These laws abrogate the fundamental right to confidentiality. The information to be disclosed, already in the hands of the Australian Taxation Office, will not help the ATO in assessing additional tax. 


Public disclosure of the information as Labor has legislated will not better inform the public and will not enhance the quality of debate and will provide a confusing picture.


Submissions on the measure before it was introduced by Labor highlighted the risk that disclosing the tax affairs of closely held companies will effectively disclose the tax affairs of the companies' owners. They also highlighted the risk of making public, the commercial in‑confidence information of private companies. 


The concerns about Labor's laws were also raised when this Government consulted on exposure draft legislation to carve-out Australian owned private companies. 


The concerns were not heeded by Labor.


We have taken them seriously. 


For closely held Australian owned private companies, the publication of company tax affairs would effectively reveal the owners' private financial affairs. 


In Japan, public disclosure of corporate tax information was required from 1950 until 2004. This disclosure was abolished in 2005 due to the information:


'being utilized in various ways inconsistent with its initial aim, and there are various reports of the disclosure being a factor in causing crimes and harassment…'


The Government will not trivialise or ignore the reputational or personal safety concerns from making public the confidential information of private companies. 


The Government's amendment will continue to ensure that publicly-listed companies and foreign owned private companies would continue to have information published, but it will ensure a balanced approach to the public disclosure of companies' tax affairs.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:48):  I relish joining this debate on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill. Senator Lambie was the last speaker on this just before question time. I am not quite sure who writes Senator Lambie's speeches, but I cannot believe that she believes the words she said in her speech—that this bank is like the Chinese military taking over the world or an attempt by the Chinese government to expand communism. I think those were the words she used.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I raise a point of order, Acting Deputy President. I would like clarification as to who Senator 'Lammie' is—perhaps you meant Senator Lambie, Senator Macdonald. I am not sure. But referring to people by their correct name would probably be helpful.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Lambie was, in her speech, likening the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill to the communist Chinese government expanding communism. I cannot believe that even Senator Lambie would believe that.


This bill will help Australia be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It provides the parliament's authority for Australia's involvement and also an appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Why do we want to become part of this bank? Why does Australia think that this is a good idea and wants to be part of it? It is because the establishment of this bank, and Australia's part in it, will be good for Australia and for Australian jobs. Following completion of all the necessary ratification processes, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the bank's depository, which is in China, and Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on the latter of the date of lodgement or on the day on which the bank is established. The commencement set out in the bill addresses the situation of the bill having received royal assent and the bank not yet having been established. That is provided for in the bill itself.


Once the bill does become law, Australia will be obligated to pay for the cost of our shareholding, of making our contribution to the ownership of the bank. Payments that Australia must make for subscription of shares of the capital stock of the bank are authorised by section 5. Section 7 authorises the consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the purposes of purchasing Australia's share subscription. That sets out the method by which Australia will become part of this bank process. Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion. That is about A$4½ billion, or a little bit more. It is part of the total of the approximately A$932 million paid up capital of the bank. The remaining US$2.9 billion will be callable capital, which is a contingent liability against the authority. The Treasurer, who is the responsible minister, may issue promissory notes and will have certain technical ways of providing the money for our investment in this bank.


It is important to understand how Australia benefits from becoming a member of this bank. The key benefit to our country is that the bank will improve infrastructure throughout the Asian region. That, of course, provides great opportunities for Australian trade and business. Our prosperity and our economic growth are very closely tied to the Asian region. That is of course why the coalition government has fought very hard to achieve remarkable success, I might say, in sealing and completing free trade agreements with Japan and Korea. And all credit to Mr Andrew Robb for the work he has done. I know that the previous Labor minister said that he was trying for six years to achieve those two free trade agreements. They never seemed to happen, so I am just a little surprised that effectively within 12 months of becoming the minster Mr Robb had been able to do the work and complete the agreement. We are very much part of Asia. We are very much part of this part of the world, and our free trade agreements conclusively prove and assist our involvement with all the countries of East Asia.


Regretfully, I have had to say in other debates today that I simply cannot understand the Labor Party's approach to the third of these very important free trade agreements, the free trade agreement that has been negotiated with one of the biggest economies in the world, China. Here we have a wonderful opportunity to increase trade, not just in goods but also in services, to a country that is already our biggest trading partner. The removal of tariffs both ways will increase that trade. Everybody knows what a huge economy it is, how many hundreds of millions of people there are in China, many of them moving into what is loosely described as the middle classes and wanting a better standard of accommodation, transport, clothing and, importantly for Australia, food. Here we have this great opportunity to increase this trade. I understand that very soon a bill will come before this parliament that will provide the mechanics of reducing tariffs and effectively ensuring the reduction of tariffs two ways in Australia's trade with China. That can only be good for Australia.


You have heard time and time again examples of how Australians have already made a mark in the Chinese markets, but those first steps, as we could call them, are certain to multiply with the endorsement of this free trade agreement. If, by chance, the Labor Party is able to convince the Greens political party and enough of the crossbenchers that this is not a good deal, then not only will that prevent Australia from having the wonderful opportunities that the free trade agreement would provide but also it will be, quite frankly—and I do not like saying this—an insult to the Chinese negotiators who have made concessions to Australia to get us to where we are at. I note that Mr Robb said some other time that if the deal does not go ahead this time then there may not be another time.


Again, the Senate has heard any number of times just how important it is that this free trade arrangement is completed through the parliamentary process prior to the end of this year. If it is not, the concessions that we get on tariffs will be put back another year. That will make us that much less competitive with our competitors in the goods and services we export than we are this year. So, it is absolutely essential that we do that. And if you ask any farmer, anyone in the service industries, they will tell you the absolutely essential nature of immediate action on this free trade bill.


It has been inquired to death. It has been looked at by everybody, and everybody in this chamber, with the exception of the Labor Party, seems to think it is a good idea. It is not a political issue because like the coalition, most of the luminaries in the Labor Party—such as Hawke, Keating, Bob Carr and the premiers of the various Labor states—support the free trade agreements. It is completely ridiculous and it is difficult to understand why the Labor Party in this chamber are opposing the free trade agreement. 


The Labor Party talk about certain provisions for allowing workers in that will not have Australian standards, and this has been said time and time again on the public record—here in this chamber and in question time—but it has been proven to be a lie, a furphy and a complete misinterpretation of the facts. Do not take the words of Senator Abetz or of Senator Payne about this; take the words of Bob Hawke, of Bob Carr, of Premier Weatherill and of the Premier of Victoria—they are the ones that are saying it. Why are they saying that? Because they know that the provisions relating to employment are the same in these agreements as they were in one of the agreements that the Australian Labor Party managed to sign up with one of the South American countries during their term of office. They are exactly the same as the Labor Party has used, so why are they opposed to it? I hate to think it and I certainly do not believe it myself, but tell me another reason apart from being the old White Australia policy coming back into the Labor Party. I am sure that is not the way, but I cannot see any other reason why the Labor Party, in this chamber in particular, oppose it. 


This Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank bill brings us closer to Asia and provides those opportunities for Australian trade and business, just like the free trade agreements. Not only does greater infrastructure and investment mean greater demand for Australian commodities, such as metals, and not only does it mean greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets, but it will also create new opportunities for Australian companies. The bill also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy, along with up to 55 other member countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which include India, Korea, France and other major economies. 


The question has been raised: will Australian companies be able to be bid for projects? Of course, the answer is yes. The bank will have an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country—not just the member countries—can bid for contracts. Australia, as a member of the bank, will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to Australian companies. If Australian companies can take advantage of those opportunities, then that means jobs for Australians and wealth for Australia. And who could be opposed to that? Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so we are pretty well positioned. We have a track record to be able to make strong bids for contracts from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


Some people have asked me whether the bank would be able to invest in Australia. According to the articles agreement, that is not precluded. However, I would expect that the bank will initially focus on infrastructure in developing countries in the Asian region, where it will be able to play a more important role in encouraging private-sector funding, financing and infrastructure. 


I have previously mentioned what Australia's investment and contribution will be. I understand from the bill that the authorised capital is some US$100 billion and about US$20 billion is being paid in. Clearly, it is a move that will be very much in Australia's interest because we are an important player in this East-Asia region. Any development of infrastructure in any of the countries in this region can only be good for the region and consequently good for Australia. 


Those of us who have had the privilege of travelling in the Asia-Pacific region understand that, whilst some Asian countries have some of the very best infrastructure going—have a look at some of the trains in Japan for example, and while I have never been to China I believe some of their trains are very good too—other Asian countries are not quite so fortunate at the present time. There is clearly a lot that can be done in the way of infrastructure. We all know that infrastructure builds the economy. That is why, I might say as an aside, the coalition government has placed such significant importance on infrastructure in northern Australia. Although I would not classify northern Australia in the same category as some of the developing countries in Asia, clearly northern Australia is a part of our country that could well do with significant infrastructure investment. The northern Australian White Paper launched by the coalition government in June makes that commitment. In fact, it not only makes that commitment but also it provided the money for it in this year's budget. 


As a nation we understand that infrastructure is important to grow the country, to grow the economy, to create jobs, to create wealth and to make Australia a better place and the living standards of all Australians even better. The same applies to infrastructure investment in Asia, not only because it is good economic sense but because as a global citizen in this part of the world Australia wants to do the right thing by providing funding for infrastructure in the Asian region.


I do not think time is going to allow me to tell the Senate of some of the third-party endorsements—from people like the Chair of Industry Super Australia, Mr Peter Collins; the executive director of the Business Council of Australia; or the group chief executive of the Australian Industry Group—but all of them are on record as strongly supporting Australia's investment in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


It is said that the investment will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be applied to projects financed by the bank. It provides new opportunities to deploy capital as well as to export the funds know-how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects, and that is very, very important for Australia. The resources of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will increase the scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long-term productive assets in this region. Australia, like Asia, is dealing with challenges in the area of infrastructure and others. This bank will help meet them, and I am delighted that Australia will be part of that. I commend this bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:09):  Last night, a billion people around the world went to bed hungry, many of them children, most of them in our region, and tonight they will go to bed hungry again. The reason why I support so strongly the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 is that it is a mechanism by or a conduit through which Australia can play a role in reducing that frightful figure of a billion people going to bed this evening without having had sufficient food. We will have 1.9 billion more people in this region by 2050—again, a challenge Australia can be part of in terms of a solution. I do not want to focus just on China, but it is illustrative of Asia. In Indonesia, the figures can be similar, as they can for other countries within the Asian region.


You and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson—you, in your case, having come from Western Australia originally and me, in my case, still coming from Western Australia—understand very clearly the fact that our state is Asia centric, whereas most of the east coast is still Pacific centric. Fifty per cent of the world's population now live within two hours of either side of Western Australia's time zone. We already play a significant role in this country, and this bill and the actions that flow from it will give us the opportunity to play an even more significant role.


I turn to China for a moment to speak about urbanisation. In the last 15 years, they have gone from being 35 per cent urban to 50 per cent urban and, in another 15 years, they will go to 65 per cent urban. They do not have sufficient land or sufficient water to be able to provide nourishment for their people. Using China as an example again, because it speaks to the importance of our involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, in the 10 years of the presidency of Hu Jintao, the per capita income in China went from US$1,000 per year to US$5,000 per year—from US$1,000 to US$5,000 in 10 years. The last time there was a fivefold increase in per capita income anywhere in the world was during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and that took 100 years, not 10. Therein lies the challenge. 


What is the impact of this? As we all know, it is an increased demand for protein foods over staple foods as a community of people move higher socioeconomically, into the middle class, and an absolute emphasis on safe food and the reliable supply of food. Military leaders around the world have said since time immemorial that people go to war when there is a fear of inadequate, unsafe food and a lack of water—examples of which exist today. People want a better lifestyle. We saw this in the 10 years I spent working in India, where there was a burgeoning development of the middle class. It leads to a greater demand for services and a greater demand for better government management of the people's needs. Again, India is a prime example. In the city of Mumbai, no building has access to water 24 hours a day. Every building, be it a house, a leading hotel or a business, has a water tank on top so they get water for a certain number of hours a day, and power—unreliable power.


Why do I make these points so strongly? It is because Asia faces a major infrastructure financing gap estimated to be worth US$8 trillion over the next decade, and this Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will be the mechanism by which we and they can start to address these issues. For water, including harvesting water, storing water, delivering water and ensuring water is safe for potable purposes and of course for irrigation and others; and for power, including generation of power, distribution of power, safe and economical consumption of power—all these require infrastructure. 


When we speak of the delivery of goods, a statistic that is not commonly known but should be is that it is estimated that more than 40 per cent of all food produced in the world is not consumed—40 per cent of food produced in the world is not consumed—due to poor delivery; poor infrastructure; poor storage, such as a lack of refrigeration so the food spoils; poor transport; vermin, such as rats; or being wasted. And our own developed world is no orphan, as we know, when it comes to the food wastage that comes out of our own homes. This is not just a developing world problem or an underdeveloped world problem. But what it does point to is the need for infrastructure, the need for supply chains, the need for logistics and the need for investment. 


You can go further and talk about the development of ports: the efficient and safe movement of goods into a port, through the port, into the supply chain, into storage, into transport—if it is refrigerated or if it is perishable—and on its way to the end consumer. Those of us who have travelled throughout Asia understand very well where those challenges lie. 


I want to give recognition to Treasurer Joe Hockey in this whole process. It is Hockey who has led Australia's drive to be part of the inauguration of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. He understands that our prosperity and economic growth in this country are closely tied to the region. I just made the point about our own state of Western Australia and of course it flows through to other states and territories. Senator Macdonald expanded that to the entire north of our country and the opportunity—magnitudes of orders of opportunity into the future. Hockey makes the point that it is important—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  I will pull you up on it this time, Senator Back. You need to address members by their titles: Mr Hockey or Minister Hockey. 




Senator BACK:
  I will. I will say 'the excellent Treasurer'.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, the point of order is that Senator Back has consistently called the Treasurer 'Hockey'. I know that the Treasurer is on the outer and I know that the Treasurer will not be the Treasurer for very long, but he at least deserves the proper title. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, thank you, Senator Cameron. I had already pulled up Senator Back. 




Senator BACK:
  That less than helpful contribution should be ignored, Mr Acting Deputy President. I certainly do give Mr Hockey the accolade and the acclaim, because it was him that saw the importance of us joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


Senator Cameron will be delighted to learn that on 29 June this year, Mr Hockey, the excellent Treasurer of Australia, gave effect to the government's commitment to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank by being the first person in the world—I am going to repeat that in case Senator Cameron needs to write it down—the first person in the world to sign the bank's articles of agreement in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. His signature was followed by representatives of 49 other countries. What a great legacy for that great man. Mr Hockey said:


The decision to join the bank was made following extensive consultations with key partners inside the Asian region and outside the Asian region. This included participating on negotiations on the bank's design with 56 other prospective founding member countries. 


It is important to understand that we are the fifth-largest regional shareholder in the bank. In that sense Australia, through the excellence of Mr Hockey, will be able to influence the bank's decisions and strategic direction. 


The question was asked in earlier contributions today—I am not sure if it was you, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, or Senator Lambie—about what governance processes were in place. I believe, since you are nodding, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it may have been you. So I have availed myself of this opportunity to inform the Senate of this.


In March of this year the government made clear that the key issues to be resolved before Australia could commit to join the AIIB were that the bank's board of directors would have control over key investment decisions and that no country—and I hope Senator Lambie's staff are listening because she made the observation that China in some way would have some massive influence—will dominate the bank or the decisions of the directors. So, in announcing our decision to sign the articles of agreement in June, again that excellent Treasurer, Mr Hockey, noted that all these criteria have been met and that the governance will be based on best practice, ensuring that all members will be directly involved in the direction and decision making of the bank in an open and transparent matter. I hope that is further discussed when we come to look at some of the amendments. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, why do we need to be involved? I cannot go further than the comments of industry leaders. Peter Collins, the chair of Industry Super Australia, made the observation:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


He also made the observation that not only will they 'provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export the funds know-how in connecting funds services and savings to bankable projects'. There you have Australian super. I am sure Senator Sinodinos will correct me if I am wrong, but if already have the second-largest or third-largest pool of superannuation investment in the world, and we are rushing to become the second-largest, if not the largest. To have an acknowledgment and an endorsement from the chair of Industry Super Australia has to be seen as a very valuable point. I hope it is a point that is not lost on members of this chamber when they finally come to consider this. 


The Business Council of Australia, Chief Executive Officer, Jennifer Westacott, welcomed the government's decision to join the bank as a founding member. She made the point that Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of the body, and decisions it will make to finance projections that address Australia's infrastructure gaps. She obviously realises that Australian companies will benefit from the opportunities to participate in developing and building new bank financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade. As we all know, we are a massive exporter. Our own state exports 95 per cent of the grain it produces. We cannot consume it. We have the land mass of continental America excluding Alaska, and we have the population of Greater New York. I just do not know where those who stand up in this place and talk about Australia not needing to be actively engaged in the world of export get off. I just do not know who they think is going to consume the produce that has made this country great, and will go on making it even greater. 


Putting to one side for a moment commodities, which of course will be 99.9 per cent free trade once the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is in place, the big point that has attracted China to Australia with this FTA is our services sector. Ten years ago, when the negotiations started under the Howard government for the China free trade agreement, the emphasis was on commodities. The Chinese now see themselves going past America as the leading economy in the world but they know they are deficient in a range of areas—in the services sector particularly, and they recognise Australia as a country that may be able to provide those services. How wonderful it will be for us in our employment, in our university sectors, to be able to produce graduates and continue to work in services sectors such as corporate governance, prudential regulation, banking and finance, insurances and extending beyond that. Minister Robb is another excellent trade minister—probably the best in our history; nobody else has produced three free trade agreements within two years—and as he says—




Senator Cameron:
  A dud.




Senator BACK:
  A dud? I would say, judging from Senator Cameron's appraisals of people, reference to Minister Robb being a dud would be the highest praise that could be accorded.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I did not call Minister Robb a dud—I said the agreement was a dud. But I can add the minister to it if you like.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, that is not a point of order.




Senator BACK:
  Senator Cameron has allowed me time to take a small libation, for which I thank him.




Senator Bilyk:
  A what?




Senator BACK:
  A drink. Minister Robb was telling us—this will be very interesting to people from Tasmania, too, because there are some very good private health providers in Tasmania—that, for the first time, under this free trade agreement, and of course Senator Sinodinos is well aware of this, an Australian-based company could purchase land, build an aged care facility, staff it, manage it and repatriate the funds back to Australia. The same thing could be repeated in the hospitality industry or, for example, in the higher education sector. So there are opportunities in the services sector of the free trade agreement. You might ask where this is relevant to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and it is relevant because it is building up that level of confidence and that level of interoperability between our Asian neighbours and ourselves, which indeed goes towards complementing this whole activity. 


We do know that some in America were concerned about the decision that Australia was making to participate in and become a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is all well and good, but again the question was asked by you, Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, when you made your contribution: will this provide the opportunity for Australian investment in infrastructure in Asia. An example is the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge that was completed in 1994—I believe Mr Keating may have been the Prime Minister at the time—a structure funded by Australia and built by that wonderful Western Australian company John Holland Construction. The impact that that bridge has had socially, culturally, economically and commercially on the border between Laos and Thailand has been phenomenal. It reminds me to make the observation that, because of the intertwining of aid and trade at that time, Thailand was a recipient country—it was receiving aid. But because of the focus of that aid partially at least on the trade space, we now see Thailand no longer as an aid dependent country but as a contributor. That surely must be the goal we move towards. How will this be partially funded? Through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


Often there is criticism in this place about the efforts of Foreign Minister Bishop, arguably the best foreign minister this country has ever had, certainly for the last decade or so. Minister Bishop's focus in the aid space is twofold.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I am sure Senator Cameron will want to take notes so he will not make a fool of himself in the future. The first aim is to allocate 20 per cent of the aid budget specifically into the aid for trade sector, emphasising the opportunity for people in developing countries not just to be given aid, not just to be given the fish, but to be taught how to fish. As has happened with Thailand, they can be moved out of that dependence on aid. The second has been the initiative of Minister Bishop, led by Bloomberg, the recently retired mayor of New York, to put together a group who can look at the effectiveness and efficiency of aid expenditure around the world, using Australia as a pilot and hopefully extending that to get much better value for aid recipients.


I am delighted and proud to support this bill and to urge my colleagues in the Senate to give it their full support for the 40- to 50- to 100-year future of our relationship with Asia.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator SINODINOS

 (
New South Wales
) (
17:30
):  I rise to speak on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. I take the opportunity, as Senator Back has done, to commend the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, for his sponsorship of this proposal. I think he was an early supporter of it. I do not think it is disclosing any secrets to say that the government initially had some reservations about being a founding member of the bank. Those reservations reflected discussions with some of our allies, such as the United States and Japan. However, the decision was taken by the government under the leadership of Tony Abbott, by Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey, to be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


I think that is a good decision. Towards the end of last year I was in Singapore and met with senior government officials, including at their central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It was clear to me that they thought it was important that they be a founding member of the bank. They said it would be good if we were a founding member of the bank as well. They put the argument that if you are on the ground floor of a new institution like this you have a capacity to influence its governance and structure. There had been reservations about the governance and structure of this institution. I will come back to that later in my speech. But overriding all of those considerations and, I think, the fundamental reason that the Australian government decided to be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, is that it is a further evolution of the role of China in the region. It shows China extending its influence in the region, being a player in the region and promoting economic development and growth in the region. 


That is important. From a geopolitical perspective it is really important that we continue to encourage China to engage not only in this region but globally and, therefore, to increase its commitment and stake in the global rules of engagement. That is very important. We often express some concern about what will happen to the rules of engagement on trade and investment—which we have had largely since World War II and which were largely a product of American power, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region—if other countries, like China, start to become more important. Will they change the rules of engagement to benefit themselves, and will that be at the expense of other smaller economies, including Australia? 


We have come at that in a number of ways. The first is, obviously, to reaffirm our strong alliances in the region and to continue to encourage the United States to engage constructively in the region. But we have also done it by promoting economic development and growth in the region; not only because that will benefit us, but also because rising incomes in those countries and rising engagement in the global economy will encourage amity and cooperation in the region. 


From a geopolitical perspective it is very important that we encourage China in these multilateral regional initiatives. It is very important that we engage constructively with China, so I am very happy to support what Australia, under the guidance of the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, is undertaking to do in this particular context of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


The word 'infrastructure' is in the title advisedly. The Chinese have identified a significant infrastructure gap in the region. It is estimated to be US$8 trillion in Asia in this decade alone. This is a product of economic growth and the need to produce new infrastructure. Infrastructure is very important. Economic infrastructure, in particular, increases your capacity to produce goods and services. It lays the basis for economic growth and development and for rising incomes. This infrastructure gap arises because economic growth is proceeding apace in the region. We need to address the financing gap that opens up as a result. This financing gap can be addressed over time through a combination of public and private contributions. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will mobilise capital in the region, drawing on government contributions, in order to help fill at least part of this gap. 


In this context I commend the work that Mr Hockey has done in the context of the G20, where, last year, under the presidency of Australia, the G20 endorsed the idea of a global infrastructure hub. The Global Infrastructure Hub will be based in Sydney and will be a clearing house for experience in addressing infrastructure issues, including matters like public-private partnerships and how to facilitate cross-border cooperation in developing and building infrastructure. That Global Infrastructure Hub is underway. It will be located in Australia and it will complement some of what we are doing here. 


We must remember that, when we talk about promoting infrastructure, it is very important to note that we must not always categorise all debt as being bad. There are contexts where providing debt financing, which can be serviced in due course, can be a very appropriate thing to do, as you would understand from your own background, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson. We should not be afraid of that. The question is always the rules under which it is done, so we can promote sound investment decisions to get the sort of returns which are needed in order to justify the investment and provide the funds for future investment.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has identified a gap in that regard. It is classified as a multilateral development bank. It is a quasi-commercial bank. What is meant there is that it is neither purely a commercial operation—it is not just a commercial bank which would crowd out private investment—nor purely an aid agency which would provide concessionary finance, grant finance or whatever. What it seeks to do is to earn minimal returns—at least in the sense of breaking even—but some returns in order that it can fill the gap in financing which exists on the continuum between purely aid focused projects and purely commercial projects. It plays a catalytic role. That is, I think, very important. It can play a role in catalysing private investment by topping it up. It can play a role in filling the gap that we have identified in getting infrastructure underway which may not be purely private infrastructure. In other words, it may not be infrastructure that benefits only one particular party that is building it. You could argue then that they capture the private benefits of that infrastructure, so they should pay for all of it. But there will be infrastructure which will have spillover benefits, or benefits which are not captured just by one group—common user infrastructure, for example. That is a good example of where having a group like this can help to fill the financing gap. That is very important. This bank will play an important part in helping to fill that infrastructure gap.


There were some concerns expressed earlier about structure and governance issues to do with the bank. These revolved around issues as to the extent to which the Chinese would have influence over the operations of the bank. It is true to say that for some aspects of the work of the bank there will be a veto. China will have veto power on issues that require a supermajority vote, such as the board, the president and the capital as well as the major operational and financial policies. But issues such as the acceptance of new members and ordinary loan decisions will not require a supermajority. And this particular veto power has been scaled back. I think this is recognition by China that it needed to make its proposal more palatable than might otherwise have been the case, and it may in part have been a reaction to some of the scepticism of the US, Japan and others. I commend the Chinese for being sensitive in that regard.


I spoke about the infrastructure gap in the region. For us the benefits of filling that gap will include a demand for commodities as new infrastructure is rolled out. That in itself is one level of demand. More importantly in a longer run sense, higher incomes in those countries will lead to more demand for a whole slew of Australian goods and services, potentially not just those involving Australian mineral and energy resources. That is very important. So there are benefits in terms of trade opportunities. There are investment opportunities in the sense that there is a capacity for the bank to invest in Australia as well. Interestingly, that could be a conduit for more investment in infrastructure related, for example, to what we are seeking to do in Northern Australia through our Northern Australia policy, which is to promote the development of Northern Australia by working with the Western Australian, Northern Territory and Queensland governments to put together infrastructure projects which will open some of those territories to more economic development. That could be a very important development. It could be a conduit for Chinese investment in Australia, done in a way which may not carry the same connotations as other forms of Chinese investment here do. And of course there will be a capacity for Australian companies to bid for procurement on major projects which are being sponsored and financed by the bank. That is a big opportunity, because from what we understand the procurement process will be a competitive one and we will be able to participate in all of that.


So this infrastructure bank provides an opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy, along with 55 other member countries including India, Korea, the UK, Germany and France. It is very significant that European countries have seen this as an opportunity to participate. They recognise not only, clearly, the rise of China but also the importance of direct engagement. I have always believed that direct engagement is the best way to get other countries to understand you better and to understand them better. That is to the benefit of everybody. We will be committing, in Australian dollar terms, $932 million to the bank. Apart from the benefits I mentioned earlier, it should be noted that, consistent with the budget treatment of Australia's contributions to the other international financial institutions, Australia's paid-in capital will be treated as an investment. It does not come at the cost of other government spending, in that sense, and does not directly add to the budget deficit. So we are not talking here about a situation where we are potentially diverting spending from other, more useful, social purposes.


I mentioned earlier that Australian companies will be able to bid for projects. There will be what is called an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country—not just member countries—can bid for contracts. Australia as a member of the bank will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to our companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks such as the Asian Development Bank, so they will be well positioned to make strong bids for contracts from this bank. Australian companies have built up a bank of knowledge in bidding for contracts with the Asian Development Bank and others, and that gives us a capacity to understand the needs of these international financial institutions. That will stand us in good stead, I believe, in bidding in the region. One other area where we can potentially also benefit is in sharing our expertise when it comes to infrastructure financing. Financial institutions such as Macquarie Bank have over the years pioneered all sorts of infrastructure financing models. It would be interesting to see the extent to which they can be adapted for the purposes of the region.


I need in my remarks to also cover a broader issue to do with our relationship with China, which is that we have recently, of course, also been negotiating and have concluded negotiations on a major free trade agreement with China. So what we see is Australia broadening and deepening our relationship with China, giving us the capacity to influence them in a way which could be very useful to the region as a whole. We are in the region, but in some ways we are seen as a bridge to other countries.


I remember working in the Howard government when we were bidding for major gas projects in China. Australian companies were bidding against British and other companies. What was important then was that the Chinese not only thought of us as potentially a major supplier of all sorts of different resources and commodities, but also saw the awarding of contracts to Australian companies as a way of sending us a signal that they saw us a valued partner in the region, an interlocutor who could also have influence with other partners in the region and outside the region, including the United States. Sometimes the Chinese used the Australian channel to get messages to our alliance partners.


There are a number of levels on which our relationship with China is developing. We have the free trade agreement. We have investment in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. On top of that we have the people-to-people movements: the ways in which we are reforming our international education to make it as good as it can be and having high-quality national education to make the experience as good as it can be in Australia. Now, particularly with a lower dollar, our tourism sector is really starting to revive and be stimulated. The Chinese will also play a major role in that regard.


The need to generate returns at the bank raises a key question regarding how the bank will balance its funding of infrastructure projects with practical considerations. Infrastructure development is known for long funding cycles, low interest rates and the potential for waste and corruption. If the bank is to grant loans that other banks reject for good reasons, it would assume major risks, especially in less developed Asian countries with volatile domestic economies and unstable governments. How the recipients will repay loans is a major question for any bank, including this bank. But I am heartened that the governance and structure being put in place will give the bank a capacity to draw on the experience of other multilateral development banks in particular. As I said before, because they will operate not to seek high returns but to break even or to earn minimal profits, they will have that quasi-commercial focus, which I think will allow them to very well fill a gap that has opened up in the infrastructure financing chain.


With regard to our relationship with China more broadly, let me also say that it is clear from the way the Chinese economy is now developing that the rebalancing which is underway means that there will be an increasing focus in China itself on economic growth being driven by consumption rather than infrastructure investment and exports. China has had a very significant and very impressive export led growth model, but that is changing. They are rebalancing their economy to put more focus on consumption. That will also lead, of course, to greater demand for a whole array of goods and services from countries like Australia. We are well placed to meet much of that demand, not just because of the free trade agreement but also because of the wide array of goods and services produced by the Australian economy. I think it is very important that we do what we can to continue to promote the competitiveness of our economy, because while we are very good at producing a whole array of goods—whether you go through the agricultural chain, where we are very efficient in physical terms, or you go through to a whole array of advanced services that we are now able to generate—it is very important for us to maintain our competitiveness in the region. As I have said so many times, our competitors in the region are not waiting for us to be competitive. They continue to be competitive and to increase their competitiveness. They face their own pressures. In many ways we need to run faster just to stay in the one spot.



It is very important for us to recognise that when we contribute to these sorts of international organisations—even though we will be eligible in terms of being able to bid for the procurement on projects—we have to be competitive, not just drawing on our experience in dealing with other multilateral development banks but also recognising that we need to be innovative, we need to be productive and we need to keep our costs under control so that we can be cost-effective, have an edge and maintain an edge over our competitors. That whole innovation agenda is a topic for another day, but that is an important part of being a good partner— (Time expired)

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

Senator SCULLION:
  I was not sure whether or not they were going to be dealt with in committee now.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We have to finish the second reading debate. I will then call for a vote on the second reading amendment.




Senator SCULLION:
  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. In summation, this bill is necessary for Australia to become a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This new international financial institution will drive economic growth and jobs in our region by funding major infrastructure projects. Australia's prosperity and economic growth is closely tied to the region. Australia's economy will benefit from improved infrastructure in Asia. Over 70 per cent of our merchandise exports go to the Asian region. Australia's membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and stronger economies in Asia will provide great opportunities for Australian trade and business. I look forward to the day when the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank might invest in infrastructure here at home. I commend this bill to the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Whish-Wilson be agreed to.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:12):  I would like to have been at the JSCOT briefing yesterday—I might not be asking these questions if I had been—but, unfortunately, I was away on other business. The Greens certainly like the concept of what is being proposed here, but it seems as though there is blind faith here—that we are suspending belief and saying we assume it is all going to be fine. It would be very good to have further guidance on a number of issues. Can you give us an idea of whether the immunity provisions relate to, for example, the conduct of employees in relation to bribery? And how are standards in the bank set if no individual country can pursue action against, for example, individual employees who might be acting in a corrupt way?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:13):  Article 50(1) basically says that governors, directors, alternates, the President, the Vice-President and other officers and employees of the bank, including experts and consultants, shall be immune from legal process with respect to the acts performed by them in their official capacity, except when the bank waives immunity, and shall enjoy the inviolability of all their official papers, documents and records. That is not clear to me. In fact, it looks like they will be immune. That is the reason we put this amendment up, which I will get to in a minute. And with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, I would have thought there was room for the government to include provisions in the bill relating to some of these issues. I suppose that is not a question; it is more of a statement. I have just a couple of very direct questions and we can get through this fairly quickly. Would the government consider the establishment of any triggers for withdrawal from the bank? The reason I ask this question is that we do not have the information with us to make the decisions on some of these very important factors. Would you put in place a trigger or a clause for withdrawal from the bank should certain preconditions not be met around ethical investing, environmental and labour safeguards or other issues in relation to impropriety, illegal or fraudulent conduct et cetera by employees?

In relation to strategy, Senator Sinodinos was talking about how it was not purely an aid agency and it was not purely a commercial bank; it had a catalytic role.

 (New South Wales) (18:17):  I want to ask you just to clarify again—if you have not done so already: under article 46.1 of the bank's Articles of Agreement:


The Bank shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process, except in cases arising out of or in connection with the exercise of its powers to raise funds, through borrowings or other means, to guarantee obligations, or to buy and sell or underwrite the sale of securities …


So I understand there are certain immunities relating to the operation of the bank. What is the issue of general criminal law in relation to officers of the bank?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  On that note, Chairman Marshall, I think Senator Cameron summed up our position very well with that last statement. I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7764:


(1) Clause 3, page 3 (lines 5 to 9), omit:


Regulations may confer privileges and immunities on:


   (a) the Bank; and


   (b) officers and employees of the Bank; and


   (c) experts and consultants performing missions or services for the Bank.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-09-15,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:19):  Labor will be opposing this amendment on sheet 7764 on the basis that these privileges and immunities are consistent with those conferred to other institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. These privileges and immunities allow the bank and its officers to operate consistent with the articles of the bank and notwithstanding they may be undertaking work in areas of uncertainty, including in weak states or where rule of law is not consistently upheld.


Clause 8 of the bill states that regulations may confer privileges and immunities on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, officers and employees of the bank and consultants performing services for the bank. Clause 8(1) specifies that privileges and immunities necessary or desirable to give effect to chapter 9 of the bank's Articles of Agreement may be conferred on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank by the regulations. In chapter 9, articles 44 to 52 of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's Articles of Agreement set out the status, immunities, privileges and exemptions that must be given to the bank by each Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank member state. This means, for example, that the bank is recognised as having international legal personality, which means that this organisation possesses international rights and duties. That is article 45. It also means that the bank will enjoy immunity from every form of the legal process except in cases arising out of, or in conjunction with, the exercise of its powers to raise funds through borrowings or other means to guarantee obligations or to buy and sell or underwrite the sale of securities. That is article 46.1, which I spoke about earlier.


I note again the commitment given that the bank's officers or employees will still be subject to the general laws of the country. I note that this matter was addressed in the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which identified that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its Alert Digest sought clarification on two matters: the nature of the proposed immunities and privileges as set out in clause 8 of the bill, and why these immunities and privileges are set out in regulation and not in the bill.


These are matters that were also canvassed at the hearing of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee last night, where interested senators had the opportunity to explore this matter further. I note that the Greens did not participate in the hearing. The officials present at the hearing last night advised the Economics Committee that conferring immunities and privileges is similar to that for comparable institutions. The Treasurer also advised the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee that the immunities and privileges conferred by the bill were consistent with those of other multilateral development banks, stating:


The nature of the proposed privileges and immunities are consistent with privileges and immunities afforded to the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Australia is a member of both of these multilateral development banks.


The opposition is satisfied with this explanation, although it would be useful if the minister could explain to the Committee of the Whole why these immunities and privileges are set out in regulations and not in the bill.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:48):  I relish joining this debate on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill. Senator Lambie was the last speaker on this just before question time. I am not quite sure who writes Senator Lambie's speeches, but I cannot believe that she believes the words she said in her speech—that this bank is like the Chinese military taking over the world or an attempt by the Chinese government to expand communism. I think those were the words she used.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I raise a point of order, Acting Deputy President. I would like clarification as to who Senator 'Lammie' is—perhaps you meant Senator Lambie, Senator Macdonald. I am not sure. But referring to people by their correct name would probably be helpful.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  There is no point of order.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Lambie was, in her speech, likening the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill to the communist Chinese government expanding communism. I cannot believe that even Senator Lambie would believe that.


This bill will help Australia be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. It provides the parliament's authority for Australia's involvement and also an appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Why do we want to become part of this bank? Why does Australia think that this is a good idea and wants to be part of it? It is because the establishment of this bank, and Australia's part in it, will be good for Australia and for Australian jobs. Following completion of all the necessary ratification processes, Australia will lodge its instrument of ratification with the bank's depository, which is in China, and Australia's membership of the bank will become effective on the latter of the date of lodgement or on the day on which the bank is established. The commencement set out in the bill addresses the situation of the bill having received royal assent and the bank not yet having been established. That is provided for in the bill itself.


Once the bill does become law, Australia will be obligated to pay for the cost of our shareholding, of making our contribution to the ownership of the bank. Payments that Australia must make for subscription of shares of the capital stock of the bank are authorised by section 5. Section 7 authorises the consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated for the purposes of purchasing Australia's share subscription. That sets out the method by which Australia will become part of this bank process. Australia's total shareholding will be US$3.7 billion. That is about A$4½ billion, or a little bit more. It is part of the total of the approximately A$932 million paid up capital of the bank. The remaining US$2.9 billion will be callable capital, which is a contingent liability against the authority. The Treasurer, who is the responsible minister, may issue promissory notes and will have certain technical ways of providing the money for our investment in this bank.


It is important to understand how Australia benefits from becoming a member of this bank. The key benefit to our country is that the bank will improve infrastructure throughout the Asian region. That, of course, provides great opportunities for Australian trade and business. Our prosperity and our economic growth are very closely tied to the Asian region. That is of course why the coalition government has fought very hard to achieve remarkable success, I might say, in sealing and completing free trade agreements with Japan and Korea. And all credit to Mr Andrew Robb for the work he has done. I know that the previous Labor minister said that he was trying for six years to achieve those two free trade agreements. They never seemed to happen, so I am just a little surprised that effectively within 12 months of becoming the minster Mr Robb had been able to do the work and complete the agreement. We are very much part of Asia. We are very much part of this part of the world, and our free trade agreements conclusively prove and assist our involvement with all the countries of East Asia.


Regretfully, I have had to say in other debates today that I simply cannot understand the Labor Party's approach to the third of these very important free trade agreements, the free trade agreement that has been negotiated with one of the biggest economies in the world, China. Here we have a wonderful opportunity to increase trade, not just in goods but also in services, to a country that is already our biggest trading partner. The removal of tariffs both ways will increase that trade. Everybody knows what a huge economy it is, how many hundreds of millions of people there are in China, many of them moving into what is loosely described as the middle classes and wanting a better standard of accommodation, transport, clothing and, importantly for Australia, food. Here we have this great opportunity to increase this trade. I understand that very soon a bill will come before this parliament that will provide the mechanics of reducing tariffs and effectively ensuring the reduction of tariffs two ways in Australia's trade with China. That can only be good for Australia.


You have heard time and time again examples of how Australians have already made a mark in the Chinese markets, but those first steps, as we could call them, are certain to multiply with the endorsement of this free trade agreement. If, by chance, the Labor Party is able to convince the Greens political party and enough of the crossbenchers that this is not a good deal, then not only will that prevent Australia from having the wonderful opportunities that the free trade agreement would provide but also it will be, quite frankly—and I do not like saying this—an insult to the Chinese negotiators who have made concessions to Australia to get us to where we are at. I note that Mr Robb said some other time that if the deal does not go ahead this time then there may not be another time.


Again, the Senate has heard any number of times just how important it is that this free trade arrangement is completed through the parliamentary process prior to the end of this year. If it is not, the concessions that we get on tariffs will be put back another year. That will make us that much less competitive with our competitors in the goods and services we export than we are this year. So, it is absolutely essential that we do that. And if you ask any farmer, anyone in the service industries, they will tell you the absolutely essential nature of immediate action on this free trade bill.


It has been inquired to death. It has been looked at by everybody, and everybody in this chamber, with the exception of the Labor Party, seems to think it is a good idea. It is not a political issue because like the coalition, most of the luminaries in the Labor Party—such as Hawke, Keating, Bob Carr and the premiers of the various Labor states—support the free trade agreements. It is completely ridiculous and it is difficult to understand why the Labor Party in this chamber are opposing the free trade agreement. 


The Labor Party talk about certain provisions for allowing workers in that will not have Australian standards, and this has been said time and time again on the public record—here in this chamber and in question time—but it has been proven to be a lie, a furphy and a complete misinterpretation of the facts. Do not take the words of Senator Abetz or of Senator Payne about this; take the words of Bob Hawke, of Bob Carr, of Premier Weatherill and of the Premier of Victoria—they are the ones that are saying it. Why are they saying that? Because they know that the provisions relating to employment are the same in these agreements as they were in one of the agreements that the Australian Labor Party managed to sign up with one of the South American countries during their term of office. They are exactly the same as the Labor Party has used, so why are they opposed to it? I hate to think it and I certainly do not believe it myself, but tell me another reason apart from being the old White Australia policy coming back into the Labor Party. I am sure that is not the way, but I cannot see any other reason why the Labor Party, in this chamber in particular, oppose it. 


This Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank bill brings us closer to Asia and provides those opportunities for Australian trade and business, just like the free trade agreements. Not only does greater infrastructure and investment mean greater demand for Australian commodities, such as metals, and not only does it mean greater investment in ports and rail in emerging markets, but it will also create new opportunities for Australian companies. The bill also provides an opportunity to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy, along with up to 55 other member countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which include India, Korea, France and other major economies. 


The question has been raised: will Australian companies be able to be bid for projects? Of course, the answer is yes. The bank will have an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country—not just the member countries—can bid for contracts. Australia, as a member of the bank, will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to Australian companies. If Australian companies can take advantage of those opportunities, then that means jobs for Australians and wealth for Australia. And who could be opposed to that? Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, so we are pretty well positioned. We have a track record to be able to make strong bids for contracts from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


Some people have asked me whether the bank would be able to invest in Australia. According to the articles agreement, that is not precluded. However, I would expect that the bank will initially focus on infrastructure in developing countries in the Asian region, where it will be able to play a more important role in encouraging private-sector funding, financing and infrastructure. 


I have previously mentioned what Australia's investment and contribution will be. I understand from the bill that the authorised capital is some US$100 billion and about US$20 billion is being paid in. Clearly, it is a move that will be very much in Australia's interest because we are an important player in this East-Asia region. Any development of infrastructure in any of the countries in this region can only be good for the region and consequently good for Australia. 


Those of us who have had the privilege of travelling in the Asia-Pacific region understand that, whilst some Asian countries have some of the very best infrastructure going—have a look at some of the trains in Japan for example, and while I have never been to China I believe some of their trains are very good too—other Asian countries are not quite so fortunate at the present time. There is clearly a lot that can be done in the way of infrastructure. We all know that infrastructure builds the economy. That is why, I might say as an aside, the coalition government has placed such significant importance on infrastructure in northern Australia. Although I would not classify northern Australia in the same category as some of the developing countries in Asia, clearly northern Australia is a part of our country that could well do with significant infrastructure investment. The northern Australian White Paper launched by the coalition government in June makes that commitment. In fact, it not only makes that commitment but also it provided the money for it in this year's budget. 


As a nation we understand that infrastructure is important to grow the country, to grow the economy, to create jobs, to create wealth and to make Australia a better place and the living standards of all Australians even better. The same applies to infrastructure investment in Asia, not only because it is good economic sense but because as a global citizen in this part of the world Australia wants to do the right thing by providing funding for infrastructure in the Asian region.


I do not think time is going to allow me to tell the Senate of some of the third-party endorsements—from people like the Chair of Industry Super Australia, Mr Peter Collins; the executive director of the Business Council of Australia; or the group chief executive of the Australian Industry Group—but all of them are on record as strongly supporting Australia's investment in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


It is said that the investment will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be applied to projects financed by the bank. It provides new opportunities to deploy capital as well as to export the funds know-how in connecting pension savings to bankable projects, and that is very, very important for Australia. The resources of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will increase the scope for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest in long-term productive assets in this region. Australia, like Asia, is dealing with challenges in the area of infrastructure and others. This bank will help meet them, and I am delighted that Australia will be part of that. I commend this bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,22,2,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:09):  Last night, a billion people around the world went to bed hungry, many of them children, most of them in our region, and tonight they will go to bed hungry again. The reason why I support so strongly the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015 is that it is a mechanism by or a conduit through which Australia can play a role in reducing that frightful figure of a billion people going to bed this evening without having had sufficient food. We will have 1.9 billion more people in this region by 2050—again, a challenge Australia can be part of in terms of a solution. I do not want to focus just on China, but it is illustrative of Asia. In Indonesia, the figures can be similar, as they can for other countries within the Asian region.


You and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson—you, in your case, having come from Western Australia originally and me, in my case, still coming from Western Australia—understand very clearly the fact that our state is Asia centric, whereas most of the east coast is still Pacific centric. Fifty per cent of the world's population now live within two hours of either side of Western Australia's time zone. We already play a significant role in this country, and this bill and the actions that flow from it will give us the opportunity to play an even more significant role.


I turn to China for a moment to speak about urbanisation. In the last 15 years, they have gone from being 35 per cent urban to 50 per cent urban and, in another 15 years, they will go to 65 per cent urban. They do not have sufficient land or sufficient water to be able to provide nourishment for their people. Using China as an example again, because it speaks to the importance of our involvement in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, in the 10 years of the presidency of Hu Jintao, the per capita income in China went from US$1,000 per year to US$5,000 per year—from US$1,000 to US$5,000 in 10 years. The last time there was a fivefold increase in per capita income anywhere in the world was during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and that took 100 years, not 10. Therein lies the challenge. 


What is the impact of this? As we all know, it is an increased demand for protein foods over staple foods as a community of people move higher socioeconomically, into the middle class, and an absolute emphasis on safe food and the reliable supply of food. Military leaders around the world have said since time immemorial that people go to war when there is a fear of inadequate, unsafe food and a lack of water—examples of which exist today. People want a better lifestyle. We saw this in the 10 years I spent working in India, where there was a burgeoning development of the middle class. It leads to a greater demand for services and a greater demand for better government management of the people's needs. Again, India is a prime example. In the city of Mumbai, no building has access to water 24 hours a day. Every building, be it a house, a leading hotel or a business, has a water tank on top so they get water for a certain number of hours a day, and power—unreliable power.


Why do I make these points so strongly? It is because Asia faces a major infrastructure financing gap estimated to be worth US$8 trillion over the next decade, and this Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will be the mechanism by which we and they can start to address these issues. For water, including harvesting water, storing water, delivering water and ensuring water is safe for potable purposes and of course for irrigation and others; and for power, including generation of power, distribution of power, safe and economical consumption of power—all these require infrastructure. 


When we speak of the delivery of goods, a statistic that is not commonly known but should be is that it is estimated that more than 40 per cent of all food produced in the world is not consumed—40 per cent of food produced in the world is not consumed—due to poor delivery; poor infrastructure; poor storage, such as a lack of refrigeration so the food spoils; poor transport; vermin, such as rats; or being wasted. And our own developed world is no orphan, as we know, when it comes to the food wastage that comes out of our own homes. This is not just a developing world problem or an underdeveloped world problem. But what it does point to is the need for infrastructure, the need for supply chains, the need for logistics and the need for investment. 


You can go further and talk about the development of ports: the efficient and safe movement of goods into a port, through the port, into the supply chain, into storage, into transport—if it is refrigerated or if it is perishable—and on its way to the end consumer. Those of us who have travelled throughout Asia understand very well where those challenges lie. 


I want to give recognition to Treasurer Joe Hockey in this whole process. It is Hockey who has led Australia's drive to be part of the inauguration of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. He understands that our prosperity and economic growth in this country are closely tied to the region. I just made the point about our own state of Western Australia and of course it flows through to other states and territories. Senator Macdonald expanded that to the entire north of our country and the opportunity—magnitudes of orders of opportunity into the future. Hockey makes the point that it is important—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  I will pull you up on it this time, Senator Back. You need to address members by their titles: Mr Hockey or Minister Hockey. 




Senator BACK:
  I will. I will say 'the excellent Treasurer'.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, the point of order is that Senator Back has consistently called the Treasurer 'Hockey'. I know that the Treasurer is on the outer and I know that the Treasurer will not be the Treasurer for very long, but he at least deserves the proper title. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order, thank you, Senator Cameron. I had already pulled up Senator Back. 




Senator BACK:
  That less than helpful contribution should be ignored, Mr Acting Deputy President. I certainly do give Mr Hockey the accolade and the acclaim, because it was him that saw the importance of us joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


Senator Cameron will be delighted to learn that on 29 June this year, Mr Hockey, the excellent Treasurer of Australia, gave effect to the government's commitment to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank by being the first person in the world—I am going to repeat that in case Senator Cameron needs to write it down—the first person in the world to sign the bank's articles of agreement in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. His signature was followed by representatives of 49 other countries. What a great legacy for that great man. Mr Hockey said:


The decision to join the bank was made following extensive consultations with key partners inside the Asian region and outside the Asian region. This included participating on negotiations on the bank's design with 56 other prospective founding member countries. 


It is important to understand that we are the fifth-largest regional shareholder in the bank. In that sense Australia, through the excellence of Mr Hockey, will be able to influence the bank's decisions and strategic direction. 


The question was asked in earlier contributions today—I am not sure if it was you, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, or Senator Lambie—about what governance processes were in place. I believe, since you are nodding, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it may have been you. So I have availed myself of this opportunity to inform the Senate of this.


In March of this year the government made clear that the key issues to be resolved before Australia could commit to join the AIIB were that the bank's board of directors would have control over key investment decisions and that no country—and I hope Senator Lambie's staff are listening because she made the observation that China in some way would have some massive influence—will dominate the bank or the decisions of the directors. So, in announcing our decision to sign the articles of agreement in June, again that excellent Treasurer, Mr Hockey, noted that all these criteria have been met and that the governance will be based on best practice, ensuring that all members will be directly involved in the direction and decision making of the bank in an open and transparent matter. I hope that is further discussed when we come to look at some of the amendments. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, why do we need to be involved? I cannot go further than the comments of industry leaders. Peter Collins, the chair of Industry Super Australia, made the observation:


This move will be a huge fillip for Australian expertise in funds management, engineering, construction, architecture and legal services which could be widely applied to projects financed by the AIIB.


He also made the observation that not only will they 'provide new opportunities to deploy capital but also export the funds know-how in connecting funds services and savings to bankable projects'. There you have Australian super. I am sure Senator Sinodinos will correct me if I am wrong, but if already have the second-largest or third-largest pool of superannuation investment in the world, and we are rushing to become the second-largest, if not the largest. To have an acknowledgment and an endorsement from the chair of Industry Super Australia has to be seen as a very valuable point. I hope it is a point that is not lost on members of this chamber when they finally come to consider this. 


The Business Council of Australia, Chief Executive Officer, Jennifer Westacott, welcomed the government's decision to join the bank as a founding member. She made the point that Australia can play a key role in setting the direction of the body, and decisions it will make to finance projections that address Australia's infrastructure gaps. She obviously realises that Australian companies will benefit from the opportunities to participate in developing and building new bank financed infrastructure, as well as having access to improved infrastructure which facilitates trade. As we all know, we are a massive exporter. Our own state exports 95 per cent of the grain it produces. We cannot consume it. We have the land mass of continental America excluding Alaska, and we have the population of Greater New York. I just do not know where those who stand up in this place and talk about Australia not needing to be actively engaged in the world of export get off. I just do not know who they think is going to consume the produce that has made this country great, and will go on making it even greater. 


Putting to one side for a moment commodities, which of course will be 99.9 per cent free trade once the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is in place, the big point that has attracted China to Australia with this FTA is our services sector. Ten years ago, when the negotiations started under the Howard government for the China free trade agreement, the emphasis was on commodities. The Chinese now see themselves going past America as the leading economy in the world but they know they are deficient in a range of areas—in the services sector particularly, and they recognise Australia as a country that may be able to provide those services. How wonderful it will be for us in our employment, in our university sectors, to be able to produce graduates and continue to work in services sectors such as corporate governance, prudential regulation, banking and finance, insurances and extending beyond that. Minister Robb is another excellent trade minister—probably the best in our history; nobody else has produced three free trade agreements within two years—and as he says—




Senator Cameron:
  A dud.




Senator BACK:
  A dud? I would say, judging from Senator Cameron's appraisals of people, reference to Minister Robb being a dud would be the highest praise that could be accorded.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I did not call Minister Robb a dud—I said the agreement was a dud. But I can add the minister to it if you like.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, that is not a point of order.




Senator BACK:
  Senator Cameron has allowed me time to take a small libation, for which I thank him.




Senator Bilyk:
  A what?




Senator BACK:
  A drink. Minister Robb was telling us—this will be very interesting to people from Tasmania, too, because there are some very good private health providers in Tasmania—that, for the first time, under this free trade agreement, and of course Senator Sinodinos is well aware of this, an Australian-based company could purchase land, build an aged care facility, staff it, manage it and repatriate the funds back to Australia. The same thing could be repeated in the hospitality industry or, for example, in the higher education sector. So there are opportunities in the services sector of the free trade agreement. You might ask where this is relevant to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and it is relevant because it is building up that level of confidence and that level of interoperability between our Asian neighbours and ourselves, which indeed goes towards complementing this whole activity. 


We do know that some in America were concerned about the decision that Australia was making to participate in and become a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That is all well and good, but again the question was asked by you, Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, when you made your contribution: will this provide the opportunity for Australian investment in infrastructure in Asia. An example is the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge that was completed in 1994—I believe Mr Keating may have been the Prime Minister at the time—a structure funded by Australia and built by that wonderful Western Australian company John Holland Construction. The impact that that bridge has had socially, culturally, economically and commercially on the border between Laos and Thailand has been phenomenal. It reminds me to make the observation that, because of the intertwining of aid and trade at that time, Thailand was a recipient country—it was receiving aid. But because of the focus of that aid partially at least on the trade space, we now see Thailand no longer as an aid dependent country but as a contributor. That surely must be the goal we move towards. How will this be partially funded? Through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


Often there is criticism in this place about the efforts of Foreign Minister Bishop, arguably the best foreign minister this country has ever had, certainly for the last decade or so. Minister Bishop's focus in the aid space is twofold.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I am sure Senator Cameron will want to take notes so he will not make a fool of himself in the future. The first aim is to allocate 20 per cent of the aid budget specifically into the aid for trade sector, emphasising the opportunity for people in developing countries not just to be given aid, not just to be given the fish, but to be taught how to fish. As has happened with Thailand, they can be moved out of that dependence on aid. The second has been the initiative of Minister Bishop, led by Bloomberg, the recently retired mayor of New York, to put together a group who can look at the effectiveness and efficiency of aid expenditure around the world, using Australia as a pilot and hopefully extending that to get much better value for aid recipients.


I am delighted and proud to support this bill and to urge my colleagues in the Senate to give it their full support for the 40- to 50- to 100-year future of our relationship with Asia.

Senator SINODINOS

 (
New South Wales
) (
17:30
):  I rise to speak on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2015. I take the opportunity, as Senator Back has done, to commend the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, for his sponsorship of this proposal. I think he was an early supporter of it. I do not think it is disclosing any secrets to say that the government initially had some reservations about being a founding member of the bank. Those reservations reflected discussions with some of our allies, such as the United States and Japan. However, the decision was taken by the government under the leadership of Tony Abbott, by Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey, to be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 


I think that is a good decision. Towards the end of last year I was in Singapore and met with senior government officials, including at their central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It was clear to me that they thought it was important that they be a founding member of the bank. They said it would be good if we were a founding member of the bank as well. They put the argument that if you are on the ground floor of a new institution like this you have a capacity to influence its governance and structure. There had been reservations about the governance and structure of this institution. I will come back to that later in my speech. But overriding all of those considerations and, I think, the fundamental reason that the Australian government decided to be part of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, is that it is a further evolution of the role of China in the region. It shows China extending its influence in the region, being a player in the region and promoting economic development and growth in the region. 


That is important. From a geopolitical perspective it is really important that we continue to encourage China to engage not only in this region but globally and, therefore, to increase its commitment and stake in the global rules of engagement. That is very important. We often express some concern about what will happen to the rules of engagement on trade and investment—which we have had largely since World War II and which were largely a product of American power, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region—if other countries, like China, start to become more important. Will they change the rules of engagement to benefit themselves, and will that be at the expense of other smaller economies, including Australia? 


We have come at that in a number of ways. The first is, obviously, to reaffirm our strong alliances in the region and to continue to encourage the United States to engage constructively in the region. But we have also done it by promoting economic development and growth in the region; not only because that will benefit us, but also because rising incomes in those countries and rising engagement in the global economy will encourage amity and cooperation in the region. 


From a geopolitical perspective it is very important that we encourage China in these multilateral regional initiatives. It is very important that we engage constructively with China, so I am very happy to support what Australia, under the guidance of the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, is undertaking to do in this particular context of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.


The word 'infrastructure' is in the title advisedly. The Chinese have identified a significant infrastructure gap in the region. It is estimated to be US$8 trillion in Asia in this decade alone. This is a product of economic growth and the need to produce new infrastructure. Infrastructure is very important. Economic infrastructure, in particular, increases your capacity to produce goods and services. It lays the basis for economic growth and development and for rising incomes. This infrastructure gap arises because economic growth is proceeding apace in the region. We need to address the financing gap that opens up as a result. This financing gap can be addressed over time through a combination of public and private contributions. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will mobilise capital in the region, drawing on government contributions, in order to help fill at least part of this gap. 


In this context I commend the work that Mr Hockey has done in the context of the G20, where, last year, under the presidency of Australia, the G20 endorsed the idea of a global infrastructure hub. The Global Infrastructure Hub will be based in Sydney and will be a clearing house for experience in addressing infrastructure issues, including matters like public-private partnerships and how to facilitate cross-border cooperation in developing and building infrastructure. That Global Infrastructure Hub is underway. It will be located in Australia and it will complement some of what we are doing here. 


We must remember that, when we talk about promoting infrastructure, it is very important to note that we must not always categorise all debt as being bad. There are contexts where providing debt financing, which can be serviced in due course, can be a very appropriate thing to do, as you would understand from your own background, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson. We should not be afraid of that. The question is always the rules under which it is done, so we can promote sound investment decisions to get the sort of returns which are needed in order to justify the investment and provide the funds for future investment.


The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has identified a gap in that regard. It is classified as a multilateral development bank. It is a quasi-commercial bank. What is meant there is that it is neither purely a commercial operation—it is not just a commercial bank which would crowd out private investment—nor purely an aid agency which would provide concessionary finance, grant finance or whatever. What it seeks to do is to earn minimal returns—at least in the sense of breaking even—but some returns in order that it can fill the gap in financing which exists on the continuum between purely aid focused projects and purely commercial projects. It plays a catalytic role. That is, I think, very important. It can play a role in catalysing private investment by topping it up. It can play a role in filling the gap that we have identified in getting infrastructure underway which may not be purely private infrastructure. In other words, it may not be infrastructure that benefits only one particular party that is building it. You could argue then that they capture the private benefits of that infrastructure, so they should pay for all of it. But there will be infrastructure which will have spillover benefits, or benefits which are not captured just by one group—common user infrastructure, for example. That is a good example of where having a group like this can help to fill the financing gap. That is very important. This bank will play an important part in helping to fill that infrastructure gap.


There were some concerns expressed earlier about structure and governance issues to do with the bank. These revolved around issues as to the extent to which the Chinese would have influence over the operations of the bank. It is true to say that for some aspects of the work of the bank there will be a veto. China will have veto power on issues that require a supermajority vote, such as the board, the president and the capital as well as the major operational and financial policies. But issues such as the acceptance of new members and ordinary loan decisions will not require a supermajority. And this particular veto power has been scaled back. I think this is recognition by China that it needed to make its proposal more palatable than might otherwise have been the case, and it may in part have been a reaction to some of the scepticism of the US, Japan and others. I commend the Chinese for being sensitive in that regard.


I spoke about the infrastructure gap in the region. For us the benefits of filling that gap will include a demand for commodities as new infrastructure is rolled out. That in itself is one level of demand. More importantly in a longer run sense, higher incomes in those countries will lead to more demand for a whole slew of Australian goods and services, potentially not just those involving Australian mineral and energy resources. That is very important. So there are benefits in terms of trade opportunities. There are investment opportunities in the sense that there is a capacity for the bank to invest in Australia as well. Interestingly, that could be a conduit for more investment in infrastructure related, for example, to what we are seeking to do in Northern Australia through our Northern Australia policy, which is to promote the development of Northern Australia by working with the Western Australian, Northern Territory and Queensland governments to put together infrastructure projects which will open some of those territories to more economic development. That could be a very important development. It could be a conduit for Chinese investment in Australia, done in a way which may not carry the same connotations as other forms of Chinese investment here do. And of course there will be a capacity for Australian companies to bid for procurement on major projects which are being sponsored and financed by the bank. That is a big opportunity, because from what we understand the procurement process will be a competitive one and we will be able to participate in all of that.


So this infrastructure bank provides an opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with our largest trading partner and the region's largest economy, along with 55 other member countries including India, Korea, the UK, Germany and France. It is very significant that European countries have seen this as an opportunity to participate. They recognise not only, clearly, the rise of China but also the importance of direct engagement. I have always believed that direct engagement is the best way to get other countries to understand you better and to understand them better. That is to the benefit of everybody. We will be committing, in Australian dollar terms, $932 million to the bank. Apart from the benefits I mentioned earlier, it should be noted that, consistent with the budget treatment of Australia's contributions to the other international financial institutions, Australia's paid-in capital will be treated as an investment. It does not come at the cost of other government spending, in that sense, and does not directly add to the budget deficit. So we are not talking here about a situation where we are potentially diverting spending from other, more useful, social purposes.


I mentioned earlier that Australian companies will be able to bid for projects. There will be what is called an open procurement model, meaning that companies from any country—not just member countries—can bid for contracts. Australia as a member of the bank will be able to benefit from up-to-date knowledge of the opportunities available to our companies. Australian companies have won contracts from other multilateral banks such as the Asian Development Bank, so they will be well positioned to make strong bids for contracts from this bank. Australian companies have built up a bank of knowledge in bidding for contracts with the Asian Development Bank and others, and that gives us a capacity to understand the needs of these international financial institutions. That will stand us in good stead, I believe, in bidding in the region. One other area where we can potentially also benefit is in sharing our expertise when it comes to infrastructure financing. Financial institutions such as Macquarie Bank have over the years pioneered all sorts of infrastructure financing models. It would be interesting to see the extent to which they can be adapted for the purposes of the region.


I need in my remarks to also cover a broader issue to do with our relationship with China, which is that we have recently, of course, also been negotiating and have concluded negotiations on a major free trade agreement with China. So what we see is Australia broadening and deepening our relationship with China, giving us the capacity to influence them in a way which could be very useful to the region as a whole. We are in the region, but in some ways we are seen as a bridge to other countries.


I remember working in the Howard government when we were bidding for major gas projects in China. Australian companies were bidding against British and other companies. What was important then was that the Chinese not only thought of us as potentially a major supplier of all sorts of different resources and commodities, but also saw the awarding of contracts to Australian companies as a way of sending us a signal that they saw us a valued partner in the region, an interlocutor who could also have influence with other partners in the region and outside the region, including the United States. Sometimes the Chinese used the Australian channel to get messages to our alliance partners.


There are a number of levels on which our relationship with China is developing. We have the free trade agreement. We have investment in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. On top of that we have the people-to-people movements: the ways in which we are reforming our international education to make it as good as it can be and having high-quality national education to make the experience as good as it can be in Australia. Now, particularly with a lower dollar, our tourism sector is really starting to revive and be stimulated. The Chinese will also play a major role in that regard.


The need to generate returns at the bank raises a key question regarding how the bank will balance its funding of infrastructure projects with practical considerations. Infrastructure development is known for long funding cycles, low interest rates and the potential for waste and corruption. If the bank is to grant loans that other banks reject for good reasons, it would assume major risks, especially in less developed Asian countries with volatile domestic economies and unstable governments. How the recipients will repay loans is a major question for any bank, including this bank. But I am heartened that the governance and structure being put in place will give the bank a capacity to draw on the experience of other multilateral development banks in particular. As I said before, because they will operate not to seek high returns but to break even or to earn minimal profits, they will have that quasi-commercial focus, which I think will allow them to very well fill a gap that has opened up in the infrastructure financing chain.


With regard to our relationship with China more broadly, let me also say that it is clear from the way the Chinese economy is now developing that the rebalancing which is underway means that there will be an increasing focus in China itself on economic growth being driven by consumption rather than infrastructure investment and exports. China has had a very significant and very impressive export led growth model, but that is changing. They are rebalancing their economy to put more focus on consumption. That will also lead, of course, to greater demand for a whole array of goods and services from countries like Australia. We are well placed to meet much of that demand, not just because of the free trade agreement but also because of the wide array of goods and services produced by the Australian economy. I think it is very important that we do what we can to continue to promote the competitiveness of our economy, because while we are very good at producing a whole array of goods—whether you go through the agricultural chain, where we are very efficient in physical terms, or you go through to a whole array of advanced services that we are now able to generate—it is very important for us to maintain our competitiveness in the region. As I have said so many times, our competitors in the region are not waiting for us to be competitive. They continue to be competitive and to increase their competitiveness. They face their own pressures. In many ways we need to run faster just to stay in the one spot.



It is very important for us to recognise that when we contribute to these sorts of international organisations—even though we will be eligible in terms of being able to bid for the procurement on projects—we have to be competitive, not just drawing on our experience in dealing with other multilateral development banks but also recognising that we need to be innovative, we need to be productive and we need to keep our costs under control so that we can be cost-effective, have an edge and maintain an edge over our competitors. That whole innovation agenda is a topic for another day, but that is an important part of being a good partner— (Time expired)

Senator SCULLION:
  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. In summation, this bill is necessary for Australia to become a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This new international financial institution will drive economic growth and jobs in our region by funding major infrastructure projects. Australia's prosperity and economic growth is closely tied to the region. Australia's economy will benefit from improved infrastructure in Asia. Over 70 per cent of our merchandise exports go to the Asian region. Australia's membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and stronger economies in Asia will provide great opportunities for Australian trade and business. I look forward to the day when the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank might invest in infrastructure here at home. I commend this bill to the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Whish-Wilson be agreed to.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:27):  At the outset I inform the Senate that Labor's position is to support the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. I expect that would not be surprising to anyone who followed the debate on this bill in the other place, given that two-thirds of the bill are measures from previous Labor budgets. The bill implements previous Labor integrity measures on capital gains tax, rollovers and lost member superannuation accounts, and it unifies the tax treatment of all civilian and Australian government employees who work overseas. It is greatly pleasing that the government is proceeding with some of the measures that Labor had planned to implement. Up until recently, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the sole purpose of the government was to tear down prior achievements of Labor governments. So, it is good to see a tax and superannuation laws amendment bill that indeed implements these sensible integrity measures.


Going to schedule 1, improving the integrity of the scrip-for-scrip rollover, we welcome the government's move to implement our integrity measures on scrip-for-scrip rollovers. The scrip-for-scrip rollover regime ensures that tax considerations are not an impediment to takeovers or mergers involving companies or trusts. Recent court cases have shed light on the tax minimisation opportunities arising from ambiguity in the existing legislation. This reform, first announced by Labor in 2012, prevents entities from indefinitely deferring capital gains tax obligations and greater consistency to the taxation of trusts.


Schedule 2 is the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. The opposition is comfortable with the government's efforts to boost the integrity of our personal income tax system by standardising the tax treatment for workers delivering overseas development assistance. This integrity measure improves the consistency of our personal income tax system by upholding the principle that Australians should pay tax on their earnings somewhere. This provision was originally introduced to ensure that aid workers working overseas were not taxed on their income both in Australia and in the source country. However, the provision no longer serves this purpose, with Australians working overseas often able to avoid income tax in both jurisdictions.


While we welcome efforts to tighten the tax net, I contrast the government's approach to the issue of double taxation of individuals with its approach to the double taxation of corporations. Earlier this year Labor announced a multinational tax package which included a measure for tackling hybrid instruments. Under our proposal, we are allowing the Australian Taxation Office to look at how a hybrid instrument is treated by an overseas jurisdiction essentially to ensure that a hybrid instrument could not, effectively, avoid tax in multiple jurisdictions. It is striking that, while the government is willing to tackle this issue in the case of aid workers, it is not willing to tackle the same issue when it comes to big multinational corporations. The principle is a sensible one. Multinational corporations are looking at how a hybrid instrument is treated by the tax regime of another country and how it is treated by the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office should not be blind to the way in which an overseas tax office treats a hybrid instrument.


Unfortunately, while the Treasurer has been talking about acting on multinational tax for over a year and we have heard, again, the promise that he will act, we are yet to see actual legislation. By contrast, Labor's multinational tax plan, announced in the first half of this parliamentary term, would raise more than $7 billion over the decade. It is informed by work in the OECD and has been carefully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.


Schedule 3 of this bill covers the small lost member account threshold. Labor will support raising the threshold at which the government collects small lost member superannuation accounts. Labor invented Australia's universal superannuation system. It was fought hard against by the coalition at the time. When the Keating government introduced universal superannuation in the early 1990s, those opposite railed against universal superannuation. I remember going out and fighting for this on the job as a union official, trying to get equal access to superannuation for blue-collar workers, predominantly in places where white-collar workers had access to superannuation but blue-collar workers did not and where white-collar workers could vest their superannuation and blue-collar workers could not—all issues opposed by those opposite. 


Before the 1996 election, the coalition promised not to tinker with superannuation but then froze the superannuation contribution rate throughout the period of the Howard government. History repeated itself in 2013 when the then opposition promised that they would not make adverse, unexpected changes to superannuation but went ahead and froze the super contribution rate at 9½ per cent, not allowing it to continue on its planned trajectory to 12 per cent, which would have guaranteed a more dignified retirement for many Australians.


The system of collecting lost member accounts is sensible. It is easy for Australians to be reunited with their lost superannuation accounts using a simple tool available on the tax office website. But the decision that the government made in the past was that when accounts fell below a certain amount they should be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office to ensure they were not completely eaten up by fees and charges. Many young people know the experience of moving from casual job to casual job, ending up with a collection of superannuation accounts and wanting to consolidate those accounts. Before we had the lost super regime, those accounts would often be gone within a matter of months. Thanks to the lost super regime these accounts, when found, contain a reasonable chunk of money—about what the individual put in.


In May 2012, Labor increased the threshold at which an account could be shifted to the ATO from $200 to $2,000. In the 2013 budget, Labor proposed an incremental increase in the threshold from $2,000 to $6,000. I note in passing that when it comes to unclaimed moneys the coalition is happy to run a scare campaign with crazy talk of 'trousering', with the suggestion that anyone who believes in having a different duration after which bank accounts should be moved to the government is somehow trying to steal people's money. At the same time we have a government bill in the Senate whose effect is going to be to move more superannuation accounts to the government. The principle in both cases is the same: we want to make sure that people who have lost their bank accounts or their superannuation accounts do not find them again only to discover there is nothing in them. We also want to guard against the possibility that someone who has simply not accessed an account for a while may not want it transferred to the government. The thresholds—duration or financial—aim to get that balance right. But the government is clearly pursuing an approach to superannuation accounts that is somewhat different from its approach to bank accounts.


In the spirit of constructive bipartisanship, Labor will support this measure. We do so knowing that, as of 30 June this year, over 14 million Australians have a superannuation fund account and approximately 45 per cent of these people have more than one account. We know, through figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, that the median figure for fees and charges for low-cost superannuation accounts is $532 a year. If a person has a superannuation balance of $1,000, they will see it entirely eroded by fees and charges in a couple of years. That is the principle of lost super laws, which see accounts moved to the tax office when they fall below a certain threshold—currently $2,000 but, under this bill, $6,000. These measures will, hopefully, ensure that low wage workers and those working casual jobs are able to retire in more dignity, knowing that their accounts have not been eaten up by fees and charges. 


At the same time, it is not possible to talk about super in this place without acknowledging that there is only one party of government in this parliament who believes that our superannuation tax concessions are not fair and not sustainable. The age pension is set to grow around five per cent a year over the next four years. The government says that the age pension is out of control because of that, but superannuation tax concessions are growing at more than four times this rate. The earnings concessions alone are set to double over the next four years to more than $30 billion. It will soon be the case that we spend more on superannuation tax concessions than we spend on the age pension entirely. 


A Grattan Institute report on tax reform found that more than half of the benefits of super tax concessions go to the top 20 per cent of households. Indeed, the top one per cent of households gains more from our super tax concessions than the bottom 40 per cent. To improve the fairness and sustainability of our superannuation system, the opposition has made clear that we will ensure that earnings in excess of $75,000 in the retirement phase are taxed at a concessional rate of 15 per cent rather than being tax-free. This represents a partial unwinding of one of Peter Costello's many imprudent decisions in the late phase of the Howard government—this one removing entirely the tax-free status of earnings in the pension phase. That is a measure which has disproportionately benefited high-income earners and done little to take pressure off the age pension but instead had the effect of acting as a windfall for those who are able to recycle their earnings through the superannuation system. 


Labor do not propose to entirely reverse that Costello decision of 2006. But we do propose, if we are fortunate enough to win government, to ensure that earnings over $75,000—and just the marginal amount over $75,000—are subject to a 15 per cent tax rate. We have also indicated that we will lower the threshold for the 15 per cent high-income superannuation charge from $300,000 to $250,000. Those two measures together save the budget in excess of $14 billion over the decade. They are responsible, they are fair and they will put our superannuation system on a more sustainable footing for the future.


Labor is hardly a voice in the wilderness amongst those who believe that our superannuation settings need to change. We can go through those who support some changes to our superannuation system, and we will start with the Secretary to the Treasury, John Fraser. The government's own tax white paper asked the question, 'Are Australia's superannuation tax concessions sustainable?' A range of groups across the political spectrum have called for the government to engage in a sensible debate over superannuation tax concessions. They include the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, AustralianSuper, the Grattan Institute and Rice Warner actuaries. Indeed, the recent reform summit cosponsored by The Australian newspaper and the Financial Review newspaper saw, as part of its communique, a recognition that we need to look carefully at our superannuation tax concessions. We need to make sure that they are fair for this generation and fair for generations to come, such as students.


What does the government have to say about these unfair and unsustainable superannuation concessions? It depends on who you ask in the government, as with many things. The Treasurer—for the moment—Mr Hockey, has refused to rule out changes, but the former Prime Minister slammed the door on him, having said that there would be no changes whatsoever. Now it falls to the new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to set aside the policy approach of his predecessor and engage with the opposition in some constructive reform.


Labor's policy on superannuation is one which has been announced early in this term of government. We did that in order to promote exactly the sort of healthy public debate that I know some on the opposite side of the chamber believe in. We recognise that superannuation changes are not universally popular, and that is why we have begun the community conversation about Labor's changes. Yes, they raise $14 billion over the next decade, but they do so by reversing a Peter Costello change, which I hope those opposite no longer believe was a fiscally prudent one, and by changing the high-income superannuation charge.


But the real question here is where the government stands. It is unusual for a member of the opposition to be saying this, but we do not know. Mr Hockey does not want to rule out any changes, but the Mr Abbott did want to rule out changes. What does Mr Turnbull believe? We know indeed that the government was considering making superannuation changes right up until the day Labor announced its policy package. Indeed, plausibly, some of the talented Treasury officials sitting in the boxes today were working on the memorandums that we know— thanks to freedom of information laws—were being sent up to the government during this period. We know that there were four briefs that went to the government in the lead-up to the 2015 budget, but they stopped on a particular day. No prizes for guessing which day that was—that was the day that Labor made its superannuation announcement. How is that a coincidence? As always, we have the government playing politics over the policy. 


Let us be clear: when we are talking about superannuation, as this bill does, we need to recognise the role of the superannuation tax concessions. They do two things. They recognise the public benefit in reducing the number of people who claim the age pension, and they recognise the public benefit in having a larger pool of savings. That second public benefit is tangible and was important in the global financial crisis but surely must be accorded less weight than the first. For people with multimillions in their superannuation accounts, Labor says: 'Good luck to you. Congratulations, but you should not necessarily be claiming the same superannuation tax concessions as you did in the past.'


Labor's policy is costed and sustainable and is something which I hope the government will engage on. I hope the government will go back to those excellent briefs which I am sure were being prepared for them by the Department of the Treasury in the lead-up to Labor's announcement and will come to a bipartisan consensus with Labor to make sure that our super tax concessions can be sustainable in the future. We have no problem with the government's proposal to increase the threshold for collecting lost members' accounts, but we want to make sure that the government engage in the bigger conversation over superannuation concessions. It is such an important conversation, particularly for those of us on this side of the chamber, who were responsible for creating universal superannuation and who will continue to defend a strong and accessible superannuation system.


Labor calls on the Prime Minister to get over the false start that he has had, the bad start that he has had, as Prime Minister of this country by conceding to the claims of the National Party to do things that are not in the national interest and only in a sectional interest. Prime Minister Turnbull has not started well. Prime Minister Turnbull has started by caving in to the National Party, and we know what that means in terms of good economic policy in this country. If you cave in to the National Party, you end up causing problems for the economic future of this country. The National Party are narrowly focused. The National Party are concerned only for their own interests, not for the interests of the regions that they have seats in. They do not look after rural communities and they do not look after Indigenous communities; they do not look after their health and they do not look after their education. Yet this new Prime Minister has caved in to the Luddites in the National Party. He has started off weakly; he has started off badly. It does not fill anyone with confidence that there will be any change. We know there will be no change because we know this Prime Minister supports the first bad budget, so he supports bad economics and bad policy.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  I rise to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. The specific aspect of this bill that I want to deal with is that of the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. This looks like another unfair tax measure, where we have an inconsistency, and questions need to be answered by Labor, Liberals and Nationals about why they would support this inconsistency. 


This measure really does penalise workers who work for the government on overseas aid projects. We are talking about people employed and paid for out of overseas development assistance. Under the current law all employees of an Australian government agency who work overseas for not fewer than 91 continuous days delivering ODA are exempted from payment of income tax on the income they earn while overseas. It might sound fair that we need to tidy that up, but that exemption is not being removed for all workers who are paid out of the government coffers.


The amendments ensure that all employees of an Australian government agency will be treated equally, in that they will now be subject to income tax on overseas income they have earned in the delivery of ODA. We are being told that there is an issue of fairness here and that there needs to be an evening out of the current system, but it is only to do with ODA. When you look into it more deeply, you find considerable discrimination. The change, which is in schedule 2 of the bill, means that overseas development assistance workers employed by the government will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. We know this is discriminatory because tax exemptions are being retained for workers in private companies, the Australian Federal Police and the military. This is where we need an explanation, because the Greens certainly support consistency, but we need some fair consistency in how this works.


If workers in private NGOs, the Australian Federal Police and the military will retain their tax exemption status, why shouldn't all government employees do so? I have not been able to find anything in the explanatory memorandum to the bill or in the second reading speech to clarify this. What we find buried in this legislation is that it does penalise workers who choose to work for the government in delivering ODA. If they are working for the government delivering ODA project services, this provision will now apply to them, where it did not previously. This is where we have to look at this measure closely. It looks very discriminatory. 


It is also relevant to consider the changes that have been made recently to overseas aid. We have seen a massive decrease in money—$11 billion—for overseas aid. Under this government we now have language about overseas aid having to be about the national interest—not the national interest in relieving poverty in low-income countries but Australia's national interest. I have looked at this issue closely for a long time. When one sees this measure, which discriminates against government workers employed under ODA but not against those in the private sector who are linked with aid, one has to ask questions. And those questions should be answered. As I say again, it looks very discriminatory. I did not hear any explanation as to why Labor signed off on this. 


This measure is largely hidden. To be frank about it, we only came across it recently. Again I want to emphasise that the Greens support consistency in terms of tax measures—that is fair—but we are not getting consistency here. Although, when you look at how it is set out on page 25 of the explanatory memorandum, you would think that it was fair, because we are told:


These amendments ensure that all employees of an Australian government agency are treated equally …


Those are the first words—I read them out earlier. When you read on, you find that we are only talking about ODA; we are not talking about those measures applying to AFP officers and the military. 


We will return to this in the committee stage of the bill. I do hope that we get a fuller explanation, because right now it seems that buried in this legislation is something that is unfair and discriminatory.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:52):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. This is a bill of unrelated tax and super measures. I will go through the three schedules in relation to each element of the bill.


The first schedule relates to improving the integrity of the scrip for scrip rollover relief rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act following a 2009 decision of the Federal Court. Secondly, this bill will end the personal income tax exemption of wages under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act earned by some Australian government employees who work overseas for more than 91 days delivering official development assistance. Thirdly, it will increase the super account balance below which small lost super accounts will be required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation under the provisions of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999. I will deal with the first schedule and then go on to the other ones in order.


It is normal practice for a company acquiring or merging with another company to offer its own shares as payment for the acquired company. Normally, such an event, which, in effect, amounts to a disposal of shares, would create capital gains tax liability. However, in certain circumstances, an entity may be able to defer paying capital gains tax until a later capital gains tax event. This is where a scrip for scrip rollover becomes a possibility. A scrip for scrip rollover is the deferral of a liability where: the owner of the asset chooses to take advantage of these provisions; the owner acquired its interest in the company being sold on or after 20 September 1985; the exchange of shares which results in a capital gain occurs on or after 10 December 1999; the exchange of shares results in the purchasing company gaining at least 80 per cent of the equity of the target company or trust; holders of voting interest in the acquired entity can participate in the merger or takeover on substantially the same terms; and the purchase bid does not contravene key provisions in chapter 6 of the Corporations Act or, if the target entity is a company, it includes a scheme of arrangement approved by the court under part 5 of the Corporations Act. Similar provisions apply to allow the deferral of capital gains tax where one trust acquires units in another trust. However, scrip for scrip rollover capital gains tax relief is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share. Generally, foreign residents for tax purposes cannot take advantage of these provisions.


The origin of the proposed changes in schedule 1 is that they arise from a decision of the Federal Court in AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation in 2009. Briefly, this case examined whether two parties were dealing with one another on an arms-length basis and whether their arrangements invoked the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Neither issue is being addressed by the proposed amendments in schedule 1, but the decision in this case left open opportunities to unduly avoid capital gains tax. 


The proposed amendments involve subdivision 124-M of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This subdivision contains provisions to deny scrip for scrip rollover relief in circumstances where the same person or company group has influence over both the selling company and the purchasing company. According to the explanatory memorandum of the bill, subdivision 124-M treated the AXA arrangement as a genuine takeover involving a substantial change in ownership rather than as a corporate restructure. As result, AXA was able to obtain the benefit of a capital gains tax cost base uplift when eventually disposing of one of its subsidiaries.


A restructure of an entity that involves the sale of a business into a different entity, such as the sale of a business from a trust to a company, will inevitably result in an uplift to the cost base to the acquiring entity for that asset. For example, a family trust conducts a successful retail business with goodwill worth around $1.5 million, but, due to problems with distributions to a corporate beneficiary, it decides to dispose of the business to a new company which it established. The trust vendor finances the purchase price. Thus, the newly created company now has the goodwill and the cost base of $1.5 million. The revenue earned by the company can be used for the loan payable to the trust. When the company sells the business, it can use the cost base of $1.5 million. However, because the parties to the transaction are not at arm's length, an independent evaluation of the business asset should be undertaken. The explanatory memorandum notes that the AXA case demonstrates that these integrity provisions can be circumvented. This can occur by:


… temporarily suppressing the ownership rights of a party in a scrip for scrip exchange through the use of instruments including convertible shares, options and rights.


Later, these transactions can be reversed, so that a transfer of ownership is accomplished without raising a capital gains tax liability that might otherwise occur. The proposed amendments seek to alter these integrity provisions so that this inappropriate tax relief would not occur.


This measure was first announced as part of the previous government's 2012-13 budget. The Treasury released a consultation on this matter back in July 2012, and it received only one submission in response. The coalition government announced that it was proceeding with this measure in December 2013, and in April 2015 the Treasury released an exposure draft of legislation containing the proposed provisions.


I will now move on to schedule 2 of this bill, which is removing the exemption of income earned from overseas employment. As it says in the Bills Digest:


Since 1964, under Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a ‘diplomatic agent’ is exempt from personal income tax of the host country on income sourced from that agent’s home country. For the purposes of this Convention a diplomatic agent is the head of the mission or a member of the diplomatic staff of the mission. Thus Australian government staff, attached to an Australian diplomatic mission, are exempt from the host country personal income tax where that host country has signed this Convention (and the overwhelming majority of host countries have now signed).


Under section 23AG of the ITAA—


the Income Tax Assessment Act—


the foreign earnings of Australian residents for tax purposes, who have been engaged in foreign service for a continuous period of not less than 91 days, are also exempt from Australian personal income tax. This applies to periods of foreign service arising from:


the delivery of Australian official development assistance by the person’s employer


the activities of the person’s employer in operating a public fund that is a deductable gift recipient operating internationally


the person’s employment by a prescribed institution which is located outside Australia and is exempt from income tax in the country in which it is resident; or is a prescribed institution that has a physical presence in Australia but which incurs its expenditure and pursues its objectives principally outside Australia or


the person’s deployment outside Australia as a member of a disciplined force (armed forces or police).


Therefore, those persons attached to Australian diplomatic missions, who are Australian residents for taxation purposes, meeting the requirements of section 23AG of the ITAA 1936, engaged in foreign services for not less than 91 days are exempt from both Australian and host country personal income tax regimes on their foreign income.


Those Australian residents engaged in foreign services, that do not meet the requirements of section 23AG of the ITAA 1936, are subject to Australian personal income tax; for example ordinary Australian diplomatic staff on foreign postings.


The Explanatory Memorandum notes that this exemption under section 23AG was originally provided to avoid double taxation of those engaged in government service.


I will now move on to talk about schedule 3 of this bill. As it says in the Bills Digest:


As individuals move between jobs it is possible that superannuation payments made on their behalf are paid to different funds. Sometimes this is a deliberate choice made by the individual or is the result of restrictions on moving balances between funds (such as for certain defined benefit schemes). If an individual does not make a choice about their superannuation fund upon commencing employment, it is likely that they will be a member of multiple funds.


The holding of multiple superannuation accounts may disadvantage individuals through the imposition of fixed administration fees. Multiple accounts can also impose additional costs on the superannuation system. However, it is important not to assume that each individual should only have a single account. Multiple accounts may be an active choice that a member makes to obtain certain insurance benefits, to facilitate investment choice or as a transition to retirement arrangement.


…   …   …


Certain ‘lost’ accounts are required to be identified and transferred biannually from superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to the Commissioner of Taxation.


While the identification of lost superannuation has been part of superannuation industry arrangements since 1996, requirements for the transfer of these funds to the Commissioner of Taxation first applied from 1 July 2010, after being announced in the 2009-10 Budget. Prior to this, these funds remained with the relevant superannuation fund or were transferred to eligible roll-over funds. At that time, the transfer to the Commissioner of Taxation of these funds was expected to increase net revenue by almost $230 million over the period 2010-11 to 2012-13.


…   …   …


The justification for the transfer of such funds—which was already in place for unclaimed bank account and life insurance fund moneys—was that it would improve the efficiency of the superannuation system overall by removing the need for superannuation funds to administer or apply member protection to small accounts that are transferred and improve the equity for other members of the fund that were cross-subsidising the member protection arrangements.


The requirements to be a ‘lost member’ are set out in the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997 and Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. These require the account holder to be ‘uncontactable’ or ‘inactive’:


the account holder is ‘uncontactable’ if:


– the provider has never had an address for the account holder or


– at least one written communication has been sent to the account holder’s last known address and has been returned unclaimed


and the provider has not received a contribution or roll-over in respect of the account holder within the last 12 months


the account holder is ‘inactive’ if the account has been held for more than two years and the provider has not received a contribution or roll-over in respect of the account within the last five years. The regulations provide for account holders to be permanently excluded from being ‘lost’ if they have indicated by some positive act or another contact that they wish to continue with the provider.


There are two strands to a superannuation account being classified as a ‘lost member account’ under the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999:


the first relates to ‘small accounts’, which are taken to be the accounts of lost members (as defined by the Regulations above) with an account balance that is less than the specified threshold in paragraph 24B(1)(b) of the Act—currently $2,000


the second relates to ‘inactive accounts of unidentifiable members’, which are taken to be the accounts of lost members (as defined by the Regulations above) where:


– the superannuation provider has not received an amount in respect of the member within the last 12 months and


– the superannuation provider is satisfied that it will never be possible for the provider, having regard to the information reasonably available to the provider, to pay an amount to the member.


Schedule 3 of this Bill proposes to change the account balance threshold relating to ‘small accounts’ from $2,000 to $4,000 from 31 December 2015 and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016.


With the time that remains to me I would like to go through some of the key issues contained in the schedules of this bill, starting with schedule 1 of the methods for dealing with potential tax loopholes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The proposed methods are:


to include any interests involved in a scrip for scrip rollover that are convertible shares, options, rights or similar interests in the calculations of equity interests involved in a scrip for scrip roll-over between the parties in these arrangements


where debt is involved the proposed solution is to remove the debt sheltering opportunity arising from the current disregarding of a capital gain arising on the settlement of a debt owed, as part of a scrip for scrip acquisition, by an acquiring company to its ultimate holding company and


where trusts are involved in a scrip for scrip roll-over, the proposed solution is to extend the operation of the new provisions so that they apply to trusts as well as to companies.


…   …   …


Item 4 of Schedule 1 amends section 127-780 of the ITAA 1997 to add a new condition for a scrip for scrip roll-over to apply. This new condition is that where a purchasing entity is part of a wholly owned group, no member of that group may issue equity (other than the necessary replacement equity), or owe new debt:


to an entity that is not a member of that wholly owned group and


in relation to the issue of a replacement interest as part of that purchasing arrangement. This prevents other members of a wholly owned group from issuing unnecessary debt or equity to third parties that can be used to avoid CGT—


capital gains tax—


obligations.


Under section 124-780—


of the Income Tax Assessment Act—


only an original interest holder can obtain a roll-over of share interests. Under section 124-781 only an original interest holder can obtain a roll-over of trust interests. The transfer of a cost base for the purposes of a scrip for scrip roll-over can, under section 124-782, only be applied to the holder of an ‘original interest’ in an entity who is either a significant stake holder or a common stake holder. This makes the definitions of the terms ‘significant stake’ and ‘common stake’ critical for the functioning of the scrip for scrip roll-over provisions. Both terms are defined at section 124-783 and apply where the entities involved are not ‘widely-held’—that is they have less than 300 shareholders (if they are a company) or beneficiaries (if they are a trust).


An entity has a ‘significant stake’ in a company if it and its associates own shares with 30 per cent or more of the voting rights, or the right to receive 30 per cent or more of any dividends or capital distributions (subsection 124-783(6)).


An entity has, or two or more entities have, a ‘common stake’ if they and their associates own shares with 80 per cent or more of the voting rights, or the right to receive 80 per cent or more of any dividends or capital distributions … 


Equivalent tests are applied to trusts …

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:12):  I am glad to rise and make a contribution on this bill, the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill, because it is one of those important, if not exactly very exciting, pieces of legislation that will better align our superannuation system with the realities of our day-to-day lives. The bill makes three changes—two to our tax laws and one, of course, to superannuation law. The two tax changes are part of the government's determined effort to make our tax system fairer and more robust, and I am sure that is an aspiration that all of us in this chamber would support. We want to make sure that everybody pays their fair share of tax and that there are no loopholes in our tax system that afford any unfair advantage to some over others based on their ability to gain the system. I would add to that coalition senators would also aspire to Australians paying the least amount of tax they possibly can.


These two changes are integrity measure that will remove the ability of certain companies, trusts and individuals to obtain an unfair tax advantage that was never intended for them. This will make our tax system harder to circumvent and more sustainable for the future. These changes will remove the ability for some entities to access tax relief from the Australian taxpayer when two merging companies are owned by the same people or the same business. This will be achieved by making definitions clearer and by ensuring that the integrity structure cannot be circumvented by businesses, trusts or companies. These changes will make our system stronger and easier to understand—a simpler, clearer set of rules for business is in the best interests of job creation and stimulating economic growth, which everyone would agree are the key priorities of economic reform for our country at the present time. However, the superannuation amendment in this bill is the aspect that is of most interest to me and to coalition senators, and is the focus of my brief contribution this evening. 


This reform is about making sure we have a superannuation system that actually meets the needs of today's modern workforce. I am referring specifically to the fact that there are a large number of Australians in the community who have multiple superannuation accounts. It is a phenomena, I suspect, that is particularly widespread amongst younger Australians as they take employment opportunities, test their skills and decide for themselves what the vocations are that they aspire to in their later years. There was a time, probably more so in my parent's generation than in my own, that you took a job with one organisation or company and you stayed with that organisation or company right through your working career—that is certainly true of my father's working career—but for most Australians, and particularly younger Australians, these days are long gone. 


We have a situation where people develop their skills and move onwards and upwards with various different employers. I think that is something that should be encouraged as young people and not-so-young people test their skills, move in and out of the workforce and take advantage of employment that best suits their particular needs or their family's needs at any point in time. That upward economic mobility, if that is a term I can use, should be celebrated. It makes us more competitive; it makes us more flexible; and ultimately it makes us a more prosperous nation. 


But, of course, it also means superannuation accounts are being established, used to make deposits for a couple of years and then, more often than not, forgotten about as people move on to new opportunities and chose to go with new employers and their preferred or default superannuation fund. In fact, we know that about 70 per cent of Australians simply sign up with the default superannuation provided by their employer without any real active consideration in regards to its suitability or how it might fit with previous superannuation accounts that they might already have in existence. 


We also know that 45 per cent of working Australians have more than one superannuation account. I suspect that trend is growing. I am sure a good many people have every intention of consolidating their hard-earned moneys into one pot but life does get busy and life does go on, and those sorts of administrative things more often than not get put off and get put off until they are forgotten about altogether. Consequently, these various amounts of superannuation sit idle and if you have a few accounts with money in them, these sums can total up to a significant amount over time. As we all understand when it comes to retirement incomes, every penny counts. 


As the law currently stands, these forgotten accounts will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office for safekeeping after five years if the provider has lost contact with the account owner and the account has less than $2,000 in it. The benefit of that scenario is that it can then be held until the original owner is found. While the ATO holds the account, the owner of the account is not being charged fees or premiums, which ultimately can swallow up or eat away at these savings and line the pockets of others instead of being used by the person who earned the money to fund their retirement in the first instance. 


However, more significantly, the Australian Taxation Office will pay a reclaimed account with interest in line with CPI. That means we are not just preserving the superannuation account and protecting it from being frozen, but if the account holder is located and can be linked back to their superannuation account then the Australian Taxation Office will pay a reclaimed account with interest in line with the CPI—that has to be a good thing for Australian superannuation holders. 


The provisions of this legalisation will boost that $2,000 threshold, which is quite a low balance in terms of superannuation accounts being held these days. The reforms contained within the bill will see the threshold gradually move to $4,000 and then progressively upwards to $6,000. This move will mean that more of these forgotten accounts can be captured and held until such time as they are reunited with the person who actually earned the money. This is an imminently sensible change, one that takes account of an increasingly mobile and flexible workforce. I will add to that: this is a very fair outcome.


This measure was first announced by the former Labor government in its 2013-14 budget. Quite soon after coming to office, though, the coalition announced that it would continue with this measure as intended. The government's decision to proceed with the increase to the small or lost member superannuation account threshold is a sensible measure. I have no trouble saying that. I am sure my colleagues— 


Debate adjourned.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:27):  At the outset I inform the Senate that Labor's position is to support the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. I expect that would not be surprising to anyone who followed the debate on this bill in the other place, given that two-thirds of the bill are measures from previous Labor budgets. The bill implements previous Labor integrity measures on capital gains tax, rollovers and lost member superannuation accounts, and it unifies the tax treatment of all civilian and Australian government employees who work overseas. It is greatly pleasing that the government is proceeding with some of the measures that Labor had planned to implement. Up until recently, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the sole purpose of the government was to tear down prior achievements of Labor governments. So, it is good to see a tax and superannuation laws amendment bill that indeed implements these sensible integrity measures.


Going to schedule 1, improving the integrity of the scrip-for-scrip rollover, we welcome the government's move to implement our integrity measures on scrip-for-scrip rollovers. The scrip-for-scrip rollover regime ensures that tax considerations are not an impediment to takeovers or mergers involving companies or trusts. Recent court cases have shed light on the tax minimisation opportunities arising from ambiguity in the existing legislation. This reform, first announced by Labor in 2012, prevents entities from indefinitely deferring capital gains tax obligations and greater consistency to the taxation of trusts.


Schedule 2 is the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. The opposition is comfortable with the government's efforts to boost the integrity of our personal income tax system by standardising the tax treatment for workers delivering overseas development assistance. This integrity measure improves the consistency of our personal income tax system by upholding the principle that Australians should pay tax on their earnings somewhere. This provision was originally introduced to ensure that aid workers working overseas were not taxed on their income both in Australia and in the source country. However, the provision no longer serves this purpose, with Australians working overseas often able to avoid income tax in both jurisdictions.


While we welcome efforts to tighten the tax net, I contrast the government's approach to the issue of double taxation of individuals with its approach to the double taxation of corporations. Earlier this year Labor announced a multinational tax package which included a measure for tackling hybrid instruments. Under our proposal, we are allowing the Australian Taxation Office to look at how a hybrid instrument is treated by an overseas jurisdiction essentially to ensure that a hybrid instrument could not, effectively, avoid tax in multiple jurisdictions. It is striking that, while the government is willing to tackle this issue in the case of aid workers, it is not willing to tackle the same issue when it comes to big multinational corporations. The principle is a sensible one. Multinational corporations are looking at how a hybrid instrument is treated by the tax regime of another country and how it is treated by the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office should not be blind to the way in which an overseas tax office treats a hybrid instrument.


Unfortunately, while the Treasurer has been talking about acting on multinational tax for over a year and we have heard, again, the promise that he will act, we are yet to see actual legislation. By contrast, Labor's multinational tax plan, announced in the first half of this parliamentary term, would raise more than $7 billion over the decade. It is informed by work in the OECD and has been carefully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.


Schedule 3 of this bill covers the small lost member account threshold. Labor will support raising the threshold at which the government collects small lost member superannuation accounts. Labor invented Australia's universal superannuation system. It was fought hard against by the coalition at the time. When the Keating government introduced universal superannuation in the early 1990s, those opposite railed against universal superannuation. I remember going out and fighting for this on the job as a union official, trying to get equal access to superannuation for blue-collar workers, predominantly in places where white-collar workers had access to superannuation but blue-collar workers did not and where white-collar workers could vest their superannuation and blue-collar workers could not—all issues opposed by those opposite. 


Before the 1996 election, the coalition promised not to tinker with superannuation but then froze the superannuation contribution rate throughout the period of the Howard government. History repeated itself in 2013 when the then opposition promised that they would not make adverse, unexpected changes to superannuation but went ahead and froze the super contribution rate at 9½ per cent, not allowing it to continue on its planned trajectory to 12 per cent, which would have guaranteed a more dignified retirement for many Australians.


The system of collecting lost member accounts is sensible. It is easy for Australians to be reunited with their lost superannuation accounts using a simple tool available on the tax office website. But the decision that the government made in the past was that when accounts fell below a certain amount they should be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office to ensure they were not completely eaten up by fees and charges. Many young people know the experience of moving from casual job to casual job, ending up with a collection of superannuation accounts and wanting to consolidate those accounts. Before we had the lost super regime, those accounts would often be gone within a matter of months. Thanks to the lost super regime these accounts, when found, contain a reasonable chunk of money—about what the individual put in.


In May 2012, Labor increased the threshold at which an account could be shifted to the ATO from $200 to $2,000. In the 2013 budget, Labor proposed an incremental increase in the threshold from $2,000 to $6,000. I note in passing that when it comes to unclaimed moneys the coalition is happy to run a scare campaign with crazy talk of 'trousering', with the suggestion that anyone who believes in having a different duration after which bank accounts should be moved to the government is somehow trying to steal people's money. At the same time we have a government bill in the Senate whose effect is going to be to move more superannuation accounts to the government. The principle in both cases is the same: we want to make sure that people who have lost their bank accounts or their superannuation accounts do not find them again only to discover there is nothing in them. We also want to guard against the possibility that someone who has simply not accessed an account for a while may not want it transferred to the government. The thresholds—duration or financial—aim to get that balance right. But the government is clearly pursuing an approach to superannuation accounts that is somewhat different from its approach to bank accounts.


In the spirit of constructive bipartisanship, Labor will support this measure. We do so knowing that, as of 30 June this year, over 14 million Australians have a superannuation fund account and approximately 45 per cent of these people have more than one account. We know, through figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, that the median figure for fees and charges for low-cost superannuation accounts is $532 a year. If a person has a superannuation balance of $1,000, they will see it entirely eroded by fees and charges in a couple of years. That is the principle of lost super laws, which see accounts moved to the tax office when they fall below a certain threshold—currently $2,000 but, under this bill, $6,000. These measures will, hopefully, ensure that low wage workers and those working casual jobs are able to retire in more dignity, knowing that their accounts have not been eaten up by fees and charges. 


At the same time, it is not possible to talk about super in this place without acknowledging that there is only one party of government in this parliament who believes that our superannuation tax concessions are not fair and not sustainable. The age pension is set to grow around five per cent a year over the next four years. The government says that the age pension is out of control because of that, but superannuation tax concessions are growing at more than four times this rate. The earnings concessions alone are set to double over the next four years to more than $30 billion. It will soon be the case that we spend more on superannuation tax concessions than we spend on the age pension entirely. 


A Grattan Institute report on tax reform found that more than half of the benefits of super tax concessions go to the top 20 per cent of households. Indeed, the top one per cent of households gains more from our super tax concessions than the bottom 40 per cent. To improve the fairness and sustainability of our superannuation system, the opposition has made clear that we will ensure that earnings in excess of $75,000 in the retirement phase are taxed at a concessional rate of 15 per cent rather than being tax-free. This represents a partial unwinding of one of Peter Costello's many imprudent decisions in the late phase of the Howard government—this one removing entirely the tax-free status of earnings in the pension phase. That is a measure which has disproportionately benefited high-income earners and done little to take pressure off the age pension but instead had the effect of acting as a windfall for those who are able to recycle their earnings through the superannuation system. 


Labor do not propose to entirely reverse that Costello decision of 2006. But we do propose, if we are fortunate enough to win government, to ensure that earnings over $75,000—and just the marginal amount over $75,000—are subject to a 15 per cent tax rate. We have also indicated that we will lower the threshold for the 15 per cent high-income superannuation charge from $300,000 to $250,000. Those two measures together save the budget in excess of $14 billion over the decade. They are responsible, they are fair and they will put our superannuation system on a more sustainable footing for the future.


Labor is hardly a voice in the wilderness amongst those who believe that our superannuation settings need to change. We can go through those who support some changes to our superannuation system, and we will start with the Secretary to the Treasury, John Fraser. The government's own tax white paper asked the question, 'Are Australia's superannuation tax concessions sustainable?' A range of groups across the political spectrum have called for the government to engage in a sensible debate over superannuation tax concessions. They include the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, AustralianSuper, the Grattan Institute and Rice Warner actuaries. Indeed, the recent reform summit cosponsored by The Australian newspaper and the Financial Review newspaper saw, as part of its communique, a recognition that we need to look carefully at our superannuation tax concessions. We need to make sure that they are fair for this generation and fair for generations to come, such as students.


What does the government have to say about these unfair and unsustainable superannuation concessions? It depends on who you ask in the government, as with many things. The Treasurer—for the moment—Mr Hockey, has refused to rule out changes, but the former Prime Minister slammed the door on him, having said that there would be no changes whatsoever. Now it falls to the new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to set aside the policy approach of his predecessor and engage with the opposition in some constructive reform.


Labor's policy on superannuation is one which has been announced early in this term of government. We did that in order to promote exactly the sort of healthy public debate that I know some on the opposite side of the chamber believe in. We recognise that superannuation changes are not universally popular, and that is why we have begun the community conversation about Labor's changes. Yes, they raise $14 billion over the next decade, but they do so by reversing a Peter Costello change, which I hope those opposite no longer believe was a fiscally prudent one, and by changing the high-income superannuation charge.


But the real question here is where the government stands. It is unusual for a member of the opposition to be saying this, but we do not know. Mr Hockey does not want to rule out any changes, but the Mr Abbott did want to rule out changes. What does Mr Turnbull believe? We know indeed that the government was considering making superannuation changes right up until the day Labor announced its policy package. Indeed, plausibly, some of the talented Treasury officials sitting in the boxes today were working on the memorandums that we know— thanks to freedom of information laws—were being sent up to the government during this period. We know that there were four briefs that went to the government in the lead-up to the 2015 budget, but they stopped on a particular day. No prizes for guessing which day that was—that was the day that Labor made its superannuation announcement. How is that a coincidence? As always, we have the government playing politics over the policy. 


Let us be clear: when we are talking about superannuation, as this bill does, we need to recognise the role of the superannuation tax concessions. They do two things. They recognise the public benefit in reducing the number of people who claim the age pension, and they recognise the public benefit in having a larger pool of savings. That second public benefit is tangible and was important in the global financial crisis but surely must be accorded less weight than the first. For people with multimillions in their superannuation accounts, Labor says: 'Good luck to you. Congratulations, but you should not necessarily be claiming the same superannuation tax concessions as you did in the past.'


Labor's policy is costed and sustainable and is something which I hope the government will engage on. I hope the government will go back to those excellent briefs which I am sure were being prepared for them by the Department of the Treasury in the lead-up to Labor's announcement and will come to a bipartisan consensus with Labor to make sure that our super tax concessions can be sustainable in the future. We have no problem with the government's proposal to increase the threshold for collecting lost members' accounts, but we want to make sure that the government engage in the bigger conversation over superannuation concessions. It is such an important conversation, particularly for those of us on this side of the chamber, who were responsible for creating universal superannuation and who will continue to defend a strong and accessible superannuation system.


Labor calls on the Prime Minister to get over the false start that he has had, the bad start that he has had, as Prime Minister of this country by conceding to the claims of the National Party to do things that are not in the national interest and only in a sectional interest. Prime Minister Turnbull has not started well. Prime Minister Turnbull has started by caving in to the National Party, and we know what that means in terms of good economic policy in this country. If you cave in to the National Party, you end up causing problems for the economic future of this country. The National Party are narrowly focused. The National Party are concerned only for their own interests, not for the interests of the regions that they have seats in. They do not look after rural communities and they do not look after Indigenous communities; they do not look after their health and they do not look after their education. Yet this new Prime Minister has caved in to the Luddites in the National Party. He has started off weakly; he has started off badly. It does not fill anyone with confidence that there will be any change. We know there will be no change because we know this Prime Minister supports the first bad budget, so he supports bad economics and bad policy.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-09-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  I rise to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. The specific aspect of this bill that I want to deal with is that of the exemption of income earned in overseas employment. This looks like another unfair tax measure, where we have an inconsistency, and questions need to be answered by Labor, Liberals and Nationals about why they would support this inconsistency. 


This measure really does penalise workers who work for the government on overseas aid projects. We are talking about people employed and paid for out of overseas development assistance. Under the current law all employees of an Australian government agency who work overseas for not fewer than 91 continuous days delivering ODA are exempted from payment of income tax on the income they earn while overseas. It might sound fair that we need to tidy that up, but that exemption is not being removed for all workers who are paid out of the government coffers.


The amendments ensure that all employees of an Australian government agency will be treated equally, in that they will now be subject to income tax on overseas income they have earned in the delivery of ODA. We are being told that there is an issue of fairness here and that there needs to be an evening out of the current system, but it is only to do with ODA. When you look into it more deeply, you find considerable discrimination. The change, which is in schedule 2 of the bill, means that overseas development assistance workers employed by the government will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. We know this is discriminatory because tax exemptions are being retained for workers in private companies, the Australian Federal Police and the military. This is where we need an explanation, because the Greens certainly support consistency, but we need some fair consistency in how this works.


If workers in private NGOs, the Australian Federal Police and the military will retain their tax exemption status, why shouldn't all government employees do so? I have not been able to find anything in the explanatory memorandum to the bill or in the second reading speech to clarify this. What we find buried in this legislation is that it does penalise workers who choose to work for the government in delivering ODA. If they are working for the government delivering ODA project services, this provision will now apply to them, where it did not previously. This is where we have to look at this measure closely. It looks very discriminatory. 


It is also relevant to consider the changes that have been made recently to overseas aid. We have seen a massive decrease in money—$11 billion—for overseas aid. Under this government we now have language about overseas aid having to be about the national interest—not the national interest in relieving poverty in low-income countries but Australia's national interest. I have looked at this issue closely for a long time. When one sees this measure, which discriminates against government workers employed under ODA but not against those in the private sector who are linked with aid, one has to ask questions. And those questions should be answered. As I say again, it looks very discriminatory. I did not hear any explanation as to why Labor signed off on this. 


This measure is largely hidden. To be frank about it, we only came across it recently. Again I want to emphasise that the Greens support consistency in terms of tax measures—that is fair—but we are not getting consistency here. Although, when you look at how it is set out on page 25 of the explanatory memorandum, you would think that it was fair, because we are told:


These amendments ensure that all employees of an Australian government agency are treated equally …


Those are the first words—I read them out earlier. When you read on, you find that we are only talking about ODA; we are not talking about those measures applying to AFP officers and the military. 


We will return to this in the committee stage of the bill. I do hope that we get a fuller explanation, because right now it seems that buried in this legislation is something that is unfair and discriminatory.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:52):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill 2015. This is a bill of unrelated tax and super measures. I will go through the three schedules in relation to each element of the bill.


The first schedule relates to improving the integrity of the scrip for scrip rollover relief rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act following a 2009 decision of the Federal Court. Secondly, this bill will end the personal income tax exemption of wages under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act earned by some Australian government employees who work overseas for more than 91 days delivering official development assistance. Thirdly, it will increase the super account balance below which small lost super accounts will be required to be transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation under the provisions of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999. I will deal with the first schedule and then go on to the other ones in order.


It is normal practice for a company acquiring or merging with another company to offer its own shares as payment for the acquired company. Normally, such an event, which, in effect, amounts to a disposal of shares, would create capital gains tax liability. However, in certain circumstances, an entity may be able to defer paying capital gains tax until a later capital gains tax event. This is where a scrip for scrip rollover becomes a possibility. A scrip for scrip rollover is the deferral of a liability where: the owner of the asset chooses to take advantage of these provisions; the owner acquired its interest in the company being sold on or after 20 September 1985; the exchange of shares which results in a capital gain occurs on or after 10 December 1999; the exchange of shares results in the purchasing company gaining at least 80 per cent of the equity of the target company or trust; holders of voting interest in the acquired entity can participate in the merger or takeover on substantially the same terms; and the purchase bid does not contravene key provisions in chapter 6 of the Corporations Act or, if the target entity is a company, it includes a scheme of arrangement approved by the court under part 5 of the Corporations Act. Similar provisions apply to allow the deferral of capital gains tax where one trust acquires units in another trust. However, scrip for scrip rollover capital gains tax relief is not available if a share is exchanged for a unit or other interest in a fixed trust or if a unit or other interest in a fixed trust is exchanged for a share. Generally, foreign residents for tax purposes cannot take advantage of these provisions.


The origin of the proposed changes in schedule 1 is that they arise from a decision of the Federal Court in AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation in 2009. Briefly, this case examined whether two parties were dealing with one another on an arms-length basis and whether their arrangements invoked the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Neither issue is being addressed by the proposed amendments in schedule 1, but the decision in this case left open opportunities to unduly avoid capital gains tax. 


The proposed amendments involve subdivision 124-M of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This subdivision contains provisions to deny scrip for scrip rollover relief in circumstances where the same person or company group has influence over both the selling company and the purchasing company. According to the explanatory memorandum of the bill, subdivision 124-M treated the AXA arrangement as a genuine takeover involving a substantial change in ownership rather than as a corporate restructure. As result, AXA was able to obtain the benefit of a capital gains tax cost base uplift when eventually disposing of one of its subsidiaries.


A restructure of an entity that involves the sale of a business into a different entity, such as the sale of a business from a trust to a company, will inevitably result in an uplift to the cost base to the acquiring entity for that asset. For example, a family trust conducts a successful retail business with goodwill worth around $1.5 million, but, due to problems with distributions to a corporate beneficiary, it decides to dispose of the business to a new company which it established. The trust vendor finances the purchase price. Thus, the newly created company now has the goodwill and the cost base of $1.5 million. The revenue earned by the company can be used for the loan payable to the trust. When the company sells the business, it can use the cost base of $1.5 million. However, because the parties to the transaction are not at arm's length, an independent evaluation of the business asset should be undertaken. The explanatory memorandum notes that the AXA case demonstrates that these integrity provisions can be circumvented. This can occur by:


… temporarily suppressing the ownership rights of a party in a scrip for scrip exchange through the use of instruments including convertible shares, options and rights.


Later, these transactions can be reversed, so that a transfer of ownership is accomplished without raising a capital gains tax liability that might otherwise occur. The proposed amendments seek to alter these integrity provisions so that this inappropriate tax relief would not occur.


This measure was first announced as part of the previous government's 2012-13 budget. The Treasury released a consultation on this matter back in July 2012, and it received only one submission in response. The coalition government announced that it was proceeding with this measure in December 2013, and in April 2015 the Treasury released an exposure draft of legislation containing the proposed provisions.


I will now move on to schedule 2 of this bill, which is removing the exemption of income earned from overseas employment. As it says in the Bills Digest:


Since 1964, under Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a ‘diplomatic agent’ is exempt from personal income tax of the host country on income sourced from that agent’s home country. For the purposes of this Convention a diplomatic agent is the head of the mission or a member of the diplomatic staff of the mission. Thus Australian government staff, attached to an Australian diplomatic mission, are exempt from the host country personal income tax where that host country has signed this Convention (and the overwhelming majority of host countries have now signed).


Under section 23AG of the ITAA—


the Income Tax Assessment Act—


the foreign earnings of Australian residents for tax purposes, who have been engaged in foreign service for a continuous period of not less than 91 days, are also exempt from Australian personal income tax. This applies to periods of foreign service arising from:


the delivery of Australian official development assistance by the person’s employer


the activities of the person’s employer in operating a public fund that is a deductable gift recipient operating internationally


the person’s employment by a prescribed institution which is located outside Australia and is exempt from income tax in the country in which it is resident; or is a prescribed institution that has a physical presence in Australia but which incurs its expenditure and pursues its objectives principally outside Australia or


the person’s deployment outside Australia as a member of a disciplined force (armed forces or police).


Therefore, those persons attached to Australian diplomatic missions, who are Australian residents for taxation purposes, meeting the requirements of section 23AG of the ITAA 1936, engaged in foreign services for not less than 91 days are exempt from both Australian and host country personal income tax regimes on their foreign income.


Those Australian residents engaged in foreign services, that do not meet the requirements of section 23AG of the ITAA 1936, are subject to Australian personal income tax; for example ordinary Australian diplomatic staff on foreign postings.


The Explanatory Memorandum notes that this exemption under section 23AG was originally provided to avoid double taxation of those engaged in government service.


I will now move on to talk about schedule 3 of this bill. As it says in the Bills Digest:


As individuals move between jobs it is possible that superannuation payments made on their behalf are paid to different funds. Sometimes this is a deliberate choice made by the individual or is the result of restrictions on moving balances between funds (such as for certain defined benefit schemes). If an individual does not make a choice about their superannuation fund upon commencing employment, it is likely that they will be a member of multiple funds.


The holding of multiple superannuation accounts may disadvantage individuals through the imposition of fixed administration fees. Multiple accounts can also impose additional costs on the superannuation system. However, it is important not to assume that each individual should only have a single account. Multiple accounts may be an active choice that a member makes to obtain certain insurance benefits, to facilitate investment choice or as a transition to retirement arrangement.


…   …   …


Certain ‘lost’ accounts are required to be identified and transferred biannually from superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to the Commissioner of Taxation.


While the identification of lost superannuation has been part of superannuation industry arrangements since 1996, requirements for the transfer of these funds to the Commissioner of Taxation first applied from 1 July 2010, after being announced in the 2009-10 Budget. Prior to this, these funds remained with the relevant superannuation fund or were transferred to eligible roll-over funds. At that time, the transfer to the Commissioner of Taxation of these funds was expected to increase net revenue by almost $230 million over the period 2010-11 to 2012-13.


…   …   …


The justification for the transfer of such funds—which was already in place for unclaimed bank account and life insurance fund moneys—was that it would improve the efficiency of the superannuation system overall by removing the need for superannuation funds to administer or apply member protection to small accounts that are transferred and improve the equity for other members of the fund that were cross-subsidising the member protection arrangements.


The requirements to be a ‘lost member’ are set out in the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997 and Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994. These require the account holder to be ‘uncontactable’ or ‘inactive’:


the account holder is ‘uncontactable’ if:


– the provider has never had an address for the account holder or


– at least one written communication has been sent to the account holder’s last known address and has been returned unclaimed


and the provider has not received a contribution or roll-over in respect of the account holder within the last 12 months


the account holder is ‘inactive’ if the account has been held for more than two years and the provider has not received a contribution or roll-over in respect of the account within the last five years. The regulations provide for account holders to be permanently excluded from being ‘lost’ if they have indicated by some positive act or another contact that they wish to continue with the provider.


There are two strands to a superannuation account being classified as a ‘lost member account’ under the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999:


the first relates to ‘small accounts’, which are taken to be the accounts of lost members (as defined by the Regulations above) with an account balance that is less than the specified threshold in paragraph 24B(1)(b) of the Act—currently $2,000


the second relates to ‘inactive accounts of unidentifiable members’, which are taken to be the accounts of lost members (as defined by the Regulations above) where:


– the superannuation provider has not received an amount in respect of the member within the last 12 months and


– the superannuation provider is satisfied that it will never be possible for the provider, having regard to the information reasonably available to the provider, to pay an amount to the member.


Schedule 3 of this Bill proposes to change the account balance threshold relating to ‘small accounts’ from $2,000 to $4,000 from 31 December 2015 and then to $6,000 from 31 December 2016.


With the time that remains to me I would like to go through some of the key issues contained in the schedules of this bill, starting with schedule 1 of the methods for dealing with potential tax loopholes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The proposed methods are:


to include any interests involved in a scrip for scrip rollover that are convertible shares, options, rights or similar interests in the calculations of equity interests involved in a scrip for scrip roll-over between the parties in these arrangements


where debt is involved the proposed solution is to remove the debt sheltering opportunity arising from the current disregarding of a capital gain arising on the settlement of a debt owed, as part of a scrip for scrip acquisition, by an acquiring company to its ultimate holding company and


where trusts are involved in a scrip for scrip roll-over, the proposed solution is to extend the operation of the new provisions so that they apply to trusts as well as to companies.


…   …   …


Item 4 of Schedule 1 amends section 127-780 of the ITAA 1997 to add a new condition for a scrip for scrip roll-over to apply. This new condition is that where a purchasing entity is part of a wholly owned group, no member of that group may issue equity (other than the necessary replacement equity), or owe new debt:


to an entity that is not a member of that wholly owned group and


in relation to the issue of a replacement interest as part of that purchasing arrangement. This prevents other members of a wholly owned group from issuing unnecessary debt or equity to third parties that can be used to avoid CGT—


capital gains tax—


obligations.


Under section 124-780—


of the Income Tax Assessment Act—


only an original interest holder can obtain a roll-over of share interests. Under section 124-781 only an original interest holder can obtain a roll-over of trust interests. The transfer of a cost base for the purposes of a scrip for scrip roll-over can, under section 124-782, only be applied to the holder of an ‘original interest’ in an entity who is either a significant stake holder or a common stake holder. This makes the definitions of the terms ‘significant stake’ and ‘common stake’ critical for the functioning of the scrip for scrip roll-over provisions. Both terms are defined at section 124-783 and apply where the entities involved are not ‘widely-held’—that is they have less than 300 shareholders (if they are a company) or beneficiaries (if they are a trust).


An entity has a ‘significant stake’ in a company if it and its associates own shares with 30 per cent or more of the voting rights, or the right to receive 30 per cent or more of any dividends or capital distributions (subsection 124-783(6)).


An entity has, or two or more entities have, a ‘common stake’ if they and their associates own shares with 80 per cent or more of the voting rights, or the right to receive 80 per cent or more of any dividends or capital distributions … 


Equivalent tests are applied to trusts …

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2015-09-15,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:12):  I am glad to rise and make a contribution on this bill, the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 4) Bill, because it is one of those important, if not exactly very exciting, pieces of legislation that will better align our superannuation system with the realities of our day-to-day lives. The bill makes three changes—two to our tax laws and one, of course, to superannuation law. The two tax changes are part of the government's determined effort to make our tax system fairer and more robust, and I am sure that is an aspiration that all of us in this chamber would support. We want to make sure that everybody pays their fair share of tax and that there are no loopholes in our tax system that afford any unfair advantage to some over others based on their ability to gain the system. I would add to that coalition senators would also aspire to Australians paying the least amount of tax they possibly can.


These two changes are integrity measure that will remove the ability of certain companies, trusts and individuals to obtain an unfair tax advantage that was never intended for them. This will make our tax system harder to circumvent and more sustainable for the future. These changes will remove the ability for some entities to access tax relief from the Australian taxpayer when two merging companies are owned by the same people or the same business. This will be achieved by making definitions clearer and by ensuring that the integrity structure cannot be circumvented by businesses, trusts or companies. These changes will make our system stronger and easier to understand—a simpler, clearer set of rules for business is in the best interests of job creation and stimulating economic growth, which everyone would agree are the key priorities of economic reform for our country at the present time. However, the superannuation amendment in this bill is the aspect that is of most interest to me and to coalition senators, and is the focus of my brief contribution this evening. 


This reform is about making sure we have a superannuation system that actually meets the needs of today's modern workforce. I am referring specifically to the fact that there are a large number of Australians in the community who have multiple superannuation accounts. It is a phenomena, I suspect, that is particularly widespread amongst younger Australians as they take employment opportunities, test their skills and decide for themselves what the vocations are that they aspire to in their later years. There was a time, probably more so in my parent's generation than in my own, that you took a job with one organisation or company and you stayed with that organisation or company right through your working career—that is certainly true of my father's working career—but for most Australians, and particularly younger Australians, these days are long gone. 


We have a situation where people develop their skills and move onwards and upwards with various different employers. I think that is something that should be encouraged as young people and not-so-young people test their skills, move in and out of the workforce and take advantage of employment that best suits their particular needs or their family's needs at any point in time. That upward economic mobility, if that is a term I can use, should be celebrated. It makes us more competitive; it makes us more flexible; and ultimately it makes us a more prosperous nation. 


But, of course, it also means superannuation accounts are being established, used to make deposits for a couple of years and then, more often than not, forgotten about as people move on to new opportunities and chose to go with new employers and their preferred or default superannuation fund. In fact, we know that about 70 per cent of Australians simply sign up with the default superannuation provided by their employer without any real active consideration in regards to its suitability or how it might fit with previous superannuation accounts that they might already have in existence. 


We also know that 45 per cent of working Australians have more than one superannuation account. I suspect that trend is growing. I am sure a good many people have every intention of consolidating their hard-earned moneys into one pot but life does get busy and life does go on, and those sorts of administrative things more often than not get put off and get put off until they are forgotten about altogether. Consequently, these various amounts of superannuation sit idle and if you have a few accounts with money in them, these sums can total up to a significant amount over time. As we all understand when it comes to retirement incomes, every penny counts. 


As the law currently stands, these forgotten accounts will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office for safekeeping after five years if the provider has lost contact with the account owner and the account has less than $2,000 in it. The benefit of that scenario is that it can then be held until the original owner is found. While the ATO holds the account, the owner of the account is not being charged fees or premiums, which ultimately can swallow up or eat away at these savings and line the pockets of others instead of being used by the person who earned the money to fund their retirement in the first instance. 


However, more significantly, the Australian Taxation Office will pay a reclaimed account with interest in line with CPI. That means we are not just preserving the superannuation account and protecting it from being frozen, but if the account holder is located and can be linked back to their superannuation account then the Australian Taxation Office will pay a reclaimed account with interest in line with the CPI—that has to be a good thing for Australian superannuation holders. 


The provisions of this legalisation will boost that $2,000 threshold, which is quite a low balance in terms of superannuation accounts being held these days. The reforms contained within the bill will see the threshold gradually move to $4,000 and then progressively upwards to $6,000. This move will mean that more of these forgotten accounts can be captured and held until such time as they are reunited with the person who actually earned the money. This is an imminently sensible change, one that takes account of an increasingly mobile and flexible workforce. I will add to that: this is a very fair outcome.


This measure was first announced by the former Labor government in its 2013-14 budget. Quite soon after coming to office, though, the coalition announced that it would continue with this measure as intended. The government's decision to proceed with the increase to the small or lost member superannuation account threshold is a sensible measure. I have no trouble saying that. I am sure my colleagues—

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I wish tonight to talk about the Australian flag. On 3 September 114 years ago, a bit of cloth—a blue flag, our flag—11 metres long and five and a half metres wide was raised for the first time from the main dome of the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, then the home of our Commonwealth parliament. Whether on the battlefield or sporting grounds or diplomatic posts or schools or homes—just like mine on the Sunshine Coast—right across this country, the Australian flag, that blue flag of stars and crosses, has come to symbolise our young Federation and the values for which we stand. 


The origins of our flag are rather unique. In April 1901, the Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, announced that a competition would be held to design a federal Australian flag. Over 32,000 entries were received with five near-identical entries being awarded equal first place and sharing in the prize of 200 pounds. On 3 September 1901, at approximately half past two, the Prime Minister announced the winning design and that bit of cloth, that blue flag was raised. 


The Commonwealth star—originally six pointed—represented the six colonies that united to become the Commonwealth. The seventh point was added in December 1908 to represent all of the federal territories, which when combined with the states constituted the nation. 


The five-star Southern Cross, an ancient and constant presence in our night sky, represents our place in the world; and the Union Jack, comprising the crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick, serves to represent the principles and ideals inherited from the United Kingdom on which our nation was founded: parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, freedom of speech and the liberty of the individual. 


This flag, our flag, was flown for the first time at the Olympic Games in St Louis in 1904, where there was only one Australian competing. In 1908, all military establishments were ordered to fly the flag. On Christmas Day 1912, Frank Wild, a member of Sir Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition, raised the flag to take possession of Queen Mary Land, which is now part of the Australian Antarctic Territory. 


In theatres of war—in Europe, the Pacific, the jungles of Papua New Guinea and Vietnam, East Timor, Afghanistan, the Middle East and in many other places—the Australian flag has been flown as a beacon of the freedoms and liberties for which countless brave Australian men and women have fought. I believe that all serving Australian Defence Force personnel should be gifted an Australian flag to honour their service to their nation. It disappointed me, when I was recently in the Middle East, meeting with serving personnel of the Australian Defence Force, to find out that they had had to buy their own flags to take over with them. I call upon the government to make sure that all who serve in the Australian Defence Force are given a flag, rather than being forced to go on the internet and pay money for one, and I will be writing to the new Prime Minister to ask him to make this one of the first acts of his government.


The Flags Act was personally signed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in February 1954. And I digress to congratulate—along with my good friend Senator Smith here—Her Majesty on becoming the longest reigning monarch in British and Australian history. Her Majesty has served Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth nations with grace and dignity for over 63½ years, a reassuring figure in what is sometimes an uncertain world. The Flags Act 1953 was amended to require that a referendum of all Australians be held in order to change the flag. 


Australian National Flag Day, on 3 September, is an occasion on which to reflect on this national symbol and the values it represents, and organisations such as the Australian National Flag Association do great work in building community understanding of the flag and its history. I am an ardent supporter of free speech—the right of people to be quite rude about each other. However, I do find it reprehensible when hooligans and troublemakers who have no respect for Australian values, of for the sacrifices of those who fought for those values, burn, damage or otherwise desecrate our flag. It is my belief that burning or damaging with criminal intent the Australian flag should be an offence, and I note that my colleague George Christensen in the other place intends to introduce a bill to amend the Flags Act— (Time expired)
