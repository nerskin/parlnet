"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—Mr Speaker, my purpose today is to explain to the House and through it to the Australian people the government's belief that the world community must deal decisively with Iraq; why Iraq's continued defiance of the United Nations and its possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability poses a real and unacceptable threat to the stability and security of our world; why the matters at stake go to the very credibility of the United Nations itself; why the issue is of direct concern to Australia and why, therefore, the Australian government has authorised the forward positioning of elements of the Australian Defence Force to the Persian Gulf.
Although there is considerable debate about the best course of action to resolve this crisis I want, for a moment, to focus on the one thing that unites us all—and that is a common abhorrence of war.
I know that in this I speak for every member of this House, every Australian. We, all of us, hope that it will still prove possible to find an outcome acceptable to the international community without military force being used. The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored.
The other point of agreement shared by members in this House, by our community and by the community of nations is that Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction—for the security and stability of our world, it must be disarmed.
For years the nations of the world have sought to persuade Iraq to abandon these most offensive of weapons. The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, has refused to comply and now the weight of the world's attention has fallen on him.
Only one nation can determine whether force will be necessary or not. Only one nation, acting alone, can make the choice for peace. That nation is Iraq.
Full disclosure by Iraq of its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs and immediate and total cooperation by Iraq with the provisions of resolution 1441 of the Security Council will remove the need for military action.
In his report to the Security Council, Dr Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations weapons inspection body for Iraq, made it clear where he believed that the responsibility for the current terrible impasse lay, and I quote:
Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.
Of at least one thing we can all be absolutely certain—if the world turns its back on the threat posed by Iraq, if the community of nations gives up because it is all too hard, then Saddam Hussein will not reward us all with benign behaviour.
Such weakness, such an abject failure of international will, will—as in the past—be treated with contempt.
Iraq will not only keep her current weapons but add to them. Saddam Hussein will not abandon his chemical and biological weapons programs. He will keep striving to build a nuclear capacity. And he will almost certainly, at some time in the future, use these weapons to fulfil his ambition to dominate his region.
Given his aggressive history, who could blame his neighbours, when faced with an Iraq allowed to keep, through the default of the international community, weapons of mass destruction, if they decided that their own security necessitated a corresponding arsenal.
Worse still, other rogue states observing the world community's failure to deal with Iraq will be encouraged to flout the international conventions on arms control and develop their own chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons.
We should all be deeply concerned about a world in which weapons of mass destruction become the norm. The more nations that possess these weapons, the greater the risk there is that they will be used. The likelihood of them falling into the hands of terrorists multiplies as their numbers proliferate. Proliferation of these weapons will make the world a much more dangerous place for all of us.
Through failure to deal once and for all with Iraq, the world will have effectively given a green light to the further spread of these weapons and will have further undermined the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and the conventions on chemical and biological weapons which the world—and not least Australia—has worked so hard to build over the last 30 years or more.
At the heart of this debate must be a recognition of the threat posed to the security of the world through the progressive breakdown of the international covenants against proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spread of chemical and biological weapons.
The world has developed over time a series of treaties, conventions, protocols and control regimes both to prevent the proliferation of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and, where possible, to eliminate such of these weapons as may now exist.
Australia is vehemently opposed to the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We do not possess these weapons and we wish to ensure that they do not become an acceptable part of every nation's arsenal. They are too dangerous. Their destructive power is hundreds of times greater than that of conventional weapons—terrible as they may be. Their destructive force is not easily contained or controlled and their effects can span the generations. These are no ordinary weapons.
Every time a nation is allowed to undermine the international treaties and agreements put in place to restrict or prohibit the spread of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, the world becomes more dangerous for all nations.
Australia—under both coalition and Labor governments—has been a staunch supporter and active proponent of multilateral action to stop the spread of these weapons.
We, therefore, have a direct and lively interest in ensuring that the international order against the spread of such weapons is not eroded but rather reinforced.
It is true that too many nations already include weapons of mass destruction in their armouries. Other nations have developed nuclear weapons—but only two stand accused of breaching the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty: Iraq and North Korea.
Iraq has been thumbing its nose at the United Nations persistently and publicly for 12 years. In North Korea's case the extent of its breach of international commitments has only recently become apparent.
The international community, with Australia playing a leading role, has begun to deal with North Korea. The security of our region and that of the broader world demands that North Korea be brought back into compliance with the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
It is ludicrous to suggest, as some have, that because Australia wants the Iraqi issue resolved, then we are passive or indifferent about North Korea. Both pose great threats to world security. Both are of intense interest to Australia. It is not a question of choice—both must be dealt with.
I pose the simple question. What hope does the world have of dealing peacefully and effectively with North Korea if the Security Council is seen to deal supinely with Iraq?
Just as we accept without reservation that stability in North Asia is crucial to our economy and our security, we must recognise that the Middle East is not remote or irrelevant to Australia.
Australia is home to several hundred thousand people of Middle Eastern background. Some are from Iraq, and we appreciate the contribution of all of these people to our nation. Many of them could be torn between seeing Saddam brought to account and the possible dangers facing their families in Iraq. During this time, they will need our compassion and our support, and I hope that all Australians will ensure that this is offered.
For almost 20 years, Iraq has been a constant threat to its neighbours. If Iraq emerges from its current confrontation with world opinion with its arsenal of chemical and biological weapons intact, the potential for Saddam Hussein's aggression against his neighbours to be renewed will be greatly enhanced. Iraq will again feel free to coerce and intimidate countries in the region.
The old policy of containment is eroding. Saddam Hussein has increasingly been able to subvert the sanctions. Smuggling of oil from Iraq and the illegal importation of proscribed goods into Iraq have increased dramatically in the past few years.
Despite the efforts earlier of the weapons inspectors—who destroyed far more of Iraq's weapons programs than Saddam Hussein ever expected—Iraq has still been able to hang on to most of the knowledge and equipment it needs.
Inspectors have never been able to eradicate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs—at best they slowed their development.
There will be no stability—no security—for the nations of the Gulf until Iraq is disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction—totally and permanently.
Disarming Iraq will bring enormous benefits to the Middle East and will be widely welcomed.
Clearly, however, the international community must redouble its efforts to resolve the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Australian government again calls on both sides to bring an end to the violence affecting Israelis and Palestinians. Neither side should make the mistake of alienating, through violence, those who are willing and ready to negotiate a settlement.
Israel has no stauncher ally than Australia in its pursuit of the right to exist within secure and internationally recognised boundaries.
Australia strongly supports the creation of a viable independent Palestinian state.
It remains a great tragedy that the courageous efforts of Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, who offered the Palestinians the great bulk of their demands, were ultimately repudiated by the Palestinian Chairman, Yasser Arafat.
As a genuine friend of Israel's, I urge Ariel Sharon to use the authority of his re-election to take whatever opportunity might reasonably arise to engage the Palestinian Authority in constructive peace discussions.
He should facilitate all bona fide international attempts to bring the parties together.
Can I, however, say this to the members of the Palestinian Authority.
How can the Prime Minister of Israel be expected to do these things while ever the murderous pattern of suicide bombing continues to be inflicted on the people of Israel?
In the end result, however, any action taken against Iraq must be justified on its own merits. It will not and cannot be predicated on whether or not other challenges to world security have been addressed.
The overriding concern about Iraq is its record of aggression and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein clearly does not see them as weapons of last resort. He has used them against his neighbours. He has used them against his own people.
This is a doleful distinction, which Iraq shares with no other country.
Iraq has form. Saddam Hussein has without provocation invaded Iran and Kuwait. He has fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain and Qatar. He has bullied, threatened and extorted Syria, Jordan and the Gulf States.
Who knows what other horrors might have been perpetrated on the Kurds or the Shia Muslims if not for the no-fly zones which Britain and the United States have enforced for these last 12 years.
Iraq also has a long history of training and supporting regional terrorist groups. It supports Palestinian suicide bombers who have caused such death and destruction within Israel.
Iraq's history of relationships with and support for terrorist organisations magnifies our concerns. The rise of international terrorism adds a new and frightening dimension to the threat posed by the proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
The ultimate nightmare for us all must be that weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of terrorists. The more the world leaves unchecked either the possession of such weapons by rogue states or the spread of those weapons, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will acquire and use them.
It cannot be stressed too strongly, Mr Speaker, that all of this is added to the fact that Iraq has flouted with impunity the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.
The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons and that Iraq wants to develop nuclear weapons.
We share the view of many that, unless checked, Iraq could, even without outside help, develop nuclear weapons in about five years.
Even before the report of the head of the United Nations weapons inspection body there was compelling evidence to support these beliefs within the published detailed dossiers of British and American intelligence.
On the basis of the intelligence available, the British Joint Intelligence Committee judged that:
·	Iraq has a useable chemical and biological weapons capability, which has included recent production of chemical and biological agents;
·	Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons—uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil nuclear application in Iraq;
·	Iraq possesses extended range versions of the Scud ballistic missile in breach of Security Council resolutions, which are capable of reaching Cyprus, Turkey, Teheran and Israel;
·	Iraq's current military planning specifically envisages the use of chemical and biological weapons. In its view, Saddam Hussein is determined to retain these capabilities.
The analysis provided by the Director of the US Central Intelligence reached similar conclusions, namely:
·	Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program;
·	it has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin and VX;
·	all key aspects—R&D, production and weaponisation—of Iraq's offensive biological weapons program are active and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War in 1991.
The intelligence material collected over recent times, to which Australia has contributed, points overwhelmingly to Saddam Hussein having acted in systematic defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council, maintained his stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and sought to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program.
Given the strong and critical language of the Blix report, the nations which comprise the Security Council face a stark and difficult choice.
The council must either act to ensure full compliance by Iraq with resolution 1441 or, through either excessive delay or indifference, risk crippling its own authority.
To emphasise the weight of responsibility which rests upon the current members of the Security Council, it is worth recalling to the House some brief history of this matter.
In 1991, the United Nations Security Council wanted to ensure that the Iraqi President was no longer in a position to launch any more unprovoked attacks on his neighbours. It resolved that Iraq must declare and then destroy all its chemical and biological weapons and any materials or facilities connected with Saddam's attempt to achieve nuclear capability. Iraq was prohibited from ever again possessing such weapons.
Saddam Hussein agreed to disarmament—to allow the United Nations to supervise and record the destruction of his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear capacity.
On this basis, and this basis alone, the world community agreed to cease hostilities against Iraq in April 1991. Iraq was allowed to maintain a conventional force—no-one questions Iraq's right as a sovereign nation to protect itself by maintaining conventional defensive weapons.
The cease-fire effectively was conditional on Iraq continuing to comply with the terms laid down by the Security Council—including, and importantly, the commitment to renounce weapons of mass destruction. To ensure compliance, the United Nations determined to continue economic sanctions against Iraq.
For 12 years the community of nations has tried to cajole and encourage Iraq to comply with the Security Council resolutions.
For 12 years the international community has tried to contain his ambitions and limit his capacity to keep or manufacture weapons of mass destruction.
For 12 years Australian navy personnel have supported the Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf, which enforces sanctions against Iraq—the crew of HMAS Kanimbla, which was farewelled on 23 January, are our most recent contribution to this important operation.
For eight years the Iraqi President obstructed the weapons inspection teams, who were charged with verifying his compliance with the UN resolutions. And for the last four years, until December 2002, he refused the inspectors entry to Iraq.
Iraq has not complied with 24 out of the 27 provisions contained in successive Security Council resolutions. Over the last 12 years the Security Council has passed no fewer than nine resolutions condemning Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors. Iraq has had a lot of time and plenty of opportunities to get it right.
The government has consistently argued that the United Nations needs to deal with Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the Security Council's authority.
This was the view I put to President Bush shortly before his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, in September last year. I then argued to him the merits of working through the United Nations.
That has been the steady theme of a strong diplomatic effort by Australia, ably led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
We have supported a leading role for the United Nations in addressing this threat. Our close relationship with and our ready access to the US administration have meant that our views are heard and respected.
We approached Security Council members in capitals and in New York to encourage a constructive resolution. We recently sent an envoy to South-East Asia to consult key partners in the region and inform them of Australia's position.
The foreign minister's consultations in Europe last week demonstrated we are not alone, neither in our concern, nor in our preparedness, ultimately to act if necessary.
On 8 November last year, the Security Council passed resolution 1441. The nations which comprise the council, large and small, from all the regions of the world, of almost every faith and political persuasion, decided, unanimously, that Iraq had been, and remained, in breach of its obligations. In particular they drew attention to Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors and to complete the required disarmament actions.
The resolution put Iraq on notice—the consequences of noncompliance would be serious.
If the compelling terms of this last resolution are not enforced, then the Security Council's deeds will have failed to match its rhetoric and serious long-term damage will have been done to the United Nations.
In hindsight the world has been too trusting—not careful enough in its dealings with the Iraqi President. But the situation is different now. Iraq has not changed—but we have. We now understand, after the events in Bali and those of 11 September 2001, that we are living in a world where unexpected and devastating terrorist attacks on free and open societies can occur in ways that we never before imagined possible.
There is a new dimension to international relations and we cannot ignore it. The atrocity in Bali demonstrated something Australia had never fully understood until then—that we are truly vulnerable. In light of this we have reappraised the way we view and deal with the threat of terrorism. We understand the danger of leaving threats unaddressed.
As the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair—whose leadership on this issue, domestically, in his own country, has been very impressive indeed—said last Saturday there are two grave issues the world must now confront: the problem of weapons of mass destruction and the challenge of international terrorism.
He said that if both were not dealt with they would sooner or later come together with terrifying consequences for the world.
On 8 November, the Security Council decided to—and I will use the words of resolution 1441—`afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations'.
The Security Council has given the Iraqi President one last opportunity to demonstrate his willingness to fulfil the commitments he gave in 1991. The terms of the resolution are explicit and prescriptive. Iraq is required to demonstrate compliance. The onus is not on the inspectors to find prohibited weapons or programs. It is on Iraq to prove it has destroyed its weapons and dismantled its programs.
And how has Iraq responded?
The weapons inspectors have given their first comprehensive report. They have been very critical of Iraq's attitude—in Dr Blix's view Iraq has cooperated on process but not on substance. The studied impudence of Iraq to the rest of the world has again been on display.
Without Iraq's active and sincere cooperation the weapons inspectors are wasting their time. Inspectors can assist Iraq disarm, they can verify to the world community that Iraq is disarming—they cannot, simply by their presence, achieve disarmament.
Dr Blix did not expressly ask for more time. He did, however, ask for more cooperation. Those who argue that the key issue is to give the inspectors more time have missed the point.
The inspectors do not need time. They need Iraq's cooperation. If Iraq were demonstrating full compliance, I would argue they be given all the time in the world. But this is demonstrably not the case.
At the end of last month, Dr Blix reported to the Security Council that all the questions concerning disarmament of Iraq remain outstanding.
The resolution had posed two important tests by which Iraq could demonstrate compliance—the provision of a full and accurate declaration of the regime's weapons of mass destruction and active cooperation with the inspection process.
Dr Blix reported that Iraq has failed both tests.
The point must clearly be understood that, following its defeat in the Gulf War, Iraq admitted to possessing chemical and biological weapons and to developing a nuclear program. In those circumstances the overwhelming imperative is that Iraq demonstrates to the world that it has destroyed those weapons and disbanded those programs. That, in fact, is what this debate is all about.
The world demands to know precisely what happened to Iraq's pre-1998 weapons and material. Iraq claims to have destroyed them—but Dr Blix is right to demand proof.
There are 6,500 chemical bombs—including 550 shells filled with mustard gas; 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent—including 1.5 tonnes of the deadly nerve agent VX; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals—300 tonnes of which could only be used for the production of VX; and over 30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents—all unaccounted for.
In 1995, the international community was confronted by Iraq's massive program for developing offensive biological weapons—one of the largest and most advanced in the world.
Despite four years of intensive inquiries and searches, the weapons inspectors did not even know of its existence until Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, defected. Faced with its duplicity Iraq finally admitted to producing aflatoxin, which causes cancers, the paralysing poison botulinum and anthrax bacteria.
It admitted to manufacturing 8,500 litres of anthrax. A single gram is enough for millions of fatal doses. Dr Blix wants proof that the anthrax has been destroyed—and so do we.
Iraq must account for the large quantity of undeclared growth media for biological weapons and for all its Scud B ballistic missiles. It must explain why it has rebuilt equipment and facilities destroyed by previous inspection teams.
It must allow the unfettered, unrestricted reconnaissance flights so relevant data can be collected and analysed. And it must allow the inspectors unsupervised access to relevant members of the Iraqi science community.
Other countries have, in the recent past, volunteered to undertake a disarmament process—South Africa, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Disarmament can involve complex technical checks and processes—but it is still relatively simple provided there is a high-level political commitment to disarm, sound planning and most importantly full cooperation and transparency with weapons inspection teams.
The transparent, openly cooperative behaviour of those three countries in disarming could not present a more vivid contrast with the stubborn, deceitful behaviour of Iraq, which has all the hallmarks of a nation which is clearly hiding something.
The world community is not asking the Iraqi regime to prove the impossible. It is asking for straightforward answers to a series of very serious questions.
Now is not the time to relieve the pressure on Iraq.
And there is only one form of pressure that Saddam Hussein understands—the threat of military force.
We have tried sanctions and containment. Sanctions can be a very powerful instrument of persuasion but have little influence over a dictator who cares nothing for the wellbeing of his people.
The brutal treatment by Saddam Hussein of his own people can be seen through his cruel and cynical manipulation of the oil for food program developed by the United Nations.
For the last 12 years Iraq has been able to trade its oil for humanitarian goods—food and medicines—under United Nations supervision.
Tragically for the Iraqi people, Saddam Hussein has rorted the program, violated its provisions and evaded its constraints. A significant portion of the humanitarian goods is re-exported from Iraq for cash, and oil is routinely smuggled out and sold illegally so that Saddam Hussein can finance his weapons program.
It is the threat of military action which has proved to be the most effective, and perhaps the only, means of attracting President Hussein's attention.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has recognised the value of this strategy. Kofi Annan has stated publicly that, in his opinion, if the Americans had not applied military pressure through the build-up of forces in the Gulf the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. There can be no stronger statement of the diplomatic value of the military deployment. There could be no more explicit rejection of America's critics.
The Australian government has the same view. Like the Secretary-General, we recognise the value of this strategy and we do not consider that the burden of it should fall to the United States and the United Kingdom alone.
That is one of the reasons why elements of the Australian Defence Force are being pre-positioned in the Persian Gulf.
Mr Speaker, this is not the first time that Australia has pre-positioned forces in the gulf, both to apply diplomatic pressure against Saddam Hussein and in anticipation of possible military action against Iraq.
In 1998, in the lead-up to Operation Desert Fox, the government pre-positioned Special Air Service forces—some 150 of them—and two refuelling aircraft with British and American forces in the gulf. We did so in the absence of any new, specific Security Council authorisation and on the understanding that a final decision to commit to military action had not been taken at the time of deployment. The aim then, as now, was to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. The circumstances of the pre-positioning of forces in 1998 are so similar as to be nearly identical.
In 1998, the then Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Brand—a former defence minister—recognised the value of the strategy, when he said:
... part of the reason why we have supported the Government in giving our approval to the steps that they've taken thus far, has been to assist in putting pressure on Saddam Hussein. And there's no doubt in my mind if there had not been pressure coming in from those who are prepared to be part of a coalition, the energising of the UN Security Council and the energising of a couple of members of the UN Security Council—Russia and France—to try and find solutions, simply wouldn't have occurred.
In deciding to pre-position our troops, we were also responding to advice from the Australian Defence Force that if, at some time in the near future, we wish to participate in military action our troops would be advantaged by having the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise. 
Mr Speaker, over the past few months there has been sustained criticism from some quarters, both here and abroad, regarding the role of the United States on this whole issue.
So much of that criticism has been either wrong, unfair or downright prejudiced.
No criticism is more outrageous than the claim that US behaviour is driven by a wish to take control of Iraq's oil reserves. Self-evidently, if cheap oil supplies were America's dominant motive, then years before now the United States would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions in return for plentiful supplies of low-priced oil.
I have no doubt that the driving force behind American policy towards Iraq now is that, in the wake of the events of 11 September, they have a justifiable concern that the twin evils of weapons of mass destruction, in the hands of rogue states, and international terrorism will come together with horrific consequences.
—They've never done anything wrong!
—The member for Werriwa is warned!
—The United States has also been falsely accused of acting unilaterally and thus in contemptuous disregard for the role of the United Nations.
The issue of Iraq is now before the Security Council precisely because of the actions and pressure of the United States.
For almost four years the Security Council had left Iraq in the too-hard basket. On 12 September 2002, President Bush addressed the General Assembly and reminded the United Nations of its responsibility to deal with Iraq's repeated defiance of Security Council resolutions.
Unless, therefore, it is regarded as provocative and contemptuous of the United States to charge the United Nations with the obligation of enforcing its own decisions, this allegation against the United States is without any substance.
The issue of Iraq will again be before the Security Council tomorrow, 5 February, at the express request of the United States. And its Secretary of State, Colin Powell, will present some new material to council members.
I have authorised the use of some Australian-sourced material in that presentation, which will include material from a number of countries. So as to protect sources, it is not possible for me to be specific as to what material has been sourced in Australia. I am sure that the House will understand this.
It can barely be denied by anyone that all the actions of the United States, at present, are designed to ensure that the Security Council acts to compel compliance with its own unanimously adopted resolution 1441.
Australia is a close ally of the United States. No nation is more important to our long-term security. Australians will never forget the vital assistance given to us by the United States during World War II.
Our value systems while far from identical are nonetheless similar. We share common democratic values. We have made common cause in the fight against terrorism.
Australia and the United States have a common interest in preventing the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
Australia's alliance with the United States has been and will remain an important element in the government's decision making process on the Iraqi issue.
The crucial long-term value of the United States alliance should always be a factor in major national security decisions taken by Australia.
In an increasingly globalised and borderless world, the relationship between Australia and the United States will become more and not less important.
The most intense desire of us all is that this challenging issue is resolved without war. No-one wants war. We all hope it can be avoided.
Given the past intransigent attitude of Iraq, it is very difficult to conceive that even the full weight of Security Council opinion, unanimously expressed and threatening imminent military action, will induce Saddam Hussein to comply with his international obligations.
The only hope of a peaceful solution will be if the Security Council acts clearly, decisively and unambiguously.
The greater the hesitancy, the greater the blurring at the edges, the more likely it is that Iraq will again dismiss world opinion.
These are some of the views I will put next week in my discussions with President Bush, the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and others.
I will make it clear that, if military action does become necessary, Australia's strong preference is that it takes place pursuant to a new Security Council resolution.
This is not because Australia believes, as a matter of international law, that a new resolution is required.
It is because the passage of a new resolution, authorising the use of force, will bring forth the greatest level of international support for, and involvement in, military action against Iraq.
There is a very strong argument that the terms of 1441, when coupled with all the previous resolutions passed by the Security Council about Iraq, provide a sufficient legal basis for military action, without the express need for a further resolution.
In fact in 1998, if I can return to that again, the government agreed to the deployment I canvassed earlier—with the support of the then opposition, under a different leader—in the clear knowledge that those personnel deployed could be involved in action against Iraq, believing that adequate legal authority existed for that deployment and any subsequent military action under then existing resolutions of the Security Council.
I have said frequently that the outcome from the Security Council may not be a black or white one.
The sense of the Security Council could be that it acquiesces in, or acknowledges the need for, military action without giving it direct sanction.
It is possible that the majority of the council members could vote for military action but the resolution could subsequently be vetoed by a permanent member.
That proposition clearly was in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition, when on 15 January he said:
We won't support any military action outside the authority of the UN ... The exception to this position might occur in the case of overwhelming UN Security Council support for military action, but where support for such action was subject to veto ... In other words, we might need to assess such a situation in light of the circumstances of the veto.
If the Security Council produces a grey rather than a black or white outcome, choices on final action and commitments will need to be made by many nations, including Australia.
In reaching its final decision the Australian government will be influenced not only by our powerful desire to stop the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and our alliance with the United States, but also importantly by the past practice of nations which have taken collective military action in the interests of world or regional security.
For example, the NATO countries conducted bombing attacks against Serbia in 1999 without any kind of direct Security Council authorisation. That authority was never sought because of an apprehended Russian veto.
A subsequent joint Sino-Russian motion condemning the NATO action was defeated. There the matter rested. The Security Council was taken to have acquiesced in the NATO action.
Our goal is disarmament. We want to see a renewed commitment to the principle of nonproliferation. We want to see Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction. We want to see the sanctions lifted. We want Iraq back in the community of nations—because it would be good for the world, good for Australia and, most particularly, good for the people of Iraq. Most of all we want the conflict resolved without resort to military force.
If the international community does not act now to disarm Iraq, it will have made a mockery of years of effort to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. It will have encouraged others to mimic Iraq.  It will make dealing with North Korea almost impossible. And, most importantly, failure to act will gravely compromise the authority of the United Nations.
Clearly the pre-positioning of Australian forces and the contingency planning with the United States military—to which ministers and I have referred frequently over recent months—have put Australia in a position where it can effectively, and in circumstances providing the best assurances of safety for our forces, contribute to a military operation against Iraq, should a final decision be taken for this to occur.
The moment for that final decision has yet to arrive. That decision ultimately will be guided by the judgment which the government makes as to where Australia's national interest lies.
This issue poses great and difficult choices for Australia. We all hate the very thought of war in any form. Our natural instinct is to recoil from it. The temptation to turn our backs on the problem and hope it will go away is great.
Yet the realities of the world in which we now live do not permit us that luxury.
We all know that history is replete with examples of the community of nations retreating from difficult decisions through fear of the immediate consequences only to find that those difficult decisions must ultimately be addressed and at an infinitely greater cost.
Finally, our thoughts must turn to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force on deployment doing their duty and maintaining a long tradition of courage and professionalism in the service of Australia.
Whatever may be their role in the weeks and months ahead, we admire them, we support them and we wish them well. We are united in our prayers and our hopes for their safety and their wellbeing. 
I present a copy of the statement.
Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Leader of the House) (3.43 p.m.)—I move:
That the House take note of the paper.
Question agreed to.
Mr ABBOTT (Warringah—Leader of the House) (3.43 p.m.)—by leave—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Crean (Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 53 minutes.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—What we have just heard from the Prime Minister is a justification for war, not a plan for peace. We have heard the Prime Minister unctuously in this House talk of his abhorrence of war and say that he wants peace, yet he has already committed our troops to war without a mandate from the Australian people, without a mandate from the parliament and without a mandate from the United Nations.
—I warn the member for Sturt!
—The truth is that we can secure a peace. Prime Minister, I say to you that we must work to secure that peace, but we will not achieve that peace by committing to the path of unilateralism which you are so firmly locked into. The path to peace can come only through the United Nations.
There are several things on which we agree.
·	Our total support for the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force and their families.
·	Nonproliferation is a critical security issue and we have to address it collectively and not unilaterally.
·	Saddam Hussein must be disarmed, but he has to be disarmed in accordance with decisions of the United Nations.

Prime Minister, you talk in your speech about the brave statements and the brave offer made by Ehud Barak, who is to visit this country soon, but the circumstances in which Ehud Barak made the offer were in talks convened by the then President of the United States, a person who was prepared to bring the parties to the table and not threaten them. There is a fundamental difference in the way in which you have locked yourself into the course of unilateralism, fear and threat and not done it properly through the collective discipline and authority of the United Nations. Yours is a very disappointing statement today, Prime Minister, because you have presented no new evidence. We have all had the opportunity to see what Prime Minister Blair has put in the British parliament, but the fact of the matter is that you still have not explained why you have committed our troops to a war ahead of that issue being determined by the United Nations.
Two weeks ago, Prime Minister, you committed Australia's young men and women to a war that has not yet been declared, knowing all along that, having committed them, you cannot pull them out. There is no graver decision for a Prime Minister than sending young Australian men and women to war.
Yet, you have committed them without the mandate of the Australian people, without the mandate of the Australian parliament and without the mandate of the United Nations.
You committed them solely on the say-so of George W. Bush.
In making that commitment, you have committed them to a command structure that you cannot withdraw from if George Bush decides to go it alone and pursue a military solution regardless of the United Nations. That is what you have committed Australian troops to, Prime Minister.
You have done all of this but you have not told the Australian people that you have done that. Indeed, in all of your comments you say that no such commitment has been made. I do not believe you, Prime Minister, and the Australian people do not believe you.
You have not had the courage or conviction to tell the Australian people what you have done and what you have committed to.
Here we are finally with the chance to debate a troop commitment by your government in this parliament, and you still have not told them.
You go to those media conferences and say that you want peace but you have already committed the troops to war.
Government members interjecting—
—You know it is true.
—The member for Sturt will excuse himself from the House!
The member for Sturt then left the chamber.
—The Leader of the Opposition has the call. He will be extended the same courtesy as the Prime Minister.
—You, Prime Minister, have committed our troops to war and you have done it with no United Nations mandate but through a US request.
And now you are going to the US.
The pity is, Prime Minister, that you will not be here to answer the questions in the parliament. I welcome the fact that you are going but I ask why, if it is so important, you did not go before you made this commitment.
My question for you—and the question the Australian people want answered—is this: when you go to Washington, will you tell George Bush that no Australian troops will be involved in a war in Iraq without the authority of the United Nations? That is what the Australian people want you to be telling George Bush. Yet, you have not made that commitment here today. The commitment we want you to make, Prime Minister, is that you will go firmly and forcefully and say to the United States President that there will be no Australian troops involved in a war in Iraq without a United Nations mandate. If you say that you believe in the authority of the United Nations and you want to strengthen its hand, that is what you will be doing as a partner and ally of the United States. That is what good partners do. They are frank with each other and they exchange the strength of their views, not lamely follow what the direction of the United States is.
You have to insist in your discussions with George Bush that no troops should be sent to war without a United Nations mandate. That is what the Australian people want, Prime Minister, and that is what those in this parliament on this side of the House are urging you to do. I know that there are people on your side of the House who share this view. I know that and so do their constituents. We know what feedback they are giving their constituents and we know, from the comments that have been made in the papers from time to time from members over there, that they want this commitment too.
It is as simple as that, Prime Minister. You are going to Washington, but deliver the message on behalf of the Australian people: no troops should be sent to war without a United Nations mandate. You say that you are going over there to inform President Bush of the wishes of the Australian people. They are the wishes of the Australian people. The Australian people do not support unilateral US led military action. 
Prime Minister, we have not had a question time today by virtue of this statement to the parliament, but we will keep asking this question because it is the question that the Australian people want answered, and you have an obligation as the Prime Minister of this country to do the right thing by the troops that you have committed to war. You say that they are not committed. We do not believe you. The only way that you can correct that record is to go to the US next week and say that you will not be supporting, and not be allowing our troops to be used in, any action that is not sanctioned and authorised by the United Nations.
Prime Minister, you argue that the United States alliance requires you to respond to all requests from the US. It does not. The very first article of the ANZUS treaty makes it clear that all alliance decisions must be in conformity with the United Nations. I cannot understand why, Prime Minister, when you keep invoking the United States alliance with us, you never refer to that article.
—An oversight.
—It is no oversight; it is just a convenience for him, because he has not consistently argued that this matter has to be resolved through the United Nations. The Labor Party has argued that, but not our Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who keeps relying on the United States alliance, when article I of that very document says that all decisions must be in conformity with the United Nations. Prime Minister, the fact is that this is a treaty which commits all presidents and all prime ministers—it is not selective; it commits all of them—and you have an obligation to act in accordance with it. It has stood the test of time and it is not the personal plaything of two individuals. It is a responsibility on behalf of their nations, and you, Prime Minister, have to act in the national interest.
There is no greater decision that a Prime Minister can take than to send men and women to war, but there is no greater breach of trust than committing them to war without telling them the full extent of the commitment. You, Prime Minister, have breached the trust that exists between a nation and its leader. You claim that you have committed our troops to bring the maximum pressure to bear on Iraq to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction. You claim that, if there is no UN mandate for military action, you can bring the troops back even if the US decides to go it alone. You have said that you would withdraw Australian forces if there were a possibility that nuclear weapons could be used. 
Where, Prime Minister, are those guarantees? Where is your statement that you have made that clear requirement of the President of the United States in relation to nuclear weapons? How do you propose to achieve the situation in which you extricate yourself from the command structure, from the control, that inevitably our troops go to because of the commitment that you have engaged in? What assurances have you personally sought from the Bush administration? These questions have been asked of you—they have been posed by me and they have been posed by members of the media—and you have not answered them. Today you had another chance to answer those questions but you still refuse to tell the Australian people the truth—you chose again today not to tell them the truth. I believe, and the Australian people believe, that you have already made the commitment to war. You have breached the confidence of the Australian people on this issue. Members of your own party know it and members of your backbench know it.
We on this side of the House believe that Australian troops should not have been sent in advance of the United Nations mandate; we believe the weapons inspectors are still doing their job and should be given the opportunity and support to finish their job; and we believe in the authority of the United Nations Security Council to deal with the issue of disarming Iraq. That is a position that we have repeated since April last year. The people who have been all over the place on this issue have been the Prime Minister and his foreign minister. They have not consulted the Australian people and they have not consulted their own party, but they have consulted George Bush. You said, Prime Minister, that you were sending our troops because it was in the nation's interest. What I want to know, Prime Minister, is: what nation? You have made the commitment to the United States President.
Let us understand the extent of the commitment that has been made by the Prime Minister. Let us not understate the size of it and what it involves for the Australian people—most of all, the troops themselves. We are sending more than 2,000 troops. For a nation with the military size of ours, that is a huge commitment. To put it in perspective, it is twice what we committed in Afghanistan—the war on terror that you often invoke as the link to this war, but a war that was sanctioned by the United Nations. The commitment of these troops is twice what was committed in Afghanistan and it is three times what we committed to the Gulf War in 1991—a commitment, Prime Minister, which you conveniently did not address in your speech; a commitment which was made by the then executive government, the Hawke prime ministership, in relation to an activity legally sanctioned by a decision of the United Nations. This time the commitment has been made for three times as many troops without any decision of the United Nations. In those circumstances in 1991, the United Nations was actively involved in preparing the requirements for the military deployment in the event of a war. It involved itself in those discussions—and it involved 30 countries, not three.
Let us have a look at the comparisons between what was done by the government in 1991 and what your government has done. And let us understand the significance of the decision that was taken by the United Nations. The deployment that you have made is not only three times what we committed to the Gulf in 1991; it is the largest single commitment of combat troops since Vietnam. 
—What about East Timor?
—They were peacekeepers—I am talking about combat troops—and under the UN flag. You do not even know the difference.
—Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition has the call. The Leader of the Opposition will address his remarks through the chair.
—The member for Blair is warned!
—Such a commitment should only be made once a just cause has been established. This has not yet happened. No link has been made between Iraq and al-Qaeda—although, as the Prime Minister says, we are waiting for new evidence from Colin Powell at the UN Security Council on Wednesday. I say to the Prime Minister that it is a valid question to ask: if the United States had this information, why didn't they make it available before? I think that is a question that all Australian people want to know the answer to. But we will wait and see what the information is because it is still within the mandate and authority of the United Nations. Despite all your assertions, no link has yet been made between Iraq and al-Qaeda. We also know that the weapons inspectors have not yet been given the chance to complete their job, and we know that the decision that you have taken has not been authorised by the United Nations.
—Give them another four years!
—I warn the member for Lindsay!
—Prime Minister, now that you are going to Washington to inform George Bush of the views of the Australian people, let me say what those views are. The Australian people do not want peace at any cost, but they do not want your war at any price. What we have to do, Prime Minister, is understand that the majority of Australians want to see Iraq disarmed, but they want it done under the mandate of the United Nations and with the authority of international law. That is the position that the Labor Party has consistently argued since April. You said that you are going to the US to tell President Bush what the views of the Australian people are, but I do not believe that is what you are going for. You are going for another set of riding instructions, and everyone knows it.
Let us look at the government's flip-flopping on the war with Iraq. Last year, when Labor released its detailed policy statement on Iraq, the foreign minister and the Treasurer said we were `appeasers' and we were `talking like Saddam Hussein'. Why? Because we wanted the issue to go back to the United Nations Security Council. When we were arguing that point last year, that is what the foreign minister was saying and it is what the Prime Minister was saying. The Prime Minister spent half of last year constantly saying—and I can put these quotes on the record if need be, and no doubt we will have plenty of time to do it—that, if he received a request from the US to participate in a war against Iraq, he would consider it. No mention was ever made by him, in those statements, of the United Nations—none whatsoever. No effort was made to convince the Americans to take the issue back to the Security Council. 
But in September, when George Bush decided to address the General Assembly, the Prime Minister changed his tune. Suddenly, the Prime Minister was saying that the United Nations should be the vehicle to disarm Iraq—six months after Labor had first articulated that exact position. When the Prime Minister made reference to that September telephone conversation with George Bush, you could hear the horse laughs. You could even see the embarrassment on that side of the chamber. But let us have a look at what he actually said to the President. He simply talked about urging him to consider the merits of acting through the United Nations, not the imperative of doing it through the United Nations. 
This is a Prime Minister who still wants to get up with weasel words, saying he wants the matter to go through the United Nations, but he has no conviction to anything other than supporting the US regardless of what happens through the United Nations. Even then, the Prime Minister refused to be honest with the Australian people. He continued to say that he had not made a commitment to war because it was hypothetical, but behind the scenes he was actively planning to deploy Australian troops. 
The government's rhetoric has finally come around to what Labor has been saying since April—but not to its real intentions. The people know that you do not mean what you say, Prime Minister. They can sense it in the mealy-mouthed way in which you claim that our military commitment is really a peace mission. They can sense it in the way you avoid answering the question: if the UN does not back the war, will you bring the troops home? You still have not answered that question, Prime Minister. You have not answered it today and you have not answered it at any press conference. You will be asked this question in the parliament, and we will see how you respond to it. You snigger and laugh about it, but this is a question that is terribly important to the Australian people. If they are to have faith in your assertion that you have made no commitments, then you have to answer the question as to how you can bring the troops home in the event that the United Nations does not authorise a war.
—I remind the Leader of the Opposition to address his remarks through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Speaker: that is the responsibility that the Prime Minister has, and that is the question to which the Australian people are entitled to have answers.
The Prime Minister is playing on the fear of Australians: the fear of the threat of terrorism. By threatening war alongside George Bush, he is not addressing that fear; he is adding to it. He is heightening the risk, he is increasing our vulnerability, he is adding to the instability in our region—an area which, his intelligence shows, is increasingly vulnerable to threat. This premature action taken by Australia comes at the expense of more immediate and critical concerns about terrorism in the region. Only three weeks ago the Singaporean government released a paper showing the extent of terrorist networks across the region. They are much greater than previously thought, but we hear nothing from this government about dealing with these more immediate issues. Our strongest defence against regional terrorism has always been our joint commitment, with countries in the region, to pursuing common goals and cooperative outcomes. We heard the Indonesian foreign minister last night expressing the concerns his people have about the commitment and the undertaking that they believe has been made with the Americans.
Prime Minister, the best way to combat terrorism—particularly in our region—is to work closely with the police and security agencies of neighbouring countries. But you are not doing that. Your preoccupation is with Iraq, not with issues in the region. We heard the Prime Minister talk about what he is going to Indonesia for: to thank President Megawati for her support in the aftermath of Bali. We welcome that; but you have also got to discuss with her how to strengthen the fight against terrorism in our region. The Prime Minister laughs at this, but it is deadly serious.
Opposition members interjecting—
—He laughs at it. Several months ago, I called for a regional summit of leaders to tackle terrorism. I have not seen one finger lifted by the Prime Minister to convene such a summit. He talks about concerns in our region about the threat from terrorism, but he is doing nothing to address it with our neighbours in the region. The Prime Minister undermines them with his approach and his talk of pre-emptive strikes and action outside the authority of the United Nations.
Prime Minister, the path to security is not through unilateralism, it is through multilateralism. The path to disarmament is through the United Nations, not through unilateralism. In aligning yourself so closely with the United States, to a course of action that is locked in regardless of the outcome of the United Nations, you are giving succour to the unilateralist approach and undermining the authority of the United Nations. That is not in Australia's national interest, Prime Minister. The truth is: the issues of international security, global security and regional security are complex. No one country, no matter how powerful, can solve them on its own. By putting its eggs in the basket of unilateralism and not multilateralism, Australia is not just undermining the United Nations but also setting back the process of dealing with these issues properly and effectively in the region. 
Unlike any issue of recent times, this issue of Iraq defines the difference between the two major political parties in this country, and that comes from a fundamental divergence of principle. Labor has always supported the role of the United Nations and the rule of international law. We helped create the United Nations out of the rubble of the Second World War, which was the consequence of the collapse of the League of Nations because countries chose to go outside of the collective authority. 
The lesson was learnt again from the Second World War and the commitment made to the United Nations. An attempt to settle international disputes through peaceful means was what we owed to the lives that were lost by Australian men and women, amongst others, who fought in the Second World War. Earlier, in the motion about bushfires and in mentioning other tragedies, sentiments were expressed about learning lessons, doing something constructive and not repeating mistakes. The mistake in the breakdown of the League of Nations was countries walking away from it. 
How can you assert your concern about North Korea going outside its responsibilities in nuclear proliferation? How can you argue to it that it has to go back into the multilateral framework, when you are prepared to go outside it because the US has asked you to do so? That fundamental hypocrisy you cannot justify; but you can soundly, solidly and proudly stand up and say: `We are only prepared to support action sanctioned and authorised by the United Nations.' That is what is in Australia's national interest. Australia, pursuing that argument and strengthening the hand of the United Nations, will give great weight and support against all those who seek to go outside it in the future. This is a role Australia has been able to play proudly in the past, but it is not playing it under the Prime Minister's leadership.
One of the proudest pieces of our history is that a Labor foreign minister, Dr Evatt, was the founding President of the General Assembly of the United Nations. But, whilst we have always supported the role of the United Nations, the Liberals have not. They have always relied for their foreign policy direction on their great and powerful friends. The parallel between the current Prime Minister and former Prime Minister Menzies is there starkly to be seen. The kowtowing to London and Washington; the constant sojourns over there; the nod and the wink in support of military action they propose, even if it does not have international legitimacy—that is the Liberals' political tradition, and it is being carried out by you again, Prime Minister. You have never had the courage as a political party to state an independent foreign policy that is in Australia's interests. You have only ever asked the question: what is in the US's interests?
Labor does support the United States alliance, but we want a mature one, not a toadying one. That is the difference between us and you. The US alliance has endured over 50 years. It has always had bipartisan support, but it does not mean we have to agree with every policy position of every US administration. We have had our differences in the past, but the alliance has endured because Australians and Americans believe in the same things: democracy, freedom and respect for the rule of law. The alliance itself, as I said before, under article I specifically says that issues of international conflict should be resolved through the United Nations.
Why is the United Nations so important? It is for this reason: if the United States flouts the decisions of the United Nations it sends a signal to other nations not to be bound by its decisions. It is in the interests of nations the size of Australia that the rule of international law be strong. A strong United Nations can ensure that nations disarm and can stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction to our region. The Prime Minister says that his main reason for deploying Australian troops to Iraq was to stop the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But what has his government done in seven years to strengthen United Nations arms control? Nothing—absolutely nothing.
It has remained silent on the Canberra Commission report. The Canberra Commission said it clearly: the possession of nuclear weapons by any state is a constant stimulus to other states to acquire them. But where has been John Howard's brave new initiative when he inherited that report, commissioned by a Labor government for the very purpose of addressing the issue of security in our region? When has this government done anything to advance the findings of that report? Labor has called for the Canberra Commission to be reconvened with a new mandate to decide what steps are needed to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.
The Prime Minister, in his speech, talked about the great efforts his government has been making to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. But why is it—with his great and powerful ally, the President of the United States—that he has not been able to convince the United States government to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty? Foreign Minister Downer called that treaty a major milestone and said that it would bring the nuclear arms race to a definite end. Prime Minister, if your words are to be believed and you have this special relationship, why aren't you forcefully advancing the argument to the United States that they sign up to the nuclear test ban treaty? The Prime Minister said nothing when, last year, the United States government walked away from negotiations towards a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention, which would have provided transparency and confidence that all countries were working towards eliminating these terrible weapons. If you believe in the multilateral framework, if you believe in these conventions, if you believe in these things, why isn't the Prime Minister strongly advocating to his US partner that these things happen? Labor would.
—I warn the Minister for Foreign Affairs! The Leader of the Opposition has the call.
—The Prime Minister says that he has been told nothing of United States preparations for war with Iraq which include the possible use of nuclear weapons; but the White House spokesman admitted that `all options were on the table'. The Bush administration has made it clear that it reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force— including through the use of nuclear weapons. Prime Minister, you have made a great play of the fact that, if nuclear weapons are used in any action we are involved in with the US, you will pull out our troops. My challenge to you is to demonstrate to the Australian people how you can deliver on that commitment under the control structure which you have committed to. It is a very important question that the Australian people want an answer to. We are talking here about disarmament, and we are talking about disarming in accordance with United Nations resolutions. There is a threat to Australian troops involved in a war in which nuclear weapons are used—which you, Prime Minister, have said that you do not condone—but you have not demonstrated how you would be able to extricate those troops. You had the chance again today, and you failed the test. There are two question times left, Prime Minister, and we expect answers to these questions. The Prime Minister arrogantly turns his back and laughs at that.
—The Leader of the Opposition will address his remarks through the chair.
—The Australian people will not treat kindly a Prime Minister who goes out and makes categorical statements that we will not be involved in any war that involves nuclear weapons, but is not prepared to give a clear answer as to how we could extricate our troops in the circumstances of being locked into a unilateral or US-led action. He has not demonstrated how we can get out of that. He has been asked this question at press conferences. These are issues we want you, Prime Minister, to be making comment on, not just in the parliament but in Washington. We want you to come out of the meeting in the Oval Office with the President of the United States and explain to the Australian people just what mechanism you have got that will extricate us in those circumstances. The Australian people are entitled to know, and they have not heard the answer from you; they have heard the assertion but not the proof.
They are used to the circumstances, Prime Minister, in which you say that you have not made commitments or that you did not know. We saw that with the `kids overboard' incident. You did not know that new evidence had come out that people had lied about it. No-one believes you on that. The problem is, Prime Minister, you also said that you had no knowledge of the Bill Heffernan exercise over there in the Senate against Justice Kirby. No-one believes that. We have a Prime Minister with form who is now trying to defend the most serious decision that a Prime Minister can take—the committing of our troops to war—and he is not able to answer these questions.
The Prime Minister has made a great mistake in committing our troops to war ahead of the United Nations mandate. The Labor Party position on this is quite clear: there should be no military action to disarm Iraq without the authority of the United Nations. Labor will support decisions of the United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 1441 in the event of Iraqi noncompliance, but Labor will not support a unilateral military attack on Iraq. They are simple positions, Prime Minister, and we have consistently advocated them. You say that you want bipartisan support. You can secure it by committing yourself to one simple proposition: that you will not commit to any act that is outside the authority of the United Nations. You say that you believe in that course of action; you found the road to Damascus in September. If you still believe it, back Labor, and we will have a bipartisan position. It is a position of great strength with which you can go to the United States, to New York, and to London—
—I warn the member for Hindmarsh!
—and say that you speak on behalf of the parliament. At the moment your commitment of the troops is without the authority of the parliament and it is without the authority of the Australian people. What is critically important in this regard is to ensure that we do strengthen the hand of the United Nations and that we commit ourselves to supportive action only when it is authorised by the United Nations.
Prime Minister, I say that you made a great mistake in committing the troops ahead of the United Nations. I do not support and Labor does not support that decision—and I have made that clear. We do not support the deployment of Australian troops in advance of any United Nations authority. I took my case directly to the troops themselves on the HMAS Kanimbla. I was prepared to be truthful with them, unlike the Prime Minister. What I should say to them was a difficult decision for me to make; but I knew that it was the right thing to do. I could not go down and farewell those troops without saying that I disagreed with the government's decision to send them. But I made the position absolutely clear that my argument was with the government, not with the troops.
—I warn the member for McEwen! The Leader of the Opposition will address his remarks through the chair.
—I also said that, whilst I did not support the decision to deploy the troops, I support the troops—and I always will. We on this side of the House always will support them. There is a fundamental distinction here: the troops of this country do not have a choice to make in terms of whether or not they go to war. They have to go if the government of the day makes that decision for them. They deserve support from both sides of the parliament. If we are to have the argument, if the demonstrations are to be conducted and if the criticisms are to be levelled, they are to be levelled at the government, not our troops, because they do not have a choice; the government does, and public opinion can sway what the government does.
—The member for Mackellar is warned!
—We know that people are ringing the offices of people on the other side of the parliament. We know from the thousands of emails that we are getting through our respective offices that the Australian people do not want war and, if action has to be taken to disarm Saddam Hussein, it has to be taken through the United Nations. I ask members on the other side of the House to deny that that is the overwhelming impression that they are getting from their constituents. You know it, because Australian people are ringing our offices to say that they have rung you. 
These are the Australian people that the Prime Minister is not listening to. He says that he has to make the tough decisions. The tough decisions do have to be taken, but when you take them you have to tell the truth. I was prepared to do it in front of the troops on the HMAS Kanimbla. What I am asserting very strongly in this chamber is that the Prime Minister has committed himself to support the US in any action they take outside the UN but he has not told the Australian people. That is my charge, Prime Minister. You have done nothing to refute that in any of the statements that you have alleged here. All you have done today is to reiterate the case for war. You have not developed the strategy for the peace. You use the words that say you want the peace, but you have already committed the troops to war. You failed the test today, Prime Minister, in your explanation to the parliament. You were on your feet—
—Leader of the Opposition!
—The Prime Minister was on his feet for 53 minutes—53 minutes in which he had the opportunity to explain what the new evidence was and what the real commitments were in terms of the troops. He failed the test. All he did was to reiterate on the `why' front. He did not explain clearly and concisely what commitment he has made to the US—why the troops should go. He just reiterated old material.
Your action has been a breach of trust with the Australian people, Prime Minister. And what of our security now? The Prime Minister has taken his eye off the ball in the fight against terrorism in our region. He has failed to adequately prepare our defences against terrorism and he has neglected regional security measures. He is instead sending our forces overseas. He has divided our people, he has alienated our friends and he has sent our best antiterrorism troops 10,000 miles away. He expects those of us left behind to defend ourselves with a fridge magnet. He has sent the frigates and he has given the Australian people a fridge magnet. This is the fridge magnet which also goes on to give a bit of advice: `Buy a pair of rubber gloves and a transistor radio in the event of terrorism.' He sends the crack troops 10,000 miles away when clearly he knows—particularly in the wake of the post-Bali circumstances—that the priority should be here. Why has he done it? Not because the United Nations has asked him to do it but because the US has asked him to do it. That is the only reason he has done it. That is what he stands condemned for today. He also stands condemned because he has not been truthful with the Australian people in telling them all of the information. That is a fundamental breach of trust with the Australian people.
The fact remains that we have the opportunity to secure a peaceful outcome. We can do it with both sides of the parliament committed to it. Labor has been totally consistent in its view, ever since April of last year. We say, `Go through the United Nations; get the authority of the United Nations.' I hear all the argument about the 12 years, but where were you, Prime Minister, in advocating the need to get back—get involved—in all of that 12-year period? I do not think I heard the speech out of him. In six years in terms of his prime ministership, I do not think I heard a peep out of him. But then George Bush rings. When George Bush rings, then you see something happen. But what about the United Nations, Prime Minister? What about the circumstances in which there is an obligation, given that this is a UN decision? Given that you were arguing that the UN could not enforce its authority, when it actually turned up with the unanimous resolution, why shouldn't we be giving support, force and strength to the hand of the United Nations? It is in our interests.
That is what should guide your decision making—what is in Australia's national interests. It is in Australia's national interests that we do not commit the lives of our young men and women to military action unless it has the authority of the United Nations. Where it is completely wrong—and a path that we will oppose all the way—is if you commit troops—
—Leader of the Opposition!
—If the Prime Minister commits troops to a US-led military attack on Iraq. It is the wrong way to get the outcome you seek. I do not disagree with the outcome you seek, but I disagree fundamentally with the way you seek to achieve it.
I said at the outset of this speech that I do agree that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed. We have supported the authority of the United Nations in achieving that result and will continue to argue for that authority to be upheld. What we do not want is a country that is cowed in fear. We do not want a country that only responds to aggression. We want a country that is prepared to stand proud, prepared to understand its history of engagement with the region, and prepared to understand its history of involvement through the United Nations—to understand the circumstances in which, despite the strength of our alliance with the United States, we have been prepared to carve out an independent foreign policy for this country. That is what Labor believes in, but it is not what the Liberals believe in. 
This not just an issue in terms of Iraq. This goes fundamentally to the way in which we resolve international conflicts. It goes fundamentally to the way in which we achieve disarmament and we achieve a better world—a more peaceful, more secure world. It goes fundamentally to replicating that approach in our region. That is why I cannot understand, Prime Minister, why you have not taken up the initiative to convene the regional leaders' summit. Australia can make a lead, but Australia will only be proud if it takes the lead; it will never be treated with respect if it blindly follows everything the United States asks of us.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2003-02-04,"—Let me say at the outset that as the leader of the third political party in this House I and my party strongly support what we see as the Prime Minister's clear and calm and resolute identification of the Australian national interest in a very uncertain world and we join with him in seeking an outcome that will better secure the safety of Australians now and in the future, abroad and at home.
We do face very difficult circumstances, circumstances in which we need solutions. But I have heard from the Leader of the Opposition little other than that he believes that the United Nations is the only vehicle for securing a solution and that he believes that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. He has no clear vision at all on how he or the United Nations might achieve that very desirable objective.
We on this side of the House do believe that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are a grave threat to its neighbours, the world and to Australia's national interest and our focus is primarily on that country and the threat that it poses, as opposed to the Leader of the Opposition's obsession—it would have to be said—on America and our relationship with that country. It is not true that we on this side do not value the United Nations. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think it is fair to say that we have used every gram of influence, and will continue seeking to use that influence, to encourage the United Nations to take a resolute position against Iraq and to persuade Iraq to disarm peacefully.
It must be remembered, coming to the Leader of the Opposition's opening remarks—I think this is germane—that the United Nations has resolved to disarm Iraq. It did so 12 years ago. Twelve years is a long time and we all have an interest in seeing the United Nations deliver that very desirable outcome. But I think it is a very telling point in relation to the Leader of the Opposition's presentation here today that it must ultimately be remembered that, while we want the UN to deliver a satisfactory outcome and we support it, we cannot rely upon it necessarily to make every decision for Australia. Should it happen that it failed in its resolve to see through an effective solution, we may ourselves as a sovereign nation have to make difficult choices in the national interest.
What undermines the Leader of the Opposition's presentation here today in this place is that he himself in a more sober moment acknowledged just that point. You said it. The Prime Minister in his speech here today quoted you saying that you will not support any military action outside the authority of the UN, the basis of your entire position here today. But, as I said, in a more sober moment outside of this place not long ago you said this:
The exception—
You allowed for no exceptions in this place today: the UN could make no mistake, take no position that did not require Australia assessing its own national interest against any decision it might make. But you said:
The exception to this position might—
you acknowledged that it might happen—
—Might.
—Might. You said:
The exception to this position might occur in the case of overwhelming Security Council support for military action, but where support for such action was subject to veto. In other words, we might need to assess such a situation in light of the circumstances of the veto.
He allowed for no such proposition or outcome in his speech here today. His whole presentation in this place falls in a heap.
While we on this side of course want the UN to be a successful vehicle for seeking resolution to this vexed issue of the threat that Iraq presents to its neighbours; to its own people, I might add—we ought not to forget them under the current regime; to global security; to Australians now and in the future, here and abroad. In that context, if a resolution cannot be secured because the UN does not come to a unanimous clear-cut position, as the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged, Australia may have to make a difficult decision in the national interest, although it is not something we would welcome. I reiterate that I have absolute confidence in the leadership of this nation under the Prime Minister and the current government to pursue the Australian national interest.
I make a second point in relation to the Leader of the Opposition's speech. He says no case has been presented by the Prime Minister today. I happen to think that it is a very long, a very comprehensive and a very compelling case based on the fact that for 12 years the global community, through the auspices of the UN, has been seeking to have this country cooperate in the process of disarming.
Let me make another point. We have deployed, as was constantly referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, Australian Defence Force units to the Middle East to step up the diplomatic pressure on Iraq and to prepare for the possibility of conflict if, and only if, Iraq refuses to disarm. The Leader of the Opposition made much of this. But it is simply not true—again, the words of a prominent member of his own side of this parliament have undermined his position on this—to say that because we have deployed troops we have committed ourselves to war, any more than that was the case in 1998, as acknowledged by the then Leader of the Opposition.
Today's debate is important. The government is responsible to the parliament and through it to the people and we welcome the opportunity. It is very important. It is a duty incumbent upon us to explain our policy on Iraq in detail. We are determined as a government—and again I say I support the Prime Minister completely in this and I know my own party does—to make decisions based in Australia's long-term national interest. That is what we are elected to do. The Australian people will hold us to account at the next election if they are not satisfied with our performance, but in the meantime they expect us to lead, and lead we must as best we can by assessing our responsibilities. That is precisely what we are seeking to do at the moment.
Iraq agreed to disclose and eradicate its weapons of mass destruction as part of the cease-fire that ended the Gulf War. It has spent the last 12 years evading its responsibilities. This is not some new problem. It may not have been the focus of our national attention in Australia. I have not thought much about it during the 1990s. But it has been there all the time as a real problem for the global community.
I think the Prime Minister rightly referred to the fact that we may be a little older and wiser now. We probably should have referred a little more to history—about the dangers of ignoring ticking time bombs. But we have concentrated on the fact that for 12 years we have been seeking that Iraq comply with the obligations imposed upon it by the global community after the Gulf War and disarm. Twelve years is a very long time. The question has to be asked: just how much longer does it really need? Hans Blix concluded:
... Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.
The United Nations commission has concluded that Iraq still has not resolved the outstanding issues that its predecessor raised in 1999. There are serious unresolved questions about such matters as Iraq's production of the VX nerve agent, a terrible weapon that affects the central nervous system; its failure to account for 6,500 chemical munitions; and its failure to account for biological growth material that could be used to produce up to 5,000 litres of anthrax. The record is quite a long one.
We also know that Iraq has developed two new ballistic missiles. Both of them have been tested at a range of more than the 150 kilometres permitted by the Security Council. These missiles have now been deployed to the Iraqi armed forces. So, clearly, for these and the other reasons listed by the Prime Minister and in other places around the world in recent days, Iraq is in material breach of the Security Council's requirements.
The government believe—and I think Australians would accept with us—that this country has a compelling national interest in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. If the international community fails to disarm Iraq, it will send a message that rogue states can develop weapons of mass destruction with impunity—that the world will stand by and allow it to happen. I do not believe we can wish that on our children and our grandchildren. 
I ask the House to look ahead and to think about what the world would be like if these weapons became more common and spread into our region. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and I went to Bali. It was a very sobering time, unlike anything else I have been through in my lifetime. I do not know what was uppermost in the other leaders' minds as we came home, but the thing that was uppermost in my mind was: what sort of a world would we be living in if these sorts of people had access to more destructive weapons and, furthermore, people closer to us had access to those sorts of weapons? What would we say to those who had lost their children in circumstances like Bali—in much greater numbers in the future—if we had failed to act? We saw how quickly concerns were raised about what we knew and what warnings were issued. We knew almost nothing—we issued appropriate warnings. I say that the evidence before us now that we need to act is far more compelling and far reaching than anything that we knew prior to Bali. What judgments would future generations pass on us if we were to fail to act on what we know now as a global community concerned for peace and for the security not only of ourselves but of future generations?
Indeed, last year, when we mourned in this place the victims of the Bali atrocity, I pointed out that that had been carried out by people who, inexplicably to us, were proud of their skills. We ought not to be naive about human nature: we all, of course, want to believe in better outcomes, in higher outcomes, in more laudable objectives being sought by people, but we ought not to overlook the nature of evil and the depravity which some people are capable of sliding into. It needs to be remembered, as I have said in this place, that this was carried out by people who, we have to conclude, were proud of their skills, who woke up in the morning and went to sleep at night knowing they were about to commit an atrocity—murder on a scale that we might have hoped, perhaps naively, that we had left behind in the 20th century. It has to be said again that these are not people who will stop at car bombs and aircraft if they can obtain access to more terrible weapons; without hesitation they will use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, in my view, if they can obtain them.
We have to make sure that terrorist fanatics never have access to weapons of mass destruction. The potential for not hundreds, not thousands but tens of thousands being murdered by these weapons is almost too horrific to contemplate. If it happened, the people of the world would rightly condemn all of the leaders who tried to pretend that the threat of terrorism would go away if we acted as if it did not exist. We know that Iraq has links to terrorism, even though the Leader of the Opposition claims that there is no evidence. I cannot understand that claim. Iraq has long supported terrorist groups, such as the PLF—the Palestinian Liberation Front—which was responsible for hijacking the Achille Lauro in 1985. They provide substantial financial grants—of the order of $US25,000 a family—to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. They developed and supported the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq, which undertakes terrorist acts against Iran. I remind the House that this organisation mounted an attack on the Iranian Embassy here in Canberra. The evidence that the Leader of the Opposition wants was broadcast on SBS. There is clearly the potential for Iraq to provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorists in the future, given its history of support for terrorism.
Finally, it has to be said that Saddam Hussein has an appalling record. Iraq invaded Iran and Kuwait without provocation, resulting in the deaths of over a million people. Iraq uses torture routinely and has used chemical weapons on its own population. The government hopes, of course, that the United Nations can disarm Iraq peacefully through the processes set out in resolution 1441. The resolution sets out unambiguously what Iraq has to do to disarm and give the world confidence that it has disarmed. The onus is now on Iraq to reverse its stance, comply fully with the resolution and disarm. One thing I did not hear in the Leader of the Opposition's presentation is this simple proposition: the individual who can cut short the possibility of military conflict and confrontation is very clearly identified—it is Saddam Hussein; that is who it is. His is the one nation that can resolve this peacefully.
It has to be said and I think it ought to be said that too many commentators—who for whatever reason have set as their primary goal in this whole debate the objective of denigrating United States—seem too slow, too reluctant and perhaps even unable to acknowledge this simple reality. We need to come back to it: the ball is squarely in Iraq's court. It is they we see as the threat; it is they that the focus of our remarks and our resolution should be committed to.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—As we meet here today, Australian troops are already on their way to danger. Dispatched by this government without consultation, their mission is unclear, their prospects uncertain. The anxiety and uncertainty of these troops—and I am sure many of them, no matter how well trained they are, will be very anxious—is shared by most Australians. Questions abound about why Australia is one of only three countries in the world to have deployed troops before the United Nations has come to any final resolution. That is the question a lot of Australians want answered: why is it that we are one of only three countries in the world to have deployed troops before the United Nations has come to any final resolution?
The Prime Minister has said that he wants the United Nations process to work in disarming Iraq. He says that he does not want war. Yet, when he spoke here today, he did not even mention the United Nations in discussing the final decision to commit to military conflict. If he truly believes that the United Nations process should work in disarming Iraq, it is surely up to him, as he is about to go to Washington, to inform President Bush when he meets him next week that Australian troops will only be deployed against Iraq with the sanction of the United Nations. If the Prime Minister truly wants to avoid war, he and his government should be working hard within the United Nations to support the work of the weapons inspectors.
On this side of the parliament, we believe that it is better to disarm a nation with weapons inspectors than with bombs. The international community always reserves the right to use force in pursuit of world peace and security, but those threatening to take action in the name of peace and security without the United Nations mandate endanger the very institution that gives most hope of delivering it. The threat, in which we now see that the Prime Minister is already complicit, to take action against Iraq without United Nations sanction corrodes the very foundation on which the United Nations rests. Shared prosperity and common security arise when nations act together. Those who act unilaterally undermine the security of all.
In his address to the parliament today, the Prime Minister gave no detail whatsoever of the commitments he has already made, on behalf of the Australian people, to the United States. That is certainly a question the Australian people want answered: what commitments to the United States have already been made by this Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian people? Today, instead of taking the Australian people into his confidence, the Prime Minister told us next to nothing of the reasons for his actions. On the contrary, the public have been left to try to make what sense they can of the confused and contradictory statements the Prime Minister has made about this issue over the past year as he has tried to read the mood of the Australian people.
For months the Prime Minister told Australians that, if he received a request from the United States to take part in action against Iraq, he would consider it. For months he did not bother to mention the United Nations. He did not argue the need for the matter to go before the United Nations Security Council. He did not talk of the need to build a broad coalition of nations to disarm Iraq. Anyone who argued for the issue of Iraq's disarmament to be dealt with through the United Nations, as Labor have done since April last year, was dismissed as an `appeaser' by this government—by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, I think, also by the Treasurer. That is how going to the United Nations was seen by this government. It was not until September, when the American President decided to address the United Nations General Assembly, that the Prime Minister rediscovered the United Nations. As we heard today, he now claims that at that time he urged President Bush to work through the UN to disarm Iraq. We hope that he will once again urge President Bush to work through the UN to disarm Iraq and that he will say to President Bush that the only way in which Australian troops will be deployed in Iraq is with the full sanction of the United Nations.
But today, in the absence of straight talk from the Prime Minister, Australians have been left to interpret his actions. The so-called predeployment of troops he has ordered lends itself to no interpretation other than that he has committed Australia to support United States action against Iraq without United Nations sanction. The Prime Minister has already sent in 2,000 Australian troops before the United Nations weapons inspectors have had time to complete their work. This is a critical point. The United Nations weapons inspectors have not completed their work. We have not had a final report from the weapons inspectors. The United Nations Security Council has not had a chance to assess the work of those weapons inspectors. That still needs to be done.
What Australians want to know—what they have a right to know—is what commitment this Prime Minister has given to the United States regarding Australia's armed forces. We want to know—and Labor will insist on knowing, on behalf of the Australian people—why Australia is one of only three nations to have taken this action. Why is it that our sons and daughters are being put in danger before the United Nations processes have been completed? Labor share with most Australians a deep concern about why our troops are being thrust into harm's way by our government at this time. The Prime Minister says that it is to increase the pressure on Iraq to disarm and that no commitment to conflict has been made, but it is very hard indeed to imagine these troops being allowed just to stand by if the United States decides to go into Iraq without United Nations sanction. Nobody believes that that is the case. Nobody believes that our troops are just going to stand by if the United States decides to go it alone. We know that this government has decided to go with the United States if that is the way it goes.
As the Leader of the Opposition has made very clear, we support the troops and what they have had to do but we do not support the mission. We know that these troops have signed up to do their duty to their country, as directed by the government. Our defence forces of course have always conducted themselves with great professionalism and distinction. Our quarrel, it is very important to say, is not with them. We want to do everything possible to make sure that they return to Australia safe and unharmed. But their deployment should be made conditional on a United Nations resolution sanctioning direct action to disarm Iraq. We certainly have seen no resolution of that type come from the United Nations.
Labor have been clear throughout regarding what position Australia should take in pursuing disarmament in Iraq. We accept, for the sake of world peace and security, that the regime of Saddam Hussein must be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction. We support United Nations action towards this end. That of course means supporting the actions of the weapons inspectors. But by deploying troops now this government is trying to pre-empt the legitimate processes of the United Nations and the legitimate work of those weapons inspectors. At this stage the United Nations has not yet come to a final decision about how to proceed further in disarming Iraq. It is in fact only weeks since the United Nations weapons inspectors re-entered Iraq to continue their work after a four-year delay. The inspection process is far from complete, yet the Australian government appears eager to rush to war.
Labor say there should be no action without United Nations sanction, because we want the countries of the world to act together to resolve this issue. We are committed to the international coalition of countries taking action against the terrorist threats. We made that very clear after September 11. Of course the horrific Bali bombing was a tragic demonstration that terrorism is a global problem. Terrorists can strike in any country. None can presume they are immune from such terrible acts of violence. The Bali attack was proof that terrorists are active on our doorstep. The region in which we live is rich in diversity and promise. Unfortunately, the threat of terrorist attacks is very real. With terrorist attacks so close to home, we must ensure our own security and safety above all else.
The Australian government must also not be party to any action that undermines what are still young multilateral institutions. In the past, Australia has been an active and constructive member of the international community. We heard from the Prime Minister today about the threat posed to world security by the breakdown of the international covenants governing the development and proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Yet he knowingly pursues a course of action that threatens the very basis of international cooperation and security. Australia was instrumental in the foundation of the United Nations. We have been a strong supporter. If this government truly believes in international peace and security, it should be acting to strengthen the United Nations, not to undermine it. Let us in Australia press for a peaceful resolution: disarmament with strong action by the weapons inspectors. If any further action is needed, we must work through the United Nations, not by Australia supporting only the United States acting alone. That is not what the Australian people want, it is not the right way for Australia and it is not what the Australian Labor Party will support.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—In the course of this debate, I believe it is necessary to recite briefly the way the situation has developed, to give some indication of how this became a serious issue, both for Australia and for the world, and to give some idea of the enormity of the conduct which is now being judged and which, I certainly believe, Australia must take a very strong stand in assisting the international community to deal with. In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait. It was an invasion which brought the near unanimous condemnation of the world. I think the UN, with the exception of Iraq, voted unanimously to condemn it. It was unsolicited, it was unprovoked and it was an invasion which had no justification. The UN Security Council called for full withdrawal on behalf of Iraq and authorised all necessary measures which were required to achieve that. As part of that, a multinational force was gathered, which Australia was part of. The nations of the world that were part of that coalition, under Operation Desert Storm led by the United States and Great Britain, were able to expel Iraq from Kuwait.
As part of that, it was insisted and agreed by Iraq that it would destroy, after full identification, its weapons of mass destruction. It was the outcome of Operation Desert Storm which led to UN resolutions requiring inspections and the identification and destruction of those weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has at all times since, notwithstanding those inspections, been in breach of the obligations which it undertook and which the world community put on it as the outcome of Operation Desert Storm. Resolution 1441, which was passed by the UN Security Council on 8 November 2002, detailed the way in which Iraq was in breach of those obligations. In fact, the first clause of resolution 1441 says that the UN Security Council:
1.	Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991), in particular through Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to complete the actions required under paragraphs 8 to 13 of resolution 687 (1991) ...
The international community has actually judged whether or not Iraq is in compliance with its obligations and it has found a material breach. That was done back on 8 November 2002. Clause 2 then goes on to say that the UN Security Council:
2. Decides, while acknowledging paragraph 1 above, to afford Iraq, by this resolution, a final opportunity to comply ...
I do not think there could have been any doubt as to what the UN meant by `a final opportunity to comply'. It found a breach and then said, `We now set up a final opportunity to comply.' It went through all of the clauses of the resolution and concluded in clause 13 by saying that the Security Council:
13. Recalls ... that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations ...
I do not think there could have been any doubt as to what `serious consequences' meant. The UN concluded by saying that it:
14. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
So the international community finds a material breach, gives one final opportunity, warns Iraq of serious consequences which will follow if it does not comply and determines to remain seized of the matter. Its inspectors then go into Iraq. The report of the inspectors does not show a nation which has finally come to terms with compliance with resolution 687. It does not show a nation which has been given its final opportunity and which has determined that, in order to avoid serious consequences, it now wants to change its policy. In fact, the report finds a nation which is continuing with noncooperation and which is continuing to fail to comply with the identification and destruction of weapons of mass destruction.
Dr Blix found that there is the VX nerve agent unaccounted for in Iraq. He found that there are 6,500 chemical bombs unaccounted for, with about 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent. He found that there are strong indications that Iraq has produced more anthrax than it has declared and that at least some of this has been retained. He found that there is a nondeclaration of 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media, sufficient to produce 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax. Above all, he found that there is no indication from Iraq that it will actually comply with identifying and destroying those weapons of mass destruction. As Dr Blix said in the report:
It is not enough to open doors. Inspection is not a game of “catch as catch can”. Rather, as I noted, it is a process of verification for the purpose of creating confidence. It is not built upon the premise of trust. Rather, it is designed to lead to trust, if there is both openness to the inspectors and action to present them with items to destroy or credible evidence about the absence of any such items. 
There is an idea that, unless an inspector can somehow find things that have been carefully hidden, Iraq wins and the international community loses. It is known that these things either exist or did exist. A country which is determined to destroy them and comply either produces them or produces the evidence of where they were destroyed. It does not play a game of hide-and-seek through a huge country—of trying to escape on a technicality, as it were. Dr Blix was quite up-front about that. I do not think there could have been any misunderstanding on the part of the Iraqi regime as to what its obligations were. If it really did determine—as Kazakhstan, South Africa and other states have done in the past—that it wanted to destroy these weapons of mass destruction, we would have known about it long before now and it would have been out there, on the record.
What concerns the international community is that this is a country which is not cooperating. This is a country which has used these weapons on its own people—this is not a theoretical issue; it has actually used these weapons in the past. This is a country which is not subject to the rule of law. It does not have a parliament or a free press. It is a country under a personal dictatorship, willing to use weapons and now not cooperating with their destruction. It is a country which was found to be in material breach of the UN resolution. It is a country which invaded Kuwait. It is a country which, after it was expelled, gave undertakings which it has now broken. It is a country which is a danger to its own people and to neighbouring countries—and it happens to be in one of the most sensitive areas of the world. It is a danger through any terrorists that may have access to it or get encouragement from it.
This government urges the Security Council to authorise a strong response. It is unthinkable that at this stage the international community could pack up and go home after all of the material breaches, after the noncooperation and after the clear and present danger. If it did, then the lesson would go out to every would-be dictator and tyrant that you too can collect weapons of mass destruction and that noncooperation will ensure that you have the capacity to keep and, if necessary, use them.
There are some people who say that no force of arms should be used to bring about the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; that would be a classic pacifist position. I do not think that has been argued by anyone in this debate. This position is argued in the community and I respect that, but I will not address it here because it has not been argued. There are other people who say that the force of arms should only be used if the UN were to authorise it. That is the position that has been repeated ad nauseam by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate.
It is this government's strong preference that the UN should authorise, if it has not already—and there is a fair argument that it has—force of arms. But to rule out the use of force of arms except on a resolution of the UN is essentially to say that any one of the five permanent members with a right of veto in the UN Security Council will determine whether or not force of arms is used. That is effectively to hand over to any one of the five nations that have a right of veto the final decision, including the final decision as to what this country, the UK and the US should do.
I would not argue that in all circumstances the right of veto should determine the response of the US, the UK or Australia—and, if I may say so, and the Prime Minister made the point, the Leader of the Opposition has not said that that should always be the case. The Leader of the Opposition on 15 January made precisely that point: how can we give across in a final sense in every circumstance the determination of Australia's response to the UN, which is effectively to give any one of those five powers a veto over not only our own response but also the responses of the UK and the US. That was his position on 15 January. He did not address why he has changed position. That was certainly the position of the member for Brand back in 1998, and I suppose it was the position of those who supported NATO's action in Serbia because NATO's action in Serbia—in that case in defence of the human rights of Muslims—was not sanctioned by the UN and would not have been sanctioned by the UN.
But I come back to the point: obviously a strong preference is for the UN Security Council, if it has not already done so—and there is a fair argument that it has—to authorise that action. That is certainly what Australia is arguing. Will we rule out, under all circumstances, in all future events, determining as an appropriate response the kind of Serbian response, the kind of response that the Leader of the Opposition had in mind in January or the kind of response there was in 1998? Obviously countries will determine their foreign policy in accordance with the seriousness of the issue, with the nature of the response, with the wrong which has to be righted and the tragic consequences which might follow if it is not righted. One of the things that has to be brought to bear in all of this debate is what the potential consequences could be if Iraq does not destroy its weapons of mass destruction. This is the point that has to be borne in mind. When we determine the response of Australia and when the UK, the US and the Security Council determine their responses, we need to think of the consequences—horrific consequences—which could follow if those weapons exist or if those weapons are passed on to third parties.
People often ask: what has changed? What has changed is that this country, which thought it could be immune from terror, received a pretty big wake-up call on 11 September and in Bali and now knows it is not immune. We are not immune because of the kind of country we are. Terrorism is a real threat to Australia, and it is in Australia's national interest to determine its response, in conjunction with the international community, to the threats which our citizens could potentially face. Those threats are enormous. We hope that the UN Security Council properly sees to this matter and will determine a response which achieves the objective of identification and destruction of those weapons of mass destruction. I think Australia has an interest in playing its part to bring about that outcome. It is something where we cannot just leave others to do all of the heavy lifting. We have an interest in this: we have an interest in ensuring widespread support and we have an interest in ensuring an outcome. That is what is determining the government in its decision making, and I strongly support the Prime Minister's statement to the House today.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—For Labor, the national security of Australia is non-negotiable. For Labor, guaranteeing national security is the first responsibility of government. For Labor, national security is constructed on three pillars: Australia's alliance with the United States; Australia's membership of the United Nations; and Labor's policy of comprehensive engagement with Asia. Our alliance with the United States was shaped by Labor Prime Minister Curtin in 1941, consummated in the ANZUS alliance of 1951 and proudly owned by successive Labor administrations in the half century since. Our membership of the United Nations was once again shaped by Labor under foreign minister Evatt in 1945, Evatt's participation in the drafting of the UN charter and Australia's chairing of the first meeting of the UN Security Council.
Our policy of comprehensive engagement with Asia is of a more recent vintage: shaped by Prime Minister Whitlam in 1972 and given further and more comprehensive expression under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating. Our policy of comprehensive engagement of Asia is based on the unremarkable principle that the national security of Australia is enhanced if you have good relations with your neighbours and, by corollary, it is undermined if you have bad relations with your neighbours. 
This is the national security policy framework of the Australian Labor Party and it is the framework within which we have developed our policy on Iraq. Each of these principles has its own logic, its own history and its own emotion, but all are galvanised by a single organising principle—namely, how do we as a nation of 19 million people in a region of three billion people best secure our long-term future?
Labor's approach to national security policy differs fundamentally from that of the government. The government argues that the beginning and the end of our security is secured by a single pillar alone—namely, our alliance with the United States. Labor have no argument about the primary importance of this alliance. We do, however, argue about its exclusive importance, particularly when it comes to the exclusion of a comprehensive commitment to the United Nations as well as a commitment to a policy of comprehensive engagement with our region.
The attitude of the Howard government towards the United Nations over the last seven years has ranged from ambivalence to neglect to outright derision. The catalogue of this government's abuse of the United Nations is too long to canvass properly in this debate. Scarcely a single UN agency has escaped this government's polemics: the Security Council, the General Assembly, the economic and social organs of the UN, the High Commissioner for Refugees and the human rights commission—and the list goes on. Why has the government done this? The large part of the answer lies in the domestic political dividend which the government believes derives from a solid dose of UN bashing. Remember the last election campaign when John Winston Howard proclaimed from posters on every schoolyard fence in the country:
We'll decide who comes into this country—not anybody else.
The quote `not anybody else' was a reference to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Human Rights Commissioner or any other of those `faceless UN bureaucrats'—to quote the foreign minister—that form part of the daily cannon fodder of Minister Downer's and Minister Ruddock's routine polemic in this parliament over a very long time.
—At least we stand up for Australia.
—You sell out every time.
—You are as trite as you are ridiculous, Minister.
—Which minister?
—That one there; not this one, this time. As I have said in this place a number of times before, the central organising principle of this government's foreign policy is a continuation of domestic electoral politics by other means. The problem arises when the government finds itself in desperate need of an international political fig leaf to camouflage its actions from time to time or when it needs to persuade some of its more aggrieved domestic constituencies that there may just be a dollop of post facto morality that can be grafted onto its predetermined policies and programs. This is precisely the dilemma that the government found itself in three years ago over East Timor when it, for the first time, ran into both the political and security policy imperative of a UN Security Council mandate. Once again, this unprincipled government now finds itself facing the same dilemma over Iraq. For the government, it is not a dilemma driven by principle at all; it is a dilemma driven by a domestic political crisis, as once again the government has found itself radically out of step with the Australian people. If domestic electoral politics is the central organising principle of this government's foreign policy, then polling research is its engine. The truth of the matter is that Mark Textor has spoken and the government is now into domestic damage control on Iraq; hence the tawdry spectacle of a Prime Minister departing for abroad trying to tack on, as an afterthought, a last-minute call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York to provide himself with some veneer of multilateral respectability.
This government's commitment to the UN is all politics, not policy—and certainly not principle. The great truth of this government's foreign policy is that its mismanagement of the UN parallels almost entirely its mismanagement of its relations with the region. This is not a mere matter of coincidence; it is a logical consequence of a government for whom the domestic political drivers are always paramount. The awful truth is that, just as John Howard has been `standing up to the UN' and seeing that as good politics, so too has he seen standing up to Asia as good politics. The examples, once again, are too numerous—even too depressing—to list. Australia now has fewer friends in the region than it did seven years ago; Australia now has more enemies in the region than it did seven years ago; and there are now fewer people in the region who are neutral about Australia than there were seven years ago. These factors are a consequence of the government's policy. Whether we like it or not, this is not good for this nation's long-term security.
As we approach the great debate that is now taking place across the world on Iraq, it is important to understand the foreign and security policy context within which that debate occurs in Australia. I said at the beginning that Labor's approach to our policy on Iraq is shaped by our alliance with the US, our membership of the UN and our engagement with the region. Labor's commitment to the alliance has been consistent. It is because of that commitment that Labor, without reservation, supported the Prime Minister's decision to invoke the alliance in support of Australia's military commitment in Afghanistan in October 2001. We did so not only because of the warmth between our two peoples but also because the attacks against the United States on 11 September triggered specific provisions of the ANZUS treaty. These were attacks on the metropolitan territory of the United States and, as a consequence, we had an obligation to assist our ally in meeting the common danger. That danger was al-Qaeda, and the Taliban administration of Afghanistan which gave it succour. My party remains committed to the prosecution of that campaign to eliminate al-Qaeda, root and branch. As a party and as a country, we have no truck with terrorist organisations responsible for the barbarism that was September 11. In fact, understanding S11 is an important part of understanding changes to US foreign policy that have become apparent since then.
For America, this attack was a violating experience. It marked the first time since the war of 1812 that there had been an external attack on the American mainland. Beyond history, however, the immediacy and carnage of S11 have fundamentally changed the American mind and, in part, it reflects American attitudes on Iraq. As friends and allies of America, the challenge that we have faced is whether Iraq is in part responsible for the S11 attacks. Were that clear, Iraq could legitimately be regarded as the Taliban is: as sponsors or cosponsors of an attack on the metropolitan territory of an ally. However, so far no such evidence has been presented, although, as we have said since the beginning, we remain open to receiving such evidence. A related factor is whether Iraq has provided or is likely to provide al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction. Once again, to date we have received no such evidence. We remain open to receiving such evidence, including in the address by Secretary Powell to the Security Council on Thursday. More broadly, we have asked whether Iraqi weapons of mass destruction represent a real, present and credible danger to the sovereign territory of Australia's allies and Australia itself. To date we have not received any such evidence, although again we wait for Secretary Powell's address and for the report of the UN weapons inspectors.
For these reasons, based on the evidence to date, Iraq does not represent a basis for the formal invocation of the ANZUS alliance. The PM has inferred that it does. We disagree although we, like the PM, understand that the alliance involves a relationship well beyond its formal letter. The tests that I have referred to above—on both the link to September 11 and the threat posed by Iraqi WMD to our security—are not just relevant to our obligations under the alliance; more broadly, they are also relevant to our consideration of the possibility of unilateral US military action beyond the Security Council, be it under the self-defence provisions of article 51 of the UN charter or beyond the UN charter altogether. So far we have not been presented with evidence that would justify Australian military participation in such unilateral action, be it within the framework of the alliance or beyond it. 
For these reasons, for Labor, the Iraq matter is one which properly is dealt with under the UN Security Council. The Security Council does not represent a soft option on Iraq. The Security Council was established by the international community to defend against threats to international peace and security. Chapter 7 of the UN charter contains specific provisions—in particular, article 42—for the military enforcement of its resolutions if the council so determines. 
Since 1991 Iraq has been in consistent defiance of its obligations under successive Security Council resolutions to disarm itself of WMD and long-range missiles. That is a fact; no-one could or should dispute it. Security Council resolution 1441 of November 2002—agreed to, 15-0, by the world community—represents a final call for Iraq to comply. Iraq is to be condemned utterly for its noncompliance to date—including its noncooperation with resolution 1441, as demonstrated by both the Blix report and, in part, the ElBaradei report, of 27 January. Dr Blix next reports on 14 February, and it represents an imperative for Iraq to comply with international obligations placed on it. 
Following Blix's next report, the UN Security Council will meet again and they are likely to consider a second resolution on Iraq. Labor and the rest of the international community await the outcome of those critical deliberations, the content of the resolution they produce, the findings on Iraqi compliance, and any sanctioned action. Labor's policy is to support the Security Council in conformity with international law. Labor, in April last year, called for the exhaustion of UN processes—nearly six months before the US or the Australian government decided that going to the UN was a good thing. After President Bush's address to the UN General Assembly on 12 September, Labor, on 13 September, released a five-point policy on the desirable subsequent shape of the UN's handling of Iraq. That policy has been reflected in the subsequent course of events, including our call for a second resolution deliberating on the outcome of Security Council resolution 1441. Labor has been consistent in its policy on Iraq.
I contrast this with the government's approach to Iraq. Last July Labor argued for the exhaustion of UN processes on Iraq. The government, led by the minister currently at the table, accused us of appeasement. Last August Labor argued for the paramountcy of the UN Security Council. The government, led by the minister at the table, accused us of being like Saddam Hussein. Last September, in response to bad opinion polls, the government suddenly tried to wrap itself in the UN flag. Last year the government committed itself to regime change in Iraq; this year the government says it is not committed to regime change in Iraq. Last year the government said it was agnostic on the need to obtain a second Security Council resolution on Iraq; this year the government suddenly decided that a second resolution, to quote what the Prime Minister said just before, is `highly desirable'. Where does agnosticism suddenly become highly desirable?
What is the common element in all of this? It is a government whose foreign policy is driven by political market research, a government which believes that a foreign policy process is a process of domestic political massage, a government which thought at the beginning of the Iraq debate last year that it could be a cute political opportunity to apply the Tampa template of the previous election. The single consistent hallmark of this government's policy on Iraq is its inconsistency. 
The international community is engaged in a grave debate on Iraq. So, too, are the Australian people. One dimension of that debate which remains unaddressed is the humanitarian cost of any subsequent war which may occur. What will be the cost in terms of human lives, civilian lives, the numbers of internally displaced persons and the numbers of refugees? My challenge to the minister, as he stands in this debate, is to outline to the parliament his plans and provisions for meeting the humanitarian costs of war in Iraq.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—International efforts to deal with the threat posed by Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction are at a critical juncture. Today I want to take the opportunity to elaborate on the Prime Minister's statement about why we must be part of the international effort to deal with this problem and why the international community must not fail.
There is no greater threat to our common future than the spread of nuclear weapons and their budget counterparts—chemical and biological weapons. Australia's concern about weapons of mass destruction is not new. We have invested much in pursuing nonproliferation over many years and involving several governments. The Howard government has played its part. In 1996 we acted as midwife to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We played a critical role in the success of the 2000 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. We worked tirelessly to promote a verification mechanism for the biological weapons convention, an Australian initiative which the Leader of the Opposition misleadingly and falsely referred to. We played a major role in efforts to start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty in the conference on disarmament in Geneva, and we are still pursuing that.
Our record builds on the record of previous governments. Previous governments established the Australia Group to stop the export of chemical and biological precursors—and I will come back to that. Our record builds on the record of previous governments in bringing the nonproliferation treaty and the chemical weapons convention into being and in addressing the proliferation of missiles and missiles technology. But Australia's activism against Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction has been just as long standing. As I mentioned earlier, in the mid-1980s Australia led the formation of what is known as the Australia Group after Iraq used chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, killing many thousands of Iranians in the most horrific way.
But the concern and involvement of successive Australian governments did not stop there. Australian forces participated in the liberation of Kuwait. Since 1991, the Royal Australian Navy has helped to enforce United Nations sanctions to stop the flow of goods that could be used to revive Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. From 1991 to 1998, 110 Australians served with UNSCOM, the predecessor of UNMOVIC. At one stage an Australian was the chairman of UNSCOM; indeed, we were the fourth largest national contributor. Today, a number of Australians continue this proud tradition by serving with both UNMOVIC and the IAEA as weapons inspectors. 
In 1998 we sent military forces to the Gulf to do precisely what we are trying to do now: convince Saddam to cooperate with the United Nations Security Council. None of these efforts was undertaken on a whim; they all enjoyed bipartisan support, by us in opposition and by colleagues opposite when they were in government. Why? Because successive Australian governments have concluded that stopping Iraq and other countries from acquiring weapons of mass destruction is a key to ensuring global security—including Australia's security. If we allow countries in other parts of the world to develop weapons of mass destruction, then these weapons will eventually turn up in our own neighbourhood. If Iraq is allowed to develop weapons of mass destruction, what message does that send to countries like North Korea? This is why it is wrong to argue that we are focusing on Iraq at the expense of other issues, including North Korea. We are, in fact, focusing on both. They are manifestations of the same problem that, at this stage, require different approaches. 
Do we really need to remind ourselves of the effects of these awful weapons? Do we really need to look again at pictures of children who died in their mothers' arms in the Iraqi town of Halabja when Saddam, using chemical weapons, massacred 5,000 ethnic Kurds? Do we really need to be reminded that just a few drops of VX on the skin can cause rapid death? Do we really need to consider what might happen if these weapons fall into terrorist hands? We know from two unnecessary wars Saddam started—against Iran and against Kuwait—that he is malevolent, and we know that he remains a strong backer of terrorist organisations. Can we really sit back and accept the risk that this poses?
There are other compelling reasons why we feel so strongly and so sincerely about this issue. Our alliance with the United States is certainly one of them, but the idea that our position on Iraq reflects some kind of blind loyalty to the United States is wrong. Equally, I do not assert that all those who oppose the position the Americans have taken on Iraq are driven by a blind hatred of the United States—although I do warn them not to feed on such anti-Americanism as there is in the community. I think the Leader of the Opposition's speech—not necessarily other speeches—has certainly fallen into that category. This government will always act ultimately in accordance with our national interest. 
Let us be clear: Australia and the United States do share alliance commitments and obligations. We benefit greatly from the influence we have in Washington which enables us to help shape international approaches. This government, more than almost any other government on earth, has been consulted by the United States every step of the way on the Iraq issue during the last year. The President has rung our Prime Minister on several occasions. The Prime Minister has met with the President, and the Prime Minister has been invited to go and meet with him again next week so that our country can have a decisive input into the formulation of policy by the world's most powerful nation. I do not think there has ever been a time in our history when Australia has been able to exert such influence in Washington because of the closeness of our relationship. 
We do share common values and interests with the United States, and we value the global leadership of the United States in defending those values and interests. Let me quote the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair—a Labour leader whom we can respect—on the relationship the United Kingdom government has with the United States. This reflects precisely my own sentiments towards the United States. Tony Blair said: 
`I will defend that relation absolutely and solidly, because I think it is important for us and the wider world. I do not think it right that the United States is made to face these issues alone. They are important issues and the world community has a responsibility to meet them.'
Great words from a great leader, who is a leader of the Labour Party—but the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. 
The question today is less about whether Saddam is guilty of trying to hide his weapons of destruction—we know he is; or why this matters to Australia—we know it does. The real question today is what we, the international community, are going to do about it. Critics portray the situation as being a choice between giving peace a chance by giving the inspectors more time and going to war against Iraq. This is a false distinction. More time, on its own, does not give peace a chance—but it will give Saddam a chance: a chance to renege again on his obligations to the Security Council and a chance to keep hiding his weapons of mass destruction capabilities until he can threaten us. 
We do not want war; no-one wants war. Quite the contrary. I am all for giving Saddam more time if it leads to his disarmament, but it will not do so while Saddam continues his current pattern of deception and contempt for the United Nations, its inspectors and Security Council resolutions. The United Nations inspectors' job is to verify that what Saddam is telling them about his weapons of mass destruction program is true; it is not to find a needle in a haystack. They have not been able to do so, and they will never be able to do so unless and until Saddam cooperates. Because war is so abhorrent, military force must be used only when all other options have been exhausted. We should give him some more time, but not time for inspectors to wander fruitlessly in the desert—time instead for Saddam to demonstrate, and not just say, that he will cooperate fully, forthrightly and actively.
The world is asking some very reasonable and pertinent questions of Saddam: just what have you done with at least 8,500 litres of biological warfare agent, which your officials told inspectors you had? What have you done with 650 kilograms of biological growth media, enough to produce 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax? Why are you lying about your production of VX, one of the most lethal chemical agents known? What have you done with 6,500 chemical weapon munitions, which your documents say you had, but which you have never declared? Why are you making missiles that exceed the range allowed for under United Nations resolutions?
In resolution 1441 the international community explicitly gave Saddam yet another and a final chance. We have supported all along a leading role for the United Nations in addressing this threat. We have encouraged the US administration to pursue the issue through the UN. To those who accuse us of backing US unilateralism I say that in Europe last week I worked to extend the coalition of concerned countries. I met the French and German foreign ministers, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU Commissioner for External Relations, and I also spent time with the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, whom I have known for many years. This comes in addition to recent consultations with key partners in our region, including the Indonesians. I spoke a week or so ago with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, about this issue amongst other things.
I can say to you that we are not alone either in our concern or in our preparedness ultimately to act if necessary. Our military predeployment in the Gulf is to demonstrate to Saddam that the international community, not just one or two countries, is serious about his compliance with UN resolutions. This decision has been criticised by the Leader of the Opposition, but let me again quote a Labour leader, Tony Blair, explaining his government's predeployment of over 30,000 troops: `Alongside the diplomacy there must be genuine preparedness and planning to take action if diplomacy fails.'
The Security Council should remain at the heart of any steps the international community takes on Iraq—including military action, which we would prefer to be authorised by a second United Nations resolution. We therefore welcome the US call for a meeting of the Security Council on 5 February to consider further evidence of Iraq's failure to meet its obligations. There is now a considerable onus on the members of the Security Council. If they do not or cannot act to ensure compliance with resolution 1441 they will damage not only the trust the international community places in them but also the very institution they serve. The unanimous passage of resolution 1441 led us all to expect that the Security Council would work to resolve this issue once and for all. They must not allow us to be disappointed.
After the Second World War we said we would never again allow monsters such as Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo to commit acts of barbarism at home and aggression abroad. We said we knew the wisdom of the saying that those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. Yet we have not done well, particularly since the end of the Cold War. We allowed the slaughter of around one million people in Rwanda because the international community decided not to intervene until it was too late. We allowed slaughter in Bosnia, and again the international community did not intervene until it was, at least, very late. We allowed President Milosevic to murder Kosovars until the United States of America, with a coalition of the willing, put a stop to it.
We have acted in Kosovo, in East Timor—this country in particular has acted in East Timor—and in Afghanistan to redress the balance a little. Although imperfect, these actions represent critical steps towards protecting the victims of barbarism. Yet still many—particularly, ironically, curiously—on the political left, here and abroad, shrug and say that the murder, torture and rape of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis by their own rulers should go unchecked and that we should trust Saddam not to repeat his use of chemical weapons on his own people and his neighbours. I cannot, in conscience, ignore the record of Saddam Hussein as a ruthless tyrant who tries still, in the face of international opinion, to retain and develop the most evil of weapons. As foreign minister of this country, I do not want to be remembered for turning my back on such evil and allowing the spectre of Saddam to haunt future generations.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I have received guernseys in this debate on Iraq, courtesy of the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, with regard to stands I took in 1998. Let me refer to those circumstances, because they go to the nub of what we are talking about now. Those actions, as I recollect them, related to a refusal by Saddam Hussein to allow his presidential palaces to be inspected. It was a matter before the United Nations at the time, which was subsequently resolved—temporarily, anyway—by agreement between Kofi Annan and Saddam Hussein. There was no issue there of regime change or of effecting the acts of disarmament by invasion.
Therein lies the nub of the problem now. As I recollect, the role of the SAS in those circumstances would have been combat; search and rescue for any downed pilots, as military activities were ramped up and vital sites to Saddam were attacked; and perhaps long-range reconnaissance also, associated with targeting related to those same attacks. It is a very different problem we are dealing with now. That is why this has caused such concern in the United States and such division for time in the United States administration. It has caused less division than it should have in the Australian government, but certainly a great deal of division amongst the Australian people.
What will be the consequences of this act for Western relationships with Muslim states in the Middle East? Can our relationships with such states here in the South-East Asian region be sustained while this action is pursued? These are serious foreign policy questions and they raise a totally different order of issue than was raised back in 1998. That was part of ongoing—and, I must say, ultimately unsuccessful—sets of international pressures to try to get Saddam Hussein to comply with agreements he undertook.
There have been many things in Labor foreign policy since World War II, but two central things are at its core. One is a commitment to the United States alliance in detail. It is a meaningful commitment, a belief that internationally the United States serves our security, serves global security and advances the interests of democracy and that locally it enhances the capability of Australian defence forces. We take these issues very seriously and always have in the Australian Labor Party. The second is a commitment to the UN. I do not need to say more about that; the Leader of the Opposition in his own remarks eloquently presented the reasons why we are committed to the United Nations. We have had those two things at the heart of our foreign policy. At no stage would we regard them as obviating a requirement on the Australian government to make independent judgments about our own interests, particularly as they related to our own region.
Australian governments have always been aware of the possibility existing that a commitment to something that the United Nations may want or to something that the United States may want may cut across Australian interests and that that would have to be either stepped away from or massaged in such a way as to ensure that Australian interests are always advanced by the actions that we take internationally. We have never assumed that you simply give a tick to anything that an international organisation or ally says is desirable for you to support. That is a very important consideration and calculation here.
Also, I might say in this debate that what has never been part of Labor Party policy, either domestic or foreign, is support for the thuggish activities of international ratbags like Saddam Hussein. It has never been part of Labor Party policy to associate with a man who has murdered the political left in Iraq on a routine basis, sometimes letting them loose to entrap themselves by their own words, and who has murdered large numbers of minorities. There used to be something like 250,000 Marsh Arabs. The marshes are drained and there are now 50,000. What happened to the other 200,000? If he is ultimately overthrown by a course of action pursued here, he will be overthrown in the certain knowledge that the bulk of the Iraqi community simply do not agree with him because they do not share his regime. His regime is drawn from a minority of a small minority. The majority of the Iraqis, the Shiites and the Kurds, are routinely persecuted by him. It has never been part of Australian Labor Party policy to have the slightest degree of sympathy for that gentleman I describe as an international ratbag.
Having said all of that, we are obliged to come to a consideration of where we are now and what we ought to do. Let me be absolutely clear: we are now here primarily discussing these things because of the defiance by Saddam Hussein of United Nations resolutions. It is a defiance which has proceeded for something like 12 years. There is an essential difference between Saddam's circumstances and those of the up to 16 other nations which are also in possession of weapons that they ought not have—that is, weapons such as chemical weapons, biological weapons and nuclear weapons. The essential difference between Saddam Hussein's situation and theirs is that they have no UN resolutions applying to them because they did not attack their neighbours with these weapons; it is as simple as that. That is why there is no UN mandate for an inspection of what might be taking place in Libya, Syria or Iran or in any of the other powers that might have such weapons. They have not used them on their own people. There is a question mark over whether they have invaded their neighbours. If they have invaded their neighbours, they have done it in a way that has not drawn the attention of the international community in the way in which Saddam Hussein managed to do over Kuwait. So there is a nub of a difference there.
There is another characteristic of these resolutions which deserves a mention, and that is that they are under chapter VII of the United Nations charter. Chapter VII has as its heading `Action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression'. This is the very serious chapter of United Nations rules, regulations, laws and principles, which the United Nations activates when they intend to do something about it. If the United Nations announces under chapter VII that it intends to do something about a matter and it is not done, that will undermine the authority of the United Nations; that will render it ineffective. There are many other resolutions under other chapters. Resolution 242 gets a bit of a guernsey here every now and then. Resolution 242 is under chapter VI, not chapter VII. It does not carry the same mandate and authority that chapter VII carries. Chapter VI is the United Nations trying to put up resolutions which might help the process of peace and it states matters of principle that are important for the world to take into consideration. Resolution 242 says that Israel should withdraw from territories that it has occupied. It also says that Israel should withdraw to secure and recognised boundaries and that the one is dependent upon the other. Resolution 242 says that, but it is not a chapter VII resolution.
Another reason this matter is before us is September 11. It is quite conceivable that had September 11 not occurred this issue simply would have drifted away. The further you are from the events which cause a particular resolution to be passed but the resolution does not succeed, the less likely you are to insist on its enforcement; you might say, `Let's get on with life and do other things.' Saddam Hussein was very unlucky. September 11 changed that. It meant that the United States administration now views just about anything internationally of a military nature through the prism of a potential terrorist attack on the United States. Up there in lights is the possibility of the utilisation of biological, chemical or radiological material in a way that destroys the lives of vast numbers of American citizens. And no American politician will be prepared to see a line traced back through the subsequent investigation to his or her watch when they might have been able to do something about it. The fact that the United States sees things through that prism and that Iraq has been so defiant does not of itself suggest a particular policy for the United States or for Australia, but it is a powerful underpinning force to their considerations. Those who are friends of the United States, like ourselves, need to contemplate that when we enter into dialogue with the United States.
We do have a chance to influence American policy. The Prime Minister had a chance to influence American policy in July last year. He chose a particular course. Though informed by all the same sets of facts, in the United States administration there was greater division—division to the point of dysfunctionality—on what ought to be done. Were they dealing with an actual terrorist threat which required an immediate American unilateral response to take it out irrespective of the views of the international community or the effect it might have among American friends in the Arab community or elsewhere, or did they have a UN problem? What did they have?
On one side of the argument, there were people like Powell and Armitage who said they had a UN problem and they ought to be very careful about how they acted because they were going to be confronted with a substantial postwar problem that would mean that the United States would need the good regard and friendship of large numbers of people as they continued their activity beyond the point of the overthrow of the regime. On the other side of the argument stood apparently the Vice-President and the Secretary of Defense. They said, `This is nonsense. This is an American interest at stake here. This needs to be dealt with right now by us.' Where did the Prime Minister stand in this debate when he had influence?
—Nowhere.
—No, he did, I am afraid. He stood on the side of the unilateralists. If you look at the comments that were made by the foreign minister and the Prime Minister at the time, and you understand the debate that was going on inside the United States, the weighting of the view of the foreign minister and the Prime Minister was in that direction. Ironically, the Labor Party, which had deliberated on this a couple of months before, was weighted in the other direction. Even more ironically, the Prime Minister finds himself desperately scrambling to get to the Labor Party's April position. The government cannot avoid that. Government members cannot walk away from the fact that, when we talked about a two-resolution process—indeed, when we talked about going to the United Nations—they accused us of appeasement and slackness. You cannot get away from that. The words are on the record. But the opposition's words are now your words; they are now your position. It was commonsense then and it is commonsense now. Whatever the interests of the United States are in this matter, we need the United Nations.
Why do we need the United Nations? The United States is like an elephant in a small room. The United States sits where it likes. Whatever the United States does for good or ill, other people have to deal with it. It is that powerful. It can make mistakes. It can defend itself from all comers when a problem arises. We are not in that position. We live in this region. We have an obligation upon us to calibrate our policy in a way that is sustainable as we deal with our neighbourhood.
Having made those statements, the Prime Minister was under an awesome obligation. He was under an obligation to ensure that he so commended Australian diplomacy to the South-East Asian region that there would be no blow-back from the policy that was being pursued in relation to Iraq. That was an absolute obligation on the Prime Minister. We could have expected from the Prime Minister a personally conducted round of diplomacy—not conducted by a junior official in the foreign ministry but conducted by the Prime Minister himself. We could have expected a routine and regular visit by the Prime Minister to the nations in the South-East Asian region.
What did we get from the Prime Minister? Fatuous rubbish about pre-emption. It was fatuous rubbish because he knows darn well that, if we decide to intervene in any South-East Asian nation, we have to do it with the permission of the power itself. It was a totally needless debate, but one which raised massive suspicions about the intentions of Australia. We have interests in this region. Australian lives have already been lost in it; Australian lives and interests continue to be threatened. We have to be able to have people in the region as allies to deal with a terrorist threat. We have to be able to balance what we do in Iraq, what we do to support the United Nations in Iraq and what we do to support the United States in Iraq with what we do to commend ourself to the region around us.
I do not think this has penetrated anywhere in the prime ministerial mind. I just do not think it has. I cannot believe that the Prime Minister has become so complacent that he cannot see this and, if he saw it, would not act on it. It is too late to turn up to Megawati now, I am afraid.
Some commentators out there suggest that the Labor Party desperately needs the UN resolution. No, Australia and this government desperately need a UN resolution. They need it. They need it if we are to be able—after the government's neglect—to sustain a viable position for this nation in the region in which our security ultimately lies. Whatever our allies' capabilities, whatever the United Nations does, in the end we have to be clever enough to defend ourselves by our diplomacy and our military activities in this region, and we need the United Nations.

"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—It is very appropriate that my colleague the member for Longman and I are the first to follow the leadership group from the government side in responding to the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq. Both of us have served six years in our respective arms of the defence forces. We have been through recruit training, weapons training and refresher training, and we have participated in exercises of various sizes and compositions. I have many friends still serving with whom I still keep in contact because they have a really good grip on life, good life priorities and a special humour which I share and which I have seldom found in civilian life. In my electorate of Lindsay I have a number of constituents who are also currently serving ADF personnel at Air Command, at Richmond, at 1CAMD or JALO as it is now called. No doubt many other members have relatives and friends currently serving and share the nation's enormous concern for their safety and wellbeing. Just like our firefighters and police officers, they are trained to deal with situations where lives are on the line.
I participated in many exercises in my time in the RAAF, which included three years in Malaysia with our support unit in Butterworth, where we have PC3 Orions on active duty. Twice a year our RAAF F18 aircraft would deploy to Malaysia for Exercise Churinga in accordance with our obligations under the Five Power Defence Arrangements. These deployments were staged and carefully planned well in advance of the exercises actually undertaken in situ.
It appears to me that there is a perception, especially on those benches opposite, that you can just click your fingers and magically your armed personnel appear in an area of operations ready to defend or prosecute an objective. The reality is somewhat different. No matter how carefully planned, and most large exercises I was involved in were planned at least two years in advance and quite frequently five years in advance, some things always go wrong, be it with supply lines—I do recall that we nearly ran out of fuel on one pitch-black exercise in Darwin, much to the chagrin of the American counterparts we were exercising with—or with communications. No matter how much redundancy is built into an exercise, comms was the bane of commanders and troops alike.
The Leader of the Opposition would not have Operation Bastille. He seems to think that you can become a member of a coalition force one day, have your troops arrive in a hot AO the next day and then participate in combat operations the next day. Nothing could be further from the truth. When the RAAF deploys just six F-18 or F-111 aircraft to Las Vegas for Red Flag, to Cold Lake, Canada for Maple Flag or Eielson Base in Alaska for Cope Thunder, it would take three or four 707s over six days to deploy. What they would be seeking to deploy is the personnel and all the equipment, the spares—all the gear that is required just to support an exercise where you know how long you are going for and if the gear does not work, hey, it is only a couple of weeks before you are back home anyway.
Today, we have the initiative over Saddam Hussein. This is something no ADF person wants lost by incompetent commanders. Currently, there is a flow of forces to the Middle East. This is placing tremendous pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors in and to disarm. Our forces need to be a part of that force flow. That force flow is occurring on a strict timetable geared around the availability of sea and airlift assets. There are only so many Galaxy Starlifters and C130s available. Therefore, to predeploy you do require tremendous amount of planning and pre-positioning. If you miss that timetable of pre-positioning then you fall to the back of the order.
You can guarantee that if our F-18 planes are required the last thing they want to do is arrive after a two-day flight using air-to-air refuellers and not have their test equipment there, their spares, their ground personnel such as maintenance experts and radar technicians and air defence personnel and their hoochies, sleeping bags and ration packs—all the basic things that give you air power. If there is any probability that we will have to click into an order of battle with coalition partners in the Middle East, we need to be part of the force flow that is happening in serial and in parallel as we speak.
A tenet of military power is that if you are not prepared to deploy your defence assets then you are not prepared to use them. The very clear message that Saddam Hussein has is that the United States is prepared to use force. Kofi Annan has set out how influential that has been in getting Saddam Hussein to comply with the weapons inspectors. The Leader of the Opposition in 1998 reiterated how influential that predeployment, and the actual deployment, is.
The League of Nations failed because it was perceived to have no teeth. We cannot let that happen to the United Nations, which is still in its infancy as a world policeman. The Leader of the Opposition does our Defence Force personnel a grave injustice when he states he is not prepared to countenance their deployment but would sanction their being involved if there is a UN resolution. The reality is that from this side of the world it would take our forces, basically at the very end of any force flow with limited sea and airlift assets, an incredibly long time to arrive in a hot theatre of operations with troops who are not acclimatised or integrated with our coalition partners and the coalition forces they will be fighting beside. They would be unfamiliar with personnel, personal strengths, confidence building exercises, computer incompatibilities, comms problems, unique geograph-i-cal and topographical features, weather phenomena and the strengths and weaknesses of the teams they will be working within.
This is the Leader of the Opposition's strategy and understanding of the application of military force. As an alternative Prime Minister, he would mail a detailed order of battle, a battle plan and timetable to Iraq via our domestic media to further his domestic agenda.
The Prime Minister has guided us through Timor and Afghanistan. He is ensuring that we maintain the initiative for our defence forces by deploying assets and personnel that may be required—which we all pray is not the case. But if it is, then you can count on our Prime Minister, who has a genuine understanding of military strategies and the relevant experience, to retain the initiative and give our ADF every advantage when their lives are on the line.
The world cannot allow the twin pillars of evil of terrorism and rogue states with NBC capability to coalesce. The world cannot stand by, as the Leader of the Opposition would, and do nothing. The Prime Minister has shown he has the experience, the capability and the confidence of the Australian people and this parliament. He is the man of the hour and this is a time when we need someone of his stature and not someone of the military incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,3,1
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—When this House debated the prospect of war with Iraq on 17 September last year, I was in New York representing the parliament as part of Australia's delegation to the United Nations. There I had the opportunity to observe the workings of the Security Council, the principal UN body charged with keeping the peace. Outside the entrance to the council, the place where Security Council representatives make statements to the press, hangs a reproduction of Pablo Picasso's most celebrated work, Guernica.
The story of Guernica is well-known, but it deserves to be told again. On 26 April 1937, German bombers attacked the town of Guernica in northern Spain. The village was left in ruins, with 1,600 civilians killed or wounded. This act of terror—the first large-scale aerial attack against a civilian population centre—outraged the world. It compelled Picasso, then living in Paris, to begin the work that would become his testament against the horrors of war and one of the greatest artworks of the 20th century.
I am told that the UN's Guernica was donated by the philanthropist Nelson A. Rockefeller in 1985. Unfortunately, it is no longer on display. According to press reports, on 27 January this year a large, blue curtain was hung to cover it up. Questioned why the painting had been covered, UN press spokesman Fred Eckhard said the blue curtain was a technically better background for the cameras covering statements being made outside the Security Council. This may be the official explanation, but the same media reports quote unnamed diplomats observing that it would not be appropriate for the US Ambassador at the UN, John Negroponte, or Secretary of State Colin Powell to talk about war with Iraq against a backdrop depicting images of women, children and animals crying with horror and showing the suffering of war. Whatever the reasons, there is a profound symbolism in pulling a shroud over this great work of art. For throughout the debate on Iraq, whether at the UN, in the US or here in Australia, there has been a remarkable degree of obfuscation, evasion and denial—and never more so than when it comes to the grim realities of military action.
Our Prime Minister denies, of course, that he has committed Australian troops to war. He denies that he shares the Bush administration's goal of `regime change' in Baghdad. He does not rule out supporting a unilateral attack, an attack not authorised by the UN, even though this would constitute a gross violation of international law. The Prime Minister has nothing to say about the long-term implications of invading and occupying Iraq—either for the stability of the Middle East or for terrorist threat to Australia—and the Prime Minister has only platitudes to offer about the humanitarian cost of war. He has nothing to say about the thousands of lives that may be lost, the homes, hospitals and schools that will be destroyed or the hundreds of thousands of refugees who will be forced to flee their homes. All along the Prime Minister dissembles, denies and evades. From the very beginning of this debate he has sought to pull his own curtain of deceit over his war diplomacy.
We are certainly on the brink of war. Matters will probably come to a head in the second half of this month. The US and the UK will seek a measure of endorsement for military action from the Security Council. Given the immense US leverage, this may be forthcoming. It appears more likely than it did some weeks ago. Failing that, the US and the UK will attack Iraq anyway. But the case for war has not been made. Of course, Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator, responsible for appalling war crimes and abuses of human rights, but overthrowing the government of a sovereign state is an extraordinary undertaking, and I have not seen much evidence to suggest that human rights is the driving element of US or UK policy. Nor is this part of the war against terrorism. Despicable as he is, Saddam Hussein has not been linked to the events of 11 September 2001. Nor has evidence been presented indicating Iraq has given or plans to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. Secretary of State Powell will apparently present new information to the Security Council, but I think we would have already heard of any definitive evidence linking Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. The Americans are already telling the world they have not got a smoking gun. 
Nor has the international community exhausted all the diplomatic options to secure the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability. Iraq has accepted the resumption of UN weapon inspections and has so far not restricted their activities. It is argued that Iraq should cooperate more positively. This may well be so—of course it is so—but a lack of proactive cooperation is no case for war. It must also be recognised that Saddam Hussein's overwhelming interest is in his survival. Why would he unleash a weapon of mass destruction that would invite overwhelming US retaliation? Paradoxically, a military effort to eliminate Hussein is precisely the circumstance most likely to prompt Iraq to use any capability it possesses. It may, indeed, be the circumstance in which Hussein hands chemical and biological agents to terrorist networks, but this is a risk the United States is apparently prepared to take in order to impose its will.
The truth is US policy towards Iraq is less about the threat of weapons of mass destruction than it is about redrawing the strategic map of the Middle East. As I have said on previous occasions, `regime change' is exactly what it says: it is about installing a pro-American regime in Baghdad; it is about changing the regime that controls Iraq's oil wealth; and it is about putting in place a regime supportive of the US military presence in the Middle East. In the process, the US may unleash events with unpredictable consequences, especially in the longer term. The US is already engaged in an open-ended commitment in Afghanistan. The occupation and reconstruction of Iraq will be a vastly greater undertaking, with unpredictable consequences for the whole Middle East. Rebuilding Iraq under a new pro-American government will be a task fraught with difficulty. It will require the support of the broad international community, support the US has so far failed to mobilise. Coupled with the ongoing horror of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a US-led assault on Iraq will fuel Islamic fundamentalism and provide many new recruits for terrorist groups. The US may rapidly achieve its military objectives, but these may prove to be steps into a strategic and political morass.
The Howard government has not had anything to say in this debate about the long-term implications of military action and the prospective occupation of Iraq. `Our government will support whatever action the US takes'—it is really as simple as that—and while Australia's military commitment to an attack will be but a small part of the US-led force, our government's rhetoric has put Australia in the very front rank of George Bush's cheer squad.
With all of this flag-waving for Bush comes an increased risk of future terrorist attack against Australians both overseas and at home. Since the US President asserted his right to take unilateral military action against any threat he perceived to his country's interests, only the UK and Australia have declared enthusiastic support. Now the Prime Minister is preparing to scurry off to Washington, hoping to make the Bush-Blair duo a triumvirate. Australia's outspoken identification with the US and the UK as global enforcers places us at substantially greater risk of terrorist attack. By his rhetoric and his actions, the Prime Minister has incited and invited extremist attention towards Australia. The danger will be greatest for Australians overseas—for Australia's embassies and consulates, for Australian businesses and, as we have already seen so tragically with the Bali bombings, for our tourists. If the government were honest in its antiterrorism advertising campaign, it would warn Australians very clearly and directly of the increased risk of further terrorist horror if we are involved in a US-led attack on Iraq.
Where should Australia be standing on this whole issue? I put it to the House that we should be standing for the rule of international law. We should be standing with the collective authority of the United Nations. We should be arguing against unilateralism. We should be making it clear that the case for military action has not yet been made. We should make it clear that there can be no case for military action while weapons inspections are continuing. In the event of Iraqi obstruction, military action should follow only with the explicit authorisation of the Security Council. A further Security Council resolution is essential for military action to have any legitimacy.
For our part, Australia should not support military action without this explicit authority; nor should we support military action that extends beyond the terms of an explicit mandate. In the event that the UN does authorise military force, it is my firm view that Australia's involvement should be limited to the present naval enforcement of the UN sanctions and our bilateral logistic and intelligence cooperation with the United States. UN authorisation should not be the determining factor in whether or not Australian ground troops are committed; nor does our strong alliance with the US oblige Australia to automatically lend our ground troops in direct support of each and every American military action. Australia did not commit ground troops to the 1991 Gulf War—and that was in response to the invasion of Kuwait. No compelling case has been made for Australian troops to fight in Iraq now.
We should all be mindful of what will follow any invasion. Pentagon planning provides for an extended occupation and administration of Iraq. The degree to which an occupation force and interim administration would operate under UN auspices is, at best, unclear. The US will be anxious to maintain a broad coalition in the post-attack period. Washington may well press its allies to rotate our military contingents and replace strike forces with units more suited to occupation duties. Australia could well be asked to contribute transport and logistic units, medical support units and possibly regular infantry. To date, this issue has received virtually no attention. Australian involvement in a longer-term US occupation of Iraq has the potential to cause significant international and regional problems for us. Adverse reactions are likely to follow in both the Middle East and South-East Asia.
I put it to the House that it is an absolute tragedy that our Prime Minister has taken Australia such a long way down the road to war, and it has all been done through dissembling and deceit. Hopefully, today's debate will not be the last before the Prime Minister announces that our troops are going into action and that a state of war exists between Australia and Iraq. Hopefully, this will not be the last opportunity for debate before we see demonstrated the enormous devastation that can be wrought by the world's most advanced bombers and missiles. We may well live in the age of the so-called smart bomb, but the horror on the ground will be just the same as that visited on the villagers of Guernica 65 years ago. Innocent Iraqis—men, women and children—will pay a terrible price, and it will not be possible to pull a curtain over that.

For the information of members who may not be familiar with that recommendation, it is that the House should rise at 9.30 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday with an agreement not to divide between 6.30 p.m. and 8.00 p.m. on those nights, start half an hour earlier on Wednesday and Thursday and conclude at five o'clock on Thursday evening. These are more civilised hours and they will help members of parliament to better discharge their duties.

I know, as someone from an outlying state, the earlier House rising on Thursday is particularly welcome. I want to make the point that those on this side of the House do not consider these measures any substitute for root and branch parliamentary reform that we called for a year ago. We will continue to raise our proposals for fundamental reform, particularly in relation to question time and your office, Mr Speaker. In the meantime, I think most of us welcome the more civilised hours.",REPS,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title>,Business,4,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—At the risk of trying your patience, Mr Speaker, I wish to respond to the Manager of Opposition Business. I appreciate his words; I also take his point that this is not substantial parliamentary reform. I would like to reassure him that the government is continuing to consider the proposals that have been put by various people for the better management of this House and for the better running of the chamber.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—There is one thing here that unites everybody, whether it be the protesters who were out the front, the Greens, the Democrats, the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Independents, and that is that no one person in this place wants war today, tomorrow or at any time. People just have different ways of expressing their attitude towards that and the way in which that can be achieved.
It is interesting to reflect on history. If we do not learn from it then we are condemned to repeat the mistakes of history. Prior to World War II, the world was absolutely tired of war after World War I—the war to end all wars. It had seen many millions of people die or suffer from the wounds of mustard gas until their deaths many years later, back in their homes. In the lead up to 1939 and the declaration of war, almost every democratic country was calling for peace; they were calling for disarmament and they were calling on the League of Nations to do this. But no-one seemed to take into account that the League of Nations had no military forces—it had no navy, it had no army, it had no air force with which to disarm Germany at that time—as its successor, the United Nations, has no military forces of its own. When the United Nations acts, it acts with the troops of nations supporting the resolutions of the United Nations—as we have seen in Timor and as we have seen in so many other places around the world. So it requires the combined support of free, peace-loving nations to ensure that the resolutions of the United Nations—the collective will of the world—are enforced upon those nations which flagrantly disregard the rule of law.
While reading recently, I came upon a quote by Winston Churchill. He said, when reflecting on World War II:
Good, decent, civilised people, it appeared, must never strike themselves till after they have been struck dead. In these days, the fearful German volcano and all its subterranean fires drew near to their explosion point. On the one side endless British discussions about trivial points, no decisions taken or, if taken, rescinded and the rule: don't be unkind to your enemy, you'll only make him angry. On the other hand, doom preparing. A vast machine grinding forward ready to break upon us.
—He sent us to Gallipoli! Why is he quoting Churchill?
—I remind the member for Werriwa that he has already been warned!
—At that time the League of Nations and the world allowed Germany to continue to expand and overtake other nations of the world. We stood by because we wanted to appease rather than apply the rule of law. Today we have to learn from that lesson. Although World War I was fought in the trenches and the British and the French prepared to fight World War II in the same vein and were outflanked and outmanoeuvred by a military force of great speed, we then did not learn again. In subsequent engagements around the world there has of course been guerilla warfare—in Afghanistan, with the USSR fighting there, in Vietnam and in many other places. So no-one can predict what future warfare will look like, other than it will probably not be fought the way it has been in the past. We do know that Iraq today have weapons of mass destruction—or at least we know they had them and they have not proven that they have destroyed them. The onus is upon Iraq to prove that.
Here you have a despot who has already killed more than one million people. Today I heard the member for Calare quote that some 70,000-odd children were killed as a result of the 1991 war, when the smart bombs and the allied forces under the UN resolution went into Iraq in order to deal with the Kuwaiti issue. But no mention is made of the million innocent people who have been killed by Saddam Hussein, using things like nerve agents and killing in the most terrible way—causing the most painful and agonising deaths. We must take a strong stand, enforce the rule of law and disarm this man now. He has had 12 years to disarm and he has flagrantly ignored every resolution that has been put before him. I do not blame the Iraqi people. I blame a very small percentage of people who wield a huge rod across the back of the Iraqi people. They are just as much in fear of the man as the rest of the world is—and should be.
As the British Prime Minister has said, on the one hand you have weapons in the hands of people prepared to use them and who have proven that, and on the other hand you have terrorists who know many forms of terrorism and will use whatever they have at their disposal. If you put the two together, who knows where the next lives may be lost? It was Bali only a few months ago. It was New York and Washington some 15 months before that. Where will it be next and what mode will it take? Will it be through anthrax? Will it be through some form of biological or chemical warfare or, God forbid, through some form of dirty nuclear weapon? The Israelis already struck at the nuclear capacity of the Iraqis some time ago with an airstrike. We know that they are trying to rebuild it today. We must be mindful not of our fears of what will happen if there is a war but of our fears for our children and grandchildren if we do not do something today—not only about Iraq but about every other country in the world that finds itself under a dictator with access to these weapons and the will to use them.
I ask you: what would have happened in the seventies if we had allowed the terrorists who continually hijacked aircraft to have exercised their will? Would we be game today to step into a 747 and travel anywhere? No, we would not. It was only because the world was prepared to take a tough stance that terrorists recognised that this operation was not worth pursuing.
No matter what attitude we take in this place, we all absolutely do not want war, the destruction that comes with it, the death and the despair. But we cannot close our minds and our eyes to the reality of what has been happening in Iraq for so long and what could happen anywhere else in the world if you mix those two potent ingredients together—the weapons and the people with the capacity to use them. Instead of having simple explosives strapped to their chests, suicide bombers could use something which is far more catastrophic.
In the last couple of minutes I have available to me, I would like to turn my attention to our troops and some of the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition. His comments today have been not only pitiful in their content but abusive towards the Prime Minister. It is not the Prime Minister who is making war; it is Saddam Hussein. We should all be collectively turning our attention to him. When our troops leave our shores, not to go to war but to make peace and to send a strong message to the world that Australia stands for peace, they do not need to go with the comments of the Leader of the Opposition ringing in their ears—that he does not believe they should be going. Leave those comments to this chamber. Let them know that they have our fulsome support—united and without any equivocation. They deserve that. Those comments only give succour to those non-thinking people who I believe were shouting at our service men and women that they were murderers. Let us not have a repeat of what happened in Vietnam.
The Leader of the Opposition talks about fear, yet today he tried to incite fear into the Australian public by stating that our Special Air Service Regiment antiterrorist troops were not here to protect us if it were needed. He is wrong. Those troops are here; other squadrons of the SASR have been sent over in pre-deployment, and I fully support them being there. That gives us the best chance to ensure that, if they are needed, they not only are acclimatised but have their minds on the job that needs to be done there. They are focused, they are trained and they are ready. That protects Australian lives. That is what we should be about. Much more needs to be said in this debate and many people wish to contribute. From my personal perspective, the Australian government is standing strong. It is not taking the populist role, but, in the end, is taking the just role. I would invite those opposite to direct their attention towards Saddam Hussein and against his regime, not against those who would seek to prevent weapons of mass destruction continuing to be spread throughout the world.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I rise to place on the public record my total and unequivocal support for the United Nations, collective security and the rule of international law. I believe the international community has an obligation to disarm Iraq once and for all. However, this must be done collectively and legally. The world must show a common front against the evil and maniacal dictator, Saddam Hussein. He has been playing diplomatic games for the last 12 years because he knows he can play on the deep distrust of American unilateralism.
The Prime Minister argues that the alliance with the US is paramount to our national security. Let us look at the ANZUS treaty, the cornerstone of this alliance. The Leader of the Opposition has, on a number of occasions, referred to article I of the treaty. As he has said, article I stipulates that both countries will use the UN to settle international disputes peacefully and refrain from the threat or use of force inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The crux of the ANZUS treaty is articles III and IV, and I will quote them. Article III says:
The Parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened in the Pacific.
Article IV says:
Each Party recognizes that an armed attack in the Pacific Area on any of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes.
Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.
If I am not mistaken, there is nothing in these articles that obliges us to assist the US in a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. In fact, it is explicit in that treaty; it refers to threats in the Pacific region to either country. I do not see on my world map that Iraq is in the Pacific region.
We in the Labor Party have provided bipartisan support to the government for the war on terror. Both countries have suffered at the hands of these barbaric terrorists who use religion as a basis for their ruthless fanaticism. This is where our focus should be. The government has warned Australians to be wary of travel in our region and still we are advised to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia. So why are the best fighting men and women of this nation being sent to the Persian Gulf in anticipation of a strike against Iraq when the threat to our security is in our own backyard?
The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that his decision to deploy troops is in the national interest. I would have thought that a Prime Minister's primary obligation is to protect the security of their country. The government has, on a number of occasions in recent months, warned Australians of credible threats from terrorists. We have already witnessed the nightmare of Bali, about which we are still awaiting answers as to whether there were intelligence failures over a period of time leading up to 12 October. I do not know how much evidence the government needs before realising that the real action in terms of our national security is right here in our neighbourhood. But the conservatives have always taken their eye off the ball when it comes to protecting our own shores. They have always rallied to the causes of their `great and powerful friends'. Whether it be in the salt marshes of the Crimea, the expanse of the South African veldt, the hellhole trenches of the Somme or the jungles of Vietnam, we have always been there, like a young child longing for attention from its parents.
I would imagine that the Prime Minister is well versed in his history. The fall of Singapore in February 1942 showed that the `great and powerful friends' could only do so much. Even then, when Australia was in mortal danger, we were being forced to abandon our national security for another sovereign nation's security. We should all honour the spirit and courage of John Joseph Curtin because, without his determination to put Australia first, we would not be here in this great democracy debating these issues tonight.
We on this side of the House believe that a government should be using its diplomatic resources to convince our American allies that going outside the UN framework is not the right way to go. Foreign Minister Downer should have been in Washington not just to stand, with a cheesy grin, next to the Secretary of State but to implore the US to work within the realms of international law.
I am sure that everybody agrees that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and one of the most bloody and brutal dictators of the last 50 years. However, we are falling into a deadly trap if we breach international law to invade Iraq. A number of practitioners in international law have concluded that there is no basis within the international law for the US to unilaterally enforce a Security Council resolution. Other members of the Security Council, like France and Russia, have warned the US not to take that action. Security Council resolution 1441, which has sent the weapons inspectors back into Iraq, is tough and has stipulated that Iraq will face serious consequences if it continues to be evasive and not cooperate with the inspectors. However, whether `serious consequences' means an automatic trigger for war is quite ambiguous. A further resolution to use force to disarm Iraq should occur if Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei conclude that Iraq is not cooperating.
I must admit that I find war deplorable. I am anxious and concerned at the thought of innocent men, women and children losing their lives or being contaminated by these horrible weapons that we suspect Saddam has at his disposal. I am further horrified by some reports that the US could consider using nuclear weapons as strategic weapons. I sincerely hope that is not the case. The Prime Minister has stated publicly his opposition to the use of nuclear weapons and he should make his position quite clear to the Bush administration. To use weapons of mass destruction to destroy weapons of mass destruction is the ultimate act of hypocrisy and would condemn the US to a pariah status. I sincerely hope that this is just outright speculation and that saner minds will prevail.
It is in the interests of the world that we make multilateral processes work. It might be tempting to back the most powerful country on earth without question, but we must explain to its leaders that it is in their own people's interests to have the world at their side against Saddam. We cannot create a precedent that allows one country to make decisions as to whether it invades or destroys a country. I know there are many on the other side of the chamber who clamber to be alongside the powerful, but I also know of others over there who are quite in agreement that collective security is the only way to gain peace and stability.
President Roosevelt had collective security in mind when the United States pushed hard for the creation of the United Nations. His aim was for all nations to work together to maintain peace and security. Australia, particularly under Labor governments, has a tradition of working hard to ensure that these goals are able to work. We should be using the processes of the United Nations to solve the ongoing and, in terms of Australia's national security interests, much more dangerous problem in North Korea. North Korea is the most roguish of the so-called `rogue states'. I believe that country has some form on the board, which is why we are saying this about it. In August 1998, North Korea launched a Taepodong 1 missile that flew over Japan. The evidence is that the North Koreans have the technology to develop a nuclear weapons system.
For two staunch allies of the US—South Korea and Japan—this is a frightening situation. I am sure that both are in constant dialogue with the US, urging it to be both active and forceful in making sure that North Korea heeds what the international community expects. The US, under the Clinton administration, granted concessions to the North Koreans through the agreed framework negotiated by Jimmy Carter in 1994. The North Koreans have reneged on this. I note that the Howard government sent a high-level diplomatic delegation to North Korea. However, as we are one of the few countries to have diplomatic relations with North Korea, we should be in constant dialogue with them, imploring them to do their duty in complying with international law and to re-enter the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a signed and ratified party. Australia should be lobbying our ally, the US, to maintain strong pressure on North Korea to conform with international norms.
However, the whole focus is on Iraq. Iraq, from the report delivered by Hans Blix, has still not accounted for 6,500 chemical weapons and has not provided convincing evidence that it has destroyed the 8,500 litres of anthrax which it produced prior to the Gulf War, and there are uncertainties about the whereabouts of the VX nerve gas. ElBaradei stated that there is no evidence of nuclear activities by Iraq and that he would require a few extra months to complete his work. What I, and I am sure many thousands of other Australians, would like to know is: why is there such a rush? Why is there such urgency to rush headlong into war? No concrete evidence has been provided to suggest that Iraq, with weapons of mass destruction, is an imminent threat to its neighbours, and the inspectors have asked for more time to complete their process. I find nothing wrong with this, but the US, the UK and Mr Howard, our Prime Minister, want to go in and blow Iraq to smithereens. The US and the UK have continued to claim that Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction. We have had to endure no end of rhetoric and `good versus evil' diatribes which, I must say, after 30 years in public life, make me quite cynical about the objectives.
To date, the US has failed to produce any significant evidence. It says that intelligence sources could be compromised by providing this information publicly. Why? Is the only evidence coming from defectors, whose claims would have to be verified and counterverified, or are the famous NSA satellites being used? It really does not matter where the evidence comes from, as long as it is strong and unequivocal. If it is, the US will have international support and Saddam Hussein will have to answer to the world, just as he did in 1990-91 when he invaded Kuwait. I look forward to the Secretary of State's address to the Security Council and I sincerely hope that the evidence is of substance; it will be to the detriment of the US position if all that is produced is circumstantial. The cynics will be crying for blood, and the split in the international community will continue to grow.
You must wonder why the US is so certain. May it not have something to do with the positive relationship it had with Iraq following that visit in late 1983 by none other than Donald H. Rumsfeld, the current defence secretary and then the special envoy to the Middle East appointed by Ronald Reagan? Previously Mr Rumsfeld was defense secretary to Gerald Ford. Prior to Mr Rumsfeld's visit to Iraq, it was as it is now: a pariah state. But this was the Cold War, and the US decided to negate Soviet influence by becoming friends with Saddam Hussein. Iran's Islamic fundamentalist regime was seen as the true enemy of American interests, and so the horrors of Saddam's regime, which were already plain to see, were ignored. Why? The hypocrisy knows no bounds. When reports of chemical weapon attacks by Iraq against Iran were made, the US countered by stating that it was the other way around: Iran was attacking Iraq. However, once Iraq invaded Kuwait and Saddam took the friendship a step too far, the truth came out.
The Reagan administration would do anything, including break its own national laws, in the interests of national security. We know from the Iran-Contra scandal that it would even sell to public enemy No. 1 so as to reap some strategic benefits elsewhere. I notice that John Poindexter, then President Reagan's National Security Adviser, is now an important adviser to President George W. Bush. My colleague the member for Werriwa refers quite frequently to Australia being split between the insiders and the outsiders. Nowhere is such a situation more prevalent than in the minds of the Republican administrations over the last 30 years. Nixon fell because he was too smart by half and he miscalculated by trying to be brutal in his treatment of opposition during a time of public upheaval over the Vietnam War. His administration felt that it could do whatever it took to protect national security. The Reagan administration had the same attitude. And it looks increasingly the same with the Bush administration; I am sorry to say that there is a perception out in the public arena that it treats its populace like mugs. In the aftermath of the horrific events of September 11, the Bush administration has maintained a siege mentality on the American public. The US and the West are targets of al-Qaeda and its affiliates, and this is where our full attention should be—to crush this threat. Instead, the focus is on a country that may or may not have weapons of mass destruction. It is less a threat than it was 12 years ago and will easily be savaged by the US military machine.
I bet you that Saddam will survive but countless thousands of others will perish under the might of the bombing campaign that may eventuate. As a gentleman said in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, 1 February:
Uncivilised, rogue states use weapons of mass destruction to kill and wage war. Enlightened, civilised countries use weapons of mass destruction to kill in the name of peace and liberation.
How many conventional bombs equal one weapon of mass destruction?
Do the dead care?
I think the Prime Minister should read this and think about it long and hard. In the name of being a longing child of the US, without the backing of the international community through the Security Council and international law, and without thinking about the security problems in our own backyard, we are facing being a part of the killing of thousands of innocent men, women and children. We are also putting at risk the finest of our armed forces when the security risk for this nation is our neighbourhood—and that risk is greater than it has ever been since the Second World War.
I am a mother and a grandmother. I would be terrified by the prospect of my child going into battle, especially in a situation where the morality and legality of that battle is in question. I implore the government to find a solution for this impasse through the United Nations. The United Nations must be made to work. I am convinced that without the United Nations worldwide conflicts would have reoccurred, just like World War I and II. The United Nations has its flaws, but countries like Australia have an obligation to uphold its principles. Australia gains strength from active participation in the forums of the United Nations. Our great diplomatic successes, notably the peace settlement in Cambodia, have been achieved in conjunction with the United Nations. It is in Australia's interest to let the current processes run their course. If the world decides to engage in military action in Iraq, I would reluctantly support the move. I say this reluctantly because I believe war is abhorrent. However, I realise that the system of collective security must be maintained and kept strong; it is the only right way to keep peace and stability in our world.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2003-02-04,"—I rise to support the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq. I recall that in the week following the Bali bombing on 12 October last year the question that was asked so often—and quite understandably—was: was the government aware; did they get an inkling; was there some intelligence? It was an understandable question from those who had suffered the loss of family members or who had suffered severe injuries. Of course the answer was that the Australian government had no warning. They had no advance intelligence or they would have put out a general travel alert.
If the government had had a warning—if they knew that those now arrested for the Bali bombing were planning a bombing, had the materials to hand and had a plan—and if they had been aware of a general location, much of that tragedy might have been averted. But we did not know. Now we do know—we know that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. How do we know? He told us. He admitted, after the 1991 Gulf War, that he had weapons of mass destruction. The weapons inspectors who were ejected from Iraq in 1998 had detailed not only the commencement of a nuclear weaponry capacity but weapons of mass destruction. So we know there is a threat.
We know there is a capacity. Iraq has the weapons and is in the process of producing an even more horrific nuclear capacity. What is the nature of the regime that controls these weapons? There are many nations around the world that have a nuclear weaponry capacity—the United States and a number of others; Australia does not—but those countries have nuclear weaponry quite legally, through international law. Those countries had them originally when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed and they kept them. There are only two states which potentially have a nuclear capacity that are in breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Those states are Iraq and North Korea—they are not known as rogue states for nothing.
But that is not enough. What is the nature of the regime in Iraq? I will share with the House some of Iraq's background. I exclude from this the Iraqi people who apparently suffer greatly under a dictatorial, brutal regime. But the regime of Hussein and his `lieutenants'—for want of a better word—has attacked its own people: the Kurds and the Shia Muslims. The Kurds were attacked with chemical weapons. Nearly 7,000 of them—women, men and children—died. Even more sadly, I have read that the terrible attack on those people has now manifested itself in the next generation. Children are being born with severe disabilities. There can be little more damning than attacking your own people in such a brutal, callous and long-lasting way.
How does Saddam Hussein treat his neighbours? Well, he invaded Kuwait. He intimidates and harasses neighbours with threats. Unlike what happened in Bali, this is a known threat. We have in Iraq a regime that has form. It is a murderous regime that attacks its own people and its neighbours. So we have full warning. What does a responsible nation, as part of the democratic link of mankind, do? Do we hope for the best and ignore it? We know what happens to nations that ignore the warnings or that hope to appease the aggressor. History is littered with those who have paid an awful price for ignoring what can only be described as evil.
We have an opportunity now to secure, for ourselves and future generations, a world largely—and I say `largely' because one can never be sure—free of weapons of mass destruction and of brutal murderous regimes. And that takes a little courage; it does not involve hiding at home. It involves doing what the Australian government is doing. The Australian government is lobbying very hard, through the United Nations Security Council, for the existing resolution to demand that Iraq disarm—which some believe is sufficient—and it is pushing for a further resolution demanding that Iraq comply with disarmament or be forcibly disarmed.
Australia is working very responsibly through United Nations Security Council channels. That is right and proper. Most importantly, we are also working with other democratic nations which share our long-term view of our responsibilities toward mankind in containing rogue states which are either obtaining or have weapons of mass destruction and ensuring that those weapons do not intersect with terrorist organisations—because they surely will. One day, sooner or later, those nations with weapons of mass destruction—nations which we know have no mercy towards their own people—will make those weapons available, overtly or covertly, to terrorists. We should say a prayer for those who happen to be in their path.
We are joining nations like the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom to press, through the United Nations, for a further resolution. Australia has asked, quite properly, for additional time for the weapons inspectors in Iraq, although time is not the only issue. It is also a matter of compliance. It is no good having the time if the state will not comply—unlike the Ukraine and South Africa, which willingly removed their nuclear capacity.
For Australia, there is not only the overriding national interest of ensuring that terrorist organisations do not obtain weapons of mass destruction and that rogue states which have them are made to disarm. Speaking as someone from North Queensland, there is also a view in northern Australia that, in an unstable region, we have to depend on our friends and allies. During the Second World War, the friend and ally that came to our aid in the Battle of the Coral Sea was the United States. People have said to me, `That happened 50 years ago.' That is very true, but things will happen in 50 years time too. The world keeps changing and evolving, and history has a way of repeating itself.
At that time, it was the United States that came and saved northern Australia—with the help of our courageous ANZAC troops and ships—from the Japanese juggernaut that had come through Singapore and Papua New Guinea and was bombing Darwin. In fact, the Catalinas were flying out of Bowen, which is in the heart of my electorate. The Americans lost 543 lives in the Battle of the Coral Sea, and not one Australian life was lost. The Americans were there for us. We should remember that our friend in the South Pacific is the United States. They provide an umbrella of security that we should not treat lightly.
I fully support the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq, because of the American-Australian alliance and because we need to be strong, remembering the atrocities in Bali. We need to ensure that no terrorist can again maim and murder the innocent—particularly with dreadful weapons of mass destruction.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I will begin by informing the House that a large crowd of around 1,000 people attended a peace rally in Bendigo last Friday. This clearly shows the depth of feeling against war by people from central Victoria of all age groups and all backgrounds. Labor's position, as outlined by the opposition leader earlier today, has been consistent since April last year. 
Labor say that there should be no military action to disarm Iraq without the authority of the United Nations. Labor will support any decision of the United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 1441 in the event of Iraqi non-compliance, and Labor will not support a US unilateral attack on Iraq. The Prime Minister claims that no decision to participate in a war against Iraq has been taken, yet he has sent 2,000 defence personnel to the Persian Gulf region. Labor oppose this dishonest deployment, which has occurred without consultation with the Australian people or this parliament. 
Tonight we heard revelations about the admission by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, that Australia would prefer UN backing; however—and this was not a point that could be made publicly—Australia was not in a position, if the UN process broke down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf. This would have to be the greatest act of deception ever perpetrated on the Australian people by a Commonwealth government. We know that lying is an integral strategy of this Prime Minister; here we have clear evidence of deception, lying to the Australian people over such a sensitive area as sending defence personnel to a war against another country. This miserable excuse for a human being is not fit to be Prime Minister of this country.
Labor's opposition to the decision to deploy troops is directed squarely at those responsible for it—the Prime Minister and this government—and not at the defence personnel involved. They are simply doing their job as directed by the government of the day. That is their task. Even if the decision to deploy them is wrong, as it is in this case, they are required to follow orders. If they are required to participate in any action against Iraq—UN-sanctioned or otherwise—then they are entitled to the full support of the Australian people, and Labor will ensure they get it. Our argument is with the Howard government, not with our defence forces. We wish our Defence Force men and women well, and we wish them a speedy and safe return home to their families. 
It is deplorable that the Prime Minister of Australia is acting as a hitchhiker on the US road to war. A war on Iraq without UN authority is a US war that serves only the purposes of the Bush administration, and Australia should not be involved in it. Most, if not all, wars are immoral and this war would be particularly immoral. The Howard-Bush regime would have us believe that a strike against Iraq would assist in the campaign against global terrorism. It would not.
If we are fair dinkum about the fight against global terrorism, then we should at least attempt to address the global hatreds that fuel global terrorism. An attack on Iraq, whether or not it is sanctioned by the UN, must only increase the likelihood of further terrorist acts because it will inflame hatreds that have existed for many years. The military are quick to remind us that the strike against Iraq would be all over in about two weeks. They may be right. But the ramifications of such a strike are likely to be with us for many decades. Even peace-loving members of the Islamic community—and there are millions in that category—could regard an attack on Iraq, whether or not it is sanctioned by the UN, as an attack on all members of the Islamic faith, thereby fuelling the hatred that breeds international terrorism.
War should always be the instrument of last resort, but in this case it seems the United States cannot start one fast enough, and its excuses are seen to be little more than fig leaves to justify an attack on Iraq. There are times when war is necessary and cannot be avoided, but this is not one of those times. This is not a defensive war: there is no evident threat that Iraq will attack the United States and there is certainly no threat by Iraq that it will attack Australia.
The regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq is a brutal and repressive dictatorship; it is one of the ugliest regimes that has afflicted this world. It does not hold free elections and would probably not survive a free election, but it was backed by the US during Iraq's war with Iran and supported thereafter until Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. In fact, recent TV footage has reminded the world of the close ties the US developed with Iraq during its war with Iran: Donald Rumsfeld, the hawkish US Secretary of Defense of today, was pictured in friendly and comfortable circumstances at that time in Baghdad with Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was defeated in the Gulf War, and he has been weakened and kept contained ever since. The UN weapons inspectors sent to Iraq last year have not completed their inspections. The rush to war cannot be justified.
Nobody seems to be able to halt the US military juggernaut and the bellicose conservatives that have been running the US political system since the Supreme Court gave the presidency to George W. Bush. It seems there is no more chance for the world today to stop the US war on Iraq than there was in December 1941 for it to stop the Japanese attack on the US Navy at Pearl Harbour.
An attempt is being made to manipulate the Security Council into war and into legitimising the war; it is being told by the US that the US will go to war regardless of the decisions of the Security Council. The Security Council is in effect being told by the United States that its function is to roll over and serve the purposes not of the world and international peace but of the Bush administration and its war.
The Prime Minister of Australia tells us that the UN Security Council must prove its relevance. What he really means is that it must be just a plaything of the United States. What he means is that he is happy to discredit the United Nations in the eyes of the rest of the world by making it not the voice of the world but the voice of the Bush administration.
Australia's interests lie in a world order that is based on the United Nations; peace, harmony and cooperation; and the rule of international law. The UN, created in 1945, offers a far better prospect of world peace than the power play and self-interest of one domineering world power.
The principle of the UN's existence means that there are rules for nations to live by, they are made by all nations for all nations and all nations have an interest in abiding by them. This is the world order that Australia needs and has a major interest in preserving. There is no question that, without the insistent pressure of the United States for action against Iraq, war with Iraq would not be on anybody's agenda. Like the missiles that are already programmed for targets in Iraq, this war will bear the stamp `Made in the USA'.
I say this with much regret because I would rather see the United States play a positive role in the world, as it was playing recently during the Clinton administration. America can stand for much that is great and it has stood for much that is great. Regrettably, however, President Bush's domineering manner and policies are squandering much of the goodwill and fellow feeling that other nations felt for the United States after the terrible terrorist attack of September 11 2001.
From its beginning the Bush administration has pursued a more narrow and more strident self-interest in world affairs that places the interests of America ahead of those of other nations. This is its policy of unilateralism. It is seen by many around the world as having exploited the dominance it has achieved with the end of the Cold War to push itself and its interests ahead, regardless of many of the major interests of other nations. Among those have been the US opposition to the Kyoto treaty on greenhouse gases, the withdrawal of the US from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the pursuit of the `son of star wars' missile defence system. Along with that has been an unwillingness to resolve major areas of tension in which the United States has been a player. Instead it has branded so-called rogue states. It has portrayed these states—Iraq, Iran and North Korea—as an `axis of evil'.
The United States has also proclaimed that it has the right to take pre-emptive military action against states that threaten its international dominance. Quite clearly, Iraq fits into this dangerous scheme, along with Iran and North Korea. Quite clearly, a war against Iraq fits into this aggressive attitude. I refer to General Peter Gration, who was the Chief of the Australian Defence Force during the Gulf War of 1991. He stated his opposition to war against Iraq in an article in the Melbourne Age of 2 January this year:
As 2003 dawns, the threat of a US-led war against Iraq looms over the world. The question for Australia is, should we take part? If we do, it will be the first time in our history that we have taken part in unprovoked offensive military action against another country.
...				...				...
The war would be the first practical implementation of recently announced changes in US national security policy. This has moved from containment and deterrence to an open-ended doctrine of the right to pre-emptive strike if the US perceives a threat developing to its global supremacy.
In my view, this is bad policy that strikes at the very heart of efforts to create a rules-based international order, and can only lead to a less stable security environment and a marginalised UN.
...				...				...
If we go to war without UN endorsement, our actions as signatories of the UN Charter would, in effect, be illegal.
He concludes by putting the view that the alternative to war is:
... to continue to pursue the present course of action through the UN inspectors already in Iraq, even in the face of some Iraqi intransigence. This is likely to be a prolonged, frustrating and probably messy and untidy business, but in the end should be effective in removing the WMD and preventing their further development.
I want to highlight my concern about the dangers of applying the idea of the right to a pre-emptive attack on another nation. The idea marks a massive move away from limiting and containing Iraq as a potential user of weapons of mass destruction. It goes further: to embracing an outright attack on a nation. It opens the door to worse instability and it places the interests of one nation far ahead of those of the world community. It weakens the United Nations. It puts the UN in the shocking position of either doing nothing while the pre-emptive attack is being planned and advocated or taking sides with one great power and endorsing its belligerence.
One has to ask what the real intentions of the US are in its rush to attack Iraq. On the one hand the US says it wants to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. On the face of it that sounds reasonable, especially if it can be achieved with UN support and without invading and bombing Iraq. On the other hand, however, the Bush administration has been trumpeting regime change in Iraq. Regime change by war is not part of international law. The doctrine means the US will overthrow the regime ruling Iraq, as it has said it would do, and it will do this by war. It will wage war whether it has the approval and support of the UN or not.
I have a lot more to say but I am going to run out of time. I will conclude with a remark in relation to the very successful peace rally that was held in Bendigo last Friday. I congratulate the organisers of that rally and those who attended. Certainly it drove home to me the depth of feeling there is in central Victoria, as indeed there is all over Australia, against any sort of war on Iraq and against Australia's participation in it. As the Bendigo district people sang when they rallied against the war last Friday, it's time to give peace a chance.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—Forgive me if I take a moment to shake myself out of the 1960s and back into 2003. After listening to the member for Bendigo's contribution to this debate, I could be forgiven for thinking I was listening to a central committee member of the Communist Party from the 1960s or maybe Tony Benn in full paranoid flight in the House of Commons. The member for Bendigo's contribution was a personalised, vicious and Trotsky-like attack on the United States and on this government. It was really quite bizarre. I think he probably did the 1960s Left movement proud. He even quoted their `give peace a chance' in his last statement, so he should be very proud of himself.
Twelve years ago, in 1991, when the coalition of countries that fought the Gulf War were successful, two elements were included as part of the cease-fire at the end of the Gulf War: one was that Iraq had to divest itself of all weapons of mass destruction, and the second was that a weapons inspection regime was to be established that ensured that Iraq did divest itself of its weapons of mass destruction, that it did not produce any new ones and that its program of creating weapons of mass destruction was removed or disbanded. In fact, an Australian, Richard Butler, was given the task of doing that and, as we all know, he left that post because he felt that the Hussein regime was not cooperating with the United Nations weapons inspection program. I make that point because the question of Iraq and disarmament and weapons of mass destruction has not sprung up in the last few weeks or months, or even in the last 12 months—as some people like to raise as a red herring in this place and in the public domain. It certainly has reached a crescendo in the last few weeks or months because, after 12 years of trying to get the Hussein regime to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and to come clean on its program, the world feels that Iraq has had long enough to do what was required of it as part of the 1991 cease-fire. 
The world is bitterly disappointed, to say the least, at the failure of the Hussein regime to do that. Weapons inspectors have been ejected in that time; the war rhetoric of Iraq has been stepped up over that time; and weapons of mass destruction are unaccounted for, even from the Gulf War, let alone the program in Iraq that continued after the Gulf War. This culminated in UN resolution 1441, which required Iraq to disarm, and the sending in of weapons inspectors under Hans Blix to ensure that Iraq disarmed. The weapons inspectors were not charged with the task of running around playing hide-and-seek in the deserts of the Middle East, trying to find evidence of weapons. The role of the weapons inspectors was to ensure that Iraq disarmed. The burden of proof was on Iraq. The burden of proof was not on the weapons inspectors to find evidence of chemical and biological weapons. In fact, Hans Blix in his report said:
Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament which was demanded of it. 
It is true that the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States and the 12 October 2002 attack on Australia by terrorists have given impetus to the world's desire to see rogue states with their weapons of mass destruction dealt with so that we can have a peaceful world in the future. Those two events ensured that a cease-fire was put in place and that promises made by Iraq 12 years ago were actually made to stick. Who can blame the people of the United States or the people of Australia for those two events causing them to want to make sure that the impetus for the disarmament of Iraq was brought to fruition?
The question we are all faced with is: when is it a good time for rogue states that produce, acquire and want weapons of mass destruction to be disarmed and dealt with? People can always put off hard decisions, but it cannot be after such rogue states have these weapons of mass destruction; it cannot be after they use these weapons of mass destruction. It can only be when the world feels that it can act to ensure that we live in a peaceful world in the future—and it must be now. That time must be now to give credibility to the United Nations and to the campaign that has been going on for decades to eradicate chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The exception is those states that can have these weapons and not use them. That is not the case with Iraq—we know that it has used them.
People who oppose an action to make Iraq disarm have to answer another question: if Iraq is not to be dealt with now, then how does one deal with other states like North Korea who have nuclear weapons programs to which they have owned up? How do we deal with those states if Iraq is allowed to keep its weapons of mass destruction, to continue to acquire and produce them and potentially to use them? That leads me to the question of the UN support for military action in Iraq. Of course, we will all be glad if the United Nations passes a resolution endorsing military action against Iraq if it is agreed that Iraq is in material breach of the UN resolutions. I hope that will occur and, from recent reportage from New York, it seems that may well occur. The Australian people obviously want that to be the case too. But what if there is no UN resolution? Is it a fatal blow to the concept of disarming Iraq? Can no military action take place if that is the case?
Some members of the ALP—the member for Bendigo has just been adding to this point—claim that it would be illegal for a coalition of the willing to take action to disarm Saddam Hussein and make him comply with UN resolutions. Of course it would not be illegal. That is simply not true. 
There are three good examples. In 1997 when the NATO powers acted against Serbia to defend and protect the people of Kosovo, there was no UN resolution allowing that to go ahead, endorsing that action. A humanitarian resolution which would have encapsulated such an action was suggested. The Soviet Union made it clear that it would veto such a resolution, so the motion was not put. The bombing of Serbia went ahead. China moved a motion in the Security Council declaring that action illegal. The motion was defeated by 13 votes to two in the Security Council. If you like, it reaffirmed that it was not illegal at the time for a military action outside UN auspices to take place—at that time an action by NATO. Back in 1982 Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. There was no UN resolution to allow Britain to take back the Falkland Islands into British sovereignty or to endorse the war that the United Kingdom conducted against Argentina. In 1962, when the Cuban missile crisis occurred, there was no UN resolution to allow the United States to blockade Cuba and interdict the introduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba to threaten the United States.
The role of Australia in all this has been impeccable. Countries like the United States, Britain, Australia and the countries of the eight European leaders who signed their letter last week—Spain, the Czech Republic and others—are placing the necessary pressure on Saddam Hussein that could force him to disarm and to avoid a war. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, himself has said—he has made it clear—that weapons inspectors would not be in Iraq today if it was not for the military pressure that has been applied on the Saddam Hussein regime. The US, Britain and Australia, through the application of predeployment military pressure, are making war less likely, not more likely. They are making it very clear to Saddam Hussein that we are serious about disarmament, we are serious about his weapons of mass destruction, and he must disarm or these weapons will be taken away from him by a coalition of the willing.
Ironically, and tragically, countries like France and Germany and their allies in Australia, particularly from the left of the ALP, are giving succour to Saddam Hussein by creating the impression that he can continue to hold out against the United Nations and against the coalition of the willing. They are giving succour to his cunning and usual plans to avoid facing the aspects of the agreement of 1991 that required him to disarm. Indeed, one could argue, as Greg Sheridan has in the Australian, that France, Germany and their allies in the ALP left are making war in the Middle East more likely, not less likely, because the more they give succour to the Hussein regime and create the impression in his mind that he has his opponents on the run the more likely the situation is to become dangerous. They should seriously think about that.
In conclusion, there is one aspect of this debate which I find quite repugnant, and that is those members of the ALP who try to create a moral equivalence between the position of Iraq on the one hand and that of the US and Israel on the other. I find it criminally misleading, repugnant and despicable that anybody would suggest that there is a moral equivalence between the United States and Israel and Iraq. Iraq is a totalitarian, dictatorial, antidemocratic regime with no freedom of the press and no freedom of association, a regime that has used weapons of mass destruction against Kurds and Shiah Muslims, the state of Israel, Iran, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. This is a regime that is bellicose and belligerent; it has no freedom that we would regard as normal in our lives. The United States and Israel are democratic, freedom-loving nations with a free press, freedom of association and freedom of religion and organisation. They have not used weapons of mass destruction against their own people, against their opponents. They have the protections that we would regard as normal for children; they have equality for women. They have the same value system that we have in Australia. To make an argument that there is a moral equivalence between Iraq and Israel and the United States is a repugnant and outrageous argument.
I commend the Prime Minister's statement to the House and I hope that other members, particularly in the ALP, will see reason on this issue.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—What we have just heard is, writ large, the view from the government benches that, whatever the result of any considerations by the United Nations, we should be warming the Australian public up for participation in a coalition of the willing—despite what the United Nations might be saying. That is what the member for Sturt was saying. What we are seeing here is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition said this afternoon. Commitments have been made to the United States, reinforced now by views from the government backbenches that it is okay to have a coalition of the willing outside the United Nations framework. What we have seen demonstrated is exactly what the Labor Party has been arguing against since April of last year. To say that somehow or other we would be giving succour to Saddam Hussein is as grave an insult as the words which were used last July by Mr Howard when he accused the Australian Labor Party of a policy of appeasement towards Iraq or in August by Mr Downer when he said Simon Crean `is talking like Saddam Hussein'.
What we are seeing here is one of a piece. The Leader of the Opposition has made it very clear that he believes—and we in the Labor Party believe—that undertakings have been given to the United States about Australia's commitment to a military engagement with Iraq outside any agreement with the United Nations. It has been confirmed here this evening that members of the government benches—in this case, the member for Sturt—are prepared to argue publicly for that event.
What we do know, and there is some agreement in this House on this, is that we have a great commitment, a bipartisan commitment, to the alliance with the United States. We in the opposition see our role slightly differently. We do not see ourselves—as the government sees themselves—as lap-dogs to the United States. We do have the same commitment to the American alliance and we do have the same commitment to the ANZUS treaty, which was articulated here this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. But we do not believe that we should, as we have done historically on at least one occasion, be compliant to foreign policy follies of the United States—like we were in Vietnam.
We have seen over the last 12 months a position built up with the bellicose nature of the language from the government—from the Prime Minister, the defence minister and the foreign minister—leading us to no other conclusion than that undertakings have been given to the United States about an engagement with them in the event of any conflict.
This evening we had Laurie Oakes divulge to us a number of things. One was from a meeting with the New Zealand High Commissioner where Mr Downer said this: `Australia would indeed prefer UN backing. However, and this was not a point that could be made publicly, Australia was not in a position if the UN process broke down to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf.'
What does this mean? Is he referring to, for example, the Multinational Interception Force which currently exists in the Gulf and the United Nations making a decision which says they no longer support the idea of the MIF—which I doubt that they would? Let us leave that argument aside for a moment. But if the proposal by the United States for military intervention in Iraq is not supported by the United Nations, we now have a position where the Australian government says—not to be divulged publicly—that we would not be in a position to withdraw those ships and those other military assets in the Gulf.
What does that tell us? It tells us that they are built in to be an integral part of the battle plan, which is the argument we have been putting to the government since September of last year. We have continually asked the Prime Minister and the government to tell us what undertakings have been given to the President of the United States. What undertakings have been given by the Prime Minister, by the foreign minister or the Minister for Defence, or the Defence Force chiefs on the instruction of the government?
What we are no doubt going to see here this evening and tomorrow is the government trying to use weasel words to try and explain away this matter which has been divulged tonight by Laurie Oakes. This is a great admission, and a point which the Leader of the Opposition made continually today was: why will the Prime Minister not take the Australian people into his confidence and explain exactly what undertakings he has given to the United States of America? We now know why: because he has been leading us up the garden path and trying to con us. It has now been explained and divulged by the hapless foreign minister.
I will just go back to a statement in July of last year by the foreign minister in which he said this in an op ed piece in the Australian: `Might prevails if all else fails.' Not logic, not argument, not debate, not what is morally right, but might prevails. Then he said:
The military option must be the last resort. But as an ally of the US, Australia will consider any request for military assistance should force be required.
I say this: shortly after this the Australian government did receive a request and did say to the government of the United States, `We will go along with you in whatever eventuates if we cannot convince the United Nations.'
We have had tonight arguments put by the government that somehow the opposition is an apologist, as I have said earlier, for Saddam Hussein. Let us make it very clear again what the Labor Party position is. The first of the three points of our policy is this: there should be no military action taken to disarm Iraq without the authority of the United Nations. I would have thought that to be an entirely reasonable proposition, and not one, as the member for Sturt argued, something that could be seen to appease or give succour to Saddam Hussein. The second is that Labor will support a decision of the United Nations Security Council to enforce resolution 1441 in the event of Iraqi noncompliance. The third is—this is most important from our point of view—Labor will not support a unilateral military attack on Iraq. And nor should we.
Listening to the comments by the members of the government, you would have us believe that somehow or another there is going to be a surgical operation where there will be an attack against Iraq, no Australian troops will be hurt or killed—and we hope not—and no American troops either. It will be all hunky-dory. We will go in there, we will have a precise attack, we will bring out Saddam Hussein and it will all be terrific. Then we will institute a new regime and the world will change. What do you say about the 50,000 Iraqi civilians who would probably die in that event? I, like many members of this parliament, am a family man, as I know the member for Sturt is. I cannot countenance invoking the horror of war on my family. Yet what we are seeing here is a readiness of the government to countenance a pre-emptive war against the people of Iraq.
There is no questioning the validity of the views which have been expressed by people on both sides of the chamber about the obnoxious nature of the Iraqi regime, about the horrors they have inflicted on their community, about their antidemocratic nature and about their past use of weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt about that. But the case has yet to be made for pre-emptive action in the way in which it has been argued by the government.
I live in the Northern Territory and I am most concerned about the regional implications of what the government is doing. It was very instructive to last night watch the interview on Lateline between Mr Tony Jones and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda. He made very clear something that the Labor Party has been saying to the government for some months: instead of being a toady and a lap-dog to President Bush and gallivanting around the world at his behest, why aren't you in South-East Asia explaining our position to the South-East Asian governments; why aren't you understanding and appreciating the implications for Australia of this adventurism that you are now exercising in foreign policy; why aren't you accepting the proposition which we have put about the implications for Australia of this support that is being given to the approach adopted by the United States? Last night in answer to the question from Tony Jones:
You're saying that Australia is not in step in some way with South-East Asia on this issue? Is that what you're trying to say?
Mr Wirajuda said:
Exactly. That's what we meant, yes.
Jones went on to talk about Prime Minister Mahathir and said:
Yet Malaysia's PM, Mahathir, has accused Australia of acting like America's deputy sheriff and says this will damage our relations with our neighbours.
He asked Mr Wirajuda if he thought that was a view shared by the Indonesians. Mr Wirajuda said:
We do share, yes, and I think many countries in the region do their the—share the positions of Malaysia in this regard.
We have said continually not to underestimate the misunderstandings that will be rife and prolific within our region about this action. We can all be sophisticated in this chamber and argue the merits of a case, but let us ask what the people on the streets of Indonesia think when they hear what we are doing. It is very instructive to hear what Mr Wirajuda said in answer to a question about whether he was worried about public opinion. He said:
I would say that the intensive campaigns and even talking about war against Iraq would tend to radicalise certain elements in our society, in the Islamic world in particular.
And, you know, it's very easy for the masses in the Islamic world to conclude that this war against Iraq is in the end a war against Muslims.
The Iraq question will not be seen in isolation.
I would say that they would see it in relations with two major global issues—namely, war against terrorism, up to more than one year we haven't fully dealt with the negative implications of this war to the Muslim world.
Ask yourself what this could eventually mean. Ask yourself what it means to us as a community and as a nation within this region of the world—our part of the world. This is what our neighbours are saying, yet it is being given, apparently, scant regard by the government. This week we had posted out to every Australian household documents on terrorism.
—And a fridge magnet.
—And a fridge magnet that we can use to fight the terrorists, as the Leader of the Opposition says. Why is it that we have not exercised our minds about the prevention of terrorism or seen the linkages that exist within the minds of some—not here in this chamber—between the position that is being adopted by the government on Iraq and those communities in South-East Asia who see what we are doing, as has been expressed by the Indonesian Foreign Minister? You can see the perceptions that are there and you can see the arguments that Islamic extremists will be putting in those communities—going out winding people up by saying: `This is not an attack against Iraq; this is an attack against the Muslim world. Come out and fight for us.'
What is this doing for Australia's national security and what does it say about Australian foreign policy? It says that we are deficient. It says that, whilst we are giving support to the national security policies of the United States about pre-emption and about `might is right', we are forgetting our own responsibilities, forgetting our own national interest, forgetting our own national security and forgetting the interests of the Australian community. As a person who lives in northern Australia—unlike most members of this chamber, who look south and not north—I look north and I am very conscious of what our neighbours are saying. I am very concerned about what our neighbours are saying and I am very concerned about what our neighbours are thinking.
—This clown lives somewhere near the Gold Coast and would not know the north of Australia if it jumped up in his face! There is no case being made by the government for the proposition of unilateral action by the United States. The opposition will support resolutions being put to the United Nations through appropriate processes of the United Nations, but we will not play lap-dog to the United States under any circumstances. We must have an independent foreign policy. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—In hearing the contributions of the member for Bendigo and the member for Lingiari, I think I heard the words `George Bush' and `lap-dog to the United States' at least 10 times! The interesting thing about the Labor Party is that they will mention `George Bush' but you will never hear them mention `Tony Blair'.
—Just wait till my speech.
—Just wait.
—`Just wait'? You had 15 minutes, went five minutes over time and you still could not get to the point. So we are not going to wait. The Labor Party never mentioned Tony Blair and, of course, he is the one person they should look to for leadership. The closest Labour leader in the world showing leadership on foreign policy today is someone who is 10,000 miles away in London.
We are debating this motion because for every preceding day in the last 12 years Iraq and its leader have ignored, deceived and lied to the world community and the United Nations. For 12 years the United Nations and the world community have recognised that Saddam Hussein needs to be disarmed—and fully disarmed.
—That's right.
—It was a specific condition, as the member for Sturt said, following the Gulf War. It was matched by resolution after resolution—I think nine resolutions in all—the most recent one being resolution 1441. Specifically, this schedule of resolutions—passed and all breached—shows that Iraq has had every opportunity to comply and has taken every single opportunity not to.
It is worth going back to 1991—to the very beginning of the inspections process following the Gulf War. Within months of the Gulf War, Iraq was caught moving proscribed items away from inspection sites. Later on during the process it lied and denied having biological weapons but, following the defection of a key member of the team who had worked on those very programs, it was forced to admit that it had lied. Then, in 1998, Iraq thumbed its nose at the world community and expelled the weapons inspectors altogether. This long and winding road of concealment, deceit and breach tells only one story: that Iraq under Saddam Hussein is intent on developing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons on a mass scale. The investigations of the weapons inspectors have raised many questions. What has happened to Iraq's 6,500 chemical bombs, including the hundreds of shells filled with mustard gas? What has happened to the 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents, including the VX nerve agent? What has happened to the tonnes of chemicals that can only be used to produce more VX? And what has happened to the 30,000 special munitions used for the delivery of chemical and biological agents?
As I have said in this House before on a previous motion on Iraq, we do not need to engage in some sort of theoretical discussion about what Saddam Hussein may or may not do with chemical weapons. We do not need to engage in a discussion about the odds on what he might do. We know the answer. The answer is that he will do what he has done before. In the past, Saddam Hussein has used the weapons that he has either developed or acquired. He was the first leader in the world to use nerve agents. He killed thousands of people in his own country with chemical weapons. When he has acquired missiles, he has used them—he has fired them. This tells us that he is not some curious collector or hobbyist intent on building up a store of weapons for his own satisfaction. He acquires them, he develops them and he uses them. To the best of the world's knowledge, he is still some way off developing nuclear weapons but that is only for two reasons. The first is that in 1981 his well developed nuclear site was bombed by the Israeli air force—something they were condemned for at the time but which the world community is truly thankful for today. The second is that the renewed nuclear capacity that he was well on the way towards some 10 years later was curtailed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
Considering this record, whilst it may be tempting to turn a blind eye—whilst it may seem easier to hope that it all goes away and to engage in endless rationalisations—if we look honestly at the history of Saddam Hussein and Iraq, the only responsible answer is that he must be disarmed. To me, the concept of the world community failing to do so after 12 years is truly frightening. If after 12 years the world community fails to act and the United Nations fails again, the message to Saddam Hussein will be that the UN is nothing more than a never-ending talking shop where resolutions are passed but not enforced. Saddam would then be in a position to further develop his weapons on a scale not yet seen, and the world community would lose any power it has left to curtail him. If this were to occur, there should be no doubt that the United Nations—particularly the United Nations Security Council and the permanent five, having passed resolution after resolution and decided that it was too hard to enforce their own resolutions— would, as the Prime Minister said at the beginning of this debate, effectively be providing a green light and an open road for Saddam Hussein to get on and develop his murderous weapons. If the issues at stake are serious enough for 12 years worth of resolutions—and I think we all agree they are—the UN Security Council has to unequivocally accept that they are serious enough to enforce. As I mentioned at the outset, Tony Blair has genuinely made a very constructive contribution to this important debate.
—What party is he from?
—As I said, Tony Blair is the Labour leader 10,000 miles away in London. He is a Labour leader who does not have his backbench on his side. As the member for Sturt mentioned earlier, he is a Labour leader who has to deal with people of the ilk of Tony Benn—who, I read in the newspaper, has been in Iraq interviewing Saddam Hussein. Despite that, Tony Blair has been prepared to show leadership because he realises what is at stake. The Labor Party used to talk about Tony Blair all the time—it was the third way. Tony Blair himself has said that he fully supports what the United States have been doing to put pressure on Iraq and on the United Nations. He has gone so far as to say that, if the US had not done that, he would have criticised them for not doing so; but you never hear the Labor Party or the Leader of the Opposition talk about Tony Blair.
In the last day or so, Tony Blair has made some critical points that deserve to be mentioned in this debate. As he has said, the greatest dangers the world faces at the moment are terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and the risk of those two things coming together, or their roads joining, is truly horrifying. That statement by Labour leader Blair is warranted and accurate. The one thing we know about terrorists is that they will use anything within their power to wreak destruction. We have seen that. We all know that, and no-one can disagree with it. The other undeniable truth is that, with every rogue state like Iraq that is allowed through world community weakness to develop these weapons, the greater is the risk that they will be obtained by terrorists—and if Iraq is allowed to do so, other rogue states and rogue leaders will do likewise, multiplying the danger.
From my perspective, I wish all this had not taken 12 years. No-one in the House or in the wider community wants war, and we have all said that. Our goal is disarmament. We want to see Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction and we want to see the UN do its job. However, I firmly believe that we in this national parliament need to support the right thing, and the right thing is to do all we can to disarm Iraq. It is not to sidetrack the debate with the wanton anti-Americanism that plays out in Labor Party branch meetings. You cannot say, `I support the American alliance,' and spend every day trashing it. In wanting a world free of acts of terror, we cannot ignore history and some of the warning signs coming out of Iraq and the regime.
As I have said, the natural temptation may be to hope it goes away, but how would we all feel if the task became harder in the future, if we are back here in two years time? How would we feel if it got so out of hand that it became impossible to disarm Saddam Hussein, if it became so hard because he had developed nuclear weapons? How would we feel if we failed again, in this 12th year, and he used those weapons he has maintained or he acquires in the future to kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of people? I think we would feel that we had failed and, unfortunately, we would be right to feel that way. Future generations would wonder why the world community and parliaments like ours allowed such a thing when the risk had been so well known, so recognised and so talked about for more than a decade.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—When I spoke in the debate on Iraq last September I began by saying that the great wars of the 20th century were not fought between armies, they were fought against populations. The front-line troops were not only brave young men but also innocent civilians—women, children and old men. They were killed not only in the trenches or on the beaches but also in their homes in London, Stalingrad, Dresden and Hiroshima. Myappeal then was to seek the involvement of the United Nations and to ensure that only action sanctioned by the United Nations could be supported. But my appeal goes beyond just the sanction of the United Nations for an attack on Iraq; it is also a plea to the United Nations to seek a peaceful means for disarming Iraq and, beyond that, to put in place a process to ensure that chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are controlled and ultimately banned completely.
This whole debate seems to have become one that concentrates on Iraq with the only option considered being an armed attack, which will surely kill tens of thousands of people. An attack on Iraq, sanctioned by the United Nations, should not be seen as the only option available to bring about a solution. Even if we see an attack as the solution, the problem does not go away. As we heard the British Prime Minister say last week, after Iraq it is on to North Korea and then to a host of other countries which possess chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. But that course of action ignores what has been one of the most important roles of the United Nations: its sponsoring of treaties and conventions. We have treaties and conventions dealing with chemical weapons and biological weapons. We have conventions dealing with nuclear weapons. We have a treaty dealing with landmines. We have an International Criminal Court. But those conventions and treaties have not been ratified by all countries. One country most notable for its failure to sign those treaties is the United States of America.
When we appeal for these matters to be dealt with by the United Nations, we are not simply seeking a vote of the Security Council to authorise military action against Iraq; we are not simply seeking another resolution that can be interpreted as a pretext for unilateral action against Iraq. What is needed is an ongoing process to prevent the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. That is what our goal should be. But where should that process begin and where should it end? In the case of Iraq, we could assume that any existing weapons were imported prior to the Gulf War. Since 1991, sanctions have been in place and a strict blockade has been imposed on Iraq to ensure that Saddam Hussein could not get his hands on weapons or components of weapons of mass destruction.
We assume that Iraq has hidden away thousands of tonnes of banned materials. But, in this whole process, we are not asking questions about where the materials are coming from. In 1998 when Iraq ended the inspection process the world did not react with alarm. It is clear that the world assumed that whatever materials and delivery systems Iraq possessed, they did not possess a real threat to any nation. There was no alarm in 1998; there was concern and there were warnings from people such as Richard Butler, but we did not deploy troops in the manner that we are now deploying them.
The mistake that is being made now is that we think that if we disarm Iraq then the problem will be solved—but it won't. The problem is not whether chemical, biological or nuclear weapons are hidden; the problem is that they are supplied. This is where the role of the United States of America must be called into question. We know that Iraq's accounting of its chemical weapons does not add up because we have documents from their suppliers. The Prime Minister was today quoting thousands of tonnes of material not accounted for. What is interesting is the recent role of the United States in concealing its role as the supplier of weapons to Iraq.
We have all heard about the 12,000-page dossier handed over to the weapons inspectors, which gives details of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons. When that was handed over, we know that only the permanent members of the Security Council received all 12,000 pages. The dossier has not been released in full to the general public. Only a limited 3,000-page extract has been made available to the non-permanent members of the Security Council—can you believe that? What was contained in the missing 9,000 pages? As you would expect in an inventory of materials, it contained details of the suppliers of those materials, and who were they? From documents released on the Internet, we know that United States-based companies including Hewlett-Packard, Eastman Kodak and Honeywell, as well as suppliers of biological materials, were supplying Iraq with weapons and materials.
Let us go back to 1994. The US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs confirmed that in the 1980s the US Department of Commerce issued licences for the export to Iraq of biological and chemical agents, including anthrax. At that time Iraq was at war with Iran. Do you remember that? The United States had no worries about supplying Saddam Hussein with those materials. We tend to forget that. Yet in his speech today the Prime Minister claimed that Iraq's use of those chemical and biological weapons was the main reason that we need to take military action—to remove those weapons.
This is hypocrisy on the part of the Prime Minister regarding the stand taken by the United States. This is why it is plain stupid to think that the way to deal with the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is to take military action against one of the many countries in possession of those weapons. What is needed is an agency capable of identifying all stocks of these weapons, wherever they are, and strictly controlling the supply of materials used in the production of those weapons. We know that the trade in materials goes on under a veil of secrecy. Oh boy, how I remember the following incident! When an El Al cargo plane crashed in the Netherlands during a flight from New York to Israel, its cargo included four principal agents used in the manufacture of VX nerve gas. The trade goes on. The wider the trade, the greater the risk.
Despite the fact that chemical weapons have been outlawed since 1925, nothing is being done to stop this deadly trade. Yet the country which demands that military action should be taken against Iraq openly trades in these materials and refuses to open its stockpiles and manufacturing facilities to inspection. That is the hypocrisy of this issue. That is what sickens me when I think that tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens will die as a result of military action. What sense of morality would allow that to happen? How can we even consider the risk of killing all those people when we have done so little to control the trade in these illegal weapons?
We cannot claim, as some leaders have, that military action will liberate Iraq. How can we justify the killing of thousands of people in order to liberate them? We should never get carried away with the `give me liberty or give me death' slogans. When you are dead you are never free to do anything. My very great fear is that, if military action is taken against Iraq, we will not have made the world a safer place. We will not have encouraged the cause of disarming the world of chemical and biological weapons. By our total indifference to human life, we will only encourage acts of terrorism rather than reduce the risk of such acts. 
That is essentially how I see this situation. Last September I placed my faith in the United Nations' ability to deal with the problem. Very few government members, then and now, have acknowledged a positive role for the United Nations in dealing with Iraq. Even now, the only role they see for the United Nations is endorsement of military action. In deploying Australian troops to the Middle East, we have shown quite clearly that we reject any proposed diplomatic solution.
We now know from the lips of the foreign minister—those wonderful little lips; I can picture him in his stockings and stiletto shoes—that our troops are committed and that `Australia is not in a position, if the UN process breaks down, to withdraw our ships and other presence from the Gulf'. As I said earlier, this problem will not be solved by military action. It will only be solved when the nations of the world reject the idea of any nation whatsoever holding stocks of chemical and biological weapons. The process of inspections in Iraq carried to its conclusion should be the first step towards that.
If anyone wonders whether I am out of step with the people of my electorate of Fowler on this issue, they would be very wrong. In the last two weeks I have conducted a survey of the voters, and the results show that the people of my electorate—an electorate that I am proud to represent in this parliament—do not want to see military action against Iraq. In answer to the question, `Do you think Australia should send troops to support a war in Iraq if the United Nations calls for an armed attack?' 42 per cent said yes and 58 per cent said no. So even UN sanctioned military action is not supported. In answer to the question, `Do you think Australia should send troops to support a war in Iraq if United States President George Bush calls for Australian support even if the United Nations does not support an attack?' 12 per cent said yes and 88 per cent said no. This is an overwhelming rejection of support for unilateral action by the United States. Eighty-eight per cent of my wonderful people said that Australia should do more to seek a diplomatic solution rather than resort to war. On the question of whether an attack on Iraq would make Australia safe from terrorist attacks, 90 per cent said it would not. Asked if they thought war on Iraq was more about oil than security, 75 per cent said it was.
I am confident that my views are in touch with the views of my electorate. I think that, if the Prime Minister and members opposite took the trouble to listen to their electorates, they would quickly change their position. As we now know, committing our forces to military action amounts to going all the way with George W. Bush. Today the Prime Minister said:
The government will not make a final decision to commit to military conflict unless and until it is satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful resolution have been explored.
But we now know that we are committed to military action. This government cannot back out now. We have not given the United Nations a chance—and we have not given peace a chance.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—I invite the member for Fowler to read the press release that the Minister for Foreign Affairs released this evening, indicating that the conclusion that she drew was just impossible.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—Order!
—Will she apologise?
—Not likely, Parliamentary Secretary. I do not think we would find a member in this place who supported war. I think the member for Fowler might agree with me on that. Nobody wants war. This debate should not be brought down to emotional terms; it has to be brought down to practical, sensible and serious consideration. That consideration should go to addressing the question: where does the world go from here? 
Of course, if Saddam Hussein had acceded to the request of United Nations resolution 1441 we would not even be having this debate and we would not be talking about the prospect of a lot of people being killed in Iraq. I think we have to keep that in context. There is no doubt that the issues of Iraq and how to deal with the problems presented by the intransigence of its leadership have been some of the most difficult that our country—indeed the world—have faced for quite some time. The issues are so complex and so interrelated that there are many possible ways that this might play out. But there will be only one way that is right for Australia, and that way will be right for the international community. Probably not even the wisdom of Solomon would be enough to be certain that the world is taking the right path. It will only be with the benefit of hindsight that we will know what the right path was.
I have always been fundamentally concerned that, whatever solution might be agreed upon, the wrong solution could result in the beginning of a decade—or even a century—of retaliation from extremist groups around the world. I know that sounds a bit emotive, but you have to be a bit sensible about these things. You have to think about what might happen and you have to look at history and the way the various extremist groups conduct themselves around the world. Although Saddam Hussein might ultimately be disarmed, terrorist cells with a hatred—and I use the word `hatred' in a considered way—of the United States of America may continue for years to come with indiscriminate, unexpected attacks on and around the free world. Whatever the world decides to do about Iraq, just imagine if it triggers that kind of a response over the next decades. It is an awful, chilling prospect, so we have to get it right.
I want to make it quite clear that I believe the majority of the Islamic world has a similar view to that held by Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and the like; that is, that all major religions of the world have as a basis the love of peace and goodwill. When I was in Indonesia with the member for Lingiari late last year, we met with the leaders of literally tens of millions of Muslims. Those leaders went out of their way to assure us that they absolutely rejected the behaviour of the small number of Islamic extremists.
There is no doubt that, for the sake of future peace and stability in our time, those of us who are concerned about the future of the world want to see rogue states disarmed. There is equally no doubt that, if the world gets the process wrong, future peace and stability may not be possible for a very long time. So it is that I reached the view very early in this debate that, if there were going to be any sort of military operation, it would be preferable that it be conducted with the imprimatur of the United Nations. I was a bit out of step when I first said that very publicly but, as referred to by the member for Fowler, and as we all know, that is a view that is held by very many of the Australian population. It is vitally important that the rest of the world should be seen to be acting in concert, through the UN Security Council, to send a clear message that the world desires peace and stability. For this reason, Australia wants a second resolution from the Security Council, because we are far more likely to get a peaceful solution if the world backs intervention.
I remember that the United States faced this kind of dilemma back in 1962—that is before you were born, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams—when they detected the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, 140 kilometres off the US coast. The debate at that time revolved around the question of whether the US should launch a pre-emptive strike against Cuba or whether it should take its knowledge to the United Nations and ask for sanctioned action and a defensive blockade. It is now a matter of history that the US President of the day, John F. Kennedy, took the hard decision and the tough way out. He sent Adlai Stevenson to the UN with undeniable evidence to expose the Soviets, even though he knew that that would show his cards to the Soviets. But it resulted in the outmanoeuvring of Nikita Khrushchev, the president of the Soviet Union at the time.
Here we are in another time and place, faced with a similarly difficult decision. But sometimes the hardest decisions can be the easiest, and it is my considered view that the Australian decision is correct: we should do everything that we can to get the backing of the United Nations as needed for any potential military operation in Iraq, once all diplomatic processes have been exhausted. Consider too the potential to create a devastating precedent for countries like India, China or Pakistan if they sought to evade the Security Council by invoking an open-ended and fact-free notion of `pre-emptive self defence'. This is yet another reason why we all need to think carefully about how the Iraqi situation will play out.
Internally in Australia Iraq is being treated as a serious issue, and the matter deserves a serious debate. The Australian parliament must rise to that challenge and be seen to be working first in the interests of our country. That should be foremost in the minds of members. Certainly we should all be respectful of public opinion, but we should not be poll driven. The realities of 11 September and 12 October underline the need for Iraq to yield up its weapons of mass destruction, and that might mean that Australia has to take a position that is not superficially popular. At this point I would observe that it is not unusual for the Howard government to find itself in this position. In many of the great debates in this country over the last several years, the government has tackled hard issues in the national interest even though they have not had popular support. It has been the hallmark of Prime Minister John Howard that he has been prepared to say what needs to be said and, more importantly, to follow through.
Members of parliament will be aware that I represent Australia's largest tropical city, Townsville in North Queensland. Townsville has the distinction of supporting Australia's largest military force. It is the home of the 3rd Brigade, Australia's ready deployment force and RAAF Townsville, one of Australia's forward air defence bases. Elements of the Australian Defence Force from Townsville are already on their way to the Persian Gulf. Army landing craft from 10 Force Support Battalion Townsville are embarked on one of Australia's LPAs, HMAS Kanimbla. Soldiers from Townsville's 5 Aviation Regiment are also under orders from the Chief of the Defence Force to prepare for forward deployment to the Gulf. Elements of 5 Aviation Force, namely the Boeing CH47 Chinook medium lift helicopters, are being prepared for possible deployment. I am constantly in touch with the men and women of all ranks in the Australian Defence Force in Townsville, and it is interesting to observe that they all want to go to the Middle East. The dangers involved never enter their minds because they understand their commitment to Australia as members of the ADF.
Australians should never forget the professionalism and dedication of our Defence Force members. They are recognised across the world, and I have heard US officers in particular refer to Australians as the best in the world. The Defence Force may have its inevitable shortcomings in areas such as financial management, acquisition and resource management, but when it comes to the sharp end of things it is the best. When the ADF deployed to Timor for extended periods of rotation, it was found that contact with home was very important for the troops. One thing that did distress me about extended periods of rotation was the fact that relationships suffered and such periods led to broken marriages in Townsville. With the Middle East being so much further away, I have asked the government to ensure that ADF members and their families are properly looked after, that communications with home are as freely available as possible and that the full resources of the Defence Community Organisation be available to families back in Australia. In the days and weeks ahead the world, through the United Nations, must make the right decision. The political agendas of individual countries must be secondary to the interests of the world as a whole. To make our way in this new and unsettling world, we must hold fast to our old and most valued principles.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I have a number of misgivings about what the Prime Minister said in his statement today. I feel very strongly about committing Australian troops to foreign wars. I believe that we should be very wary about involvement in hot wars, whether they are sanctioned by the UN Security Council or not. I have an equally firm view on the matter of the defence of Australia. I am not a pacifist. I believe that all Australians should stand ready to defend our country, and I believe it appropriate that Australian forces be part of international peacekeeping teams—but not warmaking teams. I have always supported the defence of Australian shores against invasion by a hostile force and, if we were threatened by such a force, I would not hesitate to support action being taken to defend our country. But I cannot agree with the government's commitment of our defence forces to a war in Iraq without any reason other than the fact that Iraq may have weapons of mass destruction.
There have been debates previously in this chamber about Australia's involvement in international conflicts. I recall the debate in January 1991 about the Gulf War. I was Speaker at that time, and because I was Speaker I could not join in the debate. But my view then and now was no secret: I was not in favour of Australia's forces being committed to that particular conflict. There was no division on that occasion, though the prime minister of the day, Prime Minister Hawke, had put forward a clear motion about Australia's support for the UN-sanctioned multinational forces in the Gulf. A UN-sanctioned force is something we do not have at present, of course. There was no requirement for a division as only one member—the then member for North Sydney, Mr Mack—said no when the question was put. But I had made my position clear to my colleagues and if a vote had been taken and a division held—and had I not been the Speaker and therefore able to vote—I would have voted against committing Australian forces to combat. 
The situation in East Timor in 1999 was different. Indonesia is our closest large neighbour. Instability in East Timor was adversely affecting both East Timor and Indonesia, and had the potential to impact severely on Australia. I had reservations about the government's handling of some aspects of the deteriorating situation in East Timor but I accepted the need for us to get involved—and this we did, as leaders of the multinational force, to try and assist the East Timorese. This was much more a peacekeeping action than a hot war. I was not all that happy about it but I accepted that it was necessary.
As with Australia's limited commitment to the war in Afghanistan and the subsequent pursuit of the terrorist organisations involved, I believed that that was justified. That there was a real threat to Australians was later borne out by the tragic bombings in Bali. But this current situation is quite different. There is no worldwide consensus of view. There is no convincing case for sending Australian military forces across the world to be involved in a war against Iraq. 
I am sure that we all remember `Storming Norman' Schwarzkopf, the US general who led the troops in the Gulf War. You would think that he, with his previous experience of conflict with Saddam Hussein and Iraqi forces, would be supportive of the current Bush doctrine. He has had first-hand experience in the region with the same enemy. You would expect that he would be encouraging the completion of unfinished business in that particular part of the world. But what is the former general saying? While he is no fan of Saddam Hussein—in fact, far from it—he is advocating restraint. He does not believe that adequate cause for invasion has been demonstrated. In an interview in the Washington Post he says: 
The thought of Saddam Hussein with a sophisticated nuclear capability is a frightening thought, okay? Now, having said that, I don't know what intelligence the US government has. And before I can just stand up and say, `beyond a shadow of a doubt, we need to invade Iraq', I guess I would like to have better information.
I think it is very important for us to wait and see what the inspectors come up with, and hopefully they come up with something conclusive.
That is a retired general, who commanded the forces in the Gulf, speaking—someone with direct relevant experience in the exact place where the current conflict looms, and he is not convinced. He is not all gung-ho about rushing off into another war. He finds it scary; he is nervous. If he is nervous and concerned about the current leadership of the US and where they might be taking us, I think we should all be very, very afraid—because he is someone who does have the knowledge and the experience. Soldiering was his business and he is now very worried about the dangers of rushing to war with Iraq. 
When speaking about Iraq in this House in September last year, to take note of another ministerial statement, I said:
I am deeply concerned about this drift to war without explanation or reason and, quite frankly, I find it very worrying. I am worried because I am losing confidence in many of the leaders of the international community. I have fears about their ability to make sane decisions based on evidence rather than rhetoric. I feel that Australia is being drawn by external forces along a path that will lead to death and destruction, and the government seems to be doing little to resist.
I went on to say:
The inevitability of war is in the air, not the question of its necessity. When the Prime Minister of this country commits Australia to join another nation in a pre-emptive strike against a third country, without even bothering to consult Australians, it is time for all of us to worry about the situation we are in. We expect the leaders of our country to represent us and reflect our views and to show real leadership; we do not expect them to lead us willy-nilly over a precipice or to commit us to a fight, when the vast majority of us do not even know why we should be involved. The opinion polls and emails that members are receiving show that the country is very concerned about this drift to war. 
That was part of what I said in September last year, and it is still relevant tonight. It is appropriate that I repeat those views because nothing has changed. We are still in a perilous situation. Particularly after hearing the Prime Minister today, I have no confidence in his ability and capacity to lead us and guide us through this problem. 
What we heard from the Prime Minister today was 53 minutes of rhetoric. There was very little evidence and very few new thoughts. I recall that at one stage he said that we had evidence, which we had given the Americans, that would prove that Saddam Hussein is doing some of the things the Prime Minister says he is doing. But the Prime Minister did not bother to tell the Australian parliament that. The Prime Minister has secret evidence but he cannot share it with the parliament. 
What we got today in the speech the Prime Minister made is another example of his Orwellian approach to politics. He talks about peace while sending troops to war. He talks about the United Nations but there is no Security Council resolution. He says he has not committed Australia to war but he has despatched over 2,000 Australian service personnel to the Gulf, and nearly half of the Australian Navy is on the way there.
This deployment, which the Prime Minister says has not really occurred, is nearly three times the size of the deployment Australia made to the Gulf in the 1991 war. Today we are debating a Clayton's motion—that the House take note of the Prime Minister's statement—which he will claim gives the imprimatur for Australia's involvement in war in the Middle East. We are not even debating a clear-cut motion. We are all being insulted and treated with contempt. On an issue of great importance, a matter of life and death, we are being permitted only to take note of the Prime Minister's statement. I think that is insulting to the Australian people and I think it is particularly insulting to the parliament. 
We should compare this take note motion of the Prime Minister's to the motion that was put before the House by Prime Minister Hawke in 1991. In terms of this current motion, how does someone who does not agree with the government's position register their disagreement—by voting against taking note of the speech? What a joke! At least in 1991, when Prime Minister Hawke took Australia to war, he put the following motion before the House:
That this House—
(1) reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self determination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait;
(2) affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 678 for support in implementing that Resolution;
(3) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces serving with the UN-sanctioned multi-national forces in the Gulf;
(4) deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel; and
(5) recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. 
That is a very clear-cut motion, put forward by Prime Minister Hawke, committing Australia to war—unlike what we heard from the Prime Minister earlier today. 
A motion to take note of a ministerial statement does not meet the test of parliamentary scrutiny of the government's decision to deploy troops to the Middle East. The government must bring in a resolution at some later date which clearly sets out its intentions, as Prime Minister Hawke did in 1991. This House needs to make a clear affirmative or negative decision about what we are doing, instead of taking note of some stupid speech made by the Prime Minister which was very long on rhetoric and very short on facts.
In the current situation, I have not been able to find sufficient evidence to convince me that Saddam Hussein, as bad and evil as he is, is a threat to Australia or to the people of Australia. Therefore, I cannot support the commitment of Australian troops to war in Iraq. The fact that I cannot support the commitment of our forces in this instance does not mean that I am in any way critical of the Australian defence personnel whom this government has deployed to the Middle East. They are doing their duty to act at the direction of the government of the day, and they will acquit themselves with honour. I pray that they will return safely to their loved ones. They have my absolute respect—unlike their political masters who have committed them to this ridiculous situation.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,5,1
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2003-02-04,"—I have listened with interest to some of the contributions that have been made in this debate on Iraq by members on the other side of the House. I have listened to speakers—such as the last speaker, the member for Watson—talk about the rhetoric that was used on the government side. Yet to use the bland term `rhetoric' to describe some of the statements that have been made by the other side of the House is, I think, to be complimentary of some of those speeches. The fact is that Labor's opposition to the action that has been taken by the government has almost taken on a contrived appearance—dating back to when Carmen Lawrence resigned from the front bench saying, `You must take a different stance.' Laurie Brereton came out and said, `You are all weak. You cannot be distinguished from the government. You have got to take a stand that is different—not because what you want to do is the right thing, but just to be different.' It really is a position on the part of Labor which is indefensible. Let us look at the reality of what is happening here. 
The last speaker, the member for Watson, made the point that Bob Hawke brought a motion before the parliament concerning the commitment to war. The fact is that Bob Hawke committed troops to war as an executive act, and the debate took place after that commitment had been made. The parliament was recalled after the commitment of troops had been made. In this case, we are debating a statement that the Prime Minister has made in this parliament to the Australian nation, and the statement is now available for debate in the parliamentary forum that we have, which is the formalised motion to take note of the paper. This enables people to put their position prior to any decision being made for Australia to commit troops to a situation of war. They are two entirely separate situations. 
The particular point that we have reached is this: there is absolutely no defence of Saddam Hussein, who is an evil man who commits the most horrendous acts upon his own people and the people who live within his influence and power. People ask why we are singling out and taking action against Saddam Hussein and Iraq for holding weapons of mass destruction and not against other nations which may also hold weapons of mass destruction. The very simple answer is that Saddam Hussein has shown that he is prepared to use those weapons; and indeed he has, in fact, used those weapons.
There was a statement made recently that, when the horrors of gassing in World War I were seen, there was an abhorrence by the world at large and the gassing of people during warfare has been eschewed by all people in subsequent wars. Not so with Saddam Hussein, who used it on his people and particularly on the Kurds. He has shown that he is willing to use those weapons, hence the concern for Iraq to comply with the requirement after the 1991 war that he disarm Iraq. 
It has been admitted by none other than Kofi Annan that the preparedness of the United States to take `unilateral action', as it is being termed, brought the required pressure on Iraq to admit the weapons inspectors, who have been in Iraq and reported to the United Nations on 27 January. What did that report say? I suspect the report was very much stronger than many people had suspected it would be. 
Dr Hans Blix, when handing down his report, made several very important findings. In relation to the nerve agent VX, which is one of the most toxic ever developed, Iraq's declaration stated that they had only produced VX on a pilot scale—just a few tonnes—that the quality was poor and the product unstable and, therefore, it was never weaponised. However, Dr Blix said that he had in fact found evidence that it had been weaponised. UNMOVIC was informed that there were conflicts with the declaration made by Iraq and that there was evidence that indicated that work on the issue of purity and stabilisation of that particular nerve agent had been achieved and, indeed, that work had continued on the utilisation of that weapon of mass destruction.
A document, written in 1998, was discovered and taken from the home of an Iraqi official. Although it was claimed that only 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force between 1983 and 1988, that document showed that 19,500 bombs had been in its inventory. Thus 6,500 bombs, which would contain in the order of 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent, were not accounted for. In the words of the reporter, Dr Blix: `In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume that these quantities are now unaccounted for'—in other words, probably still extant.
They discovered a number of 122-millimetre chemical rocket warheads in a bunker at a storage depot. Again, in the terms of the report, the rockets:
... could also be the tip of a submerged iceberg. The discovery of a few rockets does not resolve but rather points to the issue of several thousands of chemical rockets that are unaccounted for.
	...	...	...
Iraq has declared that it produced about 8,500 litres of this biological warfare agent, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991.
Yet there is no evidence that those chemicals have been destroyed. The report goes on repeatedly in this vein. It says:
Iraq has refurbished its missile production infrastructure. In particular, Iraq reconstituted a number of casting chambers, which had previously been destroyed under UNSCOM supervision.  Whatever missile system these chambers are intended for, they could produce motors for missiles capable of ranges significantly greater than—
the UN limit of—
150 km.
It has been found that Iraq illegally imported chemicals used in propellants, test instrumentation, and guidance and control systems. Repeatedly this report made findings that showed that, far from adhering to the requirement that it disarm, Iraq has not disarmed and has not accounted for weapons of mass destruction—from which the conclusion must be drawn that it still holds these weapons.
The question of what action can and should be taken has been a strong point of debate by people who say that Australia should not involve herself. Australia has always been a nation that plays her part in the international arena; a nation that always says that, where there is a cause and where there is justice on the side of those who wish to proceed, Australia will be part of it. As we look at the question of whether the United Nations will give its imprimatur for further action to be taken, what is really to be discussed is what occurs if there is an impasse with the United Nations. What if a veto is exercised? We saw that in Kosovo. There it was believed that, if a resolution had been brought forward to the Security Council, Russia would have exercised a veto. Consequently, the action was taken and the forces went in without the sanction of the United Nations. But you could say they acquiesced in such action, because they realised that it had to be taken.
Everyone believes that the very best solution is that United Nations imprimatur be given to any subsequent action taken. Nobody believes that the action should preferably be taken without United Nations sanction. But the reality is that, if a veto is exercised by a member of the Security Council, for whatever reason, the idea of there being an absolute stalemate with nothing occurring is something that cannot be countenanced; action will have to be taken. The question is whether at that stage Australia makes a decision to be part of that action.
The government has made it quite clear that at this point we have not taken that decision. It is a decision that will be taken in the light of whatever transpires after the presentation has been made tomorrow, 5 February, to the United Nations, and in the light of whether the United Nations decides that it must press on and that its credibility is on the line. It is in the light of the decision that is taken there that subsequent decisions will be taken. It may well be that further time will be given for more inspections to be done and for more proof to be gathered; that remains to be seen.
The important point about today's debate is that the Prime Minister has—as, indeed, people have required—made a statement in the parliament to allow this issue to be debated. I am taking part in this debate, as are members on the other side. But I am disappointed when I see some folk taking the attitude that there is a simplistic solution; that by saying `No war; we're against war' you somehow solve the question of what may happen in the future.
During the Cold War a situation occurred of mutually assured destruction which prevented the use of nuclear weapons from either side. In that period we used to hear debate on, and demands for, unilateral disarmament—I suspect from the same sort of people who are now saying that we ought not participate in this international question. The rhetoric was that, if people on the side of democracy and freedom simply disarmed, all the world's problems would be solved. Those of us who took a differing point of view said that we needed peace through strength. At the end of the day, the Cold War was resolved because of that stance and because the Soviet Union finally saw that their system was not sustainable. The difficulty is that the solution to the problems that we are dealing with now is similar to what was put forward then—if rogue states have access to weapons that are part of a mutually assured destruction, then the world will become a far more unstable place; if the constraints imposed upon the super powers no longer apply and if people with less responsible attitudes use those weapons, they could bring about a worldwide catastrophe. 
We face that situation now. Should Iraq achieve nuclear capacity—and two years ago a finding was made that Iraq would be able to achieve such a capacity within two years—and then share those weapons with terrorists or what we might call `less responsible nations', catastrophe could indeed be brought upon the world. Australia is a nation which has always played her part, as I said earlier. Australia is a nation that does not shy away from the difficult decisions and, further, it will always say that it is not only Australia's interests but the world's interests that are part and parcel of the decisions that we will make. We have fought before and we will fight again to ensure the freedom of our people, and that fight will always encompass the broad sphere as well as the very narrow sphere of imminent danger that may be within our country. These are difficult decisions and difficult times, but I have great confidence in the Australian people that they will always back the cause of righteousness.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-02-04,"—I would like to take this opportunity tonight to honour a great Australian woman who retires from public life next Monday. I was an associate to Justice Mary Gaudron nearly 10 years ago, and she had an enormous impact on my life and is no doubt part of the reason I am here today. As a lawyer, an advocate and a High Court judge, Justice Gaudron has been at the forefront and the pinnacle of our legal profession. She brought to her job as a lawyer not just a brain but a heart and hands as well. She was someone who not only used her mighty intelligence but also added compassion to her approach to the job. She brought to it her practical life experience which, I might say, can sometimes seem lost or irrelevant amongst so many other judges and lawyers of a similar age, background, race and gender. 
Mary Gaudron never sought—or got—special treatment. In her normal down-to-earth manner, she dismissed the praise she received for being the first woman to do so many things. This was not just modesty, but reflects a genuine desire on her part to see women take a truly equal place with men in all walks of Australian life. Rather than being proud of her achievements on behalf of women, her speeches in particular have shown some frustration at the `first woman' syndrome. It is a frustration that other women before her had been held back and dissatisfaction that being first did not necessarily mean that women would pour through the now open doors behind her. This is, sadly, clearly so, as her departure will leave the court again without a single woman judge. I fear for our country when the first woman High Court judge might be our last for some time.
Labor made only 14 appointments to the High Court, and we can have some pride that the Hawke Labor government recognised Mary Gaudron's capacity and appointed her in 1987. Of the coalition's 30 appointments, the best that can be said is that they have certainly been consistent.
But more about Mary Gaudron. I, like many others, have been at the receiving end of the judge's rather penetrating questions. It seemed that months of research could often be demolished with a single succinct question, often a totally practical one that simply no-one else had bothered to ask. I remember a very distressing special leave application in a rape case where an appeal was sought on the basis that a confession should not have been admissible. As part of reviewing the documents, I had viewed the videotape of the interview, which I must say was very ugly and quite confronting. I can remember in my naivety asking whether the rules governing police interviews were really necessary or whether this person was truly deserving of such protection. I got a stormy response along the lines of: `Do you really think that police or governments go around breaching the civil rights of nice middle-class ladies with white gloves on just so those who pretend to be civil libertarians will feel comfortable in defending their principles?' I must say that that quite appropriate put-down has haunted me ever since. It was typical of a woman who persistently sought to uphold the rights of the disadvantaged, the dispossessed and the discriminated against, especially in her famous contribution with Justice Deane in the Mabo case.
Sometimes her questions were more curious. I remember at my job interview being asked if I carried a gun and if I drank. The correct answers were `No' and `Yes'. It seemed that the only thing she trusted less than a staff member with a gun was one that was a teetotaller—although some of her best associates even snuck through on that count.
I have great affection for the fact that, unlike the other judges at the farewell to all associates, she did not have a near heart failure when I advised that I was going off to work for a union rather than to the bar, to Oxford, to Harvard or to some other `suitable' legal position. Instead, she recalled to me her time on the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, where a witness apologised to her for being awkward in giving his evidence as he was wearing false teeth that were not his own, having left his at home by mistake. The witness's trusty union official had kindly lent him his own set in a true sign of working-class solidarity. 
Mary Gaudron gave me a farewell gift which I still have—a silver hippopotamus—with the instructions, as I set off to my union job, that I would need a thick hide where I was going. She did not know that I would end up here, but the hippopotamus still sits in my office in Footscray with its message just as relevant.
Mary Gaudron deserves to be honoured for her contribution to the law and to Australian society. It would have been a fitting tribute to her for her to leave the court on her retirement with more women on the bench than when she was appointed, but, sadly, there are fewer. That will be a fight that those of us who follow her will have to continue in her honour.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>High Court of Australia: Justice Mary Gaudron</title>,Adjournment,11,1
