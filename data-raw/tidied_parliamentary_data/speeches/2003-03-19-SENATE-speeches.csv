"Senator EGGLESTON,",LP,2003-03-19,"—Today I would like to pay tribute to two people, a husband and wife—Dr Kevin Cullen and his wife, Diana—who separately made outstanding contributions to WA's south-west community and were both individually awarded the Order of Australia for their achievements. Dr Cullen and Diana, who was a physiotherapist, came to what was then the small south-west town of Busselton in 1948. Both Cullens worked hard in their professional careers and had a large family of children, three of whom subsequently became doctors themselves. Seeing the need to have doctors with higher qualifications in country towns, in 1958 Kevin Cullen passed the examinations for membership of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, which was, in itself, a remarkable achievement, considering that Dr Cullen was not a trainee in a teaching hospital being tutored for his examinations but a busy country doctor working long hours with little spare time for study. However, the fact that he achieved this qualification was indicative of Dr Cullen's dedication and level of clinical skills. This was confirmed in 1963, when Dr Cullen was awarded the first ever doctorate in medicine, from the then fairly new University of Western Australia medical school, for research into factors contributing to asthma. Dr Cullen continued to be a great proponent of higher standards in GP medicine in rural areas and of the objectives in that regard of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Dr Cullen worked over the whole of his subsequent medical career to improve the standards of rural medical services. 
In the 1960s, after returning from a study tour in North America, Dr Cullen conceived the idea of an ongoing survey of the population of Busselton to establish the incidence of various medical problems and diseases such as diabetes in the Australian population. It was modelled to some extent on the famous Framingham survey in the United States. Busselton was a statistically ideal population with almost equal numbers of people in each decade age group. The proposed survey was enthusiastically supported by the University of Western Australia, especially by the university's Department of Medicine. The first Busselton survey was carried out in 1966. Ninety-one per cent of the population of Busselton attended the local St John Ambulance hall to have a series of blood and lung tests performed and to have their heights and weights measured. I know this because I, along with other members of my family, was among those who were involved. 
Over the years, the Busselton survey was regularly held and from the data so gained important conclusions were drawn about the incidence of conditions such as asthma and diabetes and risk factors for coronary artery disease in the Australian population. Many years later, it has been shown that subjects who have regularly attended the survey have survived longer, with a death rate about one-third of the rest of the population of the south-west and much better than that of the metropolitan area, which proves the case for people to have regular medical check-ups to identify possible risk factors and problems. Many surveys later and 30 years on, in 1994-95, 5,500 participants in the Busselton surveys came back for additional testing, which this time included taking blood for future genetic marker and DNA studies. So the Busselton survey is indexing itself for progression in medical technology and knowledge. In 1993, Dr Cullen was awarded the inaugural AMA award for an individual contribution to health care in Australia. In the following year Kevin Cullen was made a member of the Order of Australia. The citation made particular mention of his outstanding contribution to community health and the wine industry. That award was made just prior to his death in 1994. The reference to the wine industry brings me to his wife, Diana, and the enormous contribution she made to the wine industry in the south-west of Western Australia. 
Mrs Cullen recently passed away at the age of 80 after losing a long battle with cancer. She was a pioneer of the wine industry in the Margaret River region of Western Australia. She was the first person to import Merlot and Cabernet Franc cuttings into Western Australia and was also the very first person, in 1966, to plant grape vines in the region around the Margaret River. In 1971 she established the Cullen Vineyard at Willyabrup, on the family farm. At the time Diana Cullen planted four different varieties of grapes and five years later she planted the first Merlot grapes for cropping in the region. Today the winery has 28 hectares of vineyards and it is one of the most well-known and well-awarded vineyards in Western Australia. Mrs Cullen also contributed to the industry by trialling various types of trellising and canopy management for different varieties of grapes. In 1974 Mrs Cullen's winery produced its first wines and in 1977 the winery was the first from the Margaret River region to receive a trophy, from the Canberra National Wine Show. This was to be the first of a series of awards over the years and it was the beginning of a long history of awards for the wines produced from the Cullens' vineyards, which have been appreciated by many people, including Minister Amanda Vanstone, who is here in the Senate today and represents the great wine-producing state of South Australia. 
Mrs Cullen became a full-time winemaker in 1981 until 1989, when her daughter, Vanya, took over the reins. Vanya Cullen has also won some outstanding awards for wines produced from the Cullen vineyards in the years since she became the principal winemaker. Mrs Cullen was also a founding member of the Margaret River Wine Industry Association. In 1999, in recognition of her significant contribution to the wine industry, Mrs Cullen was made a Member of the Order of Australia.
Sadly, Diana Cullen passed away a few weeks ago. Her husband Kevin died in 1994. Having grown up in Busselton, I remember both Dr Cullen and Mrs Cullen well. In fact, they lived in the property behind my parents' house when they first came to Busselton. Conversation with Kevin Cullen was always intellectually challenging as he probed the reasons for your opinions on whatever issue you were talking about. While he made a great contribution to medicine in the town, he was regarded as something of an eccentric, who practised what he preached by living a healthy lifestyle and by running two miles every lunchtime, along the beach from the Busselton Health Centre to the Busselton jetty and back, throughout the year—rain, hail or shine.
Mrs Cullen was always a charming, friendly and warm person. Winemaker Denis Horgan—who I think is regarded as the doyen of winemakers in Western Australia— said of her recently:
She was extremely well known, nationally and internationally, was a great pioneer for West Australian quality wine and she made an enormous contribution to her community. She was very much loved and respected. Margaret River had lost a great ambassador—someone who displayed excellence in the outstanding wines that she made and the encouragement that she gave to others.
I endorse those remarks by Denis Horgan and express my sympathies to the Cullen family and the community of the south-west following the loss of such a great supporter of that region.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,"<title>Cullen, Dr Kevin and Mrs Diana</title>",Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-03-19,"— My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as the Minister for Defence. I refer to the minister's public comments regarding Australian terms of engagement in any war with Iraq. Can he explain the difference between Australian and United States rules of engagement? Is the minister, in fact, claiming that the United States is more willing to target areas with civilians than Australia? What is the process by which we rule out targets selected by the US Central Command? Do we have access to independent intelligence on targets, or do we base our assessments on US intelligence? Will RAAF aircraft be used to attack targets in built-up areas where the risk to civilians is obviously much higher?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-03-19,"—I have a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the minister for his answer. I am insulted by Senator Macdonald's interjection. I think the people of Australia are interested in the rules of engagement of the Australian defence forces.
—Saddam Hussein will be interested in this answer as well.
—I know what you said and it shows a lot about you, Senator. My supplementary question is to the Minister for Defence.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. Senator Ray, who I am sorry is not here, took a point of order in the last week and asked you to give consideration to whether ministers, when giving their answers, could make inferences about behaviour or views on the other side. Mr President, when you take up Senator Ray's suggestion, would you also do so in relation to inferences that are put into questions?
—There is no point of order, Senator Vanstone, but I hear what you say. Senator Evans, could you address your remarks through the chair.
—My supplementary question runs on from the last part of Minister Hill's answer, which related to precision munitions. Minister, do all of the FA18s deployed to the gulf have the necessary laser designators to guide paveway bombs? If not, doesn't this mean that some of our aircraft are unable to use precision laser-guided bombs? Wouldn't the use of so-called `dumb' bombs inherently increase the risk of damage to non-military targets? Also, will our aircraft be armed only with Australian munitions, or will we also be using US munitions, including their JDAM precision bombs? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-19,"—The rules of engagement are set by Australia for Australian forces, and Australian commanders will have the responsibility of ensuring that they are adhered to. They do differ somewhat from the United States rules of engagement because Australia is subject to a number of conventions to which the United States is not. The Ottawa convention in relation to landmines is one, and protocol 1 of the Geneva convention is another.
Australians are also subject to a targeting directive that has been given by the Chief of the Defence Force and that is incorporated within the rules of engagement. Targets accepted by the ADF will have to be, in effect, cleared by ADF military commanders who will ensure that they meet the Australian rules of engagement and the targeting directive. The intelligence is, in some instances, partly Australian sourced, but it is reasonable to assume that it has been primarily obtained through other international sources. A great deal of effort has been put into verifying the intelligence upon which targeting decisions are made, in every effort to avoid mistakes. Civilian targets are not legitimate targets for Australian forces; I am sure the United States would also say they are not legitimate targets for the US.
As I think I said yesterday, there are always grey areas in these matters, and that is why we need able commanders supported, if necessary, by good legal advice and very sound intelligence to best avoid mistakes being made. With the use of modern precision munitions and much better intelligence than has existed in the past, it should be possible to minimise civilian casualties. It is certainly the government's objective and that of the ADF to make every effort to minimise civilian casualties.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-19,"—As I understand it, in any strike task that might be assigned and given to the ADF, the ADF is likely to be using laser-guided weapons. That is the preferred weapon for the targets that are likely to be assigned. Therefore, I assume the aircraft are fitted for that capability. In relation to whether all 14 aircraft are fitted, I will seek advice on that. That capability should best ensure accuracy in achieving the target, certainly with minimum civilian loss—hopefully, with no civilian loss.
—What about US JDAM bombs?
—There is no suggestion I know of that we would use US JDAM bombs. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-03-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.  
I am surprised that the Minister for Defence does not know what this is about since this was the subject of a speech I gave earlier today in this place, during which I gave the date of the questions and talked about them at some length—which obviously I will be forced to do again. My questions related to whether or not Australian troops, when they reach Iraq, will face a war in which nuclear weapons are being used. I asked the government to confirm that President Bush had been quoted as saying in the United States that the US administration would use nuclear weapons `if necessary'. As I said earlier today, we are entitled to know whether `if necessary' means that it is necessary or not, and our troops are entitled to know that going into this war against Iraq may be extremely dangerous and no end of suits will protect them from might occur if it is a nuclear war. 
On 28 January, American nuclear weapons analyst William Arkin, who is a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic Education at John Hopkins University, said that the US Strategic Command is compiling potential target lists, with planning focused on roles for nuclear weapons against underground facilities and to stop chemical or biological attack. When asked about this report, White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer said that all military options are available. The minister did not answer this question and did not answer the question that I posed earlier today, even though I gave him a couple of opportunities, by calling a quorum, to come to the chamber and do so. I suggest that the Australian people are interested in the answers to these questions, which for six weeks have not been forthcoming.
I also asked for details to be provided on what advice the government has been given by the US administration about these proposals to use nuclear weapons in an attack on Iraq. We would like to know. The Prime Minister keeps saying that he believes that nuclear weapons will not be used, despite the enormous amount of evidence that is coming out of the United States to suggest that they will. The Prime Minister has a belief that nuclear weapons will not be used, but this is not supported by anything which has been provided by the government to suggest otherwise. 
The STRATCOM review in the US says that nuclear weapons `could be employed against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack'. My question was: what has the United States administration said about this possibility? Which, if any, of the following circumstances would cause Australia to decline to send troops to or withdraw troops from combat in Iraq: the use by the US administration of depleted uranium in warheads—and we know the problems that that caused in Iraq in the Gulf War; the use of nuclear so-called bunker busters—a cute name but we all know that that means a small nuclear weapon; the use of other nuclear weapons; or the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation against Iraq's use of chemical or biological weapons? These are questions that have not been answered in this place or more publicly.
If no decision has yet been made about the circumstances in which our troops will be brought back, when will it be made and by what process? What advice has the government received from the US administration about a reported increase in US nuclear capability? If no advice has been received, what analysis has this government done about increased nuclear capacity? The US administration announced in January that it intended `to shatter Iraq physically, emotionally and psychologically', using at that stage `800 cruise missiles in two days'. We now know that it is 3,000 cruise missiles over 48 hours. That is 15 times as many as were used in the whole of the 40 days of the Gulf War in 1991. We would like to know whether those cruise missiles will include depleted uranium and, if so, how much. Will they all be constructed in that way? What will they target?
The Prime Minister said on 30 January, `Australia doesn't have chemical or biological or nuclear weapons and we don't want them'—we certainly do not—`we don't have them. And we don't think other countries, other than those authorised by international agreement should have them.' I asked: what concerns has the government expressed about the spread of nuclear weapons to Israel? The answer is never provided in this place. What steps has the government taken to disarm Israel of nuclear weapons—or Pakistan, or those many other countries who have nuclear weapons and who present a far greater threat to world peace than does Iraq? And what analysis has the government prepared for the implications of world peace and progress on international treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of the US move to group nuclear weapons with conventional weaponry? 
Those are important questions and I am disappointed that the minister has chosen to ignore them totally, to not come into this place prepared to answer them or to provide the answers within 30 days, as he is required to do. I asked him questions on 12 March about subsequent developments with regard to nuclear weapons but they have not been answered either. My colleague Senator Bartlett, on 21 February, asked a series of questions—some 80 questions—about this war on Iraq but they have not been answered either. Minister, you might note that they are Nos 1173 and 1174. I ask that those questions be answered expeditiously because we are now at war with Iraq. The questions that have been put on notice to you, Minister, are important ones that ought to be answered. The Australian public has a right to know.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-19,"—On 5 March Senator George Campbell asked Senator Coonan a question relating to some tax issues. On behalf of Senator Coonan, I seek leave to incorporate some additional information in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Where an Australian subcontractor supplies goods to another party in Australia as part of a contract with an overseas prime contractor, the subcontractor is required to charge GST to the prime contractor.
Where an overseas prime contractor engages a non-resident subcontractor for the supply of goods to a party in Australia, the non-resident contractor will not charge Australian GST to the prime contractor. However, when the goods are brought into Australia, GST will be charged at importation.
In each case the GST amount charged to the party in Australia will be identical.
When turnover in Australia is less than $50,000, it is a commercial decision for the prime contractor as to whether they register and claim input tax credits. Once they are registered for GST they will have to charge GST on taxable supplies that they make, but they will also be able to claim input tax credits. If an overseas prime contractor is uncertain of the requirements and implications of GST registration they can make use of the ATO's education and advisory services or seek a private ruling.
The GST has been in effect since 1 July 2000. It is not correct to assert that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has been aware of the concerns of industry for at least 3 years. I am advised that industry first raised their concerns with the ATO in the second half of 2001.
Initially industry had concerns that there was a difference in the impacts of GST, but, as I have explained this is not the case. Subsequently industry representatives have raised a concern that the obligations that accompany being registered for GST may discourage an overseas prime contractor from dealing with Australian subcontractors.
At a meeting of industry representatives and the ATO in May 2002 a number of possible responses to industry concerns were identified. The options have not yet been fully explored but the ATO has been available and willing to progress these matters with industry. There have been subsequent meetings and late in 2002 industry representatives added another option to the list of possibilities to be explored.
I am advised that the ATO remains available to progress matters in partnership with industry to ensure that any response is both acceptable to industry and conforms to the law.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Subcontractors</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-03-19,"—The Democrats have said for some time that the number of sitting days in this year, and particularly in these first six months, is inadequate given the workload this place has to get through before the end of June. We remind the government again that one of the reasons why we are sitting late is that there is insufficient time in the remaining days and weeks of this first half of the year to get through that business. I also remind the government that it means that staff in this place will be here until very late tonight. We think that is an undesirable outcome for them and it is a reflection of the fact that the government has so poorly planned this part of the year. We again urge the government to consider extending sitting times for this first half of the year in order to get through the business before us.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-03-19,"—At a time when the world is entering into a war without the sanction of the United Nations and tensions between countries remain high, it is important to re-emphasise the need to ensure that those tensions between countries do not translate into tensions between ethnic groups within Australia. This Friday, 21 March, is Harmony Day. The aim of this day is to provide an opportunity for promoting our community's success as a multicultural society, recommitting ourselves to respect, goodwill and understanding between Australians of all backgrounds and saying no to racism. Harmony Day also coincides with the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Australia has a proud history of multiculturalism and openness, but we can do better. Racism exists in Australia. We must acknowledge this and work towards eradicating it.
I am concerned that this government tends to want to paper over racism where it exists in our country. In March last year, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Racism reported on Australia to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. His report acknowledged:
... substantial efforts are being made by the Australian Government to end racism and racial discrimination.
The report makes 10 recommendations, including reviewing the basis of multiculturalism policy so that it is based upon recognition of the right to difference and to cultural identity, and that the Australian government:
... continue, improve and intensify the efforts already being made to combat racism and racial discrimination against the Aboriginal peoples, in particular by attacking their extreme poverty.
This is a report that should have been taken very seriously by our government. Instead, the credibility of the report and UN human rights mechanisms were attacked. The Race Discrimination Commissioner, Dr William Jonas, said:
The response to the Special Rapporteur's report extends the attacks of the Government on the UN human rights committees to other UN mechanisms. It is a continuation of this denial of the existence of racism in Australia ... The Government must stop obfuscating and shooting the messenger. Australia's international reputation is better served by acknowledging that, like every country of the world, we do have problems with racism and by recommitting to genuine efforts to address the issues.
Tonight in particular I do not need to point out the disdain with which this government has treated the United Nations, particularly its human rights mechanisms; but it needs to be said that the government cannot seriously attempt to improve matters without acknowledging valid criticism from authoritative bodies. To accept criticism and to undertake to improve is a sign of strength that our Prime Minister and this government have failed to manifest in their time in government. But it is in this spirit that I would like to talk briefly about some other areas in which Australians can do much better in respecting each other.
Recent events in the Middle East and the terrorist attacks in New York and Bali have had no small impact on many Australian communities. People are frightened and worried by these events. Many have been confronted, perhaps for the first time, by their lack of knowledge about other countries, cultures and religions. In some circumstances this lack of knowledge and this fear have manifested as racism. There has been a well-documented increase in attacks on, and racial vilification aimed at, Muslim Australians over the past year. On talkback radio there was a marked increase in anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment after September 11. Over the course of 2002 there was a dramatic increase in the number of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim letters published in our newspapers. There was also an increase in the number of letters published in mainstream newspapers that crossed the line from vigorous political criticism to racial vilification directed at Jewish people.
Recently I was approached by a group of mothers from the New South Wales Jewish community. They told me a little about how they had been living over the past few years, and I was surprised and somewhat shocked by the level of threat of racial attack that this community has been living under. I had no real understanding of the level of stress this has caused whole communities—schools, community organisations, religious organisations and young Australian men and women going about their everyday lives. In 1992 the Executive Council of Australian Jewry's database recorded 140 reports of violence, vandalism, harassment and intimidation directed at members of the Australian Jewish community and Jewish institutions. This included incidents of property damage, assault and direct harassment. In 2002 that same database noted 625 reports of incidents, defined by the Australian government as `racist violence' against Jewish Australians, given to the ECAJ or its constituent bodies. There were 131 incidents reported in one month alone. There were 39 reports of street harassment, the highest number ever for this type of incident—and these were the reported incidents. How many more have not been reported? The report of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry noted: 
It is of great concern to the Jewish community in Australia that synagogues in Sydney, Canberra and Perth have been subjected to arson attacks.
This group of mothers told me that in 2001 more than 13,000 homes in Sydney's Jewish community received a copy of a leaflet entitled Community security alert. This was, of course, well before the Prime Minister's famously pointless fridge magnet. The publication is quite extraordinary; it contains information of a much more practical and sobering nature. It covers how to recognise, and act upon, suspicious objects, letters and parcels, suspicious people or cars, hate mail, telephone bomb threats and hate calls, street attacks, graffiti and threats to personal security. These kinds of threats are happening in Jewish communities around Australia on a regular basis. School lessons are regularly being disrupted by bomb threats. Schools have had to hire security guards. Jewish men and women are advised not to congregate in public places because of their high state of alert. Children are too frightened to wear religious symbols. School girls are harassed by cowards who recognise their school uniform.
I was utterly ashamed, not only by the obvious level of distress being experienced by these mothers for their children and their communities but also by the actions of small-minded people against children in our community. These are not things that we would expect Australians to have to worry about on a daily basis. This situation is a clear example of one way in which Australia is not free of racism or racist attacks. In Australia, anti-Semitism is often considered to be a thing of the past or a precinct of the most radical fringe groups. Some in the Jewish community have expressed concerns to me that political views are finding expression in anti-Semitism, an example of which is the recent political protest against Israel in which protesters were calling out, `Kill all the Jews.' This should not be acceptable in Australia, regardless of your views on the political situation in the Middle East. This political situation is so fraught, involving so much bloodshed on both sides, that you can understand why people hold strong views on the matter, and express them in an emotional way.
But we must be clear on one thing: racial vilification cannot be justified. In Australia, we are proud to allow open and robust debate on all matters, including the situation in the Middle East. We are proud for our country to be home to people from all over the world and we strive towards enabling people from very different backgrounds to live together peacefully, with respect for one another and their views. We cannot allow people living in our country to be punished or vilified for the political actions of their countrymen overseas. Just as we cannot blame Americans in our midst for the actions of George W. Bush and just as we cannot blame Muslim Australians for the actions of Islamic extremists, we cannot vilify Jewish Australians according to what has been happening in Israel. We cannot use a passionate political view as an excuse for racism. 
One inspiring alliance, which has formed out of all this tension, occurred last year. It was the formation of the Australian National Dialogue of Christians, Muslims and Jews. Multiculturalism could be considered as the ethical underpinning of our country—it concerns valuing diversity, respecting difference in others, judging people on their own merits and approaching other people with a spirit of openness and consideration. As we move ever closer to war, it is more important than ever that we take good care of our fellow Australians and promote harmony in our communities.
